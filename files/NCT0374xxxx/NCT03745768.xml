  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Executive function deficits are common in late life depression (LLD) and are associated with&#xD;
      resistance to antidepressants, poor quality of life, considerable disability and increased&#xD;
      suicidal risk. A safe and well-tolerated treatment is needed to improve executive function,&#xD;
      depression burden and overall quality of life. This study uses a novel type of Transcranial&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation called intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS). iTBS delivers high&#xD;
      frequency (50Hz) magnetic pulses in &quot;bursts&quot; of 3 stimuli. It is posited that this&#xD;
      intervention induces plasticity in the human cortex. Theoretical and empirical evidence from&#xD;
      research studies informs that iTBS can improve depression and executive deficits, however,&#xD;
      this has not been examined in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project examines iTBS's ability to improve depression and executive impairment in LLD.&#xD;
      It also tests the effects of iTBS on brain connectivity within the Cognitive Control Network&#xD;
      (CCN). This study will enhance understanding of LLD, providing critical pilot data to develop&#xD;
      future randomized controlled clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both active and sham interventions are administered sequentially to the left and right&#xD;
      dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex. The total stimulation time is about 7 minutes. These&#xD;
      interventions are administered for 6 weeks (Monday-Friday). 20 subjects will be randomized.&#xD;
      Changes in mood from baseline to the end of study are measured with the Montgomery-Asberg&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale. Executive function at baseline and end of study are evaluated with&#xD;
      the National Institutes of Health Toolbox executive domain battery. Safety assessments&#xD;
      include: the 21 item Scale for suicidal ideation SSI. The frequency, intensity and burden of&#xD;
      side effects rating (FIBSER) and the Altman Self Rating Mania scale (ASRM). Ancillary&#xD;
      depression measures include the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) and the&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression of Improvement scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects undergo functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) before and after the study&#xD;
      interventions to test the effects of iTBS on the brain's functional connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will provide meaningful information about the effects of iTBS on mood and&#xD;
      executive function in older adults as well as information regarding its effects on brain&#xD;
      function. Results of this pilot study will inform a grant submission and allow investigators&#xD;
      to calculate power for a definitive randomized controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy&#xD;
      of iTBS versus placebo.&#xD;

    <description>We will assess the efficacy of iTBS in improving mood by determining if older adults randomized to iTBS will show significant decreases in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale consistent with improvement of depressive symptoms. The scale ranges from 0 to 60, with 60 being the worse outcome (the more depressed the participant).</description>

    <description>We will assess the efficacy of iTBS in improving executive dysfunction in older adults with depression by determining if older adults randomized to iTBS show significant increases in their NIH Toolbox executive domain measures consistent with executive function improvement compared to those randomized to the placebo stimulation (sham). For the NIH toolbox, performance measure scale scores are devised such that the mean is 100 and the standard deviation (SD) is 15. For the age-adjusted scale score, a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average for the test-taking participant's age.</description>

Depressed older adults randomized to iTBS versus sham will have a significant increase in functional connectivity within the CNN. Brain activity is measured through low frequency BOLD signal in the brain.</description>
