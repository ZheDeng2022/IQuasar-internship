    <textblock>
      This study is a first in human Phase 1 study that involves patients with a type of cancer&#xD;
      called HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) positive cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study asks patients to volunteer to take part in a research study investigating the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of using special immune cells called HER2 chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (HER2 specific CAR T cells), in combination with intra-tumor&#xD;
      injection of CAdVEC, an oncolytic adenovirus that is designed to help the immune system&#xD;
      including HER2 specific CAR T cell react to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is looking at combining these two treatments together, because we think that the&#xD;
      combination of treatments will work better than each treatment alone. We also hope to learn&#xD;
      the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is&#xD;
      most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response&#xD;
      will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on&#xD;
      the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will&#xD;
      also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are&#xD;
      special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. Both&#xD;
      CAdVEC and HER2-specific autologous CAR T are investigational products. They are not approved&#xD;
      by the FDA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with CAdVEC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day of your treatment, participants will receive an injection of CAdVEC into&#xD;
      your tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be obtained from the participant before the CAdVEC intratumor injection .&#xD;
      Depending on the location of the tumor, different techniques can be used for the injection&#xD;
      into your tumor. The most common route of injection is ultrasound-guided percutaneous (needle&#xD;
      puncture in the skin) injection, but endoscopic (using a lighted, flexible instrument called&#xD;
      an endoscope) ultrasound-guidance will be used for some patients as appropriate. Prior to&#xD;
      percutaneous injection, participants may receive an anti-anxiety medicine to calm them down,&#xD;
      to relieve muscle spasms, and provide sedation. If the participants tumor is injected during&#xD;
      an endoscopic procedure, the procedure may be done under sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with HER2- specific autologous T Cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier the participant gave blood for us to make HER2 targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      (HER2- specific autologous T Cells). These cells are grown in the lab and frozen for&#xD;
      participants. Invesitgators made the cells by combining dendritic cells (DCs) or monocytes&#xD;
      with the T cells in the presence of produced mixtures of adenoviral proteins. Investigators&#xD;
      then put a new gene in to those T cells to make them specifically attract to and kill HER2&#xD;
      positive tumors. As the T cells grow, they are cultured by adding adenoviral proteins for&#xD;
      stimulation and expansion. Investigators call those T cells: HER2- targeting T cells (HER2-&#xD;
      specific autologous T Cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study looks at different doses of HER2- specific autologous T Cells. The decision about&#xD;
      the dose participants receive is determined when enrolled on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven dose levels will be evaluated. Cohorts of size 3 will be enrolled at each dose level&#xD;
      until 9 evaluable patients have been studied at a single dose. Each patient will receive an&#xD;
      intratumoral injection of CAdVEC alone or combined with an injection of HER2.CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAdVEC intratumoral injection will be given as a single injection to a single appropriate&#xD;
      tumor site by direct, endoscopic, or image-guided injection on Day 1. The injection site will&#xD;
      be chosen based on a combination of criteria, including accessibility and safety of injection&#xD;
      site; tumor size; and anticipated tumor viability (e.g. avoid necrotic or cystic injection&#xD;
      sites). HER2.CAR T cells will be given intravenously on day 4 after CAdVEC injection, with a&#xD;
      3 day window (until day 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before receiving the T cell infusion, participants may be given Benadryl (diphenhydramine)&#xD;
      and Tylenol (acetaminophen). Tylenol and Benadryl are given to prevent a possible allergic&#xD;
      reaction to the T cell administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard medical tests before treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, participants will receive a series of standard medical tests and&#xD;
      procedures as well as research blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Medical tests during and after treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, participants will receive standard medical tests and procedures as well as&#xD;
      research blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study specific evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will follow participants closely after treatment for any side effects for at&#xD;
      least 2 years after the last infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the body, an extra blood sample will&#xD;
      be taken before the CAdVEC injection, before the CAR T cell infusion, and at week 1, 2, 4 ,&#xD;
      6, months 3, 6, 9 and 12 after CAR T cell infusion. Thereafter every 6 months up to 5 years&#xD;
      and then yearly for 15 years. Investigators will use this blood to see how long the T cells&#xD;
      last and to look at the immune response to the cancer. Investigators may also ask to get a&#xD;
      tumor tissue biopsy at week 12 if necessary. Buccal swabs (cheek scraping) and urine will be&#xD;
      collected before CAdVEC injection, Days 2, 4 (or the day of CAR T-cell infusion), weeks 1 and&#xD;
      2 after CAR T cell infusion.&#xD;

    <description>The intratumoral administration of CAdVEC will create a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment and will promote the recruitment and expansion of adoptively transferred HER2 specific CAR T cells via CAR (tumor antigen). We expect HER2 CAR T cells expanded at primary tumor sites will re-circulate and target metastasized tumors. The combination we propose to test has the potential to overcome each of the established individual limitations of oncolytic viruses and of CAR T-cells. Testing each element separately would not be beneficial or informative, since the combination therapy is anticipated to have unique profiles of both therapeutic benefit and potential toxicities.</description>
