      The purpose of the proposed study is to test these hypotheses through the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if early plasmin activation following severe injury correlates with SIRS,&#xD;
           TIC and complications throughout convalescence in both trauma and surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if early plasmin activation following severe injury correlates with&#xD;
           plasminogen consumption and poor plasmin activity later in convalescence.&#xD;

      Significance: Severe injury is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, affecting&#xD;
      approximately 2.8 million individuals and accounting for over 200,000 deaths annually across&#xD;
      the United States1,2,3. Large cohort studies have demonstrated that approximately 64% of&#xD;
      trauma-related deaths are due to complications including thrombosis, bleeding, infection, and&#xD;
      organ dysfunction, and each complication corresponds with an 8% increase in risk of&#xD;
      mortality4. While advances in critical care medicine have significantly improved the initial&#xD;
      survival from traumatic injuries, the proportion of morbidity and mortality from&#xD;
      complications experienced during traumatic convalescence has correspondingly skyrocketed.&#xD;
      Early in convalescence, these patients are at risk of developing life-threatening&#xD;
      complications instigated by trauma induced coagulopathy (TIC) and systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response syndrome (SIRS). Specifically, approximately 40% of patients with severe injuries&#xD;
      develop TIC and approximately 70% develop SIRS5,6. While these conditions individually&#xD;
      increase the risk of secondary sequelae, in concurrence, they dramatically increase the risk&#xD;
      of bleeding, thrombosis, infection, and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)7,8,9. Later&#xD;
      in convalescence, patients experiencing severe injury are at risk of suffering complications&#xD;
      from pathologic tissue homeostasis and repair. For example, depending on the injury, 25-65%&#xD;
      of severely injured patients' rehabilitation and quality of life are limited by poor bone&#xD;
      health, including the development of osteoporosis, impaired bone healing, and/or the&#xD;
      development of heterotopic ossification10,11,12. Together, early and late complications of&#xD;
      convalescence reportedly account for over $671 billion in healthcare expenditure and&#xD;
      disability losses yearly1. Thus, there is an unmet need for improved therapeutic and&#xD;
      diagnostic measures for these patients to prevent or treat complications of early and late&#xD;
      convalescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Acute Phase Response (APR): Following injury, the APR resolves the four principle&#xD;
      problems provoked by disruption of tissue: bleeding, pathogen invasion, tissue hypoxia, and&#xD;
      tissue dysfunction. After an isolated injury, e.g., femur fracture, the APR follows a&#xD;
      predictable and quantifiable time-course with minimal risk of complications (Figure 1A). The&#xD;
      survival phase contains the injury and prevents infection through hemostasis (fibrin&#xD;
      deposition) and acute inflammation. The later repair phase effectively removes damaged&#xD;
      tissue, regenerates new tissue, and restores function. Severe trauma derails the&#xD;
      survival-APR, provoking complications in both in early and late convalescence (Figure 1B). In&#xD;
      order to prevent exsanguination, severe trauma must provoke an adequate survival-APR in&#xD;
      proportion to the severity of the injury. However, unrestrained and prolonged activation of&#xD;
      coagulation and survival-inflammation lead to the development of TIC and SIRS and&#xD;
      significantly increasing the risk of bleeding, thrombosis, and MODS6,5,8. Additionally, if a&#xD;
      patient persists within the survival-APR for an extended period of time, the prolonged&#xD;
      activation of cellular inflammation promotes disorders of tissue homeostasis, e.g.,&#xD;
      osteoporosis, and delays the transition to the repair-APR, stalling or preventing healing&#xD;
      tissue and crippling recovery in these patients13,14. Therefore, APR complications are&#xD;
      mechanistically linked, that is, dysfunction of the survival-APR contributes to dysfunction&#xD;
      of the repair-APR. Although there are many reports suggesting potential molecular&#xD;
      determinants of a dysfunctional APR, the primary molecular targets driving this phenomenon&#xD;
      are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe Trauma-Provoked Changes in Plasmin Activity: Plasmin is converted from its zymogen,&#xD;
      plasminogen, by its activators: tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen&#xD;
      activator (uPA). While plasmin is a multifunctional protease, its canonical role is the&#xD;
      degradation of fibrin (fibrinolysis). While fibrinolysis occurs during the repair-APR&#xD;
      following an isolated injury, a severe injury provokes early hyperactivation of plasmin&#xD;
      (Figure 2)15,16. Fibrinolysis was first observed by anatomist Giovanni Morgagni and surgeon&#xD;
      John Hunter in the late 1700s during autopsies of individuals that suffered traumatic&#xD;
      injuries17,18. Both Morgagni and Hunter noted that blood from these individuals strangely did&#xD;
      not clot. It was later determined that blood clots formed following traumatic injury or&#xD;
      invasive surgery spontaneously dissolved, leading to the discovery of plasmin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate and most-recognized clinical consequence of this inappropriate&#xD;
      hyperfibrinolysis is bleeding, as the degradation of fibrin opposes effective hemostasis19.&#xD;
      The clinical significance of injury- induced hyperfibrinolysis was propelled by improvements&#xD;
      in critical care medicine that permitted not only survival of previously fatal traumatic&#xD;
      injuries, but also invasive, elective surgical procedures through the use of antifibrinolytic&#xD;
      therapeutics. Specifically, recent clinical studies in &gt;40,000 trauma patients have&#xD;
      demonstrated that prevention of plasmin activation by antifibrinolytics (e.g., aminocaproic&#xD;
      acid (Amicar), tranexamic acid (TXA)) significantly reduced blood loss and increased survival&#xD;
      when administered early after injury20,21. Thus, it has been established that inappropriate,&#xD;
      early plasmin activation (hyperfibrinolysis) is a significant cause of bleeding and mortality&#xD;
      following severe injury19,16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathologic Fibrinolysis - Hemorrhage is the Tip of the Iceberg: Both hyperfibrinolysis and&#xD;
      hypofibrinolysis occur following trauma and have been associated with complications&#xD;
      throughout convalescence22,23, indicating that plasmin's biologic role following injury is&#xD;
      more complex than previously understood. Indeed, since the initial investigations of&#xD;
      plasmin's role in bleeding, our knowledge of the biological role of plasmin has greatly&#xD;
      expanded beyond its role in hemostasis. Currently, it is recognized that plasmin is activated&#xD;
      during virtually all tissue repair, where it degrades intra- and extravascular fibrin24,25.&#xD;
      In addition to fibrinolysis, plasmin also acts through non-canonical pathways to promote&#xD;
      tissue repair including programming and migration of macrophages and progenitor cells, growth&#xD;
      factor activation, and promotion of angiogenesis26,27,28,29. Additionally, plasmin stimulates&#xD;
      an acute inflammatory response, promoting tissue regeneration30,31,32. Thus, plasmin is&#xD;
      essential for tissue maintenance and repair. Specifically, our lab has extended this premise&#xD;
      by determining that plasmin is essential for proper bone homeostasis, as well as bone and&#xD;
      muscle repair33,34,35. Thus, following trauma, the biological role of plasmin is not limited&#xD;
      to intravascular activity and bleeding. Instead, it plays well defined, albeit less&#xD;
      understood, roles in pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, tissue homeostasis, and repair of&#xD;
      virtually all tissues. While these studies would suggest that plasmin plays beneficial role&#xD;
      in recovery following trauma, judicious prevention of early plasmin activation is clearly&#xD;
      beneficial in preventing life threatening hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed study is to test these hypotheses through the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if early plasmin activation following severe injury correlates with SIRS,&#xD;
           TIC and complications throughout convalescence in both trauma and surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if early plasmin activation following severe injury correlates with&#xD;
           plasminogen consumption and poor plasmin activity later in convalescence.&#xD;
