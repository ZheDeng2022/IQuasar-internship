  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      aim of this study is to assess and compare between the efficacy of the new U/S guided erector&#xD;
      spinae plane block (ESP) and the conventional methods of systemic analgesics in adult&#xD;
      patients scheduled for elective thoracotomy surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracotomy is considered the most painful of surgical procedures and providing effective&#xD;
      analgesia is the onus for all anesthetists. Ineffective pain relief impedes deep breathing,&#xD;
      coughing, and remobilization culminating in atelectasis and pneumonia.The erector spinae&#xD;
      plane (ESP) block is a newly-described technique for treating thoracic pain, and has several&#xD;
      advantages that make it an attractive alternative to these more invasive&#xD;
      procedures.Ultrasound guided erector spinae (ESP) block is a regional anesthesia technique,&#xD;
      recently described by (Forero; et al.) for use in thoracic neuropathic pain. ESP block is&#xD;
      reported to lead to analgesic effect on somatic and visceral pain by effecting the ventral&#xD;
      rami and rami communicantes that include sympathetic nerve fibers, as LA spreads through the&#xD;
      paravertebral space . When performed bilaterally it has been reported to be as effective as&#xD;
      thoracic epidural analgesia.ESP block leads to effective postoperative analgesia when&#xD;
      performed at T 4-5 level for breast and thoracic surgery. The ESP block , will be performed&#xD;
      as follow:The patient will be placed in a sitting position and the ultrasound probe will be&#xD;
      placed in a longitudinal orientation 3 cm lateral to the T5 spinous process. Three muscles&#xD;
      were identified superficial to the hyperechoic transverse process shadow as follows:&#xD;
      trapezius, rhomboid major, and erector spinae . the needle will be inserted in a&#xD;
      cephalad-to-caudad direction until the tip lay deep to erector spinae muscles, as evidenced&#xD;
      by visible linear spread of fluid beneath muscle upon injection . A total of 20 mL of 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine will be injected here.&#xD;

    <description>VAS score will be obtained in the postoperative period at preset time intervals.Using a ruler, the score is determined by mea-suring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.No pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm).</description>

    <description>The Erector Spinae Plane block will be done as follow,the patient will be placed in a sitting position and the ultrasound probe will be placed in a longitudinal orientation 3 cm lateral to the T5 spinous process. Three muscles were identified superficial to the hyperechoic transverse process shadow as follows: trapezius, rhomboid major, and erector spinae . the needle will be inserted in a cephalad-to-caudad direction until the tip lay deep to erector spinae muscles, as evidenced by visible linear spread of fluid beneath muscle upon injection . A total of 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected here.&#xD;

    <description>Nothing will be injected&#xD;
All patients will receive pre-oxygenation with O2 100% for 3 min. Anesthesia will be induced by using fentanyl 1μg/kg, propofol 1.5-2 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg will be used for muscle relaxation. Anesthesia will be maintained by controlled ventilation with oxygen and air (50:50) with target of EtCo2≈ 35-40 mmHg, isoflurane 1:1.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), 0.5μg/kg fentanyl will be given intraoperative when either heart rate or Non Invasive Blood Pressure report an increase by more than 20% of the basal records. Anesthesia will be discontinued and tracheal extubation will be done once patient fulfilled the extubation criteria.</description>
