  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will include patients with non-haematologic cancer. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      be invited to consent for participation in our study using standard demographic data&#xD;
      collection forms and patient satisfaction questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients interested in learning more about clinical trials would be invited to go to&#xD;
      the kiosk. A summer student approved and hired according to LHSC/Lawson criteria will be&#xD;
      available from 0900-1630 daily for general assistance. If the student is overwhelmed by&#xD;
      questions or numbers of patients, the Research Navigator or designate would be called to&#xD;
      assist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An information kiosk will be placed at the patient library on the ground floor of the LRCP.&#xD;
      This kiosk will be outfitted with a computer and signage briefly outlining the title and&#xD;
      purpose of the kiosk. Cancer patients interested in learning more about clinical trials would&#xD;
      be invited to participate in our study by signing a consent form allowing the Research&#xD;
      Navigator to contact them if they expressed interest in knowing more about a clinical trial.&#xD;

      The proposed study will include patients with non-haematologic cancer. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      be invited to consent for participation in our study using standard demographic data&#xD;
      collection forms and patient satisfaction questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer disease site teams (DSTs) were asked to prioritize trials that open from May 1 to&#xD;
      Sept.30, 2018 and likely to accrue three patients over six months for major accruing tumour&#xD;
      sites (lung, breast, GI, GU, melanoma and symptom control/supportive care/multi-site such as&#xD;
      oligometastatic) and one patient over six months for other sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are made aware of the kiosk via advertising in the facility including a card given&#xD;
      at registration each day outlining the existence, location and purpose of the kiosk. The&#xD;
      location will be marked by visual cues (banner and balloons). Cancer patients interested in&#xD;
      learning more about clinical trials would be invited to go to the kiosk. A summer student&#xD;
      approved and hired according to LHSC/Lawson criteria will be available from 0900-1630 daily&#xD;
      from July 3-Aug 31 for general assistance. If the student is overwhelmed by questions or&#xD;
      numbers of patients, the Research Navigator or designate would be called to assist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An information kiosk will be placed at the patient library on the ground floor of the LRCP.&#xD;
      This kiosk will be outfitted with a computer and signage briefly outlining the title and&#xD;
      purpose of the kiosk. Cancer patients interested in learning more about clinical trials would&#xD;
      be invited to participate in our study by signing a consent form allowing the Research&#xD;
      Navigator to contact them if they expressed interest in knowing more about a clinical trial.&#xD;
      They would still be able to read a lay online or printed paper document giving them&#xD;
      background information on clinical trials (i.e. what is a clinical trial?) whether they&#xD;
      consented or not. To save on resources, the pilot will utilize general information available&#xD;
      to the public from the Stanford Cancer Institute Clinical Trials website at&#xD;
      http://med.stanford.edu/cancer/trials.html and a Canadian website&#xD;
      http://itstartswithme.ca/why-participate/ . Information specific to clinical trials at London&#xD;
      Regional Cancer Program (LRCP) will be made available by linking to an internal resource.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked if they would be interested in seeing brief summaries of selected&#xD;
      clinical trials currently available at the LRCP. They would then be asked to review a list of&#xD;
      possible trials they may be eligible for based on their cancer diagnosis. Patients will have&#xD;
      the option to click on each of the applicable trials to obtain more information including:&#xD;
      trial title, NCT number, a lay description, why the study is important, principal&#xD;
      investigator name, and a short list of eligibility criteria. Additionally, patients have the&#xD;
      option to send any trial information they might be interested in to their home their email&#xD;
      address or obtain a paper copy of the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, at the kiosk patients who signed a consent, would have the option to submit&#xD;
      electronically their first/last name and DOB in order to grant permission for a member of the&#xD;
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) staff, the Research Navigator, to review their request for&#xD;
      further clinical trial information, contact them with potential options and contact their&#xD;
      oncologist(s) to discuss their potential enrollment in a specific trial. This consent,&#xD;
      patient name and PIN numbers would then be emailed to the CRU. Alternatively, they could fill&#xD;
      this out on a paper form that would be dropped into a secure mailbox at the kiosk that would&#xD;
      be collected at the end of each day. The information would be logged on a secure electronic&#xD;
      database by HM and the paper documents except for consent destroyed (or kept in a secure&#xD;
      area). The Research Navigator would contact the patient by phone to provide further details&#xD;
      of the trial(s) of interest and to determine eligibility. If the patient is interested and&#xD;
      eligible, an indication of the clinical trial of interest would be added to the scheduling&#xD;
      list beside the patient's name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a two week run in phase, accrual, logistical and communications issues will be reviewed&#xD;
      to ensure the kiosk project is functioning efficiently and to review patient satisfaction.&#xD;
