  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the effects of opioid taper plans as documented in&#xD;
      the electronic medical record for Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) patients. The study&#xD;
      will compare different types of opioid tapering plans and will report on their effectiveness&#xD;
      in producing sustained taper or discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy for chronic&#xD;
      non-cancer pain while maintaining adequate pain control. The study population is KPWA&#xD;
      patients receiving long-term opioid therapy from 2010 to 2017.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid taper is now encouraged by many health care organizations, but it is unclear if&#xD;
      explicit plans for opioid taper by primary care providers are effective at promoting tapering&#xD;
      or discontinuation, and if they are effective, which components account for their&#xD;
      effectiveness. Patients receiving long-term opioid therapy (LtOT), who are candidates for&#xD;
      tapering, often perceive a low risk of overdose and a high risk of increased pain with opioid&#xD;
      tapering. They fear opioid withdrawal and lack of effectiveness of non-opioid therapies. For&#xD;
      patients with opioid tapering experience, support from family and a trusted health care&#xD;
      provider eased opioid tapering. Many patients report improved quality of life following&#xD;
      taper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little data exists on the optimal opioid taper strategy, including: use of long or&#xD;
      short-acting opioids, frequency of clinic visits, use of adjunctive medications and the role&#xD;
      of psychological support. Recent initiatives to reduce high-dose opioid use at Kaiser&#xD;
      Permanente Washington offer an opportunity to study the effect of opioid taper plans and&#xD;
      their components in an integrated care system with an electronic health record including all&#xD;
      health encounters and pharmacy dispensing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will report the proportion of LtOT patients who successfully taper compared to a&#xD;
      similar group of LtOT patients who don't achieve tapering or discontinuation of tapering. We&#xD;
      will also evaluate whether taper plans, defined by the patient's primary care provider,&#xD;
      increase the likelihood of successfully tapering comparing the two groups cited above.&#xD;

    <description>First, the study will describe the proportion and characteristics of patients on long-term, high-dose opioid therapy (LtOT) for chronic non-cancer pain who: a) initiate a taper attempt, b) successfully taper, or c) discontinue opioids. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who successfully taper will be compared to characteristics of patients who do not. We consider a successful taper to have occurred when a patient's average quarterly morphine milligram equivalents (MME) dose (calculated as the rolling average of the current and previous quarter's mean quarterly MME) falls below a specified threshold for two consecutive quarters after study entry. Each quarter of a sustained taper must meet one of the following two criteria and can be a combination of the two:&#xD;
Low dose of â‰¤30 MME (considered a &quot;safe&quot; dose)&#xD;
At least a 50% reduction in MME from the near peak dose</description>

        To be eligible for this study a patient must be receiving long-term opioid therapy (LtOT)&#xD;
        as follows: 1) must be Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) patient, 2) must receive opioid&#xD;
        therapy consisting of at least a 60-day supply and a mean daily dose of at least 50&#xD;
        milligrams morphine equivalent (MME) per calendar quarter for two consecutive calendar&#xD;
        quarters between Jan 2011 and Dec 2015, 3) must not die, have a gap in health plan&#xD;
        enrollment or pharmacy benefits during the two calendar quarters in which they qualified&#xD;
        for study entry, 4) must have no cancer diagnoses during the study period (2010-2017), and&#xD;
        5) must have at least two quarters of follow-up after study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A sub-analysis will focus on LtOT patients with a mean daily dose of at least 90 MME&#xD;
        instead of 50 MME.&#xD;
