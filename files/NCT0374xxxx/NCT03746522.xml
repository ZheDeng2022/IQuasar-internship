  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pivotal, phase 3 study is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of setmelanotide,&#xD;
      a potent melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R) agonist, for the treatment of obesity and&#xD;
      hyperphagia in patients with Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) or Alström syndrome (AS). The&#xD;
      study's primary efficacy endpoint will evaluate the proportion of patients (≥12 years of age&#xD;
      at baseline) who lose ≥10% of their baseline body weight following approximately (~) 52 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment with setmelanotide compared to a historical control rate. The study will consist&#xD;
      of 3 treatment periods. Eligible patients will enter a 14 week, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled treatment period (Period 1) that will be followed by a 38 week open label&#xD;
      treatment period (Period 2) in which all patients will receive setmelanotide. The primary&#xD;
      analysis will be performed after Period 2. Following Period 2, patients will continue&#xD;
      open-label treatment for 14 weeks (Period 3) after which they may be enrolled into a separate&#xD;
      treatment extension study.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. BBS clinical diagnosis as per Beales, 1999 (with either 4 primary features or 3&#xD;
             primary and 2 secondary features) Or AS diagnosis as per Marshall, 2007 (using major&#xD;
             and minor age adjusted criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Greater than or equal to ≥6 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Obese, defined as BMI ≥30 kg/m2 for patients ≥16 years of age or weight &gt;97th&#xD;
             percentile for age and sex on growth chart assessment for patients 6 to 15 years of&#xD;
             age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Study participant and/or parent or guardian is able to communicate well with the&#xD;
             Investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, and is able&#xD;
             to understand and sign the written informed consent/assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female participants of child-bearing potential must be confirmed non-pregnant and&#xD;
             agree to use contraception as outlined in the protocol. Female participants of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential, defined as: surgically sterile (status post hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation), post-menopausal for at least 12&#xD;
             months (and confirmed with a screening follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the&#xD;
             post-menopausal lab range), or failure to have progressed to Tanner Stage V and/or&#xD;
             failure to have achieved menarche, do not require contraception during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a&#xD;
             double barrier method contraception if they become sexually active during the study or&#xD;
             within 90 days following their participation in the study. Male patients must also not&#xD;
             donate sperm during and for 90 days following their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Recent intensive (within 2 months) diet and/or exercise regimen with or without the&#xD;
             use of weight loss agents (including herbal medications) that has resulted in &gt;2%&#xD;
             weight loss. These patients may be reconsidered approximately 1 month after cessation&#xD;
             of such intensive regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current or prior (within prior 2 months) use of any medication, including those&#xD;
             approved to treat obesity, that could impact the efficacy results of this study (eg,&#xD;
             orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion, liraglutide).&#xD;
             Patients on a stable dose and regimen (for at least 2 months) of medication to treat&#xD;
             attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be enrolled in the study as long&#xD;
             as they agree to remain on the same dose and regimen during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior gastric bypass surgery resulting in &gt;10% weight loss durably maintained from the&#xD;
             baseline pre-operative weight with no evidence of weight regain. Specifically,&#xD;
             patients may be considered if surgery was not successful, resulted in &lt;10% weight loss&#xD;
             compared to pre-operative baseline weight, or there is clear evidence of weight regain&#xD;
             after an initial response to bariatric surgery. All patients with a history of&#xD;
             bariatric surgery must be discussed with, and receive approval from, the Sponsor prior&#xD;
             to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorder or other Diagnostic&#xD;
             and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-V) disorders that the&#xD;
             Investigator believes will interfere significantly with study compliance.&#xD;
             Neurocognitive disorders affecting ability to consent will not be disqualifying as&#xD;
             long as an appropriate guardian able to give consent has been appointed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In patients with no significant neurocognitive deficits:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A PHQ-9 score of ≥15 and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS, any lifetime history of a&#xD;
                  suicide attempt, or any suicidal behavior in the last month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Current, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiac, or oncologic disease considered&#xD;
             severe enough to interfere with the study and/or confound the results. Any patient&#xD;
             with a potentially clinically significant disease should be reviewed with the Sponsor&#xD;
             to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of significant liver disease or liver injury, or a current liver assessment&#xD;
             due to abnormal liver tests (as indicated by abnormal liver function tests, alanine&#xD;
             transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, or serum&#xD;
             bilirubin &gt;1.5x the upper limit of normal [ULN] for any of these tests) for an&#xD;
             etiology other than non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, any underlying&#xD;
             etiology besides NAFLD, including diagnosed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),&#xD;
             other causes of hepatitis, or history of hepatic cirrhosis is exclusionary, but the&#xD;
             presence of NAFLD is not be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Moderate to severe renal dysfunction defined as &lt;30 mL/min (Appendix 11.6).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History or close family history (parents or siblings) of skin cancer or melanoma&#xD;
             (excluding non-invasive basal or squamous cell lesion), or patient history of&#xD;
             ocular-cutaneous albinism.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Significant dermatologic findings relating to melanoma or pre-melanoma skin lesions&#xD;
             (excluding non-invasive basal or squamous cell lesion), determined as part of&#xD;
             comprehensive skin evaluation performed by a qualified dermatologist during screening.&#xD;
             Any concerning lesions identified during the screening period will be biopsied and&#xD;
             results must be known to be benign prior to enrollment. If the pre-treatment biopsy&#xD;
             results are of concern, the patient should be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient is, in the opinion of the Study Investigator, not suitable to participate in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participation in any clinical study with an investigational drug/device within 3&#xD;
             months prior to the first day of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Significant hypersensitivity to study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Inability to comply with QD injection regimen.&#xD;
