    <textblock>
      The options for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are not&#xD;
      candidates for a standard definitive chemoradiotherapy regime are meagre. These are patients&#xD;
      who are not fit for a chemoradiotherapy schedule of 66 Gy in 2 Gy fractions due to either&#xD;
      tumour extent, resulting in excessive dose to the healthy tissue in the thorax, or with&#xD;
      performance status not supporting seven weeks of intensive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to study the efficiency as well as the safety of a new treatment option of&#xD;
      heterogeneously hypofractionated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC who&#xD;
      are not candidates for standard, high-dose chemoradiotherapy, either due to excessive&#xD;
      irradiation of normal tissue (defined as category A patients) or due to fragility of the&#xD;
      patient (category B patients).&#xD;

      1.1 Radiotherapy in lung cancer The options for patients with locally advanced non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC) who are not candidates for a standard definitive chemoradiotherapy regime&#xD;
      are meagre. These patients are not fit for a standard chemoradiotherapy due to either tumour&#xD;
      extent, resulting in excessive dose to the healthy tissue in the thorax, or with performance&#xD;
      status not supporting seven weeks of intensive treatment. Such patients could benefit from a&#xD;
      treatment offering long-term locoregional control leading to improved survival. However, at&#xD;
      present, they are offered palliative treatment regimens. Alternatively, a full schedule of&#xD;
      definitive chemoradiotherapy is sometimes attempted, and patient may only complete part of&#xD;
      the treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Favourable alternative treatment options for this group of patients would have to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a reasonable probability of locoregional disease control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Result in less expected toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be delivered using a shorter treatment schedule than the current 6-7 weeks Standard&#xD;
           chemoradiotherapy aims at delivering a homogeneous dose distribution to the primary&#xD;
           tumour and involved lymph nodes. However, studies of patterns of failures in locally&#xD;
           advanced NSCLC patients indicate that isolated mediastinal nodal failures are less&#xD;
           common than disease recurrence in the primary tumour site or in bulky lymph nodes. This&#xD;
           suggests that it might be possible to lower the dose to all or selected parts of the&#xD;
           involved mediastinal lymph nodes without drastically impacting the combined locoregional&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modelling studies indicate that tumour control may mainly depend on mean tumour dose,&#xD;
      provided that the minimum dose to the tumour exceeds a certain level. One example is provided&#xD;
      by stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT), where very heterogeneous dose distributions usually&#xD;
      results in higher dose in the middle of the tumour compared to the dose to the tumour&#xD;
      periphery. The Danish NARLAL2 trial [NCT02354274] investigates heterogeneous dose escalation;&#xD;
      with the most PET-avid part of the tumour used as a driver for the dose escalation. Most&#xD;
      prospective trials have focused on hyperfractionated, accelerated treatments. Although&#xD;
      effective, these schedules are also associated with substantial acute toxicity, likely not&#xD;
      tolerable for borderline curative patients with extensive local disease. Definitive&#xD;
      moderately hypofractioned radiotherapy has limited clinical evidence in lung cancer patients,&#xD;
      but has demonstrated promising outcomes in a few trials. The current study aims to use a&#xD;
      heterogeneous hypofractionated schedule for the treatment of high-risk locally advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      patients, in order to improve loco-regional control and survival. The central idea is to&#xD;
      decrease dose to normal tissue by ascribing a heterogeneous dose to the PTV. The gross volume&#xD;
      of the primary tumour and bulky lymph nodes receive mean doses of up to 66 Gy in 24&#xD;
      fractions, and thus receive a hypofractionated higher biological effective dose than standard&#xD;
      66 Gy in 33 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Aim of this study To study the efficiency as well as the safety of a new treatment option&#xD;
      of heterogeneously hypofractionated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC who&#xD;
      are not candidates for standard, high-dose chemoradiotherapy, either due to excessive&#xD;
      irradiation of normal tissue (defined as category A patients) or due to fragility of the&#xD;
      patient (category B patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Purpose To demonstrate the feasibility of a heterogeneous and hypo-fractionated definitive&#xD;
      (chemo-) radiotherapy schedule for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients not&#xD;
      candidates for standard, long-course chemoradiotherapy. Outcomes will be reported using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics, from which the viability of the regimen as a standard treatment will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Study design This is a prospective multicentre feasibility study. It includes patients with&#xD;
      inoperable locally advanced NSCLC (stage IIB-IV) not candidates for standard treatment with&#xD;
      curative intent. Patients are treated with (chemo-) radiotherapy in 24 fractions, 5 fractions&#xD;
      a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Systemic therapy Patients are allowed to receive 1-2 cycles of induction therapy with&#xD;
      platinum doublet and/or concomitant chemotherapy. Patients with synthesizing mutations such&#xD;
      as EGFR or ALK are allowed to receive TKI either as induction or as concurrent according to&#xD;
      the local institution's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Study sample size and time frame Patients in Denmark with NSCLC treated with palliative&#xD;
      intent in 2014 had a one-year overall survival of 37.5%. The study is expected to enrol&#xD;
      patients over a 2-year period, calculated from the date where two centres have opened for&#xD;
      enrolment. At least 76 patients from category A and at least 75 patients from category B 3.3&#xD;
      Continuous monitoring of early mortality Any patient death within the first three months of&#xD;
      radiotherapy initiation will be evaluated by the local site investigator and reported to&#xD;
      primary investigator. Primary investigator will provide continuous monitoring of early&#xD;
      mortality in order to ensure that the rate is not unacceptable, and will provide reports to&#xD;
      all investigators at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Data management All dose plans used for patient treatment, including adapted plans, are&#xD;
      exported to the national dose plan bank (CIRRO), from where doses to tumour, lymph nodes and&#xD;
      organs at risk are extracted for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline PET-CT scans as well as any CT or PET-CT scans at time of disease recurrence should,&#xD;
      if available, preferably also be transferred to the dose plan bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Radiotherapy treatment planning 4.1 Scan procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CT scan taking into account respiratory motion (i.e. 4D-CT scan, deep inspiration breath&#xD;
      hold CT scan, or other respiratory controlled CT scans) is acquired:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With intravenous contrast if allowed by kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum 3 mm distance between CT slices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less than four weeks before start of radiotherapy A FDG-PET scan acquired within six&#xD;
           week of the planning-CT should be used to guide the target delineation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Target volumes The primary tumour is delineated separately as GTV-T. GTV-N includes all&#xD;
      pathological lymph nodes. In patients with bulky lymph nodes, the dose will be escalated to&#xD;
      the bulky part of the lymph nodes only, delineated in a separate structure, GTV-Nhigh. Bulky&#xD;
      lymph nodes are defined as lymph nodes or conglomerates of lymph nodes where the longest&#xD;
      diameter is 3 cm or more, i.e. corresponding to minimum volume of 14 cm3 for an approximately&#xD;
      spherical target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Dose planning Patients are treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (static beam&#xD;
      angles or arc technique). Modern dose calculation algorithms (Monte Carlo, AAA, Collapsed&#xD;
      Cone or similar) must be used to account for inhomogeneity corrections. Margins are applied&#xD;
      ensuring that CTV receives a minimum dose of 95% of 50 Gy. All treatments are delivered in 24&#xD;
      fractions, 5 fractions per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 Treatment verification and quality assurance 5.1 Verification of treatment position Daily&#xD;
      imaging must be performed and used for daily correction of treatment position. Tolerances and&#xD;
      margins depend on the setup strategy and must be defined locally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Adaptive strategy and tumour shrinkage For patients where either the position of the&#xD;
      tumour, the position of the lymph nodes, patient anatomy, or lung density changes are&#xD;
      observed to result in dosimetric or geometric changes above the clinic specific tolerances,&#xD;
      the radiotherapy treatment plan has to be adapted to the observed changes. Deliberate&#xD;
      reduction of treatment volumes due to tumour shrinkage, is not encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Quality assurance To achieve similar dose planning strategies, all initially&#xD;
      participating centres have performed dose planning for two representative patients. Centres&#xD;
      joining the protocol will plan the same patients before including patients for comparison.&#xD;
      Those plans are to be evaluated by the protocol committee during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 Participants Patients with inoperable NSCLC stage IIB, III or IV with oligo-metastatic&#xD;
      disease and PS 0-2, who are not candidates for standard curative intended radiotherapy. Two&#xD;
      general criteria can be used for entry into the protocol: A) The target volume for&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatment volume is considered too large for a standard treatment of 66Gy in 33&#xD;
      fractions, considering the expected normal tissue toxicity with a standard treatment plan; or&#xD;
      B) The patient is too fragile for standard long-course radiotherapy with 66 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically or cytological confirmed locally advanced, inoperable NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to comply with study and follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fertile women must have a negative pregnancy test. Fertile men and women must use&#xD;
           effective contraception. Fertile women included in the study must use the pill, spiral,&#xD;
           depot injection of gestagen, subdermal implantation, hormonal vaginal ring or&#xD;
           transdermal patch for the duration of study treatment and one month thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior radiotherapy to the thorax, unless there is no significant overlap of current&#xD;
           treatment volumes with previous treatment fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose plan conforming to protocol planning criteria not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other active malignant disease. 6.3 Enrolment Patients are enrolled prior to initiation&#xD;
           of radiotherapy when criteria in 6.1 and 6.2 are met. Patients enrolled are registered&#xD;
           in either cohort A or cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Evaluations during treatment Patients will be evaluated and treatment toxicity will be&#xD;
      registered once during the course of radiotherapy. Adverse Event Registration collected by&#xD;
      CTC version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.5 Follow-up Patients will be seen every 3rd month during a follow up period of 24 months&#xD;
      and thereafter every 6th month until end of study. During the first 24 months, the patient&#xD;
      will be examined every 3rd month with a CT-scan and afterwards twice a year. Lung function&#xD;
      test will be performed at 3 months and if needed clinically afterwards. An ECG will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline as well as at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.6 Recurrences Local failures are assessed with CT scan of thorax and upper abdomen. All&#xD;
      recurrences should be verified by biopsy if possible. Patients with recurrence are kept in&#xD;
      the protocol with regards to collection of follow-up data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 Complications (Evaluation of toxicity) All complication (side effects) will be evaluated&#xD;
      according to the NCI-CTCAE v 4.0 during all follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1 Side effects The study is based on an overall de-escalation of dose compared to the&#xD;
      standard treatment, so it is generally expected to observe fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Adverse Event (AE) Any unfavourable and unintended sign or symptom related to the organs&#xD;
      in the thorax: the lungs, the pleurae, the oesophagus, the bronchial tree (including the&#xD;
      trachea), the heart and the great vessels in the thorax will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A SAE is an event occurring during any part of the protocol&#xD;
      treatment after radiotherapy initiation that results in any of the following: death, a&#xD;
      life-threatening experience that requires hospitalization or requires intervention to prevent&#xD;
      permanent impairment/damage. All grade 3 or more radiation-induced lung toxicity, esophagitis&#xD;
      grade 4, grade 2 pericardial effusion, bronco-pulmonary fistula and oesophagus strictureas&#xD;
      recorded using CTC -AE V4 [18]. All SAEs will be evaluated by the local site investigator and&#xD;
      reported to the trial management committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 Statistical considerations and planned data analyses This study aims at providing an&#xD;
      alternative option to a purely palliative treatment for NSCLC patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      disease. Thus the study needs to demonstrate outcomes not considerably inferior to current&#xD;
      standard palliative treatment. Current one-year survival for palliative patients in the&#xD;
      Danish Oncological Lung Cancer database is 38% (baseline estimate). The investigators assume&#xD;
      that the case mix in the current study will consist of somewhat better prognosis patients&#xD;
      than the average palliative patient, corresponding to a one-year survival of 48% (i.e.&#xD;
      10%-points better than baseline) in category A patients. In order to establish, with 80%&#xD;
      power and one-sided confidence of 95%, that the proposed treatment results in a one-year&#xD;
      survival in which is no more than 5%-points inferior to the baseline (i.e. no worse than&#xD;
      33%), 69 patients are needed. In order to account for a loss to follow-up of 10%, the trial&#xD;
      plans to accrue 76 patients in category A. Patients included in category B are inherently&#xD;
      frail and elderly, with expected worse overall survival than category A patients. Assuming&#xD;
      33% baseline one-year survival and 43% one-year survival for study patients, and maintaining&#xD;
      the remainder of the requirements above, 75 category B patients is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be considered ineffective if it cannot be concluded that the one year&#xD;
      survival rate is no more than 5%-points lower than that of the average palliative patient.&#xD;
      Locoregional failure rate will be calculated as a cumulative incidence estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity, during and after radiotherapy, will be scored using CTC version 4.0 [CTC].&#xD;
      Incidence of acute and late toxicity grade ≥ 3 and grade 5 will be evaluated, with acute&#xD;
      toxicity summarized as worst grade during treatment and late toxicity as cumulative incidence&#xD;
      of toxicity events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 Ethical considerations Patients, who are not candidates for a definitive chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      schedule of 66 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, are most often offered purely palliative intent&#xD;
      treatment regimens, either with low dose radiotherapy or chemotherapy. In this study, these&#xD;
      patients are offered a radiotherapy schedule with high doses, with an expectation of better&#xD;
      survival due to improved local control. This study will be performed according to the&#xD;
      appropriate GCP-ICH regulations and in concordance with the Helsinki Declaration (Seoul&#xD;
      version, October 2008). Approval from the ethical committee is obtained. The Danish Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency is informed. All patients must have agreed to participate by signing the&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;

    <description>A heterogeneous hypofractionated schedule for the treatment of high-risk locally advanced NSCLC patients in which the central idea is to decrease dose to normal tissue by ascribing a heterogeneous dose to the PTV. The dose to the periphery of the PTV as well as to the majority of lymph node targets is decreased compared to a standard treatment. The gross volume of the primary tumour and bulky lymph nodes receive mean doses of up to 66 Gy in 24 fractions, and thus receive a hypofractionated higher biological effective dose than standard 66 Gy in 33 fractions.</description>
