  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer worldwide is the third most common in men and the second in female,&#xD;
      although mortality is not as high as its incidence, there is less survival in developing&#xD;
      countries. According to data from the World Health Organization, in 2012, there were an&#xD;
      estimated 1.4 million cases and 693,900 deaths from this disease. Patients with rectal cancer&#xD;
      are frequently taken to resection surgery as a curative management of their malignant&#xD;
      pathology, according to the type of resection or reconstruction. In a high number of cases,&#xD;
      they are management with colorectal anastomosis with a derivative ileostomy in the same&#xD;
      procedure. The closure of this ileostomy is usually done after two to three months of the&#xD;
      procedure, however in our environment it could take up to six or twelve months, during which&#xD;
      time the patient is exposed to social difficulties, management problems and complications,&#xD;
      derived from it. The early closure (7-12 days of its creation) of an ileostomy, despite the&#xD;
      little evidence, seems to be a safe, feasible procedure that would save the patient having to&#xD;
      live temporarily with an ileostomy.&#xD;

      General purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the frequency of perioperative complications and quality of life between early&#xD;
      closure of the derivative ileostomy versus conventional closure in postoperative patients&#xD;
      with low anterior resection for rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled clinical trial, randomized, to be carried out at the National Cancer Institute of&#xD;
      Colombia E.S.E. Eligible candidates for the study will be patients older than 18 years who&#xD;
      have undergone a previous resection of the rectum plus a derivative ileostomy for colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. All patients eligible for inclusion will undergo computed axial tomography with&#xD;
      rectal contrast medium on postoperative day 5. Those who meet the inclusion criteria and do&#xD;
      not present any of the exclusion criteria will enter the study, prior willingness to&#xD;
      participate by part of the patient and obtaining verbal and written informed consent. Through&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization, patients will undergo early closure (between 7 and 12 days&#xD;
      after the ileostomy) versus conventional closure (after 90 days or more time from the&#xD;
      creation of the ileostomy). A sample size of 81 patients was calculated for each arm. The&#xD;
      follow-up will be done in both groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the creation of the&#xD;
      ileostomy, including complications using the Clavien-Dindo classification and quality of life&#xD;
      using the FACIT-C format. The statistical analysis will be done by protocol and intention to&#xD;
      treat. The perioperative complications associated with the closure of the ileostomy, the&#xD;
      complications associated with the presence of ileostomy, hospital stay, and quality of life&#xD;
      will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to find that the early closure of ileostomy in patients during the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period of previous resection due to rectal cancer is safe in terms of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, feasible and with benefits in quality of life during the immediate&#xD;
      postoperative period compared with patients to whom they are closed late (after 3 months).&#xD;
