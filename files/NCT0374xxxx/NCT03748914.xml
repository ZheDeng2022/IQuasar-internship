      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transition to life after birth is a complex physiological process where the neonate has&#xD;
      to establish sufficient ventilation and changes from intra-uterine circulation to&#xD;
      extra-uterine circulation take place. During these processes the neonate has to provide the&#xD;
      brain with adequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to maintain normal cerebral tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation and activity. Instability of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation may be associated&#xD;
      with brain damage in preterm infants. The concept of C-UCM may substitute the adverse effects&#xD;
      of immediate cord clamping by supplying additional placental blood to the infant, which is&#xD;
      mostly performed during caesarean section or in the critically ill neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized controlled Pilot study the effects of cut-umbilical cord milking on&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation and perfusion measured via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and the&#xD;
      effects on stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) also measured non-invasively in term&#xD;
      and preterm infants are evaluated for the first 15 minutes after birth and compared to a&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to analyse whether C-UCM in preterm and term infants results in an&#xD;
      improvement of cerebral oxygenation and perfusion during immediate neonatal transition&#xD;
      measured with NIRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants undergoing C-UCM after birth compared to infants without C-UCM show differences in&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation and perfusion in the first 15 min after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis I: C-UCM and cerebral blood volume (CBV) In infants with C-UCM there is more CBV&#xD;
      decrease immediately after birth, compared to infants without C-UCM, due to improved cerebral&#xD;
      oxygen delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis II: C-UCM and cerebral regional oxygen saturation (crSO2) Infants with C-UCM have&#xD;
      higher crSO2 values during immediate neonatal transition, compared to infants without C-UCM,&#xD;
      again due to improved cerebral oxygen delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis III: C-UCM and stroke volume (SV) In infants with C-UCM the SV at 15 minutes after&#xD;
      birth is higher, compared to infants without C-UCM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis IV: C-UCM and cardiac output (CO) In infants with C-UCM the CO at 15 minutes after&#xD;
      birth is higher, compared to infants without C-UCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis V: C-UCM and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) In infants with C-UCM the MABP at&#xD;
      5, 10 and 15 minutes after birth is higher, compared to infants without C-UCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm infants Neonates with a gestational age ≥28 - 37 weeks delivered by caesarean section&#xD;
      at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Medical University of Graz, will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study, provided written informed consent is obtained from parents prior to birth.&#xD;
      Neonates with severe congenital malformations will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Term Infants Neonates with a gestational age ≥37 weeks delivered by caesarean section at the&#xD;
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Medical University of Graz, will be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study, provided written informed consent is obtained from parents prior to birth.&#xD;
      Neonates with severe congenital malformations will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed as a randomized controlled pilot trial. As there have not been&#xD;
      prior human studies investigating C-UCM regarding the outcome measures cerebral oxygenation&#xD;
      and perfusion, a randomized controlled pilot study is the appropriate first step to be able&#xD;
      to calculate sample size for a bigger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations were not performed, since there are no data from previous human&#xD;
      studies available, and this pilot study needs to be conducted to generate data for the sample&#xD;
      size calculation of a consecutive main study. For this pilot study a sample size of 80&#xD;
      infants (20 subjects in the intervention group of preterm infants, 20 subjects in the&#xD;
      intervention group of term infants, 20 subjects in each of the two control groups) is&#xD;
      arbitrary designated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical history focussing on any pathologic findings during pregnancy and delivery will&#xD;
      be collected and stored anonymously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery of the neonate via caesarean section, in the intervention group the umbilical&#xD;
      cord will be clamped within 30 seconds and cut long at least 30 cm by the obstetrician. The&#xD;
      neonate is then placed under an overhead heater by the midwife. There, the umbilical cord&#xD;
      must be untwisted and held in a vertical position. It is milked once by the neonatologist&#xD;
      towards the baby at a speed of approximately 10 cm/s and then clamped 3 cm from the umbilicus&#xD;
      by one member of the clinical team. In contrast, in the control group the umbilical cord is&#xD;
      cut according to the standard procedure and no C-UCM is performed. The further treatment&#xD;
      procedure is the same in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A NIRS transducer will be placed on the newborn's left forehead, and fixed with a modified&#xD;
      neonatal CPAP cap or gauze bandage by a scientific staff member without disturbing routine&#xD;
      medical care. Furthermore, a pulse oximeter sensor will be attached on the right wrist or&#xD;
      palm to monitor preductal oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) and heart rate (HR).&#xD;
      Moreover 4 electrodes are fixed on the skin for the non-invasive cardiac output monitoring&#xD;
      (NICOM) to evaluate SV and CO. All the measurements will be performed within the first 15&#xD;
      minutes after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The pneumatic cuff for the oscillometric measurements of the arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure will be placed around the left upper arm (or alternatively on the left lower leg) at&#xD;
      5, 10 and 15 minutes after birth. A capillary blood gas check 15 minutes after birth will be&#xD;
      performed in all the patients; However infants in need for respiratory support during&#xD;
      postnatal stabilisation receive this blood gas check routinely. Moreover, rectal temperature&#xD;
      will be measured at 15 minutes after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stopwatch is started at delivery, the time points of umbilical cord clamping, C-UCM in the&#xD;
      intervention group, establishment of NIRS measurement, establishment of SpO2 measurement, and&#xD;
      blood drawing for the gas check will be noted.&#xD;
