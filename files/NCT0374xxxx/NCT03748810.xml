  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-labeled, prospective, observational, 3-year, clinical study was conducted to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness and safety between empagliflozin (25 mg once daily) and&#xD;
      dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily) in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      despite preexisting triple OAD combination.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants included in this study were initially requested to initiate therapy with&#xD;
      insulin, but they insisted on another form of OAD. When participants declined insulin&#xD;
      injection and requested another OAD, they were not randomly assigned to each groups. It is&#xD;
      fairly common among participants with T2D to decline insulin therapy, despite being aware of&#xD;
      its importance and the benefits in controlling blood glucose. Their lack of willingness to&#xD;
      use insulin is explained by their avoidance of painful injections, the potential for body&#xD;
      weight gain and their fear of hypoglycemia. The investigators conducted a regimen consisting&#xD;
      of four OADs, including empagliflozin or dapagliflozin, to confirm which regimen would be&#xD;
      effective and safe.&#xD;
