      hypertensive disorders are one of the most important complications during pregnancy, which in&#xD;
      combination with hemorrhage and infections make a dangerous triad, making them the major&#xD;
      cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in 3.7-5% of all pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are classified into 4 categories, as recommended by&#xD;
      the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in&#xD;
      Pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preeclampsia-eclampsia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational hypertension (transient hypertension of pregnancy or chronic hypertension&#xD;
           identified in the latter half of pregnancy). This terminology is preferred over the&#xD;
           older but widely used term &quot;pregnancy-induced hypertension&quot; (PIH) because it is more&#xD;
           precise .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) released revised&#xD;
      guidelines that simplified the classification of hypertension in pregnancy into 2 categories,&#xD;
      preexisting or gestational, with the option to add &quot;with preeclampsia&quot; to either category if&#xD;
      additional maternal or fetal symptoms, signs, or test results support this .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic hypertension is defined as blood pressure exceeding 140/90 mm Hg before pregnancy or&#xD;
      before 20 weeks' gestation. When hypertension is first identified during a woman's pregnancy&#xD;
      and she is at less than 20 weeks' gestation, blood pressure elevations usually represent&#xD;
      chronic hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, new onset of elevated blood pressure readings after 20 weeks' gestation mandates&#xD;
      the consideration and exclusion of preeclampsia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Hypertension Chronic hypertension is a primary disorder in 90-95% of cases and may be&#xD;
      either essential (90%) or secondary to some identifiable underlying disorder, such as renal&#xD;
      parenchymal disease (eg, polycystic kidneys, glomerular or interstitial disease), renal&#xD;
      vascular disease (eg, renal artery stenosis, fibro-muscular dysplasia), endocrine disorders&#xD;
      (eg, adreno-corticosteroid or mineralocorticoid excess, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism or&#xD;
      hypothyroidism, growth hormone excess, hyperparathyroidism), coarctation of the aorta, or&#xD;
      oral contraceptive use. About 20-25% of women with chronic hypertension develop preeclampsia&#xD;
      during pregnancy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic hypertension occurs in up to 22% of women of childbearing age, with the prevalence&#xD;
      varying according to age, race, and body mass index. Population-based data indicate that&#xD;
      approximately 1% of pregnancies are complicated by chronic hypertension, 5-6% by gestational&#xD;
      hypertension without proteinuria, and 1-2% by preeclampsia .&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Gestational Hypertension Gestational hypertension&#xD;
           refers to hypertension with onset in the latter part of pregnancy (&gt;20 weeks' gestation)&#xD;
           without any other features of preeclampsia, and followed by normalization of the blood&#xD;
           pressure postpartum. Of women who initially present with apparent gestational&#xD;
           hypertension, about one third develops the syndrome of preeclampsia. As such, these&#xD;
           patients should be observed carefully for this progression. The pathophysiology of&#xD;
           gestational hypertension is unknown, but in the absence of features of preeclampsia, the&#xD;
           maternal and fetal outcomes are usually normal .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational hypertension may, however, be a harbinger of chronic hypertension later in life&#xD;
      Furthermore, hypertension before pregnancy or during early pregnancy is associated with a&#xD;
      twofold increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Transient hypertension of pregnancy&#xD;
      (ie, the development of isolated hypertension in a woman in late pregnancy without other&#xD;
      manifestations of preeclampsia) is associated strongly with later development of chronic&#xD;
      hypertension .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although maternal diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mm Hg is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk for placental abruption and fetal growth restriction, superimposed&#xD;
      pre-eclamptic disorders cause most of the morbidity due to chronic hypertension during&#xD;
      pregnancy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preeclampsia is defined as the new onset of hypertension and either proteinuria or end organ&#xD;
      dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman. In 2013, the&#xD;
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists removed proteinuria as an essential&#xD;
      criterion for diagnosis of preeclampsia. They also removed massive proteinuria (5&#xD;
      grams/24hours) and fetal growth restriction as possible features of severe disease because&#xD;
      massive proteinuria has a poor correlation with outcome and fetal growth restriction is&#xD;
      managed similarly whether or not preeclampsia is diagnosed. Oliguria was also removed as a&#xD;
      characteristic of severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension before 20 weeks' gestation is almost always due to chronic hypertension;&#xD;
      new-onset or worsening hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation should lead to a careful&#xD;
      evaluation for manifestations of preeclampsia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs suggesting a secondary medical cause of chronic hypertension Centripetal obesity,&#xD;
      &quot;buffalo hump,&quot; and/or wide purple abdominal striae suggest glucocorticoid excess; other&#xD;
      clinical signs may demonstrate hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or growth hormone excess. In&#xD;
      addition, a systolic bruit heard over the abdomen or in the flanks suggests renal artery&#xD;
      stenosis, whereas radio femoral delay or diminished pulses in the lower versus upper&#xD;
      extremities suggests coarctation of the aorta .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with chronic hypertension in pregnancy should be monitored for the development of&#xD;
      worsening hypertension and/or the development of superimposed pre-eclampsia (the risk is&#xD;
      approximately 25%). Laboratory investigations for pre-eclampsia should be repeated if the&#xD;
      patient's blood pressure increases or if she develops signs or symptoms of preeclampsia .&#xD;
