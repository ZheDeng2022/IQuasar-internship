    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Icotinib as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant in EGFR-mutant Stage ⅢA-N2 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer which can be potentially&#xD;
      radical treated by surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with EGFR-mutant Stage ⅢA-N2 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer which can be potentially&#xD;
      radical treated by surgery are arranged to receive Icotinib with a dose of 125 mg three times&#xD;
      per day orally for 8 weeks as neoadjuvant therapy; then patients with clinical benefits&#xD;
      receive surgical resection of the tumor. If there is curative effect of Icotinib according to&#xD;
      the RECIST or pathological report, the patients will continue receive Icotinib for two years&#xD;
      as adjuvant therapy after surgery or till progressive disease or unaccepted toxicity. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is evaluate the efficacy and safety of Icotinib neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
