  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the following outcomes of the Lapiplasty®&#xD;
      Procedure for patients in need of hallux valgus surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will determine the radiographic recurrence of hallux valgus and the timing of&#xD;
           failure following hallux valgus correction with the Lapiplasty® Procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will determine whether the Lapiplasty® Procedure effectively corrects&#xD;
           anatomical alignment of the 1st metatarsal and sesamoids in all three planes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will assess whether early weight-bearing after the Lapiplasty® Procedure&#xD;
           affects the union rates or causes loss of 3-plane correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will evaluate the quality of life and pain scores following the Lapiplasty®&#xD;
           Procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will undergo the Lapiplasty® Procedure. The key surgical steps of the&#xD;
      Lapiplasty® Procedure are releasing the 1st TMT joint, anatomical correction of the 3-plane&#xD;
      deformity, bone preparation using the Lapiplasty® Cut Guide , provisional fixation and&#xD;
      multiplanar permanent fixation with the BIPLANAR™ Plate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is common for people who undergo a Lapidus Arthrodesis to be non-weight-bearing for 6-8&#xD;
      weeks following the surgical procedure. This time allows the bones to properly fuse together.&#xD;
      During this 6-8 week period, people can be limited in the typical day-to-day activities they&#xD;
      participate in, such as walking, shopping and working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lapiplasty® System Implants may allow subjects to bear weight earlier than traditional&#xD;
      procedures without negatively effecting healing/union of the joint. By allowing people to&#xD;
      bear weight earlier than traditional methods, it is possible that people will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to resume typical day-to-day activities faster than usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the Lapiplasty® Procedure and the Lapiplasty® System Implants&#xD;
      with early weight-bearing. The study preference is that subject will be placed in a walking&#xD;
      CAM boot and allowed to start protected weight bearing no later than 3 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
      Subject can begin protected bearing weight in a CAM boot as early as the day of surgery.&#xD;
      Subject will return to weight-bearing in shoe (running or another athletic shoe) and full&#xD;
      unrestricted activity as directed by the physician based on the clinical stability and&#xD;
      subject ability to safely begin weight-bearing and unrestricted activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommended Approach for Post-Operative Care and Weight-Bearing Instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject may be either bandaged, put in splint/cast or put in CAM boot at the time of&#xD;
           surgery. If subject is fitted with CAM boot at discharge, the patient should be provided&#xD;
           instructions on how to begin protected weight-bearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject is instructed to remain off the operative foot as much as possible for the first&#xD;
           few days post-op. This is to limit bleeding and swelling and to allow soft tissues to&#xD;
           recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject may leave the surgery facility with crutches, walker, rolling knee scooter or&#xD;
           wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first post-op visit (0-3 weeks), bandages are removed, and the subject can be&#xD;
           allowed to shower. Subject may wear an athletic sock. No bandages or splints are needed.&#xD;
           The subject should be reminded of post-op care of the foot/surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first post-op visit (0-3 weeks), the subject is fitted with a CAM boot (if the&#xD;
           subject was not fitted for a CAM boot at discharge). Subject should be provided with&#xD;
           instructions on how to begin protected weight-bearing in the CAM boot and acceptable&#xD;
           activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient is instructed to put weight on foot as tolerated in the restrictive boot.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient is instructed not to roll forward onto the big toe and should remain on&#xD;
                flat foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient is instructed to remove the CAM boot multiple times daily and perform range&#xD;
                of motion exercises for ankle and foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the 6 week post-op visit, if the subject is clinically stable, subject can transition&#xD;
           from the boot to a shoe (running or another athletic shoe). The transition from boot to&#xD;
           shoe may occur over a period of days/weeks, depending on subject healing and tolerance.&#xD;
           Subject is instructed that they can walk normally but are not to stand on toes, run,&#xD;
           jump or do any other high impact activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the 4 month post-op visit, subject is allowed to begin low impact exercise if they&#xD;
           are clinically stable.&#xD;
