             hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known tumors of the ovary, breast, uterus, adrenal gland, pituitary or hypothalamus&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any abnormal finding of clinical chemistry, hematology, thyroid-stimulating hormone&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known abnormal cervical cytology of clinical significance observed within three years&#xD;
             prior to randomization (unless the clinical significance has been resolved).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Findings at the gynecological examination at screening which preclude gonadotropin&#xD;
             stimulation or are associated with a reduced chance of pregnancy, e.g. congenital&#xD;
             uterine abnormalities or retained intrauterine device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (negative urinary pregnancy tests must be documented at screening and prior&#xD;
