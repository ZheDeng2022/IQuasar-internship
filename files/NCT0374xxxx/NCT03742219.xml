      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in disease prevalence over time in&#xD;
      impoverished urban communities in Lima, Peru.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to track the changes in disease prevalence of people living in impoverished urban&#xD;
      communities in Lima over the next 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data collected in prior years and in an ongoing manner, Ohio University Global&#xD;
      Health teams will be introducing interventions focused to positively impact disease states&#xD;
      and trends in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current focus is on chronic lifestyle related diseases and their precursors:&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and overweight / obesity.&#xD;

    <description>Impoverished communities in Lima, Peru will be offered free medical clinics. Four communities have been chosen initially for focus over the following 10 years. These communities will be made aware of their risk for chronic lifestyle related diseases. In conjunction with the communities, specific interventions focused on a plant-based diet, physical activity, stress management and control of unhealthy habits will be devised.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Lifestyle Modification</intervention_name>
    <description>Community awareness: a) individuals will be made aware of their own chronic lifestyle diseases and risk factors b) communities will be made aware of their aggregated data concerning chronic lifestyle related diseases and risk factors.&#xD;
Education for individuals and communities on the meaning of the lifestyle diseases and risk factors. a) individual and small group sessions explaining diseases and lifestyle measures that are helpful, b) community level education to tentatively include i) shopping guides and recipes, ii) urban gardening projects, iii) puppet shows and other community presentations, iv) literature and posters.</description>
