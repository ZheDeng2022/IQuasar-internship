  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, two-arm, placebo-controlled clinical study. The&#xD;
      enrollment will be randomized 1:1 to Neurocytotron treatment or mock treatment (placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon the completion of the study period, the placebo group will receive treatment, if the&#xD;
      study results show benefits to patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study proposes to investigate the use of non-thermal and non-radioactive radiofrequency&#xD;
      pulses in the brain for improving the symptoms of cerebral palsy. The proposed treatment will&#xD;
      deliver radiofrequency pulses to the brain of patients in a non-invasive manner. The duration&#xD;
      of the treatment will be 1 hour per day, for 28 days. After treatment, participants will be&#xD;
      monitored for two months to detect potential adverse events and any signs of symptoms&#xD;
      improvement. The study will be closed once 48 subjects complete the study. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, the placebo group will have the opportunity to receive treatment with the&#xD;
      Neurocytotron, based on the benefits shown by study results.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Informed Consent Form approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent&#xD;
             Ethics Committee (IEC) signed and dated by the subject or the subject's legal&#xD;
             representative and by the Principal Investigator. This must be obtained before the&#xD;
             performance of any study-related procedures that are not part of normal participant&#xD;
             care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients 1 to 8 years old (We will include this age range because children with CP&#xD;
             less than 1-year-old have a high mortality rate, in addition, the clinical evolution&#xD;
             stabilizes after the second year of life, and the potential effect of treatment is&#xD;
             optimized in the first 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A clinical diagnosis of spastic cerebral palsy, or spastic and dyskinetic, secondary&#xD;
             only to hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For spasticity, having scored at least 3 on the Ashworth scale, and 3 on the gross&#xD;
             motor scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For dyskinesis, any degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient with diagnosis of ataxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current or recent history (within 2 months) of significant bacterial, fungal, viral,&#xD;
             or mycobacterial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Having a condition considered as causing or likely to cause co-morbidities, as&#xD;
             determined by the investigator based on medical history, physical examination, vital&#xD;
             signs, and clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject with magnetic implants, pacemakers, claustrophobia or any other condition that&#xD;
             precludes them from entering or staying in the NeuroCytotron.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Surgical history related to spasticity treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have received treatment with botulinum toxin in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. 7. Children with prior neurosurgery within the past 6 months at the time of&#xD;
             evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of congenital heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who cannot or are unlikely able to comply with the protocol, according to the&#xD;
             consensus reached by the group of study investigators.&#xD;
