  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided interscalene block (ISB) is the reference technique for pain control after&#xD;
      ambulatory upper limb surgery, but supraclavicular block (SCB) is an alternative procedure.&#xD;
      We compared the efficacy of these two techniques in patients undergoing ambulatory&#xD;
      arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients undergoing ambulatory arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) in our&#xD;
      center is increasing annually. This procedure is associated with significant postoperative&#xD;
      pain and effective analgesia is required in order to develop day-case surgery. Although&#xD;
      continuous interscalene catheter block (ISB) is considered to be the most effective analgesic&#xD;
      technique for ARCR, the difficulties in implementing and monitoring ISB have led to many&#xD;
      anesthesiologists preferring single injection block, so that patients can be discharged on&#xD;
      the same day as surgery with a satisfactory level of pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ISB is frequently associated with phrenic nerve block,even with low volumes of local&#xD;
      anesthetics. Phrenic nerve block is a concern in some ambulatory surgery patients as it may&#xD;
      lead to respiratory complications after hospital discharge, limiting the eligibility of many&#xD;
      patients for day surgery. Changes in spirometry variables have been associated with ISB,&#xD;
      whatever the site of injection around the roots (anterior or posterior). Nevertheless,&#xD;
      effective regional anesthesia (RA) is essential for this surgery, because multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia alone is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several alternatives to ISB exist that are associated with a decreased prevalence of phrenic&#xD;
      nerve paresis.6 Supraclavicular block (SCB) decreases the risk of phrenic nerve involvement,&#xD;
      particularly when guided by ultrasound. This technique, which has been linked to a risk of&#xD;
      pneumothorax when carried out by neurostimulation only, has now been revived and is included&#xD;
      among the RA techniques considered to be safe in terms of respiratory risk, especially when&#xD;
      guided by ultrasound. Many studies have demonstrated a decreased risk of phrenic paresis with&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided SCB, even with volumes as high as 20 mL. Published studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that SCB is an effective alternative to ISB, and many studies have shown that&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided SCB is a safe technique for ambulatory shoulder surgery in terms of&#xD;
      respiratory complications. SCB is therefore a real alternative to ISB for ambulatory ARCR,&#xD;
      but comparative studies are necessary to evaluate its analgesic efficacy after patients have&#xD;
      been discharged from hospital, particularly in terms of their oral morphine consumption at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators carried out a monocentric, prospective, comparative study to determine whether&#xD;
      SCB is non-inferior to ISB in terms of post-operative analgesia in patients undergoing&#xD;
      ambulatory ARCR. Analgesic efficacy was determined by oral morphine use and/or pain scores in&#xD;
      patients after hospital discharge. Promotor hypothesis was that SCB would provide similar or&#xD;
      better analgesia to ISB in patients returning home on the evening of their surgery.&#xD;
