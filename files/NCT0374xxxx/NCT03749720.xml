  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By means of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), this study examines blood samples from patients&#xD;
      newly diagnosed with cervical cancer to investigate whether it is possible to measure the&#xD;
      presence and amount of HPV DNA in these blood samples. The first blood sample is taken at&#xD;
      time of diagnosis, and follow-up blood samples are collected during treatment- and follow-up&#xD;
      visits. We expect to find a correlation between the disease stage and the viral load and also&#xD;
      a decline in viral load after treatment. Furthermore, we hope that this method may serve as a&#xD;
      way of detecting disease recurrence earlier than what is possible today.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study hypothesises that in patients with HPV-related cervical cancer, HPV DNA may be&#xD;
      released into the bloodstream from tumor cells. These fragments of HPV DNA shed by tumor may&#xD;
      therefore be measured in blood samples from the patients. By using the same setting as for&#xD;
      real-time PCR with PCR primers and probes for fluorescence detection, the study uses digital&#xD;
      droplet PCR (ddPCR), a method based on dilution and partitioning of the blood sample in many&#xD;
      reaction chambers or droplets, to measure absolute quantities of HPV DNA fragments in blood&#xD;
      samples from women with different stages of cervical cancer. Patients are recruited at the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis, where a baseline blood sample is collected. Follow-up blood samples are&#xD;
      collected during treatment and at follow-up visits up to two years after the diagnosis. We&#xD;
      expect the HPV DNA load to decrease after treatment, and if an increase in viral load is&#xD;
      detected during follow-up, we expect this to be an early sign of a disease recurrence. The&#xD;
      method may therefore become an effective monitoring tool in these patients in terms of&#xD;
      detecting a ongoing disease recurrence, which gives us the chance to intervene and treat&#xD;
      these patients before the disease becomes too disseminated.&#xD;
