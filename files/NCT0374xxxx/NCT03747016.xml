      Traditionally, Fasting for more than 8 hours before operation is administered to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of reverse flow and aspiration. ASA guidelines suggest a 2-hour fasting for clear fluid&#xD;
      in healthy people before elective surgery. But in delivery women, the gastric emptying time&#xD;
      is affected by the physiological change. This study is a prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      study to investigate the gastric emptying time of high energy digestible foods in delivery&#xD;
      women, and the effect of high energy digestible food given before surgery on the comfort and&#xD;
      metabolism of women undergoing Cesarean section. In the first step, 60 women in delivery room&#xD;
      whose gastric volume less than 3.81 cm2 are randomly divided into three groups, 20 cases in&#xD;
      each group. The experimental group (Group E1) is treated with high energy digestible food&#xD;
      300ml, Group G1 is given 5% glucose injection 300ml and Group N1 is given normal saline&#xD;
      300ml. The gastric volume was determined by ultrasonography once every hour until gastric&#xD;
      volume less than 3.81cm2, and the time of gastric emptying was determined. The second step&#xD;
      was to recruit 80 cases of full-term elective cesarean section. They were randomly divided&#xD;
      into four groups, 20 cases in each group. The experimental group (Group E2) was given high&#xD;
      energy digestible food 300ml before the time of gastric emptying found in the first step ,&#xD;
      Group G2 is given 5% glucose injection 300ml and Group N2 is given normal saline 300ml, while&#xD;
      the control group (Group C2) was not given any diet. After admission to the operation room,&#xD;
      the volume of the stomach was measured by ultrasound, and the differences of comfort, body&#xD;
      temperature, shivering, blood glucose and postoperative anal exhaust time between the two&#xD;
      groups were observed. This study is going to investigate the gastric emptying time of high&#xD;
      energy digestible foods in delivery women, and the effect of high energy digestible food on&#xD;
      the comfort, body temperature and blood glucose of women undergoing Cesarean section, so as&#xD;
      to provide a good basis for reducing the surgery stress in women undergoing Cesarean section.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective randomized controlled study to investigate the gastric emptying&#xD;
      time of high energy digestible foods in delivery women, and the effect of high energy&#xD;
      digestible food given before surgery on the comfort and metabolism of women undergoing&#xD;
      Cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first step, 60 women in delivery room are enrolled, who are full term singleton&#xD;
      pregnancy subjects ranging 18 to 50 years old and fasting for more than 8 hours. They are&#xD;
      randomly divided into three groups, 20 cases in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group (Group E1) is treated with high energy digestible food 300ml, Group G1&#xD;
      is given 5% glucose injection 300ml and Group N1 is given normal saline 300ml. The gastric&#xD;
      volume was determined by gastric antrum cross-sectional area (CSA) measured with&#xD;
      ultrasonography before drinking and once every hour after drinking. Once CSA is less than&#xD;
      3.81 cm2, the time is recorded as gastric emptying time of the woman. The overall gastric&#xD;
      emptying time of high energy digestible food is determined with the 90 percentile gastric&#xD;
      emptying time of women drinking high energy digestible food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second step was to recruit 80 cases of full-term elective cesarean section. They were&#xD;
      randomly divided into four groups, 20 cases in each group. The experimental group (Group E2)&#xD;
      was given high energy digestible food 300ml before the time of gastric emptying found in the&#xD;
      first step, Group G2 is given 5% glucose injection 300ml and Group N2 is given normal saline&#xD;
      300ml, while the control group (Group C2) was not given any diet. After admission to the&#xD;
      operation room, the volume of the stomach was measured by ultrasound, and the differences of&#xD;
      comfort, body temperature, shivering, blood glucose and postoperative anal exhaust time&#xD;
      between the two groups were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is going to investigate the gastric emptying time of high energy digestible foods&#xD;
      in delivery women, and the effect of high energy digestible food on the comfort, body&#xD;
      temperature and blood glucose of women undergoing Cesarean section, so as to provide a good&#xD;
      basis for reducing the surgery stress in women undergoing Cesarean section.&#xD;
