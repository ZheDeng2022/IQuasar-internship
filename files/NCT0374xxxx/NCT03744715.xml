  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study (Extension Study) designed to allow patients to&#xD;
      continue to receive poziotinib treatment who have had previous exposure to poziotinib and/or&#xD;
      are still receiving clinical benefit from treatment, as judged by the Investigator or&#xD;
      treating physician. Patients must begin treatment in this study within 28 days after their&#xD;
      last dose of poziotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This extension protocol is intended to provide clinical benefit of poziotinib to patients who&#xD;
      are responding to treatment. The additional treatment is optional and voluntary.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who wish to participate in the extension study must provide written Informed&#xD;
      Consent. Treatment will begin after completion of the End of Study (EOS) or End of Treatment&#xD;
      (EOT) visit of the Original Study. The assessments obtained at the EOS or EOT visit will&#xD;
      serve as Baseline data for the extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive poziotinib treatment at the last dose received or at the&#xD;
      standard starting dose of 16 milligrams (mg) poziotinib, once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may receive treatment as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit, as judged&#xD;
      by the investigator or treating physician (case-by-case decision with approval of Spectrum),&#xD;
      death, withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, lost to follow-up, or poziotinib&#xD;
      receives commercial approval in their country of residence or development is terminated by&#xD;
      the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. There will be an EOS Visit 35 (±5) days after the last&#xD;
      dose of poziotinib.&#xD;
