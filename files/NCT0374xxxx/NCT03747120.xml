&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either Arm A: THP (trastuzumab, pertuzumab and weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel), Arm B: THP-K (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, pembrolizumab and weekly paclitaxel) or&#xD;
      Arm C: TH-K (trastuzumab, pembrolizumab and weekly paclitaxel). Patients will be stratified&#xD;
      according to hormone receptor status and lymph node status. All patients will be treated&#xD;
      weekly every three weeks for four cycles (only paclitaxel will be administered weekly) and&#xD;
      then undergo breast surgery. Arm A patients will be regarded as the reference group.&#xD;
