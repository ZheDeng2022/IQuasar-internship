      To determine the prevalence of P. jirovecii in nasopharyngeal aspirations of neonates and&#xD;
      infants hospitalized for symptomatic respiratory infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is recognized that primary infection with Pneumocystis, an opportunistic and transmissible&#xD;
      fungus, occurs early in childhood. Early investigations of primary infection considering the&#xD;
      detection of P. jirovecii in respiratory specimens suggests that primary infection in infants&#xD;
      without immunodeficiency could be either asymptomatic or symptomatic. The infection may be&#xD;
      identified as an apparently benign respiratory infection evolving on its own, but may also be&#xD;
      contemporaneous with another viral or bacterial respiratory infection. In addition, there are&#xD;
      little data available on the genotypic characteristics of P. jirovecii in infants developing&#xD;
      primary infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the project will focus on the detection of P. jirovecii in hospitalized&#xD;
      infants, presented with symptoms, and without overt immunodeficiency. The prospective&#xD;
      collection of biological, clinical and epidemiological data in these infants will make it&#xD;
      possible to identify risk factors for the acquisition of the fungus and to address its role&#xD;
      in symptoms and clinical presentation. A second focus will be on the identification and&#xD;
      comparison of genotypes in infants developing primary infection and in immunocompromised&#xD;
      adults developing PPC or colonized by the fungus. These two approaches are the necessary&#xD;
      steps to address the putative role of these patient populations (infants and adults) in the&#xD;
      human reservoir of the fungus. A third focus will be the detection and genotypic&#xD;
      identification of P. jirovecii in infants and the exhaled air of infants in their&#xD;
      environment. The potential role of infants as potential infectious sources may be determined.&#xD;

    <description>The main biological parameter which will be measured will be the positive or negative result of P. jirovecii detection in nasopharyngeal apsirate specimens from non-immunosuppressed newborns and infants. The prevalence of P. jirovecii comtemporary with first contacts with the fungus will be assessed.</description>
