  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy in reducing disease activity and safety&#xD;
      of Dupilumab in adult patients with cholinergic urticarial (CholU) who are symptomatic&#xD;
      despite H1-antihistamine treatment (licensed dose).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with Dupilumab has been shown to reduce clinically significant exacerbations and to&#xD;
      improve skin symptom control as well as quality of life in moderate to severe atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis patients and in moderate to severe asthma patients. It has been approval by EMA&#xD;
      for the treatment of atopic dermatitis patients in September 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dupilumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and&#xD;
      interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling and was previously found to be effective in atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis and asthma. Considering that CholU and atopic diseases share many common features&#xD;
      (e.g. key pathogenic role of mast cells and IgE, itch is a dominant symptom, Th2 dominance),&#xD;
      it is reasonable to expect that Dupilumab is beneficial in CholU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results suggest that Dupilumab may provide an effective treatment option for patients&#xD;
      with insufficient treatment responses to H1-antihistamines exhibiting wheal and flare type&#xD;
      skin reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard treatment of CholU consists of administration of antihistamines. In most&#xD;
      patients, symptoms persist with standard dosing of antihistamines. In&#xD;
      antihistamine-refractory patients with cholinergic urticaria, no other licensed treatment is&#xD;
      currently available. In 2014, omalizumab has been licensed for add-on therapy in CSU patients&#xD;
      who still have symptoms despite standard-dosed antihistamine treatment, but not for chronic&#xD;
      inducible forms of urticaria. Accordingly, there is still a great medical need for additional&#xD;
      treatment options of CholU patients that are refractory to antihistamine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dupilumab has excellent potential to provide symptom control in CholU. This study will&#xD;
      provide additional valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of Dupilumab in improving&#xD;
      quality of life in these patients, in addition to managing CholU symptoms.&#xD;

                  the patient), Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;

                  been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment&#xD;

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 m prior to screening). For female patients on the&#xD;
                  study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other&#xD;
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) In case of&#xD;
                  use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a&#xD;
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
        had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
        (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous&#xD;
        amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL; or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
        (with or without hysterectomy) at least six months ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone,&#xD;
        only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone&#xD;
        level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
