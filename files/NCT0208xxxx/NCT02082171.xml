  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of physical disability represents a major priority for the public health system.&#xD;
      Physical disability is the final result of a complex cascade of negative events occurring at&#xD;
      different levels (i.e., environmental, social, biological, and clinical). The heterogeneity&#xD;
      of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the onset of physical disability may require the&#xD;
      adoption of preventive interventions affecting multiple domains. Although several studies&#xD;
      suggest that single or different combinations of preventive interventions (in particular,&#xD;
      physical activity, cognitive training, and healthy diet) might provide beneficial effects in&#xD;
      preventing functional loss (and its related features, such as pain or reduced quality of&#xD;
      life), very limited evidence coming from clinical trials is currently available on the topic.&#xD;
      Intervention trials are usually designed to test the effect of a specific monodimensional&#xD;
      intervention on a very selected population, so to reduce the risk of biased results. This&#xD;
      approach, although legitimate and methodologically correct, may 1) be insufficient to target&#xD;
      the multiple and heterogeneous physiopathological mechanisms underlying the onset of physical&#xD;
      disability, and 2) cause a population selection bias leading to difficulties in implementing&#xD;
      the study results to the overall older population (thus, determining the &quot;evidence-based&#xD;
      medicine&quot; issue in the elderly). To our knowledge, there are no available data from clinical&#xD;
      trials evaluating the effects of a multidomain intervention based on lifestyle modifications&#xD;
      (e.g., physical activity, cognitive training, nutritional modification) for preventing&#xD;
      mobility disability (a very early phase of the disabling process) in community-dwelling older&#xD;
      persons. In the present project (Multidomain Intervention to preveNt Disability in ElDers,&#xD;
      MINDED), we propose to conduct a pilot study aimed at estimating the effects of a multidomain&#xD;
      person-tailored preventive intervention (based on physical activity, cognitive training, and&#xD;
      nutritional modifications) on frailty status, physical performance, cognitive function,&#xD;
      nutritional status, health-related quality of life, and use of health care services. In&#xD;
      addition, we will perform cost-effectiveness analyses of the proposed intervention. The&#xD;
      project will yield the necessary preliminary data to design a definitive full-scale Phase 3&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial. By providing a conclusive answer about the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      multidimensional preventive program in the primary prevention of major health-related&#xD;
      outcomes, the results of the full-scale trial will have relevant clinical and public health&#xD;
      implications, and will promote the practicing of a truly evidence-based geriatric medicine.&#xD;
