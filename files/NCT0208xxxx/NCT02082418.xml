  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging modifies the metabolic pathway of the neurotransmitter serotonin by reducing the&#xD;
      synthesis rate and increasing the breakdown rate of serotonin, possibly related to the&#xD;
      observed enhanced sensitivity of the serotonergic pathway. Since serotonin plays a prominent&#xD;
      role in neuropsychological functions such as anxiety, mood and memory, the enhanced&#xD;
      sensitivity of the serotonergic pathway in aging can probably explain the fact that elderly&#xD;
      are more vulnerable to develop cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serotonin synthesis in brain is regulated by its precursor tryptophan (TRP). Because&#xD;
      tryptophan is an essential amino acid, modifying the availability of tryptophan through&#xD;
      dietary intake, can directly influence central serotonin metabolism and consequently&#xD;
      affective and cognitive processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that an acute intake of whey protein with&#xD;
      high levels of TRP such as alpha-lactalbumin can stabilize the metabolism of serotonin and&#xD;
      subsequently enhance metabolic and cognitive functions in healthy older adults. The acute&#xD;
      effects of this dietary protein will be investigated in subjects with mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI), or dementia, compared to control subjects in order to examine whether&#xD;
      healthy older subject with MCI benefit more from the intake of alpha-lactalbumin and/or whey.&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate if this meal can optimize serotonin metabolism by&#xD;
      elevating plasma TRP levels and plasma TRP appearance and enhance splanchnic TRP extraction.&#xD;
      In addition, the effects on mood and cognitive functions will be examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves for all subjects 3 test days (approximately 8 hours each). On this test&#xD;
      day the investigators will examine the acute effects of a protein meal. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      a mixture of alpha-lactalbumin and/or whey and/or casein, carbohydrates and amino acid stable&#xD;
      isotopes to investigate protein and amino acid kinetics (assigned to alpha-lactalbumin or&#xD;
      whey or casein group on test day 1, then switch on test day 2 and 3). The subjects will&#xD;
      receive these stable isotopes by infusion in their blood and by oral intake (e.g.&#xD;
      simultaneously with protein meal). For study purposes, blood will be drawn approx. 25 times&#xD;
      during 8 hours on the test day, altogether about 100-120 ml of blood will be drawn on the&#xD;
      test day.&#xD;
