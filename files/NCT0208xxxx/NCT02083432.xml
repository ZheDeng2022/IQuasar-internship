      The aims of the study: to explore the possible effectiveness of cognitive behavior treatment&#xD;
      (CBT) among children and adolescents with formally diagnosed intra-oral injection phobia&#xD;
      (DSM-IV), when performed by specially trained dentists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients diagnosed with intra-oral injection phobia according to the diagnostic manual&#xD;
      DSM-IV. The effect of cognitive behavior therapy when performed by specially trained dentists&#xD;
      will be evaluated. Patients referred to the Centre for Odontophobia, and who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, will be allocated to an immediate treatment group (test group) and a&#xD;
      waiting list group (control group) of 30 subjects in each group. After treatment they will be&#xD;
      followed up during a 1-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses are formulated based on the literature and previous population and treatment&#xD;
      studies of similar designs among adults at the Centre for Odontophobia.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Hypotheses are formulated based on the literature and previous population and treatment&#xD;
      studies of similar designs among adults at the Centre for Odontophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: referred 10-17-yr-olds (N=60) who refused intra-oral injections due to&#xD;
      intra-oral injection-phobia. This randomized controlled study consisted of a test group&#xD;
      (immediate treatment) and a control group (5 weeks waiting list). A diagnostic interview was&#xD;
      performed by trained clinical psychologists, and 5 sessions of CBT were performed by 4&#xD;
      specially trained dentists. Each session had a maximum duration of one hour. Assessment at&#xD;
      pre-treatment, post-treatment and 1-yr follow -up included responses from 4 different&#xD;
      validated self-report instruments; Children's Fear Survey Schedule-Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS),&#xD;
      Blood Phobia Scale (BS), Injection Phobia Scale for Children (IPS-C) and Intra-Oral&#xD;
      Injection-Phobia Scale (IOIP). Paired sample t-tests were performed on the sumscores of the&#xD;
      self-report instruments pre- , post waitlist, and post- treatment (n=17).&#xD;
