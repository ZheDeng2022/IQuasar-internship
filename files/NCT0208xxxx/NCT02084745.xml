    <textblock>
      Boston keratoprosthesis (KPro) is a piece of specialized plastic that replace sick cornea&#xD;
      (transparent structure at the front of the eye) in patients who have failed or those who are&#xD;
      expected to have poor results with traditional corneal transplantation. While the Kpro can&#xD;
      offer dramatic improvement in vision, it is also associated with several complications.&#xD;
      Glaucoma (optic nerve damage due to high pressure inside the eye) is one of the most common&#xD;
      complications after KPro surgery and can potentially cause irreversible vision loss. The&#xD;
      implantation of a glaucoma drainage device (GDD), a tiny tube that drains the liquid inside&#xD;
      the eye by bypassing the natural drainage system, is an effective option to lower the eye&#xD;
      pressure in patients with KPro. Given the frequency and potentially devastating effects of&#xD;
      glaucoma among KPro patients, some surgeons recommend to put in a GDD as a preventative&#xD;
      measure. However, there is no consensus on when is the best timing to perform such surgery in&#xD;
      relation to the Boston Kpro surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients undergoing the Boston KPro surgery, implanting a GDD simultaneously, at the time&#xD;
      of surgery, is more efficacious than at 6 months later, in the prevention of the progression&#xD;
      of glaucoma and in maintaining better visual functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit 40 patients over 4 years. Recruited patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 2 groups: 1) simultaneous GDD implantation at the Boston KPro surgery,&#xD;
      and 2) GDD implantation 6 months after the Boston KPro surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once recruited, patients will be followed before the KPro surgery, postoperative day 1, week&#xD;
      1, month 1, 3, 6 and 12. Standard ophthalmological exam will be performed at each visit.&#xD;
      Additional non-invasive glaucoma tests and evaluation (visual fields and optic nerve photo)&#xD;
      will be performed on day 1, month 1, 3, 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients assigned to group 2, a GDD will be implanted 6 months after the KPro surgery.&#xD;
      They will have additional follow-ups on post-GDD surgery day 1, week 1 and month 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of visual acuity, visual fields, optic nerve evaluation and complications will be&#xD;
      compared between the two groups to determine the better timing of GDD implantation.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma is a major problem for KPro candidates. Indeed, many diagnostic indications for KPro&#xD;
      such as aniridia, chemical burns, trauma and repeated graft failure imply alteration of the&#xD;
      iridocorneal angle, and consequently high intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the prevalence of glaucoma before KPro surgery lies between 27% and 77%, with&#xD;
      most studies showing a prevalence above 50%. The diagnosis and management of glaucoma is&#xD;
      particularly challenging in the KPro population. Preoperatively, the measurement of IOP is&#xD;
      possible through Goldmann tonometry and pneumotonometry but this measurement may be erroneous&#xD;
      due to corneal scarring and irregularity. Furthermore, corneal opacification usually prevents&#xD;
      visualization of the optic nerve head, and visual field assessment is not possible due to&#xD;
      poor vision. Therefore, while glaucoma is often suspected in patients undergoing KPro, this&#xD;
      diagnosis may be only confirmed postoperatively. While optic nerve head and visual field&#xD;
      examination become possible following KPro surgery, the determination of IOP can only be&#xD;
      accomplished through digital palpation. The shortcomings of this method, including its very&#xD;
      poor inter- and intra-observer reliability, are well recognized. Because IOP reduction is the&#xD;
      basis of glaucoma treatment, it is exceedingly difficult to manage glaucoma in the KPro&#xD;
      population. In the face of such complexity, some KPro surgeons have suggested that Glaucoma&#xD;
      Drainage Device (GDD) implantation could be performed during KPro surgery in all patients&#xD;
      with marginal preoperative IOP control. With this approach, the GDD could prevent&#xD;
      postoperative IOP rise and the need for subsequent surgical and medical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to implant a GDD in a patient with pre-existing or prospective KPro must be&#xD;
      weighed carefully. The insidious development or progression of glaucoma is the most common&#xD;
      blinding complication of KPro implantation. Indeed, the course of glaucoma is a major&#xD;
      determinant of KPro surgery prognosis and specifically of the visual result. On the other&#xD;
      hand, complications associated with concomitant GDD and KPro surgeries may in themselves lead&#xD;
      to severe and irreversible vision loss and thus, prevent the visual rehabilitation of these&#xD;
      patients. With the increasing use of the KPro, it is important to evaluate the optimal timing&#xD;
      of GDD implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients undergoing the Boston KPro surgery, implanting a GDD simultaneously, at the time&#xD;
      of surgery, is more efficacious than waiting 6 months to implant a GDD, in the prevention of&#xD;
      the progression of glaucoma and in maintaining better visual acuity and visual fields&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the most appropriate time to implant a GDD in order to prevent the&#xD;
           deleterious effect of glaucomatous optic neuropathy on visual rehabilitation of patients&#xD;
           implanted with the Boston KPro.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the outcomes of the visual acuity, visual field and glaucomatous optic disc&#xD;
           damage by implanting a GDD at the time of KPro surgery versus implanting GDD 6 months&#xD;
           post-KPro surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single blind, prospective randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The duration of the study is 5 years, 4 years to recruit and 1 year to&#xD;
      follow each patient. Forty consecutive patients (forty eyes) will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      One eye of each patient will be included. The study protocol is approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of CHUM. All patients will be informed about the design of the study and the&#xD;
      procedure, and written informed consent will be obtained from all patients. Patient's&#xD;
      eligibility for the study will be evaluated at the first consultation visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline study visit, patients will be randomized with a 1:1 allocation into two&#xD;
      groups. Group 1 will comprise 20 patients undergoing KPro and simultaneous GDD while group 2&#xD;
      will include 20 patients undergoing KPro and then GDD 6 months later. Randomization schedule&#xD;
      will be computer generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the surgery, a complete medical and ophthalmological history will be obtained from&#xD;
      each patient. Patients will undergo a thorough ophthalmological evaluation, A-scan and B-scan&#xD;
      ultrasound. The primary and concomitant pre-operative diagnoses are noted. The Boston KPro,&#xD;
      purchased from Massachusetts Eye and Ear infirmary (Boston, MA), is implanted using the usual&#xD;
      standard technique. The GDD that will be used is the Ahmed implant (New World Medical, Rancho&#xD;
      Cucamonga, CA). The Ahmed implant will be implanted using the standard technique either at&#xD;
      the time of KPro surgery in group 1, or 6 months following KPro in group 2. Standard&#xD;
      postoperative management will be followed. Follow-up visits will be performed on day 1, week&#xD;
      1, and months 1, 3, 6, and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual acuity will be measured pre-operatively and at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Humphrey Visual Field 24-2 (SITA-Fast) will be performed at post-op 1 month, 3 months, 6&#xD;
           months, and 1 year. In cases where an automated visual field test is unreliable due to&#xD;
           unacceptable number of false positives (&gt;33%), false negatives (&gt;33%), or fixation&#xD;
           losses (&gt;20%), a Goldmann Visual Field will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Optic disc examination will be done by a glaucoma specialist on post-operative days 1&#xD;
           and post-operative months 1, 3, 6, and 12 and graded according to the Disc Damage&#xD;
           Likelihood Scale (DDLS). The chart containing measures of DDLS made on previous visits&#xD;
           will not be made available to the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc will be taken on postoperative months 1, 3,&#xD;
           6, 12. The blinded glaucoma specialist will assign a DDLS to each photograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient's test results will be compiled in a table. Based on data available one month&#xD;
      post-operatively, the investigators will decide whether there is evidence of glaucomatous&#xD;
      optic neuropathy at this time (thereby likely reflecting presence of pre-existing glaucoma).&#xD;
      Based on data gathered over 12 months, the investigators will decide whether or not the&#xD;
      glaucoma has progressed through the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All medical records, including operative protocol and progress notes, will be analyzed and&#xD;
      data will be collected with respect to ophthalmic diagnosis of the operated eye. Patient&#xD;
      demographics (age and gender), preoperative diagnosis, presence of pre-KPro glaucoma,&#xD;
      surgical feasibility, retention of both GDD and KPro devices, short and long term&#xD;
      complications of eyes who receive GDD will be studied. Patients who experience vision loss&#xD;
      secondary to GDD complications such as tube occlusion, overfiltration, hypotony and choroidal&#xD;
      hemorrhage will be analyzed in greater detail. Complications related to post-operative&#xD;
      glaucoma will be evaluated. The extent of visual recuperation and the impact of glaucomatous&#xD;
      optic nerve damage on the visual potential will be studied. Continued progression of glaucoma&#xD;
      and the need for medical and surgical therapy will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of this study, Visual Fields (Sita 24-2) and glaucomatous disc damage&#xD;
      will be compared between both groups. Log rank test will be used to check the significance of&#xD;
      differences between both groups. Pre- and post-best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), as&#xD;
      expressed in logMar units, will be compared in each group and plotted to demonstrate the&#xD;
      evolution over time of the visual acuity in each group. Percentages of patients with fixation&#xD;
      loss (BCVA worse than 1.30 logMar) at final visits from the two groups will also be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suitable time of GDD implantation will be determined by analyzing the visual outcome at&#xD;
      the start and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-KPro and calculating the hazard on each time point.&#xD;
      For this, time varying survival models - Cox and accelerated failure time (AFT) models will&#xD;
      be applied according to their validity. The risk in both groups can be shown graphically by&#xD;
      Kaplan Meier survival curve for loss of visual field and glaucomatous optic disc damage.&#xD;
      Tests for statistical significance will be carried out at alpha=0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Boston KPro allows recovery of sight to patients with reversible corneal blindness.&#xD;
      Glaucoma, a serious and sight threatening complication of KPro, may rob patients irreversibly&#xD;
      and permanently of the sight they had recovered. The results of study will shed light on the&#xD;
      most appropriate timing of glaucoma prevention and treatment. Hence, glaucoma will be treated&#xD;
      in a timely fashion, preventing irreversible visual loss without subjecting patients to undue&#xD;
      complications of glaucoma surgery.&#xD;
