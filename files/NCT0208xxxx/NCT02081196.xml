    <measure>The Number of Device and/or Procedure-Related Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through 16 weeks post-treatment visit, which is approximately 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of device- or procedure-related adverse events will be tabulated. Adverse event reports are collected throughout the study from enrollment through the 16 week follow-up visit. The investigator determines if there is a relationship between the event and the study device or procedure.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Fat Layer of the Treated Area as Measured by Ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and 16 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the fat layer thickness will be calculated by comparison of pre-treatment and 16 week post-treatment ultrasound measurements taken in the area treated with the device, and in the untreated contralateral flank control area. The Sponsor's standardized techniques for obtaining ultrasound imaging will be used. Overall fat layer thickness changes were normalized for each subject by subtracting the change in control from the change in treated area to remove the influence of weight variations. Success is defined as, on average, at least a 1mm or greater reduction in fat layer thickness for the treated flank as compared to the untreated control flank. Results indicate the fat layer reduction in millimeters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Pre-treatment Images Correctly Identified.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the treated vs. untreated areas will be assessed by observation of changes in surface contour and/or fat volume by an independent photo review of pre-treatment and post-treatment images. Images show both treated and untreated flanks. Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. Reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. Criteria for evaluable photos for the purposes of the independent review: subject completed treatments; subject has complete set of baseline photos and post-treatment photos; photos were taken using Zeltiq standard procedure. The expected success rate is 80% correct identification.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subject satisfaction with the Zeltiq procedure as determined by the results of a subjects satisfaction questionnaire at the 16 week follow up visit. This questionnaire will be composed of 5-point Likert scale questions, as well as free-text responses.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Subject has clearly visible fat on the flanks, which in the investigator's opinion,&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subject with body mass index (BMI) up to 30. BMI is defined as weight in pounds&#xD;
             multiplied by 703 divided by the square of the height in inches.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject agrees to maintain his/her weight (i.e., within 5 pounds) by not making any&#xD;
             major changes in their diet or lifestyle during the course of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subject has had an invasive fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction, mesotherapy)&#xD;
             in the area of intended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has had a non-invasive fat reduction and/or body contouring procedure in the&#xD;
             area of intended treatment within the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject needs to administer, or has a known history of subcutaneous injections into&#xD;

        <title>Change in the Fat Layer of the Treated Area as Measured by Ultrasound</title>
        <description>Change in the fat layer thickness will be calculated by comparison of pre-treatment and 16 week post-treatment ultrasound measurements taken in the area treated with the device, and in the untreated contralateral flank control area. The Sponsor's standardized techniques for obtaining ultrasound imaging will be used. Overall fat layer thickness changes were normalized for each subject by subtracting the change in control from the change in treated area to remove the influence of weight variations. Success is defined as, on average, at least a 1mm or greater reduction in fat layer thickness for the treated flank as compared to the untreated control flank. Results indicate the fat layer reduction in millimeters.</description>

        <description>Change in the treated vs. untreated areas will be assessed by observation of changes in surface contour and/or fat volume by an independent photo review of pre-treatment and post-treatment images. Images show both treated and untreated flanks. Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. Reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. Criteria for evaluable photos for the purposes of the independent review: subject completed treatments; subject has complete set of baseline photos and post-treatment photos; photos were taken using Zeltiq standard procedure. The expected success rate is 80% correct identification.</description>
