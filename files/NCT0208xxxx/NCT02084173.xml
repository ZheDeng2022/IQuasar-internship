  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging of western societies in the coming years combined with increasing alcohol&#xD;
      consumption among elderly, the number of elderly with alcohol problems is expected to rise&#xD;
      considerably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly patients are often lonely; suffer from feelings of loss, fear to be a burden on their&#xD;
      children and on society, and feel powerless. On the surface their alcohol related problems&#xD;
      seem less severe that those of the middle-aged patients while in reality co-morbidity and&#xD;
      social issues complicate alcohol dependency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no specific treatment tailored for alcohol use disorder among elderly is&#xD;
      available. Consequently they receive either no treatment, are given brief advising from the&#xD;
      general practitioner or are referred to treatment at specialized treatment institutions with&#xD;
      no specific treatment for elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a study aimed at developing and testing an outpatient behavior&#xD;
      therapy program for alcohol use disorders for seniors (60 years and older), which - if&#xD;
      effective - can be easily implemented in routine care. Three centers from Denmark, Germany&#xD;
      and USA (New Mexico) will participate. All three centers have a long and extensive experience&#xD;
      with alcohol treatment and alcohol research. Patients fulfilling the DSM 5 criteria for&#xD;
      alcohol use disorder are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent participants will be randomly assigned to either Motivational&#xD;
      Enhancement Therapy (MET), four sessions/one session per week or MET followed by Community&#xD;
      Re-enforcement Approach (CRA), eight sessions/one session per week - thus 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment in total. 50% will receive MET and 50% MET+CRA. Primary outcome is percentage of&#xD;
      patients with abstinence or controlled use (alcohol intake of equivalent blood alcohol&#xD;
      content equal to or less than 0.5‰.). A total of 1000 patients will be enrolled. Participants&#xD;
      will be assessed with a battery of international validated instruments measuring drinking&#xD;
      pattern as well as key elements of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are assessed before initiation of treatment, at the end of MET treatment (four&#xD;
      weeks), at the end of MET+CRA treatment (12 weeks), at 6 months, and at 12 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. 7 or less correct answers in the &quot;inclusion quiz&quot; - indicating cognitive problems&#xD;
