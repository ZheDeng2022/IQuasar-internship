      The goals of this study is to determine if nelfinavir can target Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and&#xD;
      Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in patients with certain cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are&#xD;
      gammaherpesviruses that are associated with a variety of human cancers, including a subset of&#xD;
      lymphomas, carcinomas, and sarcomas. In tumors the virus typically exists in a latent state.&#xD;
      In latently infected cells, the vast majority of viral genes are not expressed and there is&#xD;
      little to no production of infectious virions. The virus replicates in tandem with cell&#xD;
      division using cellular machinery. This highly restricted pattern of gene expression allows&#xD;
      the virus to evade immune recognition and clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the treatment approach to virally-associated malignancies is no different than the&#xD;
      treatment approach to the same tumors where there is no viral association. Yet, the presence&#xD;
      of virus within these tumors offers an opportunity to develop virus-specific, targeted&#xD;
      therapies in these diseases. Such therapies might not only be more effective but also less&#xD;
      toxic. EBV- and KSHV-associated cancers are more common in patients with HIV, congenital&#xD;
      immunodeficiencies, or other immunosuppression, such as transplant recipients. These patients&#xD;
      in particular would benefit from more targeted treatment approaches to their malignancies,&#xD;
      potentially sparing the toxicities of cytotoxic chemotherapy in an already immunocompromised&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation of lytic gene expression in virally-infected tumors may enhance tumor-specific&#xD;
      cell killing through multiple mechanisms. Importantly, the cytotoxic effects of antiviral&#xD;
      nucleoside analogues, such as acyclovir and its cogeners, depend on the activity of viral&#xD;
      kinases which are only expressed during lytic replication. Because EBV(+) or KSHV(+) tumors&#xD;
      are characterized by latent viral infection, these antiviral drugs as a single agent are not&#xD;
      active in these tumors. However, if lytic gene expression could be activated in&#xD;
      virally-associated tumors, this could render EBV(+) and KSHV(+) tumor cells susceptible to&#xD;
      killing by antiviral nucleoside analogues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nelfinavir (NFV), an FDA-approved protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, has been shown&#xD;
      to be a potent activator of lytic gene expression of EBV(+) and KSHV(+) cancer cell lines.&#xD;
      Furthermore, NFV is able to activate lytic gene expression of EBV and KSHV at drug levels&#xD;
      that are achievable in humans. There is also growing evidence that NFV has antitumor&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study is to determine if NFV activates lytic gene expression in the tumors&#xD;
      and causes tumor regression in patients with EBV(+) or KSHV(+) cancers.&#xD;
