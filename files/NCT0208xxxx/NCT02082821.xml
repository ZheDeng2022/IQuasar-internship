    <textblock>
      Heart transplantation (HT) is a lifesaving procedure for patients with end-stage heart&#xD;
      failure and provides a better survival and quality of life if compared to medical treatment.&#xD;
      HT is subject to alloimmune response, which, if left uncontrolled, is capable of jeopardizing&#xD;
      long-term cardiac function. Advances in immunosuppression have enhanced the survival of HT&#xD;
      patients. Nearly 2500 HT per year have been performed in the US during the last 10 years and&#xD;
      despite significant improvements, long-term survival rates remain poor. More than 20% of&#xD;
      patients do not survive more than 3 years, and those who survive are afflicted by long-term&#xD;
      complications of alloimmunity and chronic immunosuppression. Life expectancy of patients who&#xD;
      lose cardiac allografts is dramatically poor due to the absence of any therapeutic tool apart&#xD;
      from re-transplantation, which is plagued by poor outcomes. The identification of novel&#xD;
      therapeutic targets is thus mandatory. ATP/P2X7R signaling in T cells is highly relevant for&#xD;
      cardiac allograft survival. ATP is a small molecule present at high concentrations inside&#xD;
      cells; it is released as extracellular ATP (eATP) following cell damage or death where it&#xD;
      acts as a danger signal. ATP is sensed by the P2X receptors (seven receptors named P2X1-7),&#xD;
      mainly expressed by T lymphocytes. We have recently demonstrated that the ATP/P2X7R axis has&#xD;
      a key role in cardiac allograft survival in humans and mice. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy&#xD;
      (CAV) is a major limiting factor for HT survival; indeed CAV occurs in 50% of HT recipients&#xD;
      by 5 years after transplantation and invariably results in allograft failure. CAV is clearly&#xD;
      of immunological origin, as syngeneic murine grafts do not develop it. Once CAV occurs, the&#xD;
      most definitive treatment is re-transplantation, but survival remains poor. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that a single nucleotide polymorphysm (SNP) loss-of-function P2X7R mutation (p.Glu496Ala /&#xD;
      c.1513A&gt;C, rs3751143) generates a compensatory upregulation of the other purinergic receptors&#xD;
      (P2XsR), thus creating a state of hypersensitivity to eATP. This eATP hypersensitivity&#xD;
      results in an abnormal generation of Th1/Th17 cells, that leads to CAV and early cardiac&#xD;
      allograft loss. Our study will answer a fundamental question: What is the effect of the P2X7R&#xD;
      loss-of-function mutation on the immune system? Our goal is to generate the first&#xD;
      targeted-therapy for a selected group of cardiac transplant recipients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart transplantation is a lifesaving procedure however, more then 20% of patients do not&#xD;
      survive beyond 3 years, being the cardiac allograft afflicted by cardiac allograft&#xD;
      vasculopathy (CAV), which results in allograft loss. The purine adenosine 5'-triphosphate&#xD;
      (ATP), released during cell damage/inflammation, is sensed by the ionotropic purinergic P2X7&#xD;
      receptor (P2X7R), which is expressed primarily, though not exclusively, on lymphocytes, thus&#xD;
      regulating T cell activation. Loss-of-function single nucleotide mutations (SNPs) have been&#xD;
      detected for P2X7R gene; particularly the Glu496 to Ala 1513A&gt;C (rs3751143) P2X7R&#xD;
      loss-of-function mutation is relatively common (1-3% of individuals are mutated omozygous and&#xD;
      25% are heterozygous). Our central hypothesis is that a loss-of-function P2X7R mutation&#xD;
      identifies a group of cardiac transplanted patients at high risk for CAV and cardiac&#xD;
      allograft loss because of a compensatory overexpression of P2X1R/P2X4R, which induces a&#xD;
      disregulation of T-bet/ROR-g, ultimately leading to the abnormal generation of Th1/Th17&#xD;
      cells. Our primary goal is to define the effect of the P2X7R loss-of-function mutation on&#xD;
      clinical end points in the CTOT-05 cohort of cardiac transplant recipients (200 patients) and&#xD;
      to explore the effects of the mutation on the immune system. Our preliminary data&#xD;
      demonstrated that P2X7R increases during cardiac transplant rejection in vivo in mice and in&#xD;
      humans and it is activated by ATP released by cardiac cells, thus triggering activation of&#xD;
      Th1/Th17 cells. However, while short-term disruption of the P2X7R pathway prolongs cardiac&#xD;
      allograft survival, the genetic deletion of P2X7R accelerates CAV and shortens cardiac&#xD;
      allograft survival. This was evident in P2X7R KO-B6 mice and in a group of cardiac transplant&#xD;
      recipients bearing the P2X7R loss-of-function mutation. Based on our published results and&#xD;
      our novel observations, we have developed the following working hypothesis: P2X7R&#xD;
      loss-of-function mutation generates a compensatory overexpression of the other ionotropic&#xD;
      purinergic receptors (P2X1/P2X4) with chronic delivery of ATP immunity, hyperactivation&#xD;
      T-bet/ROR-g, abnormal generation of Th1/Th17 cells and ultimately leading to accelerated CAV&#xD;
      and to cardiac allograft loss. To test this hypothesis, we will follow two main paths: i) we&#xD;
      will evaluate in the CTOT-05 cohort of cardiac transplant recipients the effect of the Glu496&#xD;
      to Ala 1513A&gt;C (rs3751143) P2X7R loss-of-function mutation on clinical end points&#xD;
      (development of coronary artery vasculopathy, death, re-transplantation or re-listed for&#xD;
      transplantation, any rejection) in the first year post transplant; ii) we will explore in&#xD;
      vivo and ex vivo in the CTOT-05 cohort of cardiac transplant recipients the effects of P2X7R&#xD;
      loss-of-function mutation on the immune system.&#xD;
