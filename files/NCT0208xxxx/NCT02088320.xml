  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of the present study is to further develop an echocardiographic technique to&#xD;
      measure cardiopulmonary transit time (PTT) and pulmonary blood volume (PBV) using ultrasound&#xD;
      contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims for the present study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare echocardiography-based PTTs and cardiac MRI-based PTTs obtained using a&#xD;
           'peak-to-peak' method&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To further quantify the relationship between echocardiographically-derived PTT, using&#xD;
           Optison, and existing echocardiographic methods used to determine ventricular function&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To measure the reproducibility of echocardiographically-based PTT using Optison.&#xD;

      Study Procedures The measurement of PTT and PBV has been described in detail in our prior&#xD;
      protocol. These calculations and techniques are identical for the current study. In addition,&#xD;
      we may place additional regions of interest (ROIs) during the off-line analysis, but this&#xD;
      step would not influence the data acquisition during the TEE or the TEE procedure itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that placement of a peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter is standard-of-care for&#xD;
      patients undergoing a TEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition and Analysis of Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is the anticipated flow of data acquisition and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to or upon arrival to the TEE Suite, prospective patients will be screened by&#xD;
           study personnel for informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After informed consent is obtained, the patient will undergo a focused TTE in the TEE&#xD;
           Holding Room prior to the TEE. One or two doses of echocardiographic contrast will be&#xD;
           administered to obtain PTT via TTE to facilitate comparison to PTT derived from TEE&#xD;
           (Specific Aim #3). Prior to ultrasound contrast administration, an agitated saline&#xD;
           injection will be given if intra-cardiac shunt is suggested by color Doppler evaluation.&#xD;
           If a shunt is present, contrast would not be administered and the patient would be&#xD;
           unenrolled from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During the TEE, under direct supervision of an attending cardiac anesthesiologist and/or&#xD;
           an attending cardiologist, up to 2 additional doses of echocardiographic contrast would&#xD;
           be administered. A sub-set of patients will receive 2 doses to facilitate comparison of&#xD;
           PTT obtained from different views (Specific Aim #2). This is analogous to our previous&#xD;
           protocol in which multiple doses of contrast are administered in order to assess&#xD;
           reproducibility of PTT measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. As part of standard-of-care, all patients that have completed a TEE are monitored in the&#xD;
           TEE Suite for at least 30 minutes including assessment of blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
           and oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies to be analyzed will be locked on the Echocardiography cart and the data will be&#xD;
      transmitted to a separate work-station for 'off-line' analysis using dedicated software. As a&#xD;
      back-up, the data will also be stored on DVDs, which will be stored under lock and key in the&#xD;
      PI or co-investigator's offices in VHVI. As described in our prior protocol, clinical and&#xD;
      echocardiographic data will be entered into a REDCap database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate that conducting the limited TTE prior to the scheduled TEE will take ~ 10-15&#xD;
      minutes. However, these steps can be carried out in the TEE Holding Room while another&#xD;
      patient is getting a TEE in the Procedure Room and should therefore not add procedural or&#xD;
      waiting time to the length of the scheduled TEE. If the first TEE patient of the day is&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, study personnel can perform the TTE portion as the Procedure Room is&#xD;
      being prepped for the TEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the TEE, administration of contrast in the manner described above is estimated to add&#xD;
      ~ 10-15 minutes to the duration of the procedure. This includes administration of the&#xD;
      contrast and, in the case of administering multiple doses, waiting for the initial contrast&#xD;
      injection to wash out, and then administering an additional dose.&#xD;
