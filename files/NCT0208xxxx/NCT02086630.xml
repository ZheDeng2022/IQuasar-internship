    <textblock>
      This study addresses racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS treatment. Many persons living&#xD;
      with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. (10-19% of PLHA), predominantly African-Americans and&#xD;
      Latinos, delay taking Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) until late in the course&#xD;
      of their HIV disease or never initiate HAART when it is medically indicated. However, there&#xD;
      are no behavioral interventions to increase HAART initiation among PLHA who delay or decline&#xD;
      HAART (&quot;PLHA-DD&quot;). The overarching aim of the proposed study is to develop a flexible,&#xD;
      targeted, and sustainable behavioral intervention to increase HAART initiation among PLHA-DD,&#xD;
      which, if efficacious, will lead to reductions in morbidity, early mortality, and health care&#xD;
      costs, as well as increased viral load suppression (reducing transmission to others).&#xD;
      Further, the study complements and primes participants for existing adherence interventions,&#xD;
      from which PLHA-DD can benefit when they initiate HAART.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This application seeks to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS treatment. National&#xD;
      studies have consistently shown that many persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. (an&#xD;
      estimated 10-19% of PLHA), predominantly people of color, delay taking Highly Active&#xD;
      Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) until late in their HIV disease or never initiate HAART when&#xD;
      it is medically necessary, even when engaged in care. This population is of critical&#xD;
      importance because they experience disproportionately higher morbidity and earlier mortality&#xD;
      compared to their peers on HAART, and higher health care costs. Further, they are less likely&#xD;
      to achieve virologic suppression, increasing the probability of HIV transmission to others.&#xD;
      However, we do not yet have a behavioral intervention to increase the timely initiation and&#xD;
      continued use of HAART for PLHA-DD. This proposal seeks to address a serious gap in existing&#xD;
      programs by creating a culturally targeted, sustainable, multi-level, and individualized&#xD;
      video-based behavioral intervention for the population of PLHA who are medically eligible for&#xD;
      HAART but who have delayed or declined HAART (referred to as &quot;PLHA-DD&quot;). This is not an&#xD;
      adherence intervention per se, but will serve as a complement to, and primer for, existing&#xD;
      adherence interventions, from which PLHA-DD can benefit when they initiate HAART. The&#xD;
      proposed study is innovative in that it seeks to broaden the HAART adherence research&#xD;
      paradigm to include HAART initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barriers to HAART initiation for PLHA-DD are multi-faceted. At the individual level, for&#xD;
      example, PLHA-DD suffer from negative attitudes toward HAART (particularly medical mistrust&#xD;
      and fear), a lack of accurate knowledge about HAART and health, and &quot;competing priorities,&quot;&#xD;
      including mental health problems and substance use. PLHA-DD also experience powerful social&#xD;
      barriers to HAART including negative peer norms regarding medications and stigma. Further,&#xD;
      structural barriers such as poor access to necessary resources and supports (e.g.,&#xD;
      transportation, paperwork) and ancillary services (e.g., mental health care) impede HAART&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will create a culturally targeted video-based intervention to increase motivation and&#xD;
      psychosocial and practical preparedness for HAART among PLHA-DD. The study is guided by two&#xD;
      complementary theoretical models: the Theory of Triadic Influence, a social-cognitive theory&#xD;
      that integrates individual, social, and structural influences on health behavior and the&#xD;
      Anti-racist Stance, which acknowledges the salience of barriers linked to racial/ethnic&#xD;
      minority status in the lives of PLHA-DD (associated with exclusion, stress, discrimination,&#xD;
      and poor access to institutional structures), without assuming homogeneity among PLHA-DD. The&#xD;
      intervention will be flexible and individualized: there will be a 12-week intervention period&#xD;
      during which participants will receive three structured sessions (including one with a&#xD;
      &quot;support partner&quot; to reduce social barriers, plus patient navigation, an efficacious&#xD;
      low-threshold and adaptable approach to reduce individual and structural barriers to&#xD;
      initiating and sustaining HAART. The intensity of navigation will depend on need, increasing&#xD;
      the intervention's efficiency. The sessions will consist of individualized interactive&#xD;
      components and targeted high-quality video components, which will enhance ease-of-use,&#xD;
      fidelity, and future sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this three-year project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore health care and social service providers' and PLHA-DD's perspectives on barriers&#xD;
           to/facilitators of initiation and continuation of HAART for PLHA-DD at the levels of&#xD;
           individuals, networks, organizations, and other structures;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop components of an intervention and examine their acceptability, safety,&#xD;
           feasibility, and gather preliminary evidence of their efficacy with respect to HAART&#xD;
           initiation and continuation among PLHA-DD medically eligible for HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a three phase study: (1) an Elicitation Phase to&#xD;
      explore barriers to HAART among PLHA-DD (n=16) and health care and social service providers&#xD;
      (N=18); (2) a Development Phase to create intervention components using Intervention Mapping,&#xD;
      a mechanism for integrating theoretical models, data, and the literature; and (3) an&#xD;
      Evaluation Phase to test and revise intervention components (N=30-50 PLHA-DD recruited from&#xD;
      two large urban HIV clinics and assigned to an intervention or control arm using permuted&#xD;
      blocks random assignment and interviewed at 3 time points).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also explore peer recruitment approaches to reaching PLHA-DD. PLHA recruited through&#xD;
      peers will be seen at a local field site but will engage in the same procedures as the&#xD;
      clinic-recruited cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll a total of 90-100 PLHA-DD, ideally half from clinics and half through peer&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urgent need to address disparities in HAART initiation and continuation and support&#xD;
      access to HAART for vulnerable populations has been identified by numerous scientific and&#xD;
      community leaders, health care providers, and public health officials. Although PLHA-DD are a&#xD;
      modest proportion of the population of PLHA (10-19%), efficacious interventions to reduce&#xD;
      morbidity, increase longevity, increase viral load suppression, and reduce health care costs&#xD;
      associated with delayed HAART initiation are sorely lacking for this group, and have very&#xD;
      high potential public health significance.&#xD;
