      The purpose of this study is to better understand how sleep apnea, a common sleep disorder in&#xD;
      which a person has one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while sleeping, may&#xD;
      affect pregnancy and to determine the effect of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), a&#xD;
      treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep the airways open during sleep, for pregnant&#xD;
      women with sleep apnea.&#xD;

      Emerging data support a link between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes, particularly preeclampsia. Furthermore, SDB, which is characterized by intermittent&#xD;
      nocturnal hypoxia-reoxygenation as well as sleep disruption, results in endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and metabolic dysregulation, the same biological pathways that have been&#xD;
      associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for both&#xD;
      adverse pregnancy outcomes and SDB, and has been associated with the same aforementioned&#xD;
      biological aberrations. Therefore, obesity complicates the definition of a causal&#xD;
      relationship between SDB and pregnancy outcomes. While some classic cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors (prehypertension) are certainly relevant in pregnancy, there are also&#xD;
      well-established risk factors that are unique to pregnancy (uterine vascular stiffness,&#xD;
      placental angiogenic factors). The interplay between SDB, obesity and these unique&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors remains undefined, and this proposal aims to address this&#xD;
      knowledge gap. Without this data, our ability to understand how we can mitigate these risks&#xD;
      through the use of therapeutic interventions for SDB, such as CPAP (continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure), is compromised. To further address this knowledge gap, we will make use of&#xD;
      the placenta's ability to accumulate evidence of damage over time and provide a record of&#xD;
      maternal vascular health throughout gestation. Numerous placental lesions deriving from&#xD;
      maternal vascular disease have been identified and can be readily detected on placental&#xD;
      pathology. These lesions can provide a measure of the severity of hypoxic stress experienced&#xD;
      by the fetus during gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' central hypothesis is that SDB is an effect modifier that increases&#xD;
      maternal cardiovascular risk and placental hypoxic injury in obese pregnant women, and that&#xD;
      CPAP treatment during pregnancy will result in an improved cardiovascular risk and placental&#xD;
      profile. To test this hypothesis the investigaotrs will identify a cohort of obese women both&#xD;
      with and without SDB. The investigators will examine SDB's impact on maternal vascular&#xD;
      stiffness (uterine artery Doppler), angiogenesis (pregnancy specific angiogenic factors e.g.,&#xD;
      sFLT-1) and metabolism (insulin resistance) across pregnancy (Aim 1). The investigators will&#xD;
      perform a randomized controlled trial of autotitrating- CPAP verses sham-CPAP in pregnancy to&#xD;
      examine the impact of CPAP treatment during pregnancy on cardiovascular risk (Aim 2) and will&#xD;
      explore the interplay between SDB, CPAP and evidence of maternal vascular disease and chronic&#xD;
      fetal hypoxia by evaluating the placental profile of obese women with and without SDB (Aim&#xD;
      3).&#xD;

    <description>CPAP is a device that has a mask worn over the nose that is attached to a device that provides positive airway pressure. CPAP is worn while sleeping, it splints open the airway and prevents apneas (cessation of breathing) and hypopneas (reduced airflow while breathing).</description>
