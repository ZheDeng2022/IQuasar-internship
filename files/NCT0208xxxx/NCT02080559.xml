      This randomised, open-label, single-centre, descriptive study aims to investigate gene&#xD;
      expression (i.e what genes are 'switched on' and 'off') following vaccination with 4CMenB and&#xD;
      to relate this to vaccine reactions and to immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 healthy Caucasian infants aged 8-12 weeks (at time of first visit) who have not yet&#xD;
      received their routine infant immunisations will be recruited. Participation in the study&#xD;
      will be limited to to Caucasian infants (defined as having two Caucasian parents). This is so&#xD;
      that baseline variability in gene expression data which is to some degree affected by&#xD;
      ethnicity is reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised to either a 'test' group or 'control' group depending on what&#xD;
      4CMenB schedule they receive, with 80 infants in each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the usual paediatric immunisations according to the UK national&#xD;
      immunisation schedule. In addition, participants in the test groups will receive 4CMenB at 2,&#xD;
      4 and at 12 months while those in the control groups will receive the same vaccine at 5, 7&#xD;
      and 13 months. Blood samples will be taken from each infant at specified time points before&#xD;
      and after vaccination to address the objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, oro-pharyneal swabs will be obtained around different vaccination timepoints to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of 4CMenB vaccination on the oro-pharyngeal Neisseria microbiome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of meningococcal disease is 0.2-14 per 100,000 in industrialized countries. In&#xD;
      England and Wales, during the period 2005-2010, there were 900-1300 cases annually. Disease&#xD;
      is commonest in infants, young children and adolescents and case fatality is high at 8-10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently there were no licensed vaccines against serogroup B meningococcal disease,&#xD;
      although vaccines against epidemic strains of MenB have been used in several countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, 4CMenB is associated with significant reactogenicity. This is presumably&#xD;
      related to the presence of various bacterial surface components present in the outer membrane&#xD;
      vessicles (OMVs), including lipopolysacchride (LPS), which are capable of activating the&#xD;
      innate immune response. The host pathways responsible for reactogenicity to OMV vaccines, and&#xD;
      indeed to other vaccines, are not yet established, and the relationship between&#xD;
      reactogenicity and immunogenicity is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide information about pathways and mechanisms of immunity and may&#xD;
      identify gene expression signals which can be used in future vaccine design and evaluation.&#xD;
