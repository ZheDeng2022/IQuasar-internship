      The potential effect of indigo naturalis on the immune system is unknown. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the therapeutic effect of indigo naturalis in psoriasis may involve&#xD;
      inhibiting the activation of Th1 and Th17 cells that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      thereby regulating the hyperplasia of epidermis induced by Th1/Th17 related cytokines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis induced by altered interactions between the&#xD;
      immune system and skin and characterized by hyperplasia of the epidermis (acanthosis),&#xD;
      infiltration of leukocytes into both the dermis and epidermis, and dilation and growth of&#xD;
      blood vessels. Our previous studies have shown that topical application of indigo naturalis&#xD;
      significantly improves psoriatic symptoms and demonstrated that the anti-psoriatic effects of&#xD;
      indigo naturalis are mediated by promoting differentiation and inhibiting proliferation of&#xD;
      epidermal keratinocytes. However, the potential effect of indigo naturalis on the immune&#xD;
      system is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, growing evidence demonstrates that activated T cells are the primary modulators in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of psoriasis and psoriasis is believed to be a mixed Th1/Th17 disease with&#xD;
      strong IL-17 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signatures. The identification of elevated levels of&#xD;
      IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), IL-12, IL-17 and IL 22 in cutaneous lesions and in the&#xD;
      serum of psoriatic patients supports the theory that these Th1/Th17-related cytokines&#xD;
      directly or indirectly act on keratinocytes leading to their activation and&#xD;
      hyperproliferation. The investigators suppose the therapeutic effect of indigo naturalis in&#xD;
      psoriasis may involve inhibiting the activation of Th1 and Th17 cells that produce&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby regulating the hyperplasia of epidermis induced by&#xD;
      Th1/Th17 related cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether the effect of indigo naturalis in improving psoriatic symptoms is&#xD;
           associated with the function of Th1/Th17 cells expressing IFN-γ and IL-17 in peripheral&#xD;
           blood of patients with psoriasis before and after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether the effect of indigo naturalis in improving psoriatic symptoms is&#xD;
           associated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood of&#xD;
           patients with psoriasis before and after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether the effect of indigo naturalis in improving psoriatic symptoms is&#xD;
           associated with histopathological change in psoriatic lesions and whether these&#xD;
           pathological changes are different from the change in inflammatory and immune reactions&#xD;
           in patients with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate the effects of Th1/Th17-related cytokines and immunological factors in&#xD;
           patients with indigo naturalis treatment on epidermal keratinocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To detect the effect of indigo naturalis on the function of releasing cytokines (IFN-γ,&#xD;
           IL-17, and IL-23, etc.) from monocytes in patients with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To analyze the concentration of indirubin in peripheral blood and to clarify whether the&#xD;
           effect of indigo naturalis in improving psoriatic symptoms is: (A) a systemic effect&#xD;
           that affects the metabolism and immune system through absorption and transdermal&#xD;
           delivery into body. (B) a direct effect on the epidermal keratinocytes alone.&#xD;
