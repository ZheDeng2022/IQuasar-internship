  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study (the hypothesis) is to identify differences in the gene expression&#xD;
      profile in the bladder muscle and hereby gain greater knowledge about the muscular mechanisms&#xD;
      that cause overactive bladder and daytime urinary incontinence in children older than 5&#xD;
      years. A secondary aim is to examine how this gene expression profile differs from children&#xD;
      with a neurogenic overactive bladder and how the gene expression profile changes from&#xD;
      childhood till adulthood. Such new knowledge will result in a more precisely targeted and&#xD;
      hence effective treatment of overactive bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be obtained by retrieving bladder biopsies from children and adults&#xD;
      suffering from an overactive bladder or a neurogenic bladder. These biopsies will undergo&#xD;
      molecular analysis and the investigators will compare them with biopises from bladder healthy&#xD;
      adults and children.&#xD;

    <description>We will evaluate the gene expression (which genes are up- and/or down regulated) in the bladder in healthy children compared to children suffering from an overactive bladder. This gene expression will then be compared to the gene expression in bladder tissue from adults, to evaluate what happens in the bladder from childhood to adulthood.</description>

&#xD;
          -  patients must have filled out 48-hour bladder diaries&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a minimum of 4 micturitions per day (assessed from the bladder diaries)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  functional daytime urinary incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  overactive bladder as defined by urgency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  no signs of neurogenic bladder dysfunction on invasive urodynamics&#xD;
&#xD;

             the informed consent the parents /legal guardian have given permission to the&#xD;
             authorities (The Danish Ethical Committee), so that they may get information about the&#xD;
             child during monitoring and quality inspection visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
