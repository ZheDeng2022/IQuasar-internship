  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe and compare the different types of diabetes that&#xD;
      exist in people from white European and south Asian origin in the UK (United Kingdom) who are&#xD;
      diagnosed with diabetes before they turn 30 years old. By doing this we hope to identify&#xD;
      cases of MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young), which is a rare genetic cause of&#xD;
      diabetes that is frequently misdiagnosed. Identifying MODY cases is important, as the&#xD;
      treatment may differ to conventional treatment for type 1 or type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

      People who meet the recruitment criteria, will be invited to attend for a single fasted 2&#xD;
      hour visit at our research facility. During the visit we will record details of their&#xD;
      diabetes history as well as their general health and undertake blood and urine tests. At the&#xD;
      end of the visit their participation will be complete. We will contact them later to discuss&#xD;
      results of specialist blood tests and whether or not they have MODY, if they have had genetic&#xD;
      testing performed.&#xD;

      We will be collecting blood and urine samples for routine diabetes tests as well as more&#xD;
      specialist tests that will help define what type of diabetes is present. We'll also collect&#xD;
      DNA to look for MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young), the genetic cause of diabetes,&#xD;
      in some people.&#xD;
