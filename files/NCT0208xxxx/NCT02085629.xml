      To collect evidence of the safety of administering donor-derived regulatory macrophage (M&#xD;
      reg) preparations to living-donor renal transplant recipients in the context of an&#xD;
      international European Union funded consortium aimed at evaluating cellular immunotherapy in&#xD;
      solid organ transplantation (The ONE Study). It is anticipated that immune regulation induced&#xD;
      by M reg therapy can eventually be used to reduce the need for conventional immunosuppression&#xD;
      in transplant recipients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decades of immunosuppressive drug development has produced an array of powerful&#xD;
      pharmacological agents, but the various drawbacks associated with these treatments leaves&#xD;
      considerable room for improvement. By harnessing the power of suppressive mechanisms in the&#xD;
      human immune system, regulatory cell therapy may be able to support peripheral tolerance and&#xD;
      induce a level of donor-specific unresponsiveness that allows for a reduction in the use of&#xD;
      conventional immunosuppression in organ transplant recipients. Several alternative regulatory&#xD;
      cell types have been identified as potential adjunct immunotherapies for solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation and are now approaching a stage of development that would allow clinical&#xD;
      testing in an early-stage trial. The EU-funded international ONE Study consortium aims to&#xD;
      answer the question as to whether M reg treatment, or other immunoregulatory cell-based&#xD;
      therapies, can be advanced in the clinical management of solid organ transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This particular M reg trial aims to explore the potential of M reg therapy as an adjunct&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment in living-donor renal transplant recipients through a clinical&#xD;
      protocol design shared by other investigators in The ONE Study group testing additional&#xD;
      regulatory cell therapies in separate trials.&#xD;
