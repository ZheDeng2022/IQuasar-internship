  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial of LDE225 for the treatment of steroid-refractory chronic Graft&#xD;
      Versus Host Disease (GVHD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial will enroll participants with steroid-refractory chronic GVHD,&#xD;
      and likely take approximately 24 months to complete accrual. Treatment will consist of LDE225&#xD;
      given daily for continuous dosing in 28-day cycles. Participants will have undergone&#xD;
      allogeneic SCT and have developed chronic GVHD which has not responded sufficiently to&#xD;
      systemic corticosteroids (dose of at least 0.25 mg/kg/day of ideal body weight), have&#xD;
      relapsed disease while tapering steroids, or not having an adequate response to steroids plus&#xD;
      other therapies. Participants who are responding will then be eligible to receive additional&#xD;
      courses of therapy. Participants will be followed on trial for 12 months after starting&#xD;
      therapy and the trial will be completed when all participants have reached 12 months of&#xD;
      follow-up or have withdrawn from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose escalation phase of 4 cohorts of participants (each cohort 3-6 participants)&#xD;
      will have a primary endpoint of safety and toxicity of administering LDE225 in this setting.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients eligible for inclusion in this study have to meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must provide written informed consent prior to any screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after either&#xD;
             myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning regimens. Any donor source of stem&#xD;
             cells is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be at least 100 days after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have steroid refractory classic cutaneous, myofascial, or&#xD;
             sclerodermatous cGVHD (+/- other organ involvement, clinically diagnosed), defined as&#xD;
             having persistent signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD despite the use of prednisone at&#xD;
             ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) for at least 4 weeks in the preceding&#xD;
             12 months (or equivalent dosing of alternate corticosteroids) without complete&#xD;
             resolution of signs and symptoms or if not improving on any line of therapy beyond&#xD;
             steroids or if treating physician feels that increasing or adding steroids is not in&#xD;
             the patient's best interests. Note that the dose of systemic steroids can certainly be&#xD;
             lower than 0.25 mg/kg/day at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable dose of corticosteroids for 4 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No addition or subtraction of other immunosuppressive medications (e.g., calcineurin&#xD;
             inhibitors, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil) for 4 weeks prior to enrollment. The&#xD;
             dose of immunosuppressive medicines may be adjusted based on the therapeutic range of&#xD;
             that drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum Cr ≤ 2 gm / dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl, AST &lt; 5x ULN), unless hepatic&#xD;
             dysfunction is a manifestation of cGVHD. For patients in whom a diagnosis of hemolysis&#xD;
             or Gilbert's is made, the total bilirubin is allowed to be elevated. For patients with&#xD;
             abnormal LFTs above the thresholds, documented cGVHD on liver biopsy will be required&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function as defined by ANC ≥ 1000 / µl and&#xD;
             platelets ≥ 20,000 / µl without growth factor or transfusional support&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasma creatine phosphokinase (CK) &lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is able to swallow and retain oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had major surgery within 4 weeks of initiation of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with concurrent uncontrolled medical conditions that may interfere with their&#xD;
             participation in the study or potentially affect the interpretation of the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to take oral drugs or with lack of physical integrity of the upper&#xD;
             gastrointestinal tract or known malabsorption syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously been treated with systemic LDE225 or with other Hh&#xD;
             pathway inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have neuromuscular disorders (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular&#xD;
                  dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy) or are on&#xD;
                  concomitant treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis,&#xD;
                  such as HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and gemfibrozil, and that cannot&#xD;
                  be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting LDE225 treatment. If it is&#xD;
                  essential that the patient stays on a statin to control hyperlipidemia, only&#xD;
                  pravastatin may be used with extra caution.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who are planning on embarking on a new strenuous exercise regimen after&#xD;
                  initiation of study treatment. NB: Muscular activities, such as strenuous&#xD;
                  exercise, that can result in significant increases in plasma CK levels should be&#xD;
                  avoided whilst on LDE225 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have taken part in an experimental drug study within 4 weeks or 5&#xD;
             half-lives, whichever is longer, of initiating treatment with LDE225.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving other anti-neoplastic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, targeted&#xD;
             therapy or radiotherapy) concurrently or within 2 weeks of starting treatment with&#xD;
             LDE225.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have a narrow&#xD;
             therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with&#xD;
             LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at&#xD;
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting&#xD;
             treatment with LDE225. Note that patients who require antifungal prophylaxis are&#xD;
             preferred to be on fluconazole, and, patients taking voriconazole or posaconazole who&#xD;
             must continue are excluded from the dose escalation phase of the study. Once the MTD&#xD;
             is established, patients taking voriconazole or posaconazole will be allowed to enroll&#xD;
             but at a dose adjustment to be determined before the expansion phase opens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing prednisone requirement &gt; 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to any new immunosuppressive medication in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECP therapy within 4 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active disease relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active, uncontrolled infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant heart disease, including any one&#xD;
             of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Angina pectoris within 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute myocardial infarction within 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  QTc &gt; 450 msec for males and &gt; 470 msec for females on the screening ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family&#xD;
                  history of prolonged QT-interval syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g. congestive heart failure,&#xD;
                  uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor&#xD;
                  adherence with an antihypertensive regimen)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a&#xD;
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a&#xD;
             positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not willing to apply highly effective contraception during the study&#xD;
             and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and&#xD;
                  through 6 months after the final dose of study treatment. Highly effective&#xD;
                  contraception is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sterilization: Patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of&#xD;
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study patients, the&#xD;
                  vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient]&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use a combination of the following (both a+b):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non-hormonal&#xD;
                       intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Barrier method of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are&#xD;
                       not allowed to count as contraception as it cannot be ruled out that the&#xD;
                       study drug decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraception. Patients&#xD;
                       are able to continue taking oral contraceptives if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: Woman are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing&#xD;
                       potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea&#xD;
                       with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of&#xD;
                       vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH&#xD;
                       levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
                       oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the&#xD;
                       case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman&#xD;
                       has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered&#xD;
                       not of child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patient must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception&#xD;
                  (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and&#xD;
                  continue using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months&#xD;
                  following the study drug. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized&#xD;
                  men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent&#xD;
                  delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexually active males who are unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while&#xD;
                  taking the study drug and for 6 months after stopping investigational medications&#xD;
                  and agree not to father a child in this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
