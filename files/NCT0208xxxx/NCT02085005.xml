      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: To assess the progression-free survival rate at 10 months in patients on&#xD;
      maintenance therapy with capecitabine plus aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy: Progression Free Survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy: Overall Survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy: Objective Response Rate (ORR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid&#xD;
           Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health related Quality of Life (HRQL): EORTC QLQ-C30 scores and EQ5D-3L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      To collect blood and tumor samples to perform investigations for potential biomarker testing.&#xD;

      Total study duration for a participant can be up to 28 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is being conducted in countries where the INN designation for the study molecule&#xD;
      is &quot;aflibercept&quot; and this term is therefore used throughout the synopsis. In the US, the US&#xD;
      proper name is &quot;ziv-aflibercept&quot;.&#xD;
