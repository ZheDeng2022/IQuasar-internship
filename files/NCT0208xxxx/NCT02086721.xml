  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The formation of metastasis is responsible for as much as 90% of cancer-associated mortality.&#xD;
      In spite of recent advances in oncologic therapy, approximately 50 % of the lung cancer&#xD;
      patients have already overt disseminated cancer at diagnosis. Additionally, numerous patients&#xD;
      with locoregional disease initially treated with curative intent develop (oligo)metastases&#xD;
      during the course of disease. In both instances, these stage IV patients are generally&#xD;
      considered to be incurable and mostly treated palliatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oligometastases, defined as 1-5 sites of active disease on whole body imaging, was coined to&#xD;
      refer to isolated sites of metastasis resembling limited tumor metastatic capacity. The&#xD;
      implication of this concept is that local cancer treatments are curative in a proportion of&#xD;
      patients with metastases and that incorporating local therapy is a conceptually attractive&#xD;
      approach. In several, but not all, academic centers the standard treatment of patients with&#xD;
      oligometastases in good general health is standard chemotherapy followed by surgery or by&#xD;
      Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) with radical dose on the macroscopic visible&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The widespread introduction of SABR and of minimally invasive surgery has fuelled research in&#xD;
      treating patients with oligometastases. Indeed, local control of metastases can be obtained&#xD;
      in virtually all parts of the body with a low proportion of patients experiencing severe side&#xD;
      effects. In the few prospective studies published to date, approximately 20% of patients&#xD;
      remained free of recurrence several years after treatment when all sites of disease were&#xD;
      targeted by radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with standard anti-cancer therapeutic modalities like chemotherapy and radiotherapy&#xD;
      (RT), immunotherapy has recently gained a lot of attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, and therefore, considerable efforts have been&#xD;
      made to exploit this unique target for selective drug delivery. One of the appealing targets&#xD;
      for both approaches is the splice variant of fibronectin containing extra domain B (EDB),&#xD;
      which is abundantly expressed in vascular endothelial cells of a variety of primary tumors as&#xD;
      well as metastases , but virtually absent in normal tissues. Recently, a human recombinant&#xD;
      scFv fragment directed against EDB, designated L19, was developed and subsequently combined&#xD;
      with the pro-inflammatory interleukin-2 (IL2), resulting in the immunocytokine L19-IL2.&#xD;
      L19-IL2 delivers high doses of IL2 to the (metastatic) tumor site(s) exploiting the selective&#xD;
      expression of EDB on newly formed blood vessels. Interleukin-2 (IL2) plays an essential role&#xD;
      in the activation phases of both specific and natural immune responses. Even though it has no&#xD;
      direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, it can induce tumor regression by stimulating a&#xD;
      potent cell-mediated response. In summary, L19-IL2 is an immunocytokine which will stimulate&#xD;
      immune response specifically in tumors with angiogenesis and tissue remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy is a particularly interesting partner for immunotherapy, since it can be&#xD;
      harnessed to specifically modify the immunogenicity of the primary tumors and their&#xD;
      microenvironment, in the attempt to generate an in situ immunization of the host against a&#xD;
      patient's own cancer. Our hypothesis is that three independent therapeutic approaches will&#xD;
      synergize to improve dramatically survival in patients with oligometastases of solid tumors.&#xD;

      1. Tumor vasculature Profound differences exist between vascular endothelium and&#xD;
           surrounding stroma of normal tissues and tumors. Tumor vasculature is extremely&#xD;
           disorganized and tortuous. Vascular shunts are frequent, and distinguishing arterioles&#xD;
           from venules can be challenging. Apart from the architecture, the blood flow itself is&#xD;
           strikingly altered: it can be sluggish, sometimes stationary or even reverse. The&#xD;
           endothelium in tumors proliferates rapidly and contributes to active angiogenesis. The&#xD;
           direct contact of the tumor endothelium with the host's blood pool makes this site a&#xD;
           unique target for selective drug delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. L19 Fibronectin (FN) is a broadly present soluble constituent of plasma and other body&#xD;
           fluids. FN usually exists as a dimer formed by two nearly identical (approximately 250&#xD;
           kDa) subunits covalently linked near their C-terminus by a pair of disulfide bonds. Even&#xD;
           though FN molecules are the product of a single gene, the resulting protein can exist in&#xD;
           multiple forms that arise from alternative spicing of pre-mRNA that can generate up to&#xD;
           20 variants in humans. Splicing occurs in 3 regions of the FN gene, leading to inclusion&#xD;
           or exclusion of either one of the two type III repeats, named EDB and EDA. The 91 amino&#xD;
           acid sequence of EDB is identical in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and humans.&#xD;
           EDB-containing FN is dispensable during embryogenesis, but is thought to play a&#xD;
           modulating role in the growth of connective tissues. In adults, EDB-FN is highly&#xD;
           expressed in normal tissues during angiogenesis, but not in mature vessels. Furthermore,&#xD;
           EDB-containing FN is abundantly found in solid tumors. It is mainly produced by tumor&#xD;
           cells and deposited in the subendothelial extracellular matrix of solid tumors and&#xD;
           hematological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           L19 is the single chain (scFv) human antibody that specifically targets EDB-FN. Antibody&#xD;
           fragments in small scFv formats are useful and versatile tools with various advantages&#xD;
           including rapid blood clearance and easy manipulation for antibody engineering. The L19&#xD;
           antibody has been shown to recognize and target EDB-FN in vivo both in animal models and&#xD;
           patients. In past years, the L19 antibody has been conjugated with numerous agents,&#xD;
           including therapeutic radionuclides, and cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interleukin-2 Cytokines are a heterogeneous group of soluble small polypeptides or&#xD;
           glycoproteins exerting pleiotropic or redundant effects promoting growth,&#xD;
           differentiation, and activation of normal cells. Cytokines produced by immune cells may&#xD;
           have pro- or anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activities. In malignant diseases,&#xD;
           cytokine production and release can be affected by the tumor itself and/or therapeutic&#xD;
           interventions. Cytokines may also display potent anticancer activities, but are&#xD;
           frequently hampered by treatment-related toxicities prohibiting dose-escalation to&#xD;
           therapeutically effective concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interleukin-2 (IL2) plays an essential role in the activation phases of both specific&#xD;
           and natural immune responses. Even though it has no direct cytotoxic effects on cancer&#xD;
           cells, it can induce tumor regression by stimulating a potent cell-mediated response. As&#xD;
           such, IL2 is one of the treatment options in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. L19-IL2 In order to overcome toxicity while simultaneously delivering therapeutic doses&#xD;
           of IL2 to the tumor issue, the elegant option of combining the anti-EDB scFv L19&#xD;
           antibody with IL2 was pursued. It has been shown that the L19-IL2 conjugate mediates the&#xD;
           selective delivery and accumulation of IL2 at tumor endothelial cells, where the EDB&#xD;
           antigen is expressed during angiogenesis, leading to a dramatic increase of the&#xD;
           therapeutic efficacy of IL2. In the first preclinical study, 80% of the xenograft tumors&#xD;
           (including teratocarcinoma and small cell lung cancer) tackled with L19-IL2 were&#xD;
           subsequently composed of connective and necrotic tissue. At the same time an increase in&#xD;
           the levels of interferon-gamma and of cytotoxic lymphocytes, macrophages and natural&#xD;
           killer cells was found. These histological and therapeutic effects were underlined in a&#xD;
           orthotopic pancreatic cancer model treated with the antibody-cytokine conjugate. One&#xD;
           year later, this response percentage was repeated in Ramos lymphoma xenografts treated&#xD;
           with L19-IL2 and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab whereby a complete remission lasting&#xD;
           for more than one year was found in 4 of the 5 mice treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent phase I/II clinical trial, the use of L19-IL2 was proven safe in a variety of&#xD;
      stage IV malignancies with a recommended dose of 22.5 Mio IU. Furthermore, it was safely&#xD;
      combined with dacarbazine in stage IV melanoma patients maintaining the same recommended dose&#xD;
      level. In the first study, the overall objective response rate was reported to be 51% after&#xD;
      two cycles, and in the second this rate was 28% with one complete response still ongoing 21&#xD;
      months after treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, three phase I/II clinical trials on L19-IL2 alone or in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy for patients with metastatic melanoma (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers: NCT01055522&#xD;
      and NCT01253096) and pancreatic cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01198522) are ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details on SABR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescribed dose is risk adapted to the metastatic localization and closeness to organs at&#xD;
      risk (in accordance with local protocol of MAASTRO clinic). Patients will receive a dose&#xD;
      schedule of 1 x 30 Gy, 3 x 15-20 Gy; 5 x 12 Gy; 8 x 7.5 Gy; to the 80 % or 100 % isodose&#xD;
      which should encompass the periphery of the PTV as closely as possible. Maximum dose is not&#xD;
      restricted but volumes with a dose higher than 105% must be located within the gross tumor.&#xD;
      The minimum dose allowed is EQD2α/ẞ10 =60 Gy, an ablative dose with EQD2iso=≥ 87.5Gy10 should&#xD;
      always be the objective. Treatment will be delivered with intensity modulated arcs&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step -1: Assessment of the toxicity of 10 Mio IU of L19-IL2 (n=3-6); this step is only chosen&#xD;
      when dose-limiting toxicity occurs in Step 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of 10 Mio IU of L19-IL2 given on day 1, 3 and 5 of each 21-day cycle (max. 6&#xD;
      cycles) via i.v. bolus injection starting within one week after completion of SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be scored at every intravenous (i.v.) drug administration and on day 7, 14 and&#xD;
      21 of the cycle, according to the CTCAE4.0 scoring system. Hematology, liver and kidney&#xD;
      function will be controlled on day 1, 3, and 5 prior to L19-IL2 administration, and on day 7,&#xD;
      14 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When in 0/3 patients a toxicity of grade 2 or more has occurred step 1 is considered safe. If&#xD;
      in 1/3 or more patients a grade 2 or more toxicity has occurred, 3 more patients will be&#xD;
      included in this step. If another grade 2 or more toxicity occurs in 1/3 or more patients,&#xD;
      the study will be stopped. When at maximum 1/6 patients experience grade 2 toxicity, this&#xD;
      step will be considered safe. When step 1 is considered safe, step 2 will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Assessment of the toxicity of 15 Mio IU of L19-IL2 (n=3-6) Administration of 15 Mio&#xD;
      IU of L19-IL2 given on day 1, 3 and 5 of each 21-day cycle (max. 6 cycles) via i.v. bolus&#xD;
      injection starting within one week after completion of SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be scored at every i.v. drug administration and on day 7, 14 and 21 of the&#xD;
      cycle, according to the CTCAE4.0 scoring system. Hematology, liver and kidney function will&#xD;
      be controlled on day 1, 3, and 5 prior to L19-IL2 administration, and on day 7, 14 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When in 0/3 patients a toxicity of grade 2 or more has occurred step 1 is considered safe. If&#xD;
      in 1/3 or more patients a grade 2 or more toxicity has occurred, 3 more patients will be&#xD;
      included in this step. If another grade 2 or more toxicity occurs in 1/3 or more patients,&#xD;
      the study will be stopped. When at maximum 1/6 patients experience grade 2 toxicity, this&#xD;
      step will be considered safe. When step 1 is considered safe, step 2 will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Assessment of the toxicity of 22.5 Mio IU of L19-IL2 (n=3-6) Administration of 22.5&#xD;
      Mio IU of L19-IL2 given on day 1, 3 and 5 of each 21-day cycle (max. 6 cycles) via i.v. bolus&#xD;
      injection starting within one week after completion of SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be scored at every i.v. drug administration and on day 7, 14 and 21 of the&#xD;
      cycle, according to the CTCAE4.0 scoring system. Hematology, liver and kidney function will&#xD;
      be controlled on day 1, 3, and 5 prior to L19-IL2 administration, and on day 7, 14 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When in 0/3 patients a toxicity of grade 2 or more has occurred step 1 is considered safe. If&#xD;
      in 1/3 or more patients a grade 2 or more toxicity has occurred, 3 more patients will be&#xD;
      included in this step. If another grade 2 or more toxicity occurs in 1/3 or more patients,&#xD;
      the study will be stopped. When at maximum 1/6 patients experience grade 2 toxicity, this&#xD;
      step will be considered safe. When step 1 is considered safe, step 2 will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Expansion cohort of the maximally tolerable dose (n=10) Administration of the&#xD;
      maximally tolerable dose of L19-IL2 given on day 1, 3 and 5 of each 21-day cycle (max. 6&#xD;
      cycles) via i.v. bolus injection starting within one week after completion of SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be scored at every i.v. drug administration and on day 7, 14 and 21 of the&#xD;
      cycle, according to the CTCAE4.0 scoring system. Hematology, liver and kidney function will&#xD;
      be controlled on day 1, 3, and 5 prior to L19-IL2 administration, and on day 7, 14 and 21.&#xD;
