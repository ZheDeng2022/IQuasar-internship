  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to develop and test a behavioral intervention&#xD;
      delivered by promotoras to help at-risk Latinas lose weight and prevent diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research is to compare two evidence-based strategies for preventing&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes - promotora-led lifestyle intervention and metformin - vs. usual care (UC)&#xD;
      among Latinas in a &quot;real world&quot; setting. The aims of this study are to 1) develop a&#xD;
      protocol-based, promotora-led lifestyle intervention (PLI) to promote weight loss in at-risk&#xD;
      Latinas, and assess its feasibility; 2) compare changes in weight and cardiometabolic&#xD;
      markers-hemoglobin A1C, fasting lipids, blood pressure-from baseline to 1 year between&#xD;
      at-risk Latinas randomly assigned to the PLI group versus metformin and usual care (UC)&#xD;
      groups; and 3) understand the social and cultural context surrounding weight-related&#xD;
      behaviors among Latinas at-risk for diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that Latinas&#xD;
      assigned to PLI and metformin will have greater weight loss (primary outcome) and greater&#xD;
      improvements in cardiometabolic markers from baseline to 1 year than those randomized to UC&#xD;

    <description>The Promotora-led Intervention consists of a core curriculum or 12 group sessions of 90 minute duration over a 12-week period and will be followed by a maintenance phase of 10 biweekly and then monthly 90-minute sessions during months 4 through 12. One promotora will lead each session in Spanish, exploring such topics as being active, low-fat diets, portion control, self monitoring, problem solving and life-style changes.</description>

            <title>Promotora-led Intervention</title>
            <description>The PLI consists of a core curriculum or 12 group sessions of 90 minute duration over a 12-week period and will be followed by a maintenance phase of 10 biweekly and then monthly 90-minute sessions during months 4 through 12. One promotora will lead each session in Spanish, exploring such topics as being active, low-fat diets, portion control, self monitoring, problem solving and life-style changes.&#xD;
Prometra led intervention: Behavioral life-style program lead by a team of trained community health workers (called promotoras) with 2 principal goals - encouraging participants to lose 7% of their total weight and complete 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was underpowered to detect a clinically meaningful weight difference between the metformin and standard care arms.&#xD;
This study was a community-based translation trial with fewer eligibility criteria than DPP, a less intensive screening process, and no run-in period.&#xD;
The study enrolled motivated study volunteers, potentially limiting the external validity of the findings among all Latinas with prediabetes.</limitations_and_caveats>
