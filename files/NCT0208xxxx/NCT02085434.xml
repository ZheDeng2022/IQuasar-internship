  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends a staged approach for pediatric practices&#xD;
      to manage the growing problem of pediatric overweight and obesity, starting with Stage 1,&#xD;
      Prevention Plus, which encourages families to improve basic lifestyle choices related to&#xD;
      eating and activity in order to improve BMI status. This study will test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      an innovative FITLINE telephone counseling program for overweight and obese 8-12 year olds&#xD;
      seen in pediatric practices where nutritionists coach parents in improving their child's diet&#xD;
      and physical activity, to reduce BMI. If found to be effective, the FITLINE program will&#xD;
      provide a model for widespread implementation of Stage 1, Prevention Plus of the AAP expert&#xD;
      committee recommendations through pediatric practices nationwide.&#xD;

      The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends a staged approach to the management of&#xD;
      pediatric overweight and obesity, starting with Stage 1, Prevention Plus, which encourages&#xD;
      families to improve lifestyle choices related to eating and activity in order to improve BMI&#xD;
      status. Most pediatric practices, however, have difficulty implementing these guidelines due&#xD;
      to limited time and access to weight loss experts to whom they can refer their patients and&#xD;
      families, and burden to families in accessing in-person weight loss services. In response,&#xD;
      The investigators team developed the FITLINE pediatric practice-based referral program that&#xD;
      provides practices an easily accessible resource to help families make AAP-recommended Stage&#xD;
      1 lifestyle changes. The program includes two components. The first, a pediatric&#xD;
      practice-based component, consists of systems to identify overweight and obese children ages&#xD;
      8-12, a brief pediatric provider-delivered intervention, referral to the FITLINE counseling&#xD;
      program, and feedback from the FITLINE nutritionist. The second, a parent support component,&#xD;
      consists of six weekly FITLINE counseling telephone calls delivered by centrally located&#xD;
      nutritionists who provide tailored, personalized coaching, along with a parent booklet to&#xD;
      guide parents in setting goals and working with their child to make Stage 1 lifestyle&#xD;
      changes. Providers receive a summary from the nutritionist of the progress made by families&#xD;
      so they may support maintenance of an improved lifestyle, or refer for additional&#xD;
      intervention. A nonrandomized intervention study with contemporaneous control was used.&#xD;
      Parents and their children ages 8-12 with BMI â‰¥85th percentile (N=40) were recruited from two&#xD;
      pediatric practices. Practices implemented systems to identify overweight/obese children,&#xD;
      prompt brief provider intervention, and refer parents to 6-weekly FITLINE telephone&#xD;
      counseling sessions with a nutritionist who guided parents in setting goals and helping their&#xD;
      child make American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)-recommended lifestyle changes. Child BMI and&#xD;
      parent survey of child diet and physical activity were completed at baseline and 3 months.&#xD;
      Medical record data from 44 children matched for age and BMI was collected.&#xD;
