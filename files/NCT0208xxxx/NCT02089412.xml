    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-dose, randomized crossover study of single oral 10-mg tablet&#xD;
      doses administered either after an overnight fast or in combination with a standard high-fat&#xD;
      meal in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase&#xD;
      will consist of 2 periods: Screening and Baseline (Baseline Period 1), during which each&#xD;
      subjectï¿½s study eligibility will be determined and baseline assessments will be conducted.&#xD;
      During this phase, each eligible subject will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences to&#xD;
      receive single oral doses of E2006 10 mg under fasted and fed conditions. The Randomization&#xD;
      Phase will consist of 3 periods: administration of the first randomized dose (Treatment&#xD;
      Period 1), baseline for the second randomized dose (Baseline Period 2), and administration of&#xD;
      the second randomized dose (Treatment Period 2).&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. All females must be of nonchildbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal women&#xD;
             (defined as at least 12 months consecutive amenorrhea, in the appropriate age group&#xD;
             and without other known or suspected cause) or subjects who have been sterilized&#xD;
             surgically or who are otherwise proven sterile (eg, bilateral tubal ligation with&#xD;
             surgery at least 6 months prior to dosing, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
             with surgery at least 2 months prior to dosing). In addition, females must have a&#xD;
             negative serum B-human chorionic gonadotropin test result at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Males who are not abstinent or have undergone a successful vasectomy, who are partners&#xD;
             of women of childbearing potential must use, or their partners must use a highly&#xD;
             effective method of contraception (eg, condom plus spermicide, condom plus diaphragm&#xD;
             with spermicide, intrauterine device starting at least 1 menstrual cycle prior to&#xD;
             starting study drug and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days [longer if&#xD;
             appropriate] after the last dose of study drug)&#xD;
