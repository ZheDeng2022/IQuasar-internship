  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is&#xD;
      effective in increasing level of (a) physical activity (PA) and (b) self-efficacy in patients&#xD;
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PR is an evidence-based multidisciplinary approach consisting primarily of a supervised&#xD;
      exercise program with educational components. It has demonstrated high efficacy in improving&#xD;
      dyspnoea, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and functional exercise capacity in patients&#xD;
      with COPD. Despite these improvements, there is no conclusive evidence that these benefits&#xD;
      translate to an increase in PA in patient's day-to-day life. This is of concern as low PA is&#xD;
      a predictor of all cause mortality, correlated with lower HRQoL, increased level of dyspnoea&#xD;
      and higher number of hospital admissions in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-efficacy is found to be an instigating force in forming intention to exercise and in&#xD;
      maintaining practice for an extended time. Self-efficacy may be the key in determining&#xD;
      whether a patient translates the improvement in exercise tolerance to actually being more&#xD;
      physically active. Based on current knowledge, there is insufficient evidence that&#xD;
      self-efficacy increases after pulmonary rehabilitation and no correlation has been made&#xD;
      between level of self-efficacy and level of PA in these group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence this study aims to find out whether the existing PR program increases level of PA and&#xD;
      self-efficacy. Correlation between level of PA and self-efficacy will be made.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The intervention group will consist of all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) referred to Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital (GSTT) pulmonary rehabilitation. A&#xD;
      sample of 30 is anticipated as this is the maximum number of patients who could be enrolled&#xD;
      in the 3 month recruitment period in Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient information sheet, together with the referral for PR, will be posted to the&#xD;
           patients. Patients will be informed about the study details in the patient information&#xD;
           sheet. This will include the fact that they have to wear an accelerometer for 5 to 7&#xD;
           days prior to starting the program. These accelerometers will be collected thereafter.&#xD;
           Instructions on the use of the accelerometers will be given. They will also be informed&#xD;
           that any personal information will strictly be kept confidential and that the results&#xD;
           will be used for analysis in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Written consent will be taken on initial assessment if patient agrees to participate in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Pulmonary Rehabilitation Adapted Index of Self-Efficacy (PRAISE) questionnaire will&#xD;
           be administered. It consists of 15 questions and will take less than 10 minutes to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The patient will undertake 14 sessions of PR under supervision to successfully complete&#xD;
           the program. The program is held at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The PRAISE questionnaire will be administered again after completion of the program.&#xD;
           Patients will be asked to wear the accelerometers again to track their physical&#xD;
           activity. After 5 to 7 days of use, the accelerometers will be collected either from&#xD;
           their address or via stamped postage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No changes will be made to the current pulmonary rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No control group is present in the study as pulmonary rehabilitation is the standard of care&#xD;
      and it is not ethical to withhold pulmonary rehabilitation from patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis would be that there is no difference in physical activity and&#xD;
      self-efficacy before and after pulmonary rehabilitation. The statistical test used will be a&#xD;
      paired sample t-test to determine the change in a) physical activity and b)self-efficacy&#xD;
      after pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation analysis will be made between self-efficacy and physical activity with a) Anxiety&#xD;
      and depression (Hospital anxiety and depression scale), b)Functional exercise capacity (6&#xD;
      minute walk test) and c) COPD Assessment test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Pearson or Spearman correlations will be done depending on whether or not the data is&#xD;
      normally distributed.&#xD;
