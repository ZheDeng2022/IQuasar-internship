    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to study the effect of adjunctive chronotherapy (wake therapy, sleep&#xD;
      phase advance, and bright light therapy) on acutely depressed inpatients. The investigators&#xD;
      will attempt to recruit individuals admitted to the acute inpatient unit and study the&#xD;
      results of the treatment on depressive symptoms, and suicidality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute depression, and suicidality continue to be significant causes of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, and frequently result in acute inpatient hospitalization. Currently available&#xD;
      treatments for depression have limitations for acute care including, either a slow onset of&#xD;
      action such as is the case of pharmacotherapy, or high cost and limited availability such as&#xD;
      is the case for ECT. This is exacerbated by ever shortening hospitalization times.&#xD;
      Subsequently many of the individuals who are admitted for depression are discharged weeks&#xD;
      before it can be expected for them to have symptomatic relief. Further more, in many cases&#xD;
      treatment results in the trial of multiple medications before an effective treatment regimen&#xD;
      is found (if such a treatment is found at all) (Rush, Trivedi et al. 2006). There is&#xD;
      subsequently a great need for effective anti-depressant therapies with rapid onset of action,&#xD;
      widespread availability, and cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a consistent and expanding body of literature showing that chronotherapy is an&#xD;
      effective, and rapid treatment of acute depression(Wu, Kelsoe et al. 2009, Martiny, Refsgaard&#xD;
      et al. 2012, Echizenya, Suda et al. 2013). Published studies report response and remission&#xD;
      rates in the range of 41-61%, 24-59% respectively acutely. Chronotherapy is a brief protocol&#xD;
      that involves the combination of wake therapy (total sleep deprivation), sleep phase advance&#xD;
      (a shift to an earlier sleep schedule with gradual normalization), and bright light therapy.&#xD;
      The currently published reports have demonstrated efficacy in both unipolar and bipolar&#xD;
      depression, and there has been reported stability of results for as long as 9 weeks (which&#xD;
      was the longest designed study). Studies have been completed in real world clinical&#xD;
      populations, which have included co-morbid populations, with the only groups showing a&#xD;
      worsening of effect being those with psychotic depression (Benedetti, Zanardi et al. 1999),&#xD;
      and those with panic disorder(Roy-Byrne, Uhde et al. 1986). The treatment itself has been&#xD;
      well tolerated with a high percentage of individuals completing the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current body of literature is encouraging, and the technique is being utilized clinically&#xD;
      in some facilities (including our own institution), however there are still relatively few&#xD;
      clinical trials published, and still unanswered questions that limit widespread clinical&#xD;
      utility. One such issue is related to the high percentage of published trials performed&#xD;
      outside of the US (although some have been done in the US). Because a high percentage of the&#xD;
      studies have been done in other countries it is not clear if this procedure will translate&#xD;
      well into the treatment paradigm in the US. Currently in the US, inpatient admission is&#xD;
      restricted to individuals with severe, often highly treatment resistant disease that includes&#xD;
      acute suicidality. To this writers knowledge there have not been any studies that&#xD;
      specifically address suicidality. It is also not clear if patients in the US will tolerate&#xD;
      the procedure. Tolerability has been addressed in many of the published papers, and in&#xD;
      general the procedure is tolerated well with few if any side effects, however, again it is&#xD;
      unclear how the procedure would be tolerated in clinical patients in the US.&#xD;
