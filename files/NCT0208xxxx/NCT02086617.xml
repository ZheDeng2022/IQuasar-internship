      The purpose of this study is to investigate prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA)&#xD;
      among male patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Secondary purpose is to document&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening of AAA in selected population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethiology of AAA is known to be common with atherosclerotic arterial diseases, and on the&#xD;
      basis of our previous studies (ClinicalTrials.gov ID CAD-AAA-02) the prevalence of AAA seems&#xD;
      to be higher in CAD population than unselected male population. This leads to hypothesis that&#xD;
      selective screening of these patients (for AAA) could be cost-efficient and life saving&#xD;
      option for detecting AAAs before rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will be carried out as a single-center prospective screening study. Patients will be&#xD;
      selected for this study on basis of their ICD 10 diagnose codes in North Carelian patient&#xD;
      information system. Inclusion criteria will be any kind of atherosclerotic heart disease&#xD;
      (ICD10 codes I20-I25). Criteria for exclusion are malignant disease, already diagnosed or&#xD;
      treated AAA and failure to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      800 patient records that meet the inclusion criteria will be reviewed for eligibility.&#xD;
      Invitations for screening will be sent for 600 patients with intention to have at least 400&#xD;
      patients screened. Screening will be done by verified sonographers in designated screening&#xD;
      appointments.&#xD;
