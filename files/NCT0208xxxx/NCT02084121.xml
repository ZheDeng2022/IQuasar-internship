        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorder / inborn&#xD;
             error of metabolism. Diagnosis should be confirmed by appropriate test(s) (enzyme&#xD;
             and/or mutation analysis) before study entry. Patients must not be eligible for&#xD;
             myeloablative chemotherapy as a preparative regimen for transplant due to age,&#xD;
             co-morbidities or organ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Inborn errors of metabolism / Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMD) eligible for this&#xD;
             Compassionate Use Provision include Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be ≥ 3 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have Lansky or Karnofsky performance status ≥40&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have adequate function of other organ systems as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl and creatinine clearance ≥60 cc/min/1.73m2. Newborns must&#xD;
                  have a creatinine clearance &gt; 25 cc/min. For babies &lt; 3 months of age, the raw&#xD;
                  value on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) must be &gt; 1 cc/kg/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic transaminases (ALT/AST) ≤4 x normal, bilirubin &lt;2.0mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Normal cardiac function by echocardiogram or radionuclide scan (ejection fraction&#xD;
                  or shortening fraction &gt;80% of normal value for age)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pulmonary function tests demonstrating forced expiratory volume at one second&#xD;
                  (FEV1) of &gt;50% of predicted for age. If child is too young for pulmonary function&#xD;
                  tests (PFTs), crying vital capacity result of &gt;50% of normal value for age or&#xD;
                  resting pulse oximeter &gt;85% on room air or clearance by pulmonologist will be&#xD;
                  required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must have a related donor [identical or mismatched for 1, 2 or 3&#xD;
             histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B or -DR loci].&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient, and parent, or legal guardian must have given written informed consent&#xD;
             according to FDA guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have a minimum life expectancy of at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patients of childbearing potential cannot be pregnant or&#xD;
             lactating/breast-feeding and must be either surgically sterile, postmenopausal (no&#xD;
             menses for the previous 12 months), or must be practicing an effective method of birth&#xD;
             control as determined by the investigator (e.g., oral contraceptives, double barrier&#xD;
             methods, hormonal injectable or implanted contraceptives, tubal ligation, or partner&#xD;
             with vasectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled seizures, apnea, evidence of recurrent or uncontrolled&#xD;
             aspiration, or need for chronic mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with allogeneic stem cell transplant with cytoreductive therapy in the past 6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have had previous radiation therapy that would preclude total body&#xD;
             irradiation (TBI) (as determined by radiation therapist)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled infection or severe concomitant diseases, which in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator, could not tolerate reduced intensity transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe impairment of functional performance as evidenced by a Karnofsky (patients &gt;16&#xD;
             years old) or Lansky (children &lt;16 years old) score &lt;40%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test result&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant, as indicated by a positive serum human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (HCG) test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects whose only donor is pregnant at the time of intended transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects of childbearing potential who are not practicing adequate contraception as&#xD;
             defined by the investigator at the site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Jehovah's witness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have any comorbid condition which, in the view of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigators, renders the patient at too high a risk from treatment complications and&#xD;
             regimen related morbidity/mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of related donors&#xD;
