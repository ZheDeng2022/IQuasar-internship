    <textblock>
      This prospective, consecutive enrolment, single-arm study will enroll up to 15 patients with&#xD;
      single de novo, Type A lesions &lt; 10 mm in length and located in a native coronary artery with&#xD;
      a reference vessel diameter of 2.75 mm - 3.0 mm as measured by both offline QCA and IVUS. All&#xD;
      patients will receive a 3.0 x 14mm DESolve Stent loaded with approximately 40 mcg of&#xD;
      Myolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) will be completed for all patients at&#xD;
           baseline and at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will will be completed for all patients at baseline&#xD;
           and at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) will be conducted on all patients enrolled at 12&#xD;
           and 24 months.&#xD;
