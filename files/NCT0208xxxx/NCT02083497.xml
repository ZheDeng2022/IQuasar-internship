  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most popular sport worldwide is football and there is, therefore , interest in detecting&#xD;
      factors that may interfere with their practice. These factors are already investigated in the&#xD;
      literature , in particular kick, gesture performed frequently , whereas in most situations is&#xD;
      through him that achieves the main goal: to score. For this particular effort is needed&#xD;
      balance to run it , and based on this body balance the ankle joint , responsible for the&#xD;
      sense of position and movement of the body . Any deficit in the joint may interfere with the&#xD;
      functional performance of the individual. The football players can use rigid or elastic&#xD;
      bandages to prevent and optimize its performance . The use of bandages in different&#xD;
      conditions is being studied , however analyzes performed during sporting gestures are scarce&#xD;
      . Therefore , this study aims to evaluate the influence of two types of bandage ankle dynamic&#xD;
      balance and activity power of the support limb during kicking through biomedical&#xD;
      instrumentation muscles . Participate in the study 180 individuals practicing football ,&#xD;
      where half will consist of professional athletes and half will consist of sedentary&#xD;
      individuals who have committed the sport of football at some point in life, aged 20 and 35&#xD;
      years of both sexes . All will perform the task of controlled shot on a force platform with&#xD;
      one foot . Electrical activity through electromyography superfíciedos long and short fibular&#xD;
      muscles , tibialis anterior and gluteus medius is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gesture Controlled Shooting ( GCC ) will consist of the following phases :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the signal of the researcher , the individual should go to the center of the platform&#xD;
           and reach , stand on one foot for execution of the kick, whereupon the cycle throughout&#xD;
           the GCC ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After shooting the ball vertically , the participant will expect it to reach the maximum&#xD;
           height and during the descent of the ball, run the kick with the member that is not&#xD;
           supported on the platform , and the same shall be held at a convenient time for hit the&#xD;
           target ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effort must be made to the medial region of the foot ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The goal of the task is to hit the ball on target , accurately ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After foot contact with the ball for the execution of the kick, the individual should&#xD;
           remain with leg support with visual focus directed to the target until the moment the&#xD;
           search signal for it to leave the platform with the foot that held the kick and&#xD;
           following with the foot that was in contact with the force platform ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle the task will be completed .&#xD;
&#xD;
           18 kicks will be performed, and 9 will be with the dominant leg and 9 with the&#xD;
           non-dominant lower limb in each of the following situations : without bandage , bandage&#xD;
           with rigid and elastic bandage .&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the data , will be used ANOVA test for a significance level of 5 % . After the&#xD;
      tests , the correlation is also carried out Pearson between the data obtained in the three&#xD;
      situations of shooting . Therefore it is expected that the dynamic balance and muscle&#xD;
      activation is influenced positively with the use of different types of taping , possibly&#xD;
      showing what kind of application is most effective for use the sport of football.&#xD;
