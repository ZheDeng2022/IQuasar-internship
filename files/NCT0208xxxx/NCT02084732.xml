  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Differentiated thyroid cancer includes papillary, follicular, Hurthle cell, and&#xD;
      C-cell/medullary carcinoma. Even though incidence is relatively low (1% of all neoplasms), a&#xD;
      rise in this disease has been recorded in the country (The Atlas of Cancer Mortality in&#xD;
      Colombia, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this disease has a low rate of attributable mortality, the costs arising from&#xD;
      treatment, monitoring, and disabilities among affected patients and their families are high&#xD;
      for the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic approach to differentiated thyroid cancer once it starts progressing is&#xD;
      limited; there are no truly favorable treatment options for patients with advanced thyroid&#xD;
      cancer: available options include surgery, radiotherapy, and radioactive iodine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular biology now allows the identification of the effects of mutations and alterations&#xD;
      in the proteins that participate in cell signaling which account for dedifferentiation,&#xD;
      invasiveness, and the progression of neoplastic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) is one of the main molecules to be&#xD;
      addressed by targeted molecular therapy. Its increased expression in differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      cancer has been demonstrated and has been associated with increased growth, invasiveness, and&#xD;
      shorter recurrence-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different agents are effective against this tyrosine kinase receptor; nevertheless, taking&#xD;
      into account that it is not solely responsible for tumor progression, according to clinical&#xD;
      study results, it is more reasonable to use non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as&#xD;
      sorafenib and motesanib. These inhibitors have already been tested in phase II studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from recent phase II research studies using these emerging treatment options have&#xD;
      shown important effects in the therapeutic approach to other solid neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about the safety of this type of treatment is limited; a need for information&#xD;
      regarding the use of new therapeutic approaches in Colombia is one of the contributions that&#xD;
      the National Institute of Cancer can make to the country through this study.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of sorafenib in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with advanced thyroid cancer (metastatic or recurrent) in a 24 months follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan The analysis plan includes the description of clinical and epidemiological&#xD;
      characteristics of recruited patients at the end of the first year and the before and after&#xD;
      comparison from clinical response according to RECIST criteria. At the end of the first and&#xD;
      second follow-up years, analyses will be performed. In each of these, the response of&#xD;
      patients by outcomes of interest measured at specific monitoring times will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parametric and non-parametric descriptive statistics will be used as necessary; the&#xD;
      comparison of some variables between baseline measurements and follow-up predetermined&#xD;
      cut-offs will be performed while taking into account the lack of independence between&#xD;
      observations. Analysis of qualitative variables will be performed using McNemar's Test and&#xD;
      the analysis of quantitative variables using the Paired Student's t-Test or Wilcoxon Test&#xD;
      depending on the normality of the distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used for time until events, survival curve and&#xD;
      progression-free time median will be stated. Correlation studies between some indicators,&#xD;
      clinical variables, and observed outcomes using parametric and non-parametric coefficients&#xD;
      will be performed. Interobserver agreement will be evaluated for the reading of diagnostic&#xD;
      images using a Kappa coefficient.&#xD;
