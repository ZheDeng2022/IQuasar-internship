    <textblock>
      The aim of this RCT of study is to compare the outcomes of the standard salpingectomy&#xD;
      (removal of the fallopian tube) with the radical removal of the tube and the mesosalpinx in&#xD;
      terms of ovarian reserve.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer accounts for 3% of all female cancers and represents the fifth leading cause&#xD;
      of cancer death in the Western world (1). In 90% of cases, these are epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      cancers (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the biological aggressiveness of this tumor and nonspecific symptoms, that causes&#xD;
      a diagnosis at an advanced stage in 75% of cases, ovarian cancer is the gynecological cancer&#xD;
      with the highest mortality rate (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, an effective screening strategy to the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer doesn't&#xD;
      exist, so the prophylactic adnexectomy is the only available tool to reduce the incidence and&#xD;
      the mortality rate, even if the role of this surgical strategy is controversial, especially&#xD;
      in premenopausal women (4). In fact, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists&#xD;
      (ACOG) guidelines recommend the ovarian preservation in premenopausal women with no family&#xD;
      history or other risk factors for ovarian cancer (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some clinical studies have shown that the prophylactic adnexectomy and the consequent&#xD;
      surgical menopause increase significantly the long term risk of cardiovascular and&#xD;
      psychosexual diseases. (6-8). In particular, a case-control study done in a population of&#xD;
      29,380 women subjected to hysterectomy with and without adnexectomy, showed an increased risk&#xD;
      of total mortality ( HRs 1.12 95 % CI 1:03 to 1:21 ), lethal and non- lethal cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease ( HRs 1.17 95 % CI 1:02 to 1:35 ) and stroke ( HRs 1.14 95 % CI 0.98-1.33 ) (9) . In&#xD;
      this population of women subjected to salpingectomy, the surgery wasn't able to lead to an&#xD;
      improvement in general survival (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the new histopathological classification of the epithelial ovarian cancer,&#xD;
      proposed by Kurman (11) and based on new acquisitions about the pathogenesis and the origin&#xD;
      of these tumors, it is possible to conceive a new preventive strategy associated with a less&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, the carcinogenesis model proposed by Kurman, provides for the classification of the&#xD;
      most important histological types of epithelial tumors into two types, diversified according&#xD;
      to clinico-pathological and genetic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type I is composed of low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, clear cell and mucinous&#xD;
      carcinomas, whose the ovarian borderline tumors and endometriosis represent the&#xD;
      pre-neoplastic lesions. Conversely, the II type includes high-grade endometrioid carcinomas,&#xD;
      carcinosarcomas and undifferentiated carcinomas and, more frequently, high-grade serous&#xD;
      carcinomas, whose preneoplastic lesion, now, seems to be represented by the serous tubal&#xD;
      intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plenty of evidence, to support the correlation between the epithelial ovarian cancer and the&#xD;
      STIC, has been obtained by immunohistochemical and molecular genetics investigations (11).&#xD;
      However, from a clinical point of view, this association has been demonstrated only by a&#xD;
      study on 55 patients affected by a high-grade serous carcinoma, whose results have shown an&#xD;
      involvement in the endosalpinx in 70% of cases and the presence of STIC in about 50% of cases&#xD;
      (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies, performed on BRCA1 / 2 populations, showed the presence of strongly sites&#xD;
      reactive to p53, defined &quot;p53 signature&quot;, in the distal tube (13). These sites seem to be&#xD;
      more frequent and characteristically multifocal in those tubes with concomitant STIC (14).&#xD;
      The finding of &quot;p53 signature&quot; may, therefore, identify an early clonal expansion of the&#xD;
      neoplastic proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new theory has given the opportunity to prevent this devastating type of cancer by the&#xD;
      addition of the prophylactic bilateral salpingectomy (PBS, with the only removal of the tube&#xD;
      and the preservation of the ovaries) in all surgical procedures performed in those women with&#xD;
      benign diseases once they have accomplished their reproductive desire. The PBS, in place of&#xD;
      the current standard procedure (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) could reduce the risk of&#xD;
      cancer, improving at the same time the quality of life and reducing the risk of premature&#xD;
      death due to cardiovascular disease, seen in women subjected to salpingo-oophorectomy before&#xD;
      the onset of natural menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary data (17) show that, if the bilateral salpingectomy is performed with great&#xD;
      care, no patient has negative effects in terms of ovarian function. In addition, in our&#xD;
      experience, no perioperative complication is attributable to salpingectomy alone. Despite the&#xD;
      retrospective design of our first study, according to the post hoc analysis, these data have&#xD;
      shown a significant statistical reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the most recent acquisitions assume that also the tissue surrounding the tube seems&#xD;
      to give rise to neoplastic sites, so it is conceivable that a greater oncological radicality&#xD;
      can be obtained removing the tube and the adjacent structures (mesosalpinx). Now it remains&#xD;
      to prove if also the radical technique of prophylactic salpingectomy causes no functional&#xD;
      damage to the ovary.&#xD;
