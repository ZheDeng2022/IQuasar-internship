      The goal of this study is to develop and test the effects of a marrow transplant (BMT) Legal&#xD;
      Clinic established through a medical-legal partnership (MLP) in an adult blood and marrow&#xD;
      (BMT) transplant setting. This will be a 2-arm randomized, controlled clinical trial, in&#xD;
      which the intervention group of patients will participate in a BMT Legal Clinic and the&#xD;
      control group is provided standard information regarding legal resources.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood or marrow transplant patients (BMT) may experience legal support needs through their&#xD;
      transplant process. Specific examples of medical-legal issues impacting BMT patients include&#xD;
      social security disability benefits, Will/estate issues, employment concerns, and creditor&#xD;
      issues. At the beginning of the transplant process, BMT patient-families are often&#xD;
      overwhelmed by the stress of transplant, and their focus is usually on their care and&#xD;
      treatment needs. Legal planning that may be important to patient-families may not be&#xD;
      considered or deferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, the process of referral to legal services is predominantly a reactive process.&#xD;
      Once a patient identifies a legal issue or concern to a BMT social worker, this is often&#xD;
      after the issue escalates to the point where it creates significant stress for the&#xD;
      patient-family. The BMT social workers have prolonged contact with these patients and&#xD;
      frequently spend many hours trying to assist patients to resolve these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer Legal Line (CALL) provides caring and compassionate pro bono legal consultation and&#xD;
      other referral or pro-bono legal services based on income guidelines to Minnesotans affected&#xD;
      by cancer. CALL has provided this support based on Blood and Marrow Transplant (BMT) social&#xD;
      work referral for the past 5 years. To our knowledge, there have been no medical-legal&#xD;
      partnerships established within hospitals for patients undergoing blood or marrow transplant&#xD;
      with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that by establishing an onsite BMT Legal Clinic through a Medical-Legal&#xD;
      Partnership (MLP), that patient-and families can be better served through proactive legal&#xD;
      consultation. The BMT Legal Clinic would serve to connect the CALL staff with the BMT care&#xD;
      team to better serve patients to address patients' concerns, promote well-being, and reduce&#xD;
      stress related to medical-legal issues.&#xD;
