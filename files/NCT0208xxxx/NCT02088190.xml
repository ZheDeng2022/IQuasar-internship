      The investigators hypothesize that the improvements in insulin sensitivity, beta (β)-cell&#xD;
      function, and inflammation will be greater, and the improvement in sarcopenic obesity will be&#xD;
      less, in younger versus older individuals after substantial weight loss induced by sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy bariatric surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With an aging population that is increasingly susceptible to obesity and obesity-related&#xD;
      comorbidities including sarcopenia and diabetes, effective and safe treatment options&#xD;
      tailored to the needs of older adults are imperative. While medication and lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions generally fail to achieve sustained large-scale weight loss, bariatric surgery&#xD;
      is the most effective long-term weight loss treatment for obese patients and improves many of&#xD;
      the medical complications associated with obesity. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) results in&#xD;
      substantial weight loss and may be more appropriate for older adults due to its low rate of&#xD;
      complications and mortality. Therefore, SG has been proposed as a reasonable primary&#xD;
      treatment modality in older obese individuals, with a substantial recent increase in the&#xD;
      number of interventions performed. Despite the potential benefits, very little is known of&#xD;
      the physiologic and metabolic effects of bariatric surgery, including SG, on glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis and muscle physiology in older adults. A fundamental understanding of the effects&#xD;
      of excess adiposity and weight loss interventions is of profound importance, especially with&#xD;
      emerging evidence that earlier treatment of obesity may delay/prevent many comorbidities. An&#xD;
      underlying inflammatory state has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and&#xD;
      insulin resistance and may provide an important connection to the age-related declines seen&#xD;
      in older obese patients. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the modifying effect of age&#xD;
      and inflammation on the SG-induced changes in body composition, muscle physiology, and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity. This protocol will be conducted in two age cohorts (greater than 60 and&#xD;
      less than 50 years old).&#xD;
