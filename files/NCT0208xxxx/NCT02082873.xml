    <textblock>
      This research is being conducted to determine if Neuroscience intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      nurses are able to identify seizures by reviewing quantitative EEG (qEEG) that is running at&#xD;
      the bedside. QEEG is the application of mathematical and analytical techniques to analyze EEG&#xD;
      signals. Several hours of data can be displayed on a single screen in several graphical&#xD;
      panels. Routine evaluation of EEG data consists of manual inspection of each page of EEG data&#xD;
      by a trained neurophysiologist (a neuro ICU doctor) and can be quite time-consuming. In most&#xD;
      cases, this data can only be reviewed intermittently and interpretation is almost always&#xD;
      relayed to the primary clinical team after the seizures have occurred. Theoretically,qEEG&#xD;
      graphical displays can provide a simplified view of complex EEG data that could possibly be&#xD;
      used by non-neurophysiologists, such as Neuro ICU nurses. Our hypothesis is that Neuro ICU&#xD;
      nurses are able to accurately identify recurrent seizures in real-time.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL TITLE A prospective trial of nonconvulsive electrographic seizure detection by&#xD;
      nurses in the adult Neuro ICU using a panel of quantitative EEG trends&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE OF STUDY The primary objective of this prospective study is to determine the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of quantitative EEG (qEEG) trends in the identification of&#xD;
      recurrent nonconvulsive electrographic seizures by non-neurophysiologists in adult patients&#xD;
      admitted to the Duke Neuro Intensive Care Unit (Neuro ICU). Our hypothesis is that bedside&#xD;
      Neuro ICU nurses using a panel of qEEG trends can identify recurrent nonconvulsive seizures&#xD;
      (NCS) with adequate sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include identifying seizure and EEG characteristics that make NCS more&#xD;
      or less likely to be detected on qEEG. These characteristics include average seizure&#xD;
      duration, spatial extent of the seizure (focal, hemispheric or bilateral/generalized) and the&#xD;
      EEG background (periodic vs. non-periodic and epileptiform vs. non-epileptiform).&#xD;

&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the increased awareness of nonconvulsive seizures (NCS) and nonconvulsive status&#xD;
      epilepticus (NCSE) in patients admitted to the NICU, the utilization of continuous EEG (cEEG)&#xD;
      monitoring in the NICU is rising. qEEG is a potential tool that can aid in the interpretation&#xD;
      of large volumes of EEG data. qEEG is the application of mathematical and analytical&#xD;
      techniques to characterize and analyze EEG signals. Several hours of data can be displayed on&#xD;
      a single screen in several graphical panels. Routine evaluation of EEG data consists of&#xD;
      manual inspection of each page of EEG data and can be quite time-consuming. Since continuous&#xD;
      review of EEG data is not possible, EEG data is always relayed to the primary clinical team&#xD;
      in a post-hoc manner which is not ideal. Theoretically, qEEG graphical displays can provide a&#xD;
      simplified view of complex EEG data that could possibly be used by non-neurophysiologists,&#xD;
      such as Neuro ICU nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been no studies in the adult or pediatric population that have prospectively&#xD;
      evaluated the use of qEEG by non-neurophysiologists to identify recurrent NCS. Given that our&#xD;
      retrospective data show that neurophysiologists and non-neurophysiologists have similar&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity in identifying the presence of NCS on qEEG panels, our hypothesis&#xD;
      is that Neuro-ICU nurses will have an acceptable sensitivity and specificity in prospectively&#xD;
      identifying recurrent NCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, prospective evaluation of Neuro ICU nurses' ability to detect NCS&#xD;
      via qEEG running at the bedside. The study will not affect clinical management decisions or&#xD;
      patient care. It will utilize DUHS Neuro ICU nurses that will serve as qEEG readers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to compare the accuracy of Neuro-ICU nurses' ability to detect NCS&#xD;
      on bedside qEEG and post hoc review of the corresponding raw EEG by blinded, board-certified&#xD;
      neurophysiologists. The neurophysiologists are blinded to the Neuro ICU nurses prospective&#xD;
      seizure identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll a sample of 40 nurses and 30 adult patients who are already on continuous&#xD;
      video electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring during their admission to the Duke Neuroscience&#xD;
      ICU. In this prospective study we will include adults who are clinically suspected to have&#xD;
      NCS, defined by the fact that the treatment team physician has requested cEEG monitoring. The&#xD;
      treating physician will make the decision to initiate cEEG monitoring and determine the&#xD;
      duration of monitoring. We will exclude subjects with convulsive seizures without concern for&#xD;
      NCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible subjects will be consented for enrollment after the clinical team has decided&#xD;
      that the patient will be placed on cEEG monitoring. Subsequently, the neurophysiology fellow&#xD;
      will review the raw EEG intermittently as this is the standard of care. Once the&#xD;
      neurophysiology fellow has detected NCS, the research team will be contacted by either the&#xD;
      clinical Neuro ICU team or the neurophysiology team if the patient is deemed appropriate to&#xD;
      continue participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses will be consented for their participation in the trial as it involves their ability to&#xD;
      detect NCS with the use of bedside qEEG trends. Neuro ICU nurses who consent will receive&#xD;
      training on qEEG monitoring by the research team via a 15 minute online PowerPoint&#xD;
      presentation. In addition, a binder containing printouts of the training PowerPoint&#xD;
      presentation will be attached to each EEG machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single printout of a qEEG panel, containing the sentinel seizure captured on cEEG&#xD;
      monitoring will be displayed next to the cEEG machine. The NCS will be clearly marked by the&#xD;
      research team. All patients undergoing cEEG monitoring at Duke have qEEG running&#xD;
      simultaneously in addition to the raw EEG. The program that creates the qEEG display is Magic&#xD;
      Marker developed by Persyt, Inc. Neuro ICU nurses will be asked to check the qEEG screen&#xD;
      hourly and record the number of seizures (similar in appearance to the sentinel seizure qEEG&#xD;
      print out) seen on the qEEG display. A 24 hour log will be attached to the EEG machine. If a&#xD;
      patient and a nurse are enrolled in the study, but the second nurse on the later shift has&#xD;
      not agreed to participate in the trial then we will either end the study or ask the second&#xD;
      nurse if he/she would like to participate. There are nurses from the float pool that may be&#xD;
      interested, and if so, we will provide a one-on-one training session at the beginning of&#xD;
      their shift and consent them. At one hour intervals the nurse will mark one of the following&#xD;
      options: no seizures, 1-2 seizures, 3-5 seizures, 6-10 seizures or &gt;10 seizures. The absolute&#xD;
      times that the nurse should evaluate the qEEG display will be determined by the study team at&#xD;
      the time of enrollment and clearly marked on the log sheet. The standard of practice of the&#xD;
      neurophysiology fellow independently reviewing the raw EEG intermittently will continue&#xD;
      unchanged. Treatment of recurrent NCS will be at the discretion of the Neuro ICU team in&#xD;
      conjunction with the neurophysiology team. The nurse's review of the qEEG will have no impact&#xD;
      on patient care or treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse will review the subject's qEEG for the duration of their shift (12 hours) or for&#xD;
      only part of their shift. The total duration of the study will be for 24 hours or when the&#xD;
      treating physician discontinues continuous EEG monitoring, whichever is shorter. If the first&#xD;
      nurse participates in the study, but the nurse on the second shift has not agreed to&#xD;
      participate, then the study will stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing enrollment, the qEEG data and raw EEG data will be de-identified by study&#xD;
      author (CW). Board-certified neurophysiologists and study authors (SS and CS) will review the&#xD;
      raw EEG data independently to identify seizures. Electrographic seizures will be identified&#xD;
      using published criteria [15]. In the case of discrepancy in the identification of seizures&#xD;
      the two authors will review the studies together and establish a consensus. Each hour of raw&#xD;
      EEG will be placed into the follow categories: no seizures, 1-2 seizure, 3-5 seizures, 6-10&#xD;
      seizures or &gt;10 seizures. In addition, the average seizure duration, the spatial extent of&#xD;
      each seizures (focal, hemispheric or generalized/bilateral), and primary background EEG&#xD;
      abnormalities will be determined by the author and board-certified neurophysiologist, CS,&#xD;
      from the raw EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECTION OF SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroscience ICU Nurses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Neuroscience ICU nurses will be asked to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The responsible treating team in the Adult Neuro ICU will identify subjects after the&#xD;
      treating physician has decided to initiate cEEG monitoring. No restrictions are made with&#xD;
      regard to gender, race, religion or underlying cause for hospitalization, including prior&#xD;
      history of seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT RECRUITMENT AND COMPENSATION Appropriate subjects will be identified by the treating&#xD;
      team in the Adult Neuro ICU. It will be at the sole discretion of the treating team in the&#xD;
      Adult Neuro ICU or the clinical neurophysiology team to notify a research coordinator to&#xD;
      approach the patient for recruitment into the study. Subject demographics will mirror that of&#xD;
      the patient demographics of the Duke Adult Neuro ICU. No compensation will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT PROCESS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroscience ICU Nurses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be introduced to all Neuro ICU nurses via an email request to participate in&#xD;
      the study. The consent form will be reviewed with all nurses willing to participate in the&#xD;
      trial. The study physicians will review the consent forms individually with each nurse in the&#xD;
      Duke Medical Pavilion conference room and answer any questions individually at that time.&#xD;
      Those that agree to participate in the study and sign the consent form will attend a brief,&#xD;
      15 minute training session on qEEG monitoring presented by the study authors (SS, CS and CW).&#xD;
      Their participation is completely voluntary and their recorded responses of qEEG&#xD;
      interpretation will be used as part of the project data. No identifying information will be&#xD;
      recorded. It will be made explicitly clear that there will be no penalty for not&#xD;
      participating and that no incentives will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Subjects Legal Representative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be introduced to the patient or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) by a&#xD;
      member of the clinical team. If the patient or LAR is willing to participate, the study team&#xD;
      will approach them. Informed consent will be obtained by the PI, Study Coordinator, or other&#xD;
      Key personnel for all subjects in the study. Consent will be obtained from the patient or&#xD;
      LAR, as defined by Duke guidelines, if the patient is unable to provide consent. The patient&#xD;
      will be assessed for impaired decision-making at the time of consent. All patients requiring&#xD;
      cEEG monitoring will require involvement of a neurologist who will determine the ability to&#xD;
      consent if that determination has not already been made either by the PI or other&#xD;
      investigators on the trial. All investigator personnel on this trial are neurologists.&#xD;
      Consent will be obtained in a quiet, private location to protect the privacy of the&#xD;
      prospective participant. Potential participants will be identified by bedside evaluation at&#xD;
      DUHS Neuro ICU. Once the participant is identified, the patient and/or family will be&#xD;
      notified of the opportunity to participate in the project, and the purpose of the study will&#xD;
      be reviewed in addition to all of the risks and benefits of participation. The entire consent&#xD;
      form will be reviewed and all questions will be addressed. It will be made explicitly clear&#xD;
      to all participants and LARs that no additional procedures will be performed as part of this&#xD;
      trial and that no incentives will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT'S CAPACITY TO GIVE LEGALLY EFFECTIVE CONSENT Many subjects will not have the capacity&#xD;
      to provide consent given the nature of the study and acuity of the disease. Consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the subject's legal representative. Periodic assessment of capacity will be&#xD;
      assessed by the research coordinator, and if deemed to have capacity the subject will be&#xD;
      presented with the opportunity to be consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY INTERVENTIONS The standard of care will continue unchanged, and this consists of&#xD;
      intermittent raw EEG review by the neurophysiology team. No interventions will come to the&#xD;
      participating subject based on qEEG data review by the Neuro ICU nurses, but rather will&#xD;
      continue to rely on the current standard of care with the existing infrastructure using raw&#xD;
      EEG. All decisions to treat NCS will be at the sole discretion of the treating team and&#xD;
      responsible care physicians. The duration of continuous EEG monitoring will be determined&#xD;
      solely by the treating team or responsible care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Subjects Legal Representative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no physical, psychological, legal, or economic risks identified. Social risks&#xD;
      include the decision to choose to participate or not participate. Cognitively impaired adults&#xD;
      may be recruited as subjects given the acuity and sequela of NCS. Special precautions include&#xD;
      the deferring to the subjects legal representative for consent in this situation. Should the&#xD;
      subject or subjects LAR choose not to participate there will be no repercussions and medical&#xD;
      care will continue per the treating team. There will be no direct benefit to the patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroscience ICU Nurses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no physical or psychological risks identified. The nurse's decision to participate&#xD;
      or not will not have repercussions. The decision to participate will have no ramifications on&#xD;
      employment status with Duke University Hospital (job classification, pay, etc.). The&#xD;
      neuroscience ICU nurses will benefit from the study by receiving training on qEEG&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COSTS TO THE SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Subjects Legal Representative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional costs that the patient's will incur as a result of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroscience ICU Nurses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no costs that the Neuro ICU nurses will incur as a result of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS We will determine the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the use of qEEG trends by Neuro ICU nurses in identifying recurrent&#xD;
      nonconvulsive seizures in critically ill patients with acute or chronic neurologic injuries.&#xD;
      This will be calculated by comparing the number of suspected seizures marked by Neuro ICU&#xD;
      nurses via qEEG displays to the number of seizures identified by the gold standard analysis&#xD;
      of the raw EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and&#xD;
      negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio) will be&#xD;
      calculated for the ability to detect the presence or absence of seizures. Contingency&#xD;
      analysis will be used to make several comparisons of the mean diagnostic accuracy of the&#xD;
      Neuro ICU nurses: 1. short (&lt; 25th percentile) vs. long (&gt; 75th percentile) seizures; 2.&#xD;
      spatial extent of seizures (generalized vs. hemispheric vs. focal); 3. Background EEG pattern&#xD;
      (epileptiform vs. non-epileptiform and periodic vs. non-periodic). The chi-square statistic&#xD;
      will be calculated for each these analyses. For all calculations, a p-value &lt; 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING Raw and qEEG data will be obtained and stored (as it is&#xD;
      currently). The qEEG and raw EEG data will be anonymized after the subject has completed&#xD;
      participation in the study. Although all EEG data in the Neuro ICU is recorded with video for&#xD;
      clinical purposes, no video will be retained during this project. The anonymized data will be&#xD;
      used solely by research investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard clinical practice will not be altered during this study. There should be no impact&#xD;
      on patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIVACY, DATA STORAGE AND CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected will include the digital EEG portion of our cEEG monitoring records and&#xD;
      their corresponding qEEG panels. Although all EEG data in the Neuro ICU is recorded with&#xD;
      video for clinical purposes, no video will be retained during this project. After extracting&#xD;
      the relevant data from the complete cEEG file, all identifying information will be removed&#xD;
      and the EEG will be numerically indexed in the data set. All cEEG and qEEG data is currently&#xD;
      collected locally (bedside PC) on the monitoring system and automatically copied to the&#xD;
      central server for remote review. Once the data is collected, the files are centrally&#xD;
      reviewed, and at that point can be copied to the project computer for indexing, extraction of&#xD;
      segments and de-identification of the data. All PHI data will be removed leaving no record of&#xD;
      the origin of the data. Clinical data will be stored on the Duke IT maintained network&#xD;
      server. The de-identified cEEG and qEEG data will be stored on the Isilon storage server&#xD;
      behind Duke's firewall. The de-identified cEEG or qEEG data will not be shared with any&#xD;
      parties outside Duke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected from the Duke electronic medical record system. This includes&#xD;
      age, race, gender, primary diagnosis, and reason of cEEG monitoring. As part of the study&#xD;
      protocol, no PHI will be recorded at any time. PHI will only be reviewed to extract relevant&#xD;
      study information, such as patient demographics and official interpretation of the cEEG by&#xD;
      the neurophysiology team. This review process will occur less than 24 hours after study&#xD;
      initiation. After the relevant information is extracted, the demographic data, cEEG data and&#xD;
      qEEG data will be anonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research data will be stored on a Duke IT maintained network server. Confidentiality will be&#xD;
      ensured as no PHI or video data will be retained on this server. The de-identified cEEG and&#xD;
      qEEG data will be used solely by research investigators.&#xD;
