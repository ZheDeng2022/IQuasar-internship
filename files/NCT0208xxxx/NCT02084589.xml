  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind study, in which a comparison of patient&#xD;
      controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) of continuous background infusion with demand dose and&#xD;
      demand only, using ropivacaine 0,15% and fentanyl 2μg/ml for pain relief in labor, is being&#xD;
      investigated. The purpose of the study is the assessment of the efficacy of labor analgesia&#xD;
      and maternal satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent is obtained by all parturients. Non invasive monitor of blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, SpO2, ECG for the patient and a continuous monitoring of the fetal&#xD;
      heart rate is being placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are randomized in two groups, both receiving the same drug (ropivacaine&#xD;
      0,15% and fentanyl 2μg/ml). Group 0 receives demand dose of 5 ml with lockout of 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Group 1 receives background infusion of 5 ml/h and demand dose of 5 ml with lockout 10&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parturients have to be instructed to self administration of epidural bolus dose when they&#xD;
      experience mild to moderate pain. Both parturient and anesthetist who conducts the study and&#xD;
      treat breakthrough pain, are blind to group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last suture, total volume of epidural infusions of PCEA, total infused drug of PCEA&#xD;
      pump, number of delivered PCEA boluses and manual rescue doses are being calculated. Time of&#xD;
      delivery, mode of delivery, Apgar scores, and overall maternal satisfaction scores, neonate&#xD;
      pH and Hct of the patient (ABGS), as well as possible need of newborn cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation are also recorded.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind study, in which a comparison of patient&#xD;
      controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) of continuous background infusion with demand dose and&#xD;
      demand only, using ropivacaine 0,15% and fentanyl 2μg/ml for pain relief in labor, is being&#xD;
      investigated. The purpose of the study is the assessment of the efficacy of labor analgesia&#xD;
      and maternal satisfaction. Inclusion criteria include primigravidas or secundigravidas, 18 to&#xD;
      40 years old, ASA I or II, gestational age &gt; 38 weeks, cervical dilatation ≥ 4 cm and request&#xD;
      for epidural labor analgesia. Exclusion criteria are: patient's refusal to participate to the&#xD;
      study, allergy to amino amide class of local anesthetics, contraindications to epidural&#xD;
      analgesia, drug addiction or addiction to alcohol and administration of opioids in the last 3&#xD;
      hours before the initiation of labor epidural analgesia. Patients with history of clinical&#xD;
      important cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, metabolic or kidney&#xD;
      disease are also excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After explaining the procedure to the parturient and the written consent is obtained, a&#xD;
      preload of 500 ml of crystalloids is given intravenously. Non invasive monitor of blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, SpO2, ECG for the patient and a continuous monitoring of the fetal&#xD;
      heart rate is being placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The insertion of the epidural catheter is performed at L2-L3, L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace, in&#xD;
      the sitting position, with 18G Touhy's needle using the loss of resistance to air technique&#xD;
      to identify the epidural space. The catheter is inserted 4 cm into the epidural space and&#xD;
      after aspiration for blood or cerebrospinal fluid is tested with 5 ml of drug containing&#xD;
      ropivacaine 0,15% and fentanyl 2μg/ml. After 6 minutes and granted that verbal analogue score&#xD;
      (VAS score) is ≥ 4, the PCEA pump is programmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are randomized in two groups, both receiving the same drug (ropivacaine&#xD;
      0,15% and fentanyl 2μg/ml). Group 0 receives demand dose of 5 ml with lockout of 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Group 1 receives background infusion of 5 ml/h and demand dose of 5 ml with lockout 10&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parturients have to be instructed to self administration of epidural bolus dose when they&#xD;
      experience mild to moderate pain (before the pain intensity becomes severe). Both parturient&#xD;
      and anesthetist who conducts the study and treat breakthrough pain, are blind to group&#xD;
      assignment. Breakthrough pain is defined as the manifestation of severe pain even with&#xD;
      correct PCEA use, necessitating adjustment of analgesic regimen by the anesthesiologist&#xD;
      during labor. In this case, the anesthetist controls the function of the epidural catheter&#xD;
      and administrate a rescue dose of 5 ml of the drug and assess pain after 15 minutes. In case&#xD;
      of VAS score more than 3 after 30 minutes and administration of two rescue doses, the&#xD;
      parturient is withdrawn from the study and replaced by another parturient via randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the test dose and every 5 minutes for the first hour of labor the following&#xD;
      parturients' parameters are collected; blood pressure, heart rate, SpO2, VAS score, level of&#xD;
      sensory block and level of motor block (using the modified Bromage Scale), uterus&#xD;
      contractions, oxytocin and possible side effects (nausea, vomiting, sedation, itch). Also,&#xD;
      fetal heart rate is being recorded every five minutes. After the first hour and until the&#xD;
      beginning of the second stage of labor the above parameters are monitored every 15 minutes,&#xD;
      and from the second stage to the last suture every 5 minutes. Cervical dilatation is being&#xD;
      recorded after every cervical examination performed by the obstetric team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal hypotension (defined as a systolic blood pressure (SPB) &lt; 100 mmHg or a decrease of&#xD;
      SBP of more than 20% from the baseline) is treated with left lateral position, administration&#xD;
      of fluids and intravenous ephedrine (doses of 2,5 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last suture, total volume of epidural infusions of PCEA, total infused drug of PCEA&#xD;
      pump, number of delivered PCEA boluses and manual rescue doses are being calculated. Time of&#xD;
      delivery, mode of delivery, Apgar scores, neonate pH and Hct of the patient (ABGS), as well&#xD;
      as possible need of newborn cardiopulmonary resuscitation are also recorded. The epidural&#xD;
      catheter is removed when the modified Bromage score is 6/6 and sensation is back to normal.&#xD;
      At that point the overall maternal satisfaction is assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is under neurological exam for 24h (every 12 hours according to the protocol of&#xD;
      our clinic).&#xD;
