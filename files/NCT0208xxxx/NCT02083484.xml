  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for participants who have progressed after prior&#xD;
      systemic therapy including ipilimumab, and V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1&#xD;
      (BRAF) inhibitor or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) enzyme inhibitor when indicated.&#xD;
      Participants cannot be eligible for or have participated in any pembrolizumab (MK-3475)&#xD;
      clinical trial with the exception of a participant enrolled in the pembrolizumab protocol&#xD;
      MK-3475-006 who received treatment on the ipilimumab treatment arm and progressed; such&#xD;
      participants will be eligible to participate in the EAP, regardless of prior treatment with a&#xD;
      BRAF/MEK inhibitor, as long as all other eligibility criteria for MK-3475-030 are met.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab&#xD;
      and if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The Expanded Access Program (EAP) for&#xD;
      this medicine in the U.S. is closed. The EAP will continue outside the U.S.&#xD;
