    <textblock>
      The study defines a new model of prenatal care called OB Nest which will be compared to the&#xD;
      traditional model of prenatal care. OB nest is intended to create an experience for patients&#xD;
      that feels more connected and patient-centered, allowing the patient to visit the clinic less&#xD;
      frequently while offering increased communication with the OB nurses and providers through&#xD;
      new tools provided to the patient. The goal of the project is to promote patient-centered&#xD;
      care through a new prenatal care program based on constant and direct support from a nursing&#xD;
      team, meeting the on-demand needs of expecting mothers as they rise, and as thus, redesigning&#xD;
      the need and timing of on-site appointment with providers. Pregnant women randomized to the&#xD;
      OB Nest cohort will see the number of pre-planned visits with their providers decreased and&#xD;
      replaced with more direct and constant support and interaction with an assigned nursing team.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      OB Nest is a model designed to promote increased patient-centered care during pregnancy. OB&#xD;
      Nest care will allow for more flexibility, decrease interruptions to your productivity, while&#xD;
      continuing to maintain safety for you and your infant. This model of care is anticipated to&#xD;
      allow you more access to your health care team during your pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare OB Nest, a new model of prenatal care, to the existing traditional&#xD;
      model of prenatal care. The plan is to have about 300 low-risk mothers take part in this&#xD;
      study. Eligible patients will be randomized to one of two groups; The Traditional Prenatal&#xD;
      care Group or the OB Nest Group. Mothers will have an equal chance of being assigned to the&#xD;
      OB Nest group. Mothers randomized to the OB Nest intervention will be assigned to a nursing&#xD;
      care team comprised of one to three nurses and see their initial eleven planned appointments&#xD;
      with their provider reduced to six. Mothers will still be able to request additional&#xD;
      in-office visits with their provider and/or the provider require additional in-office visits&#xD;
      to monitor mother and infants safety/care.&#xD;

    <description>OB Nest is designed to reduce the number of pre-planned visits with their OB provider and replace the in-clinic visits with a direct and constant support from an assigned nursing team.
