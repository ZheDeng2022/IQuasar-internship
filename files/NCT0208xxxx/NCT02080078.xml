  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the use of theophylline in patients with NSCLC and advanced solid&#xD;
      malignancies and whether treatment with theophylline will help lower or diminish the side&#xD;
      effect of diarrhea in patients taking erlotinib. Patients will be enrolled in one of two&#xD;
      parts of the study to verify the lowest dose of theophylline that is effective and the&#xD;
      highest dose of erlotinib that can be tolerated with theophylline. If this study shows that&#xD;
      theophylline is able to inhibit erlotinib induced diarrhea, it will help demonstrate that&#xD;
      patients using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs), erlotinib, can use it effectively at&#xD;
      higher doses without experiencing severe diarrhea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erlotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which is a newer, effective treatment for&#xD;
      cancer patients. TKIs are the only class of anticancer drugs that are predominately used as&#xD;
      single agents. TKIs were hoped to lack side effects but can cause severe enough diarrhea that&#xD;
      patients frequently stop treatment, even if TKIs are controlling their cancer. TKIs inhibit&#xD;
      nucleoside transporters (NTs), perturbing regulation of adenosine levels in the intestine. It&#xD;
      is possible that the reason for the inability to use TKIs in combination therapies has been&#xD;
      their additive effects on NTs causing unacceptable diarrhea. It has been shown that TKIs are&#xD;
      potent NT inhibitors, therefore it will theoretically inhibit NTs of intestinal epithelial&#xD;
      cells causing an accumulation of extracellular adenosine resulting in chloride secretory&#xD;
      diarrhea. If this hypothesis is correct, it has profound implications for oncology, since&#xD;
      diarrhea is one of the dose-limiting toxicities of TKIs. It has been shown that co-incubating&#xD;
      cells with 8-phenyltheophylline (8PT), which is an A2B adenosine receptor antagonist, block&#xD;
      chloride secretion caused by nitrobenzyl-mercaptopurine ribonucleoside (NBMPR). Theophylline&#xD;
      is also a methylxanthine and is a commercially available and licensed example of a 8PT. As it&#xD;
      is already known that erlotinib is effective, it is used as a control factor in the first arm&#xD;
      of the study and will be increased in the second arm to see what the maximally tolerated dose&#xD;
      is when in combination with a controlled dose of theophylline.&#xD;
