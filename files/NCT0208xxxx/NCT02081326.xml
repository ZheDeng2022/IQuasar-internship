  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if repeat bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccinations can&#xD;
      confer a beneficial immune and metabolic effect on Type 1 diabetes. Published Phase I data on&#xD;
      repeat BCG vaccinations in long term diabetics showed specific death of some of the disease&#xD;
      causing bad white blood cells and also showed a short and small pancreas effect of restored&#xD;
      insulin secretion. In this Phase II study, the investigators will attempt to vaccinate more&#xD;
      frequently to see if these desirable effects can be more sustained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible volunteers will either be vaccinated with BCG in a repeat fashion over a period of&#xD;
      four years or receive a placebo treatment. The investigators hypothesize that each BCG&#xD;
      vaccination will eliminate more and more of the disease causing white blood cells that could&#xD;
      offer relief to the pancreas for increased survival and restoration of insulin secretion from&#xD;
      the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional adaptive trial for COVID-19 is also being conducted on these randomized double&#xD;
      blinded type 1 diabetic subjects receiving BCG or placebo injections.&#xD;
