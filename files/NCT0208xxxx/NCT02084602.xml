  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence of the emergence of P. falciparum resistance to artesunate (a&#xD;
      derivative of artemisin) in Southeast Asia. The emergence and spread of resistant strains to&#xD;
      artemisinin would represent an alarming threat to the success of the antimalarial combination&#xD;
      therapy in the region. The delayed clearance of parasitemia for more than 24 hours has been&#xD;
      taken as an early sign of resistance, a phenomenon seen at the Thai-Cambodia border.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study, is to assess the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of&#xD;
      combinated artesunate/mefloquine therapy to treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      malaria in the Peruvian Amazon through the analysis of the rate of clearance of parasitemia&#xD;
      and other important outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Combination therapy with artemisinin derivatives is the treatment of choice for malaria by P.&#xD;
      falciparum since 2006, but there is growing evidence of the emergence of P. falciparum&#xD;
      resistance to artesunate in Southeast Asia. The delayed clearance of parasitemia for more&#xD;
      than 24 hours has been taken as an early sign of resistance, a phenomenon seen at the&#xD;
      Thai-Cambodia border. The emergence and spread of resistant strains to artemisinin would&#xD;
      represent an alarming threat to the success of the antimalarial combination therapy in the&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study, will be conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Health&#xD;
      of Peru.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective: To determine the rate of clearance of parasitemia in the first 72 hours after&#xD;
      administration of artesunate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary/exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the efficacy of the artesunate (AS)/mefloquine (MQ) therapy in participants&#xD;
           with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the Peruvian Amazon (sub-study);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to correlate the clinical results from the in vivo study with results of in vitro&#xD;
           sensitivity and molecular genotyping;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to identify common specific genetic determinants to the resistance of artemisinins in&#xD;
           parasite populations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to determine the levels of gametocytes in participants with uncomplicated falciparum&#xD;
           malaria treated with AS/MQ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to determine the contribution of host immunity in clinical and parasitological response;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. to create a catalog of parasite samples closely correlated with clinical response data&#xD;
           to perform a longitudinal follow-up of resistance trends;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. to determine pharmacokinetic parameters associated with failure of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in seven health facilities and one hospital in the Department of&#xD;
      Loreto in the Peruvian Amazon, where 59 volunteers will be enrolled between 5 and 65 years of&#xD;
      age with confirmed diagnosis of monoinfection by P. falciparum. In addition to the main&#xD;
      study, we will conduct a sub-study to determine the efficacy of AS/MQ (regime currently used&#xD;
      in Peru) After signing the informed consent/assent, blood samples will be taken to determine&#xD;
      parasite density, baseline biochemical tests, genotyping studies, analysis of molecular&#xD;
      markers and in vitro sensitivity, antibodies against malaria and cytokines. Artesunate will&#xD;
      be administered according to national guidelines in the first three days, 4 mg/kg/day.&#xD;
      However, mefloquine administration will be delayed for up to 72 hours to measure the rate of&#xD;
      clearance of parasitemia with artesunate alone in the first three days. Serial blood samples&#xD;
      for thick/thin smears will be taken every 4 hours during the first 12 hours and then every 6&#xD;
      hours until complete the first 72 hours, after the AS administration, during which time the&#xD;
      study participants will remain in a hospital ward. Monitoring will be undertaken until day 42&#xD;
      with analysis of thick/thin smears according to WHO guidelines. In case of parasitemia&#xD;
      recurrence, additional blood samples will be collected for genotyping tests, in vitro&#xD;
      sensitivity, and analysis of molecular markers of drug resistance and immunology assays. The&#xD;
      sub-study will be useful to assess the efficacy of the regimen currently in use by the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health of Peru, in this arm the patients will be given AS 4 mg/kg/day in Days 0,&#xD;
      1 and 2 and MQ 12.5mg/kg/day in Days 1 and 2. In this arm, the follow up will be done using&#xD;
      thick smears on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. Blood samples will be collected on&#xD;
      Days 0, 42 and the day of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow the Ministry of Health to know the state of resistance/tolerance to&#xD;
      artesunate in Peru and take the necessary control measures to ensure that artesunate can be&#xD;
      used successfully for treatment of falciparum malaria. Importantly, the results of this study&#xD;
      will be compared to parallelly-designed studies in Kenya (US Army Medical Research Unit&#xD;
      Kenya-USAMRU K) and Thailand (Army Forces Medical Research Institute of Medical&#xD;
      Sciences-AFRIMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Malaria is one of the main public health problems in Peru, early and efficacious&#xD;
      treatment in the principal control strategy the appearance of strains that are resistant to&#xD;
      the regular treatment used in Peru jeopardize the strategies for malaria control in South&#xD;
      America. This study will allow us to know the current resistance status and to prepare&#xD;
      corresponding measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Budget: This study will be done as a joined effort between NAMRU-6 and the INS, this will&#xD;
      cost 201,934.93 Nuevos Soles afforded by Instituto Nacional de Salud and a total cost of&#xD;
      527,934.93 Nuevos Soles for both participating institutions&#xD;
