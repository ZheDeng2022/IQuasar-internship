      The ultimate clinical aim of this proposed phase I trial is to evaluate the toxicity and&#xD;
      determine the recommended phase II dose of combining the effect of LDFWART following&#xD;
      administration of docetaxel for 6 cycles in patients with recurrent platinum-resistant&#xD;
      ovarian cancer.&#xD;

    <description>This study has 6 treatment cycles given at 3 weeks intervals ± 3 days. A cycle is defined as 1 treatment of morning Docetaxel and afternoon Low Dose Fractionated Whole Abdominal Radiation Therapy (LDFWART).

    <description>Chemotherapy will consist of 6 cycles of Docetaxel. Each cycle will follow standard of care and will be scheduled every 3 weeks ± 3 days. Chemotherapy should be administered in the morning to allow 6-8 hours before Radiation Therapy. On Day 1 of each cycle, chemotherapy will consist of Docetaxel 60 mg/m² infused intravenously over 30-60 minutes (with premedication of dexamethasone 10 mg given IV 30-60 minutes prior to docetaxel administration).</description>
