  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEG-BCT-100 as the&#xD;
      second-line therapy following sorafenib in advanced HCC patients. Another objective of the&#xD;
      study is to explore whether the expression of OTC and ASS are predictive biomarkers for drug&#xD;
      response and prognosis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm clinical trial. Approximately 35 subjects will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. All subjects will be treated with PEG-BCT-100 2.7 mg/kg weekly (day1, 8 and 15).&#xD;
      Three week treatment of PEG-BCT-100 is considered as 1 cycle. All subjects will receive&#xD;
      PEG-BCT-100 till progressive disease, intolerable toxicity or patients withdraw consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical effects of PEG-BCT-100 on disease response will be evaluated every 6 weeks until&#xD;
      disease progression. Disease response evaluation will be based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. The&#xD;
      disease response based on modified RECIST criteria will also be evaluated and documented for&#xD;
      reference only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety parameters will be evaluated throughout the study. Adverse event (AE) will be graded&#xD;
      according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      version 4.0 (NCI CTC AE v4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a tumor tissue biopsy at baseline for evaluation of the biomarkers&#xD;
      of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) and arginine succinate synthetase (ASS) except for those&#xD;
      subjects whose tumor tissue blocks have been obtained within 1 year and are available for the&#xD;
      biomarkers evaluation. The association between the levels of the 2 biomarkers and disease&#xD;
      response to PEG-BCT-100 treatment will be explored in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects on patients' quality of life will be evaluated every 2 cycles of the PEG-BCT-100&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
