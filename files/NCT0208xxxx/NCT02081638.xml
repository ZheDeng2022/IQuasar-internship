      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The immune system protects the body from infection. But it can also cause harm. For&#xD;
      example, the clotting system makes blood clot and protects from bleeding. But blood clots are&#xD;
      sometimes harmful. People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have increased&#xD;
      inflammation and clotting. This may increase their risk for diseases like stroke or heart&#xD;
      attack. Researchers want to know how aspirin or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (so-called&#xD;
      statin medications) affect the immune and clotting systems of people with HIV. Aspirin is a&#xD;
      medicine to decrease clotting. Statins are medications given to lower cholesterol and&#xD;
      decrease inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how aspirin or statins change immune and clotting systems in people with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 and older with HIV and a low viral load, not on aspirin or a statin medication.&#xD;
      They must also have either: (1) never taken anti-HIV medications (ARVs), have a suppressed&#xD;
      viral load, have stable CD4 counts, and never had an opportunistic infection; or (2) been&#xD;
      taking ARVs for 5 continuous years and have a suppressed viral load for more than 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and lab&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will repeat screening tests and have an MRI. An MRI is a way to visualize&#xD;
           blood vessels in the neck and head. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and&#xD;
           out of a cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take either study drug once daily for 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a blood procedure twice. Blood will be removed through a needle&#xD;
           in one arm and circulated through a machine that removes white blood cells. The blood,&#xD;
           minus white blood cells, is returned through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be observed for 3 months before and after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite dramatic improvements in mortality with antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-infected&#xD;
      persons remain at risk of developing non-infectious complications, including cardiovascular,&#xD;
      renal, and neurological disease. A small subset of the HIV-infected population achieve&#xD;
      durable control of HIV virus in the absence of ART. These individuals, termed elite&#xD;
      controllers (ECs), remain ART na(SqrRoot) ve, have stable CD4 T cell counts for many years&#xD;
      and have no history of opportunistic infections. Despite the lack of AIDS complications,&#xD;
      recent evidence suggests ECs may exhibit heightened immune activation that may contribute to&#xD;
      a potentially increased risk for non-infectious complications, similar to successfully&#xD;
      treated progressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current 2 group, randomized, open label trial, we intend to study the effects of a&#xD;
      lipid lowering agent vs aspirin (ASA) on immune activation in HIV-1 infected participants.&#xD;
      One group will consist of ECs who are HIV-1 infected, maintain HIV-RNA levels of less than&#xD;
      the LLD of commercially available assays in the absence of ART, have no history of ART or&#xD;
      opportunistic infections (OIs) and have stable CD4 T cell counts for greater than 3 years.&#xD;
      The second group will enroll HIV-1 infected Treated Progressors (henceforth referred to as&#xD;
      ART &lt;50) who have maintained HIV-RNA below the limit of detection in commercially available&#xD;
      assays (&lt;40, &lt;48, or &lt;50 copies/mL) for greater than 3 years on ART (treatment duration&#xD;
      greater than 4 years). Up to 2 months after the screening and enrollment visit, each group&#xD;
      will enter a 3 month observation period (to establish baseline values for biomarkers/cellular&#xD;
      markers). After 3 months, participants from each group will be randomized to either ASA, 81&#xD;
      mg PO daily, or atorvastatin (ATV), 40 mg (dose adjusted for subjects on antiretroviral&#xD;
      regimens with significant interactions, and will be treated for 9 months, followed by 3&#xD;
      months of a wash out period (see Figure 1). The primary end point will be change of sCD14&#xD;
      after 9 months of study intervention from Month 3 to Month 12 in each treatment arm, with&#xD;
      groups combined (EC and ART &lt;50). Secondary objectives will be to compare changes in soluble&#xD;
      biomarkers (sCD14, IL-6, D-dimer, hsCRP, sTF, sCD163 and other relevad treatment arms (ASA vs&#xD;
      statin and EC vs ART&lt;50 and with groups combined), to evaluate cardiovascular (CV) disease&#xD;
      prevalence in EC vs ART&lt;50 and with groups combined), to evaluate cardiovascular (CV) disease&#xD;
      prevalence in EC vs ART &lt;50 by MR imaging of carotids, to determine MR measurements and&#xD;
      correlations with biomarkers and cellular activation markers, and to investigate changes in&#xD;
      plasma viremia as measured by single copy assay over time.&#xD;

             lower limit of detection of the assay used; transient periods of low level (&lt;300)&#xD;
             detectable virus, blips, acceptable if isolated and followed by viral loads less than&#xD;
             the lower limit of detection) &gt;3 years and current HIV-RNA less than the LLD of the&#xD;
             commercially available assay used. Subject will be rescreened if HIV is detectable at&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;

             mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to ATV or ASA, including a history of myositis or&#xD;
             rhabdomyolysis with statin or ASA use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Other contraindication for ASA or statin therapy (active liver disease, peptic ulcer&#xD;
             disease, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women who are lactating, pregnant, or actively trying to become pregnant or&#xD;
             considering pregnancy over the likely span of the study (including women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential who are unwilling to use adequate contraception throughout the&#xD;
             study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any chronic inflammatory condition either requiring anti-inflammatory medication&#xD;
             (systemic corticosteroids, daily NSAID use,immunomodulating medications) which may, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, confound the interpretation of soluble inflammatory&#xD;
             biomarkers. While on study, short term (less than 5 days) NSAID use will be allowed at&#xD;
             the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Active drug use or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, may&#xD;
             interfere with the ability of the subject to participate in the study or that may&#xD;
             unacceptably increase the risk of the study intervention..&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Safety laboratory cut offs: coagulation (INR &gt;2 upper limit of normal [ULN], PLT&lt;75K),&#xD;
             renal function (GFR&lt;60), liver function (ALT or Alkaline phosphatase or direct&#xD;
             bilirubin &gt;2x ULN), aldolase &lt;1.5 ULN and anemia (Hg &lt;9 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Antiretroviral therapy with tipranivir, or any therapy which combines non-nucleoside&#xD;
             reverse transcriptase inhibitors with protease inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Chronic hepatitis C co-infection. However, if a subject has more than 24 weeks of&#xD;
             sustained virologic response (SVR), the subject can be considered for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. If either MR or apheresis is contraindicated, subject may still participate without&#xD;
             this procedure. In the case of missed apheresis, a 30 mL research blood draw will be&#xD;
             substituted (see Appendices B and C).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If statin initiation is indicated per current guidelines, subject will be&#xD;
                  counseled to consult with their PMD. If the subject then chooses to take part in&#xD;
                  the study, we will provide their PMD with all pertinent lab results during the&#xD;
                  course of the study, if requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-enrollment Guidelines: Co-enrollment in other trials will be restricted, other than&#xD;
        enrollment on observational studies. Study staff should be notified of co-enrollment as it&#xD;
        may require the approval of the Investigator.&#xD;
