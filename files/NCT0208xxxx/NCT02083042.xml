      This study aims to validate whether Lophius Biosciences Kit T-Track® CMV is suitable to&#xD;
      assess the functionality of CMV-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and to determine a&#xD;
      protective cut-off value for CMV reactivations/disease in kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lophius kit T-Track® CMV represents a highly standardized and sensitive diagnostic tool to&#xD;
      assess the functionality of a network of clinically relevant CMV-reactive effector cells. It&#xD;
      is based on the stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with urea-formulated&#xD;
      immunodominant CMV proteins, pp65 and IE-1, and the subsequent quantification of CMV-specific&#xD;
      CMI (spot forming colonies) using a highly sensitive IFN-γ ELISpot.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe clinical complications including acute rejection and opportunistic infections in solid&#xD;
      organ transplantation (SOT) are mainly caused by inadequate impairment of cell-mediated&#xD;
      immunity (CMI) by immunosuppressive therapy. In particular CMV is responsible for increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality revealing the need for either prophylactic or preemptive antiviral&#xD;
      treatment. Recipients with negative CMV serology (R-) receiving a graft from a seropositive&#xD;
      donor (D+) are at highest risk of developing CMV-associated complications. Therefore, these&#xD;
      patients usually receive antiviral prophylaxis whereas patients at intermediate risk (D+/R+&#xD;
      or D-/R+) are treated either prophylactically or preemptively. Although prophylaxis is&#xD;
      efficient, it is also accompanied by harmful side effects and high costs. Thus, there is a&#xD;
      need for a personalized antiviral as well as immunosuppressive therapy to optimally treat the&#xD;
      patient and to improve long-term patient and graft survival. The detection of a protective&#xD;
      threshold of functional CMV-reactive cells may help to predict the onset of viral&#xD;
      complications, thereby minimizing harmful side effects. Currently available tools to measure&#xD;
      CMV-specific cellular immunity reveal striking limitations including a lack of&#xD;
      standardization necessitating a commercially available standardized test system. The Lophius&#xD;
      kit T-Track® CMV represents a highly standardized and sensitive diagnostic tool to assess the&#xD;
      functionality of a network of clinically relevant CMV-reactive effector cells. It is based on&#xD;
      the stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with urea-formulated&#xD;
      immunodominant CMV proteins, pp65 and IE-1, and the subsequent quantification of CMV-specific&#xD;
      CMI (spot forming colonies) using a highly sensitive IFN-γ ELISpot. This study aims to assess&#xD;
      the suitability of the Lophius Biosciences kit T-Track® CMV to determine the CMV-specific CMI&#xD;
      in renal transplant recipients scheduled for a preemptive antiviral treatment strategy.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it will be investigated if the results obtained with T-Track® CMV are suitable&#xD;
      to define a cut-off value of CMV-specific CMI mediating protection from CMV reactivations and&#xD;
      related complications. Moreover, possible associations between CMV-specific CMI measured with&#xD;
      T-Track® CMV and clinical complications including acute rejection episodes and opportunistic&#xD;
      infections will be analyzed as well as the influence of the immunosuppressive treatment and&#xD;
      the patient's HLA type on viral immunity.&#xD;
