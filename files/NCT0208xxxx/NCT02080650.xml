  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will aim to determine whether circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be captured&#xD;
      using the novel cMET based ferrofluid. The primary objective of this pilot study will be to&#xD;
      describe the numbers of c-MET expressing cells that can be detected by the c-MET CTC capture&#xD;
      technique. These data will be separated by disease site. The investigator will also describe&#xD;
      the detection rates of both the c-MET CTC capture and the EpCAM CTC capture techniques in&#xD;
      each patient, also separated by disease site.&#xD;
