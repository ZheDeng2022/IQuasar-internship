      The propose of the study is to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Oxaliplatin in&#xD;
      combination with pegylated recombinant human arginase 1 (PEG-BCT-100) and Capecitabine and&#xD;
      efficacy of this combination regimen (PACOX)in patients with advanced liver cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open-label study. The first part of the study (Part 1) is a dose&#xD;
      escalation study of a 21-day regimen of IV Oxaliplatin in combination with weekly IV&#xD;
      PEG-BCT-100 2.7 mg/kg and oral Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice per day for 14 days. There are 3&#xD;
      successive treatment cohorts in dose level of 85 mg/m2, 100 mg/m2 and 130 mg/m2 for&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin. Subsequent treatment cohort is opened only after all patients in the previous&#xD;
      cohort have completed the first 3 cycles of PACOX. The first patient entered the study is&#xD;
      started at Cohort 1. At least three subjects will be treated at this cohort and observed for&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). If one of the three treated patients develops DLT at any dose&#xD;
      level, three additional patients are to be entered at the same dose level. The dose of&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin will be escalated if no DLT for the first three patients or one of the six&#xD;
      treated patients develops a DLT. If two or more of the three/six patients at a given dose&#xD;
      level experienced a DLT, dose escalation is stopped and the previous dose level is declared&#xD;
      the MTD (recommended dose) of PACOX regimen for the second part of the study (Part 2). If the&#xD;
      first three patients in Cohort 3 do not develop a DLT, an additional three patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Cohort 3. If one or less than one patient in Cohort 3 has developed a DLT. the&#xD;
      dose level is declared as the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be assessed through physical examination and vital signs findings, safety&#xD;
      laboratory tests results, and graded by the NCI CTCAE (version 4.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Patients receive the recommended dose of PACOX regimen as defined in Part 1. A 14-day&#xD;
      screening period followed by a treatment period consisting of 3-week treatment cycles.&#xD;
      Patients will be treated until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The treatment&#xD;
      period will end by a follow up visit at 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment. After&#xD;
      the study treatment, patients will be follow-up every 8 weeks for survival status or until&#xD;
      study termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both parts of the study will receive PACOX regimen until disease progression,&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity, death or patients withdraw consent. The clinical effects of PACOX&#xD;
      regimen on tumor response will be evaluated. Tumour assessment which is based on RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      criteria will be performed until disease progression.&#xD;

    <description>There are 3 successive treatment cohorts in dose level of 85, 100 and 130 mg/m2 for Oxaliplatin. Subsequent treatment cohort is opened only after all patients in the previous cohort have completed the first 3 cycles of PACOX. At least 3 subjects will be treated at each cohort and observed for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). If 1 of the 3 treated patients develops DLT at any dose level, 3 additional patients are to be entered at the same dose level. The dose of Oxaliplatin will be escalated if no DLT for the first 3 patients or 1 of the 6 treated patients develops a DLT. If 2 or more of the 3/6 patients at a given dose level experienced a DLT, dose escalation is stopped and the previous dose level is declared the MTD for the second part of the study. If the first 3 patients in Cohort 3 do not develop a DLT, an additional 3 patients will be enrolled in Cohort 3. If 1 or less than 1 patient in Cohort 3 has developed a DLT. the dose level is declared as the MTD.</description>
