    <textblock>
      The Fit Study is a three-year, cluster-randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of school-based body mass index (BMI) screening and reporting on child health.&#xD;
      Seventy-nine California schools will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) BMI screening&#xD;
      and reporting, 2) BMI screening, and 3) no BMI screening or reporting (control).&#xD;
      Investigators will assess the impact of BMI reporting on students' BMI trajectories over&#xD;
      three years. Investigators will also assess the impact of BMI screening on weight-based&#xD;
      teasing, feelings of stigmatization, and weight-control behaviors among students.&#xD;

      The Fit Study is a three-year, cluster-randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of school-based body mass index (BMI) screening and reporting on childhood obesity and&#xD;
      psychosocial outcomes. This study will take place during the 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17&#xD;
      school years. Seventy-nine schools across California will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      groups: 1) BMI screening and reporting, 2) BMI screening, and 3) no BMI screening or&#xD;
      reporting (control). Schools randomized to Groups 1 and 2 will conduct height and weight&#xD;
      measurements annually with their 3rd-8th grade students. Group 1 and 2 schools will also&#xD;
      administer the five fitness assessments (mile run or PACER test, curl-ups, push-ups, trunk&#xD;
      lift, and sit and reach) annually with their 5th-8th grade students. In the fall of Years 2&#xD;
      and 3, Group 1 schools will mail a report home to parents with students' results from the&#xD;
      previous spring. All 3rd and 4th grade parents will receive a report with BMI results only.&#xD;
      Investigators will randomize the parents of 5th-8th grade students to receive a report that&#xD;
      provides BMI results only or one that provides BMI results with results from the five fitness&#xD;
      assessments. Schools randomized to Group 3 will not conduct height and weight measurements&#xD;
      with their students during Years 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each fall, investigators will administer a survey to 4th-8th grade students from all schools.&#xD;
      This survey will assess weight-based teasing, feelings of stigmatization, and weight-control&#xD;
      behaviors among students. The student survey will also ask questions about students'&#xD;
      experiences having their heights and weights measured at school. During all years,&#xD;
      investigators will mail a survey home a subsample of parents to assess parent behaviors&#xD;
      related to their child's physical activity and nutrition, as well as parent reactions to the&#xD;
      BMI report. Finally, schools will complete a survey in Spring 2017 to assess their nutrition-&#xD;
      and physical activity-related policies and programs.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will assess change in BMI z-score over 3 years between students in Group 1 (BMI screening + reporting) and students in Group 2 (BMI screening only). Primary analyses will be limited to students who were overweight (BMI â‰¥ 85th percentile) at baseline (Spring 2015). Investigators will also compare change in BMI z-score over 3 years between Group 1 students whose parents received the BMI-only report and Group 1 students whose parents received the BMI + fitness report. In both sets of analyses, ethnicity will be used as an effect modifier.</description>
