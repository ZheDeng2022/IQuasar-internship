  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome for study success is defined as ptosis correction and maintenance of the surgical correction</measure>
    <time_frame>1year</time_frame>
    <description>Correction of ptosis at 3 months must be Grade 0, Pseudoptosis, or Grade 1, and maintenance of ptosis correction at 12 months is demonstrated by a classification of ptosis Grade 1 or less</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Long term visibility: Mammography and ultrasound will be used to evaluate the presence of the mesh or potential for mesh interference in evaluation of the breast tissue.</measure>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator satisfaction with the surgical implantation/usage of GalaFLEX Scaffold based on a satisfaction questionnaire completed at procedural and follow up timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the role that GalaFLEX scaffold plays in MD's perception of the ability to obtain a successful result, MD's provide assessments of the surgical procedures such as mesh handling, ease of placement. At follow up timepoints, a satisfaction questionnaire is completed to assess satisfaction with overall procedural results</description>
