  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a rapidly emerging imaging modality that can function&#xD;
      as a type of &quot;optical biopsy&quot;, providing non-invasive cross-sectional images of tissue&#xD;
      architectural morphology in situ and in real-time. This proposal will demonstrate that OCT&#xD;
      has the ability to provide novel and valuable histopathological information regarding donor&#xD;
      kidneys that can be used to predict post-transplant renal function. These investigations will&#xD;
      result in a major breakthrough in increasing the number of healthy kidneys available for&#xD;
      transplantation by making the most efficient use of available donor kidneys, eliminating the&#xD;
      possible use of bad donor kidneys, providing an accurate measure of expected post-transplant&#xD;
      renal function, and allowing better distinction between post-transplant immunological&#xD;
      rejection and ischemic-induced acute renal failure.&#xD;

      What will be assessed: Kidney pathology will be assessed. Specifically, optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) will be used to observe the pathology of the kidney uriniferous tubules. The&#xD;
      proximal convoluted tubules that make up most of the kidney uriniferous tubules and&#xD;
      parenchyma in the outer cortex of the kidney (i.e., the portion of the kidney subjacent to&#xD;
      the outer kidney capsule) are sensitive indicators of damage to the kidneys. When damaged due&#xD;
      to ischemia (i.e., a lack of blood flow), these tubules swell and cellular debris is released&#xD;
      into the lumens of these tubules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is this data important: Damage to the kidney proximal tubules, known as acute tubular&#xD;
      necrosis (ATN), is the most common cause of poor post-transplant kidney function following&#xD;
      transplant. It has been shown that determining the extent of ATN is a good indicator of&#xD;
      post-transplant renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How will the data be collected: The histopathology describe above (i.e., the pathology of the&#xD;
      kidney tubules) will be collected using optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is a rapidly&#xD;
      emerging imaging modality that can function as a type of &quot;optical biopsy&quot;, providing&#xD;
      non-invasive cross-sectional images of tissue architectural pathology in situ and in&#xD;
      real-time. OCT is similar to ultrasound, but uses light waves instead of sound waves to&#xD;
      obtain high-resolution imaging. The ability of OCT of obtain high-resolution images is&#xD;
      necessary in order to observe the pathological changes describe above (i.e., damage to the&#xD;
      kidney tubules). Algorithms will be developed as a result of this investigation in order to&#xD;
      assist in the prediction of ATN and post-transplant kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What factors will be measured to determine post-transplant kidney function: The factors that&#xD;
      will be used to measure post-transplant renal function include serum creatinine, BUN and&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rates (GFR). This data will be collected by examining the surgical and&#xD;
      laboratory reports for each patient. The data will be collected daily for the first two weeks&#xD;
      following transplant and biweekly for the next six months following transplant. Six months&#xD;
      following transplant, this data will be collected every 3 months until conclusion of study&#xD;
      (i.e., 4 years). The patient data will be stored on password-protected files on a&#xD;
      password-protected computer. The data will be available only to the principal investigator&#xD;
      and the co-investigators in this study. A nephrologist fellow who will report directly to the&#xD;
      principal investigator will collect the data. The principal investigator will verify data&#xD;
      accuracy and protocol compliance. A biostatistician who will be blinded as to patient&#xD;
      identity will independently analyze the data. If the data is published, only the parameters&#xD;
      listed above and related to post-transplant renal function will be reported. No names will be&#xD;
      associated with publication of the collected kidney transplant data. The principal&#xD;
      investigator and the biostatistician will monitor this data and any indications of potential&#xD;
      harm to the patient will be reported immediately to the Institutional Review Board (IRB).&#xD;
