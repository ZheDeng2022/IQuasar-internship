      This study is designed to estimate the two-way drug interaction between DCV and DTG as a drug&#xD;
      interaction between DTG and DCV is expected to be low and this study is to be performed as&#xD;
      confirmation. This will be a single-center, open-label, three-period, crossover study in&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects. This study to describe and compare steady-state plasma DTG and DCV&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics following administration of DTG 50 mg q24h with and without DCV 60 mg q24h&#xD;
      and following administration of DCV 60 mg q24h with and without DTG 50 mg q24h also the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability was assessed after a repeat dose DTG 50 mg q24h with or without DCV&#xD;
      60 mg q24h and after a repeat dose DCV 60 mg q24h with and without DTG 50 mg q24h&#xD;
