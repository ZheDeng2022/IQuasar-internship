  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objectives are to define incidence and prevalence of Delirium in an elderly&#xD;
      population admitted to the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology and, in the&#xD;
      postoperative phase, in the high Dependency Unit as well as to determine the presence of risk&#xD;
      factors. Secondary objectives are to determine mean hospital stay, rates of complications as&#xD;
      well as in-hospital mortality and at 1-3 and 12 months after discharge, functional recovery&#xD;
      and cognitive outcomes at 1, 3 and 12 moths follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aging of population as well as the increased life expectancy put progressively urgent&#xD;
      demands about the adequacy of the level of care provided in a hospital environment to ensure&#xD;
      clinical pathways tailored on the needs of each individual patient. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      gradual evolution of Health Care systems to care for the acute, with increasing levels of&#xD;
      specialization often technologically driven, cannot and must not neglect these aspects of&#xD;
      personalization of care protecting the elderly &quot;frail&quot; patient, because of its intrinsic&#xD;
      characteristics. In such a context, evaluation of frailty undertakes not only the meaning of&#xD;
      prevention and promotion of quality of life but it takes in account important issues for&#xD;
      patient's safety and the economic weight it entails. Delirium (acute confusional state) is a&#xD;
      complex syndrome which frequently occurs in the elderly hospitalized population. Development&#xD;
      of Delirium is associated with negative outcomes such as a longer hospital stay, a higher&#xD;
      rate of complications, cognitive and functional decline, loss of independence,&#xD;
      institutionalization, and, ultimately, death. For skilled healthcare professionals, on the&#xD;
      other hand, it represents a challenging condition because a prompt and accurate diagnosis&#xD;
      with the introduction of all those prevention and non-pharmacological measures may reduce the&#xD;
      incidence, severity and/or duration of Delirium and improve functional recovery. Therefore&#xD;
      the meaning of conducting such an observational study is also to provide evidence of&#xD;
      patients' needs and address the on-ground educational aspect for healthcare professionals in&#xD;
      a daily practice. The purposes of the study are to determine the incidence and prevalence&#xD;
      (before and after surgery) of Delirium in an elderly population admitted to the Department of&#xD;
      Orthopedics and Traumatology and in the High Dependency Unit in the postoperative phase as&#xD;
      well as to determine the risk factors for developing such a condition. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      are mean hospital stay, rates of complications as well as in-hospital mortality and at 1, 3&#xD;
      and 12 months after discharge, functional recovery and cognitive outcomes at 1, 3 and 12&#xD;
      months follow-up.&#xD;
