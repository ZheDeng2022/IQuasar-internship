  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary: To examine the within subject variability of Clexane (80 mg) in healthy male and&#xD;
      female volunteers administered subcutaneously (s.c.) as a single dose, in two periods, under&#xD;
      fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To monitor safety during the Treatment Periods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a pilot, open-label study to evaluate the PK of enoxaparin following s.c.&#xD;
      administrations of 80 mg Clexane, on 2 different occasions, in 14 healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprised a Screening Visit and 2 Treatment Periods (1 and 2). Screening (Day -14&#xD;
      to Day -1): Screening assessments were carried out within 14 days before administration of&#xD;
      the first dose of Clexane. Eligible subjects were asked to return for Treatment Period 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Periods 1 and 2 (Day 0 to Day 26): Eligible subjects received two doses of s.c.&#xD;
      Clexane over 2 Treatment Periods (1 dose/period). Final confirmation of eligibility was made&#xD;
      prior to dosing during Treatment Period 1. Confirmation of ongoing eligibility was made prior&#xD;
      to dosing during Treatment Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Treatment Period was of 2 days duration, from the afternoon before dosing (Day 0) until&#xD;
      36 hours (h) post-dose (evening of Day 2). During each Treatment Period, subjects resided at&#xD;
      the Clinical Unit. Study drug was administered on the morning of Day 1 following an overnight&#xD;
      fast. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were collected pre-dose and up to 36 h post-dose (x14&#xD;
      samples) for the measurement of enoxaparin. Safety was also evaluated at specified times&#xD;
      throughout the study. There were at least 7 days between each dose administration. The&#xD;
      Post-Study Follow-Up was conducted on Day 2 of Treatment Period 2 after completion of the 36&#xD;
      h PK blood sampling and vital sign check.&#xD;

    <description>Enoxaparin exerts its anticoagulant effect primarily via interaction with anti-thrombin III (ATIII), thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of ATIII on activated factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin/factor IIa (FIIa). Inhibition of FXa activity prevents conversion of prothrombin/factor II (FII) to FIIa and inhibition of FIIa activity (direct/indirect) prevents conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and therefore clot formation. As enoxaparin cannot be measured directly in blood, the PK of enoxaparin have been studied on the basis of its effect on clotting mechanisms, particularly the inhibition of FXa (anti-FXa) and FIIa (anti-FIIa) activity.&#xD;

Each Treatment Period was of 2 days duration, from the afternoon before dosing (Day 0) until 36 hours (h) post-dose (evening of Day 2). Study drug was administered on the morning of Day 1 following an overnight fast.&#xD;
There were at least 7 days between each dose administration. In period 1, one dose of Clexane was administered s.c. into the left or right side of the abdomen (alternating sides with Treatment Period). This dose contained 80 mg enoxaparin sodium (equivalent to 8,000 international units (IU) anti-factor Xa (anti FXa activity) in 0.8 mL of water for injection.&#xD;
In period 2 one dose of Clexane was administered s.c. into the left or right side of the abdomen (alternating sides with Treatment Period). This dose contained 80 mg enoxaparin sodium (equivalent to 8,000 international units (IU) anti-factor Xa (anti FXa activity) in 0.8 mL of water for injection.</description>

        <title>Anti-FXa Cmax</title>
        <description>Enoxaparin exerts its anticoagulant effect primarily via interaction with anti-thrombin III (ATIII), thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of ATIII on activated factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin/factor IIa (FIIa). Inhibition of FXa activity prevents conversion of prothrombin/factor II (FII) to FIIa and inhibition of FIIa activity (direct/indirect) prevents conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and therefore clot formation. As enoxaparin cannot be measured directly in blood, the PK of enoxaparin have been studied on the basis of its effect on clotting mechanisms, particularly the inhibition of FXa (anti-FXa) and FIIa (anti-FIIa) activity.&#xD;
Cmax is the maximum (or peak) serum concentration that a drug achieves in a specified compartment or test area of the body after the drug has been administered and before the administration of a second dose.</description>

        <title>Anti-FIIA AUC0-t</title>
        <description>Enoxaparin exerts its anti-coagulant effect primarily via interaction with anti-thrombin III (ATIII), thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of ATIII on activated factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin/factor IIa (FIIa). Inhibition of FXa activity prevents conversion of prothrombin/factor II (FII) to FIIa and inhibition of FIIa activity (direct/indirect) prevents conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and therefore clot formation. As enoxaparin cannot be measured directly in blood, the PK of enoxaparin have been studied on the basis of its effect on clotting mechanisms, particularly the inhibition of FXa (anti-FXa) and FIIa (anti-FIIa) activity.&#xD;

          <title>Anti-FXa Lambda Zeta</title>
          <description>Enoxaparin exerts its anti-coagulant effect primarily via interaction with anti-thrombin III (ATIII), thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of ATIII on activated factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin/factor IIa (FIIa). Inhibition of FXa activity prevents conversion of prothrombin/factor II (FII) to FIIa and inhibition of FIIa activity (direct/indirect) prevents conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and therefore clot formation. As enoxaparin cannot be measured directly in blood, the PK of enoxaparin have been studied on the basis of its effect on clotting mechanisms, particularly the inhibition of FXa (anti-FXa) and FIIa (anti-FIIa) activity.&#xD;
Lambda zeta is the apparent first-order terminal elimination rate constant calculated from a semi-log plot of the plasma activity/concentration versus time curve.</description>

        <title>Anti-FIIa Lambda Zeta</title>
        <description>Enoxaparin exerts its anti-coagulant effect primarily via interaction with anti-thrombin III (ATIII), thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of ATIII on activated factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin/factor IIa (FIIa). Inhibition of FXa activity prevents conversion of prothrombin/factor II (FII) to FIIa and inhibition of FIIa activity (direct/indirect) prevents conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and therefore clot formation. As enoxaparin cannot be measured directly in blood, the PK of enoxaparin have been studied on the basis of its effect on clotting mechanisms, particularly the inhibition of FXa (anti-FXa) and FIIa (anti-FIIa) activity.&#xD;
Lambda zeta is the apparent first-order terminal elimination rate constant calculated from a semi-log plot of the plasma activity/concentration versus time curve.</description>

          <description>Enoxaparin also releases tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which is thought to contribute to anticoagulant activity, by inhibiting FXa generation and free FXa. Tmax is the time to Cmax. If the maximum value occurred at &gt; 1 time-point Tmax was defined as the first time-point with this value.</description>

        <title>TFPI Lambda Zeta</title>
        <description>Enoxaparin also releases tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which is thought to contribute to anticoagulant activity, by inhibiting FXa generation and free FXa. Lambda zeta is the apparent first-order terminal elimination rate constant calculated from a semi-log plot of the plasma activity/concentration versus time curve. The parameter was calculated by linear least-squares regression analysis using the maximum number of points in the terminal log-linear phase (e.g. ≥ 3 non-zero plasma concentrations).</description>

          <title>Treatment Period 1</title>
          <description>Eligible subjects received two doses of s.c. Clexane over 2 Treatment Periods (1 dose/period).&#xD;
Each Treatment Period was of 2 days duration, from the afternoon before dosing (Day 0) until 36 hours (h) post-dose (evening of Day 2). Study drug was administered on the morning of Day 1 following an overnight fast.&#xD;
There were at least 7 days between each dose administration. In period 1, one dose of Clexane was administered s.c. into the left or right side of the abdomen (alternating sides with Treatment Period). This dose contained 80 mg enoxaparin sodium (equivalent to 8,000 international units (IU) anti-factor Xa (anti FXa activity) in 0.8 mL of water for injection.</description>
