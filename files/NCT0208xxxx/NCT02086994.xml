    <textblock>
      We aim to compare carbetocin with misoprostol for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage in&#xD;
      patients with severe preeclampsia. The primary outcome is postpartum haemorrhage (blood loss&#xD;
      of ≥ 500 ml) while our Secondary outcomes include use of additional uterotonics, need for&#xD;
      blood transfusion, maternal adverse drug reaction, maternal complications and maternal death&#xD;

      We conducted a prospective non-randomized study at Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,&#xD;
      Benha University Hospital, since March 2013 till June 2015, after approval of the study&#xD;
      protocol by the Local Ethical Committee. A written informed consent was obtained from&#xD;
      eligible women before induction or at early stage of labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with singleton pregnancies of more than 28 weeks' gestation who are admitted to&#xD;
      hospital with severe preeclampsia and candidates for vaginal delivery were eligible for the&#xD;
      study. Preeclampsia is labelled as severe in the presence of any of the following&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Persistent cerebral or visual disturbances or cerebral edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Persistent epigastric pain with nausea or vomiting, or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Systolic ≥160 mmHg or diastolic ≥110 mmHg on 2 occasions at least 6 h apart with the&#xD;
           patient at bed rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Proteinuria of ≥5 g on 24-hour urine collection. Urine dipsticks are not accurate for&#xD;
           this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Oliguria (˂500 mL in 24 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pulmonary edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our exclusion criteria are HELLP syndrome, eclampsia, abruptio placentae, malpresentation,&#xD;
      polyhydramnios, previous uterine scar, chorioamnionitis and multiple pregnancies. All&#xD;
      patients were in stable condition (no evidence of maternal hemodynamic instability or fetal&#xD;
      distress) and their management afterwards followed the standards accepted in our country and&#xD;
      established guidelines for the management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. For&#xD;
      hypertensive crisis the first drug used was hydralazine (5 mg IV every 15 minutes to a&#xD;
      maximum total dose of 20 mg) and, if this was ineffective, Nifedipine (Epilat): 10 to 20 mg&#xD;
      orally / 30 min (max 50 mg), Then 10-20 mg /4-6 h (max 120 mg/day) or labetalol (20 mg IV&#xD;
      every 10 minutes to a maximum total dose of 300 mg). No patient needed additional treatment&#xD;
      for their symptoms or developed antepartum complications that required admission to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit. All patients were evaluated hourly and received magnesium sulphate to&#xD;
      prevent eclampsia during the pregnancy and for a minimum of 24 hours postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients (60) were divided into two groups, Group A (30) received a single dose of&#xD;
      carbetocin (100 μg in 1 mL ampoule, Pabal) while Group B (30) received misoprostol (600 μg, 3&#xD;
      tables) sublingually after the delivery of the anterior shoulder of the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third stage of labour is managed as usual by clamping and cutting of umbilical cord,&#xD;
      waiting for signs of placental separation and delivering the placenta by controlled cord&#xD;
      traction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the 3rd stage of labour is calculated. Patient is kept in labor room under&#xD;
      observation for a period of 1 h and any complaint such as nausea, vomiting, fever, headache,&#xD;
      chills, diarrhoea and shivering is noted. In cases of uterine atony (determined by physical&#xD;
      examination and continuous postpartum bleeding) uterus is massaged and additional uterotonics&#xD;
      were given and noted (oxytocin and/or prostaglandin, at the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      physician). Any requirement for manual removal of the placenta or blood transfusion is also&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following laboratory assessments (hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, and renal and liver&#xD;
      function tests) are performed in every patient on admission and postpartum. Vital signs&#xD;
      (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate) and urine output are measured every hour until&#xD;
      at least 24 hours after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of blood loss A clean plastic lined absorbent drape is placed under the woman's&#xD;
      buttocks to collect all the blood lost after delivery of the baby and drainage of the&#xD;
      amniotic fluid. The drape is changed as many times as needed. The woman stays on the drape or&#xD;
      asked to wear a pad over the next 60 minutes. In the case of severe haemorrhage, we follow&#xD;
      the usual guidelines for management of postpartum haemorrhage, and the supplemental treatment&#xD;
      is registered. All drapes and pads are weighed on an electronic scale and the known dry&#xD;
      weight of the linen is subtracted. As 1 ml of blood weighs close to 1 g, the balance in grams&#xD;
      is assumed to be the total blood loss in ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemoglobin concentration is measured before, 2 hours and 24 hours after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of haemorrhage at labour third phase is determined by observation estimation&#xD;
      considering the amount of blood under the patient. The rate of haemoglobin and haematocrit&#xD;
      are measured at hospitalization and also 2 h, 24 h after delivery and then are recorded. At&#xD;
      this interval, the patients are evaluated in terms of possible complications of administered&#xD;
      drugs such as vomiting, diarrhoea, shivering, pyrexia, and headache).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have the Foley catheter in situ for 24 hours after delivery and the amount of&#xD;
      urine was monitored hourly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has no external funding source. No author had any potential relationships that may&#xD;
      pose conflict of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Our primary outcome measure is postpartum haemorrhage, defined as a blood&#xD;
      loss of ≥ 500 ml. We analyse the blood loss, change in haemoglobin concentration between&#xD;
      admission and discharge. While secondary outcomes include use of additional uterotonics, need&#xD;
      for blood transfusion, maternal adverse drug reaction (such as headache, vomiting, abdominal&#xD;
      pain, pruritus, tacky or bradycardia), sever maternal complications (such as seizures or need&#xD;
      for ICU admission) and maternal death.&#xD;
