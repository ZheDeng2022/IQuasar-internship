      Introduction: Care of frail and dependent elders with multiple chronic conditions is a major&#xD;
      challenge for health care systems. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      coordinating the existing structures in the private and public sector for the care of frail&#xD;
      and dependent persons over age 60, and susceptible of presenting complex bio-psycho-social&#xD;
      issues. This approach is aimed at improving the coordination, continuity, quality and&#xD;
      efficacy of care in this population, which presents a high risk of hospitalization, emergency&#xD;
      room visits, institutionalization and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Three-year cluster randomised controlled trial. A control group receiving usual care&#xD;
      (follow up by primary care physician and home nursing service) will be compared to an&#xD;
      intervention group that will be provided, in addition, in-home multidimensional geriatric&#xD;
      assessment with access to a 24h/7 day a week call service, and coordinated long-term&#xD;
      follow-up. Survival analyses will be conducted to compare the outcomes between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hospitalizations: rates of first hospitalization, number, cause and length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency room visits: rates of first visit, number and cause&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Institutionalization: number of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality: rate and number of deaths and place of death (home versus hospital)&#xD;

      Background Since the second half of the twentieth century, a major prolongation in life&#xD;
      expectancy has led to a rapid increase in the number of older adults in Switzerland, with a&#xD;
      high prevalence of multiple chronic diseases, functional incapacities and cognitive deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, care of the frail elderly is characterized by fragmentation and discontinuity&#xD;
      within and between sectors, resulting in frequent and inappropriate hospitalizations and&#xD;
      premature nursing home placement with an increase in health care costs. Furthermore, many&#xD;
      older patients with progressive chronic diseases prefer to die at home, but more than 50&#xD;
      percent will do so in hospital, with multiple hospitalizations in their final year. This is&#xD;
      mostly related to the availability of health resources in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care-giver burden with increased morbidity in this population is an often hidden consequence&#xD;
      of caring for dependent older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study performed in 2003 at the University Hospital of Geneva emergency room5 showed that&#xD;
      among 255 patients (mean age 79 years) evaluated during a three-month period for inability to&#xD;
      stay at home, 59 percent had no acute medical problem but rather a breakdown of their&#xD;
      informal support system. Ninety per cent were frail and dependent, and 85 percent had not&#xD;
      been evaluated by their primary care physician previous to their arrival to the emergency&#xD;
      room. This study suggests that many needs and disabilities of the frail elderly are not&#xD;
      identified and that the lack of coordination between the different actors of the community&#xD;
      primary health care system does not enable these patients to stay at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, there has been an increasing interest in the ability of integrated models of&#xD;
      care to improve health outcomes and shift service utilization from the institutional setting&#xD;
      into the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrated models of care vary greatly among countries and depend on local health policy,&#xD;
      financing, as well as professional and sociocultural values. Broadly, three different levels&#xD;
      of integration have been described - linkage, coordination and full integration - depending&#xD;
      on the level of integration between the different actors of the administrative, financial and&#xD;
      service sectors with a continuum in the degree of collaboration, ranging from informal to&#xD;
      those structured with all the services included under a single roof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first level or linkage is the organizational model that best applies to Geneva. Patient&#xD;
      care takes place between the primary care physician and existing structures depending on&#xD;
      patient needs. Communication between professionals involved is encouraged in order to promote&#xD;
      continuity of care. However each structure functions under its own legal, financial and&#xD;
      operational environment with no cost shifting between structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No distinct model of integrated care for the frail elderly is in place in the Canton of&#xD;
      Geneva, as collaboration depends on the informal linkage between the actors in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the implementation of the second level of integration by&#xD;
      coordinating existing community resources to improve the care of frail elderly patients&#xD;
      presenting with complex medical and psychosocial issues in the real-life clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A prospective randomized controlled cluster trial with two intervention arms and two&#xD;
      control arms will be conducted. Each arm corresponds to a nursing team in one of two home&#xD;
      nursing service health care centers (Onex and Bernex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the difficulty in randomizing frail complex patients individually, patients were&#xD;
      randomized by nursing teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nursing personnel of each center are divided in two teams of similar size (nine nurses&#xD;
      per team in Onex and six nurses per team in Bernex) and composition. Each team is responsible&#xD;
      for following patients in a predetermined sector, by patient address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team initially began recruitment in July 2009 in the Onex home nursing service&#xD;
      health center. The Bernex center was added in June 2011 in order to reach the recruitment&#xD;
      target. Two nursing teams were identified in each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are assigned to a nursing team depending on their place of residence. The allocation&#xD;
      of the nursing teams to the intervention or to the control arms will be performed by use of a&#xD;
      random number generator. Each nursing team will be designated by a number (1 to 4) and the&#xD;
      first four random numbers generated, allocated to the corresponding team. It was decided&#xD;
      before the process that the highest number in each site would be allocated to the control arm&#xD;
      and the other to the intervention arm. Once a patient is attributed to a team, he or she will&#xD;
      remain so for the entire follow-up period with no transfer of patients between teams. The&#xD;
      recruitment of patients will not be influenced by their health status, since eligibility will&#xD;
      be determined only after the patient is attributed to one group or another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control arm will consists of two clusters of patients over 60 years of age followed by a&#xD;
      primary care physician and routinely evaluated by the home nursing service with the resident&#xD;
      assessment instrument-home care (RAI-HC) and identified as frail by pre-defined clinical&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention arm will consist of two clusters of patients over 60 years of age followed&#xD;
      by a primary care physician and routinely evaluated by the home nursing service with the&#xD;
      RAI-HC and identified as frail by predefined clinical criteria that will receive in addition&#xD;
      an in-home multidimensional geriatric assessment, access 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to a&#xD;
      call service provided by the Community Geriatrics Unit and coordinated long-term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the real-life clinical setting, blinding will not be feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population The target population will be patients over 60 years of age followed by a&#xD;
      primary care physician who prescribes a home intervention by the home nursing service. These&#xD;
      patients, who will be routinely evaluated with the Resident assessment instrument-Home care&#xD;
      (RAI-HC), will be identified as frail if they fulfill predefined clinical criteria (see&#xD;
      inclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home nursing service evaluations are prescribed by the primary care physician usually after&#xD;
      an acute event (fall) or decompensation of a physical or psychological illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population already presents a variable degree of frailty and dependencies that&#xD;
      require in-home interventions by a home nursing service and for which the Community&#xD;
      Geriatrics Unit may be requested by the primary care physician to evaluate the most complex&#xD;
      situations. This, however, is not usual practice. Patients identified were not previously&#xD;
      known to the Community Geriatrics Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geographical setting The Canton of Geneva has a population of 466,918 inhabitants, 16 percent&#xD;
      of which are 65 and over. Most of the elderly population live at home, 14 percent of which&#xD;
      live in nursing homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was carried out in two of the 45 communes of the Canton of Geneva: Onex with à&#xD;
      population of 17,942 and Bernex, with a population of 9,772 inhabitants. These communes were&#xD;
      chosen because of their size and geographical proximity to the Community Geriatrics Unit site&#xD;
      at Loex and of the good collaboration with the primary care physicians of the region. Each&#xD;
      commune has a home nursing service health center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The socioeconomic status is similar and homogeneous in this population and should not present&#xD;
      a confounding factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up in the intervention group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each patient will be routinely administered the RAI-HC by the assigned home care nurse.&#xD;
           If inclusion criteria are present, the nurse will present the protocol orally and in&#xD;
           writing to the patient and/or his or her caregiver. It is clearly specified in the&#xD;
           written information that the patient will not incur any extra out-of-pocket expenses&#xD;
           since in-home geriatric assessment is reimbursed by the health insurance. The visit is&#xD;
           90 %reimbursed by the patient health insurance (private and obligatory). The remaining&#xD;
           10 percent deductible will be waived by the Community Geriatrics Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If consent is obtained, patient information will be transmitted to the research nurse&#xD;
           for CHIP score calculation based on the RAI-HC data and inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Community Geriatrics Unit doctor will inform the primary care physician of his or&#xD;
           her patient's inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Community Geriatrics Unit doctor will contact the patient to schedule an in-home&#xD;
           multidimensional geriatric assessment. If necessary, an evaluation will be performed by&#xD;
           another member of the Community Geriatrics Unit team, such as a physical therapist,&#xD;
           occupational therapist, psychologist, dietician or social worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The results and recommendations of this evaluation will be transmitted to the primary&#xD;
           care physician and to the home care nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coordinated follow-up between the primary care physician, the home nursing service nurse&#xD;
           and the Community Geriatrics Unit will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be receive written instructions (information will be available in their&#xD;
           home log book) about whom to contact in case of an acute health problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first person to contact is the primary care physician;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If not available, the home nursing service nurse (imad) should be contacted;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The nurse or the patient should contact the call service of the Community Geriatrics&#xD;
           Unit that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for an urgent intervention to be&#xD;
           carried out by telephone and/or a home visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Team meetings between the primary care physician, home nursing service and Community&#xD;
           Geriatrics Unit will be scheduled as needed to discuss complex situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up in the control group During the same period, patients who are followed by the&#xD;
      nursing team assigned to the control arm will be administered the RAI-HC. If frailty criteria&#xD;
      are detected, patient information will be transmitted to the research nurse for CHIP score&#xD;
      calculation and inclusion in the study. Patients will continue receiving usual care and&#xD;
      follow-up by the primary care physician and the home nursing service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The planned sample size of 300 (150 per arm) was calculated based on a 5 percent&#xD;
      alpha error (two-sided) and a power of 80 percent to detect a difference in hospitalizations&#xD;
      of 12 percent. This difference was based on a previous meta-analysis of controlled studies&#xD;
      that utilized comprehensive geriatric assessment.24 The expected hospitalization rate in&#xD;
      frail elders is approximately 30 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, 150 patients will be recruited sequentially, randomized by cluster arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calendar Recruitment began in July 2009. The study was initially programmed for 18 months.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, due to circumstances related to the real-life clinical setting, there were many&#xD;
      challenges. Recruitment was delayed in 2010 during the five-month maternity leave of the&#xD;
      research nurse, who was difficult to replace. Furthermore also in 2010, the home nursing&#xD;
      service health care center of Onex moved its offices, causing recruitment delays. Finally in&#xD;
      2011, the Bernex home nursing service team had to deal with a period of transition to a&#xD;
      computerized record system, and a new research nurse had to be hired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment target was reached on July 1, 2012 with follow up of outcomes until December&#xD;
      15, 2012. Data analysis and manuscript redaction will be carried out in 2013-2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Departments of&#xD;
      Internal Medicine and Community Medicine of the University Hospital of Geneva on August 26,&#xD;
      2008 (Protocol No. 08-128) as well as the Ethics Committee of the Geneva Medical Association&#xD;
      for clinical ambulatory research on October 24, 2008 (Protocol number: 08-06).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed consent was obtained after allocation to the intervention group, since integrated care&#xD;
      is not routinely part of usual care. Consent for the control group was waived by the ethics&#xD;
      committees, given that all patients were already being followed by the home nursing service&#xD;
      that routinely obtains consent to use collected data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of intervention efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hospitalizations: rates of first hospitalization, number, cause and length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency room visits: rates of first visit, number and cause&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Institutionalization: number of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality: rate and number of deaths and place of death (home versus hospital)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection In both groups, the research nurse will collect data from patients'&#xD;
      computerized hospital records, computerized home nursing service records and records from the&#xD;
      Community Geriatrics Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected in all patients will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alarms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical diagnosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of consultations at home for an acute problem (by telephone or a home visit) by&#xD;
           the Community Geriatrics Unit physician, the primary care physician or other emergency&#xD;
           services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Descriptive results will be reported by counts and percentages or by&#xD;
      means and standard deviations. Characteristics between groups will be compared using exact&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney, Chi-squared or Fisher tests. The main and secondary outcomes will be compared&#xD;
      in intention to treat between intervention and control groups by using survival analyses. For&#xD;
      mortality, the Kaplan-Meier survival estimator, log-rank test and Cox regression model will&#xD;
      be used. As death is a competing event for the other outcomes (institutionalization, first&#xD;
      hospitalization and first emergency room visit), competing risk models will be used. The&#xD;
      cumulated incidences and the hazard ratio will be obtained with the package cmprsk for R&#xD;
      version 3.0.1. All reported hazard ratios will be adjusted by health care center and the&#xD;
      tests for comparison of cumulated incidence over follow-up period will stratified by health&#xD;
      care center. Cumulated incidence at one, two and three years will be compared using a Wald&#xD;
      test. Two-sided p-values less than 0.05 are considered significant. All analyses will be&#xD;
      performed using S-Plus 8.0 for Windows and R version 3.0.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding Funding of swiss francs 94,500 ($104,241) was obtained from the Quality Bureau of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Geneva in December 2008. This amount was used to hire a part-time (50&#xD;
      percent) research nurse assistant to coordinate the study, collect data and manage the&#xD;
      database from July 2009. Additional funding of swiss francs 66,000 ($72,800) was obtained&#xD;
      from the Edmond J. Safra Fund in order to continue the study in October 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion Care of the frail and dependent elderly is usually characterized by frequent and&#xD;
      unnecessary hospitalizations, emergency room visits and institutionalization. Most patients&#xD;
      express the desire to die at home but most will do so in hospital, in many cases due either&#xD;
      by the absence of a caregiver or by lack of coordinated care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators postulate that these outcomes can be achieved by implementing an integrated&#xD;
      care network, with close coordination between the different actors as well as access to a&#xD;
      specialized community geriatrics unit that includes a round-the-clock call service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors of the study will also seek to demonstrate that the establishment of such a&#xD;
      network is feasible and will provide effective and efficient health care for this population.&#xD;
      If the results are positive, it is hoped that political decision-makers in the health care&#xD;
      sector will be encouraged to further implement and support such programs.&#xD;
