      The following study investigates the role of information/expectancies in the response to&#xD;
      Ibumetin and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial with crossover, within subjects&#xD;
      repeated measurements. The symptoms are measured by questionnaires. 40 patients will be&#xD;
      included in the study. The administrated drug is Ibumetin 400 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not require patients to meet in the clinic. Patients will be instructed in how&#xD;
      to report pain, tension and nervousness via mobile phone (Checkware AS, Trondheim,&#xD;
      Norway).Three days a week for 12 weeks the patients are instructed to report at 0900 AM, and&#xD;
      thereafter at 0910, 1100, 1300, 1500, 1700, and 1900 hrs each study day. At these times the&#xD;
      patients will receive a sms where they are instructed to immediately rate their pain and&#xD;
      stress level and report back.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial with crossover, within subjects&#xD;
      repeated measurements. The symptoms are measured by questionnaires. 40 patients will be&#xD;
      included in the study. Patients are recruited via the Department of Rheumatology, UNN. The&#xD;
      patient group is selected because they respond well to NSAIDs. Since the patients can&#xD;
      participate while being at home it is not a requirement to live in Tromsø.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patients are recruited their normal treatment plan is examined. This includes both&#xD;
      their prescript treatment from the patient's physicians and also non-prescript substances,&#xD;
      such as herbal medicine. If these drugs or substances inflict with the study treatment plan,&#xD;
      the patients will be excluded. The patient will follow the study treatment plan on study days&#xD;
      only, which is three days during the week. During the study days the patients will be&#xD;
      required to abstain from any other substances that can influence the treatment, such as&#xD;
      alcohol, both prescription and nonprescription drugs and herbal medicine. After 19:00 the&#xD;
      study day is over and other medication can be taken. On the non-study days the patients can&#xD;
      follow their normal treatment plan, but if the following day is a study day, no medication&#xD;
      can be consumed after 21:00.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients can at any time withdraw from the study. A patient who withdraws from the study&#xD;
      will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not require patients to meet in the clinic. The patients can be at home, at&#xD;
      work or performing their daily routines as they participate. Information about the procedures&#xD;
      of self-administration will either be given to the patients in written form through mail or&#xD;
      in person by the experimenter. Patients will be instructed in how to report pain, tension and&#xD;
      nervousness via mobile phone (Checkware AS, Trondheim, Norway). Data from the sms is&#xD;
      automatically saved in a database administrated by Checkware AS and the research team. The&#xD;
      patient's phone number is connected to a patient ID number in the database. The patients name&#xD;
      is connected to the same identification number in a different document safely secured on a&#xD;
      different hard disk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Submission via sms has the advantage that most people have their mobile phone with them at&#xD;
      most times. Additionally, the time of recording is registered, which cannot be reliably done&#xD;
      via paper and pencil recordings. Three days a week for 12 weeks the patients are instructed&#xD;
      to report at 0900 AM, and thereafter at 0910, 1100, 1300, 1500, 1700, and 1900 hrs each study&#xD;
      day. At these times the patients will receive a sms where they are instructed to immediately&#xD;
      rate their pain and stress level and report back. If they do not report within 10 minutes&#xD;
      they will receive a new sms as a reminder. Patients will also be instructed to send in the&#xD;
      SF-36 and the Fear of Pain Questionnaire at the inclusion of the study, midway and at the&#xD;
      final day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: pain intensity and pain unpleasantness are measured by numerical rating&#xD;
      scales (NRS) via sms. Perceived health related quality of life measured with Sort Form (36)&#xD;
      Health Survey in Norwegian translation [22]. Secondary endpoints: tension and nervousness&#xD;
      measured on NRS via sms. Fear of pain measured by The Fear of Pain Questionnaire III in&#xD;
      Norwegian translation [23].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires Short Form (36) Health Survey The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF(36)) is a&#xD;
      standardized and validated self-report questionnaire that assesses how patient perceive their&#xD;
      own health. It is normally used to measure health status in clinical studies. The present&#xD;
      study will use a Norwegian translation of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fear of Pain Questionnaire III The Fear of Pain Questionnaire III (FPQ-III) is a&#xD;
      standardized and validated self-report questionnaire that assesses fear of pain. It contains&#xD;
      of 30 items involving three subscales: Severe pain, minor pain and medical pain. Each item is&#xD;
      rated on a five-point Likert scale, were 1=no fear and 5=extreme fear. The present study will&#xD;
      use a Norwegian translation of the FPQ-III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical control and placebo Kragerø Tablettproduksjon (in Kragerø, Norway) will be&#xD;
      responsible for the pharmaceutical control. The administrated drug is Ibumetin 400 mg&#xD;
      (http://www.felleskatalogen.no/medisin/ibumetin-takeda-nycomed-559938). The placebo is&#xD;
      capsules containing sugar spheres produced by Kragerø Tablettproduksjon. To secure that the&#xD;
      Ibumetin and the placebo looks identical; the Ibumetin will be purchased by Kragerø&#xD;
      Tablettproduksjon from the producer of Ibumetin, Takeda Nycomed, and then sealed in identical&#xD;
      capsules as the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kragerø Tablettproduksjon will label and pack the entire 12 week treatment. The treatment&#xD;
      dose for each day will be put in separate containers. The containers will be marked with a&#xD;
      number from 1-35 representing the specific treatment day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment order is different for each patient, and Kragerø Tablettproduksjon has received&#xD;
      the treatment order for every patient from the Department of Psychology, UiT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patients have been enrolled they receive an ID-number. To secure double blinding an&#xD;
      independent researcher at the Department of Psychology, who is not involved in the study,&#xD;
      will administer the ID-number distribution using www.random.org. The ID-number is also linked&#xD;
      to a specific order of treatment and the order of treatment is different for every patient.&#xD;
      The lists (1) linking each patient to their ID-number and (2) linking the treatment order to&#xD;
      the different ID-numbers will be filed separately from other study information and not be&#xD;
      released to the conductors. However, if circumstance requires, such as severe side effects&#xD;
      resulting in hospital admission or death (see below), the blinding for the specific patient&#xD;
      or patients will be released to the conductors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2 drug (Ibumetin and placebo) x 3 information (no information, positive, neutral) within&#xD;
      subjects repeated measures (pre-test, 6 post-tests) design will be conducted. All patients&#xD;
      will be tested in all conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition 1: Baseline: Pain and stress registered, Ibumetin placebo not administrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition 2: Ibumetin: Ibumetin administrated. No information about the effect. Condition 3:&#xD;
      Placebo: Placebo administrated. No information about the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition 4: Ibumetin + Positive Information: Ibumetin administrated. The patients receive&#xD;
      written information that the capsule is Ibumetin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition 5: Placebo + Positive Information: Placebo administrated. The patients receive&#xD;
      written information that the capsule is Ibumetin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition 6: Ibumetin + Neutral Information: Ibumetin administrated. The patients receive&#xD;
      written information that the capsule is placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition 7: Placebo + Neutral Information: Placebo administrated. The patients receive&#xD;
      written information that the capsule is placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that have been enrolled and have signed the informed consent are informed about the&#xD;
      purpose of the experiment and the procedures. Patients will orally self-administer 4 capsules&#xD;
      containing Ibumetin 400 mg or identical looking capsules with placebo every Monday, Wednesday&#xD;
      and Friday morning for 12 consecutive weeks in their home environment. The administrated&#xD;
      treatment dose of Ibumetin is normal in treatment of pain in patients with Axial SpA. The&#xD;
      patients will report their score on the outcome variables via mobile phone in accordance with&#xD;
      the schedule mentioned above. The seven conditions are presented five times to each&#xD;
      participant, for 35 days, with one workday between each condition. For the first seven study&#xD;
      days, each condition is run once, for study days eight to 14 each condition is run once, etc.&#xD;
      Thus, the 35 study days are comprised of five blocks of seven study days, in which all&#xD;
      conditions are presented. The order of presentations of the conditions is random within each&#xD;
      block and is different in all participants. The subjects are allowed to take non-study&#xD;
      medicine on non-study days and after 1900 hours on study days, but not after 2100 hours if&#xD;
      the following day is a study day. The SF-36 and FOP questionnaires are filled in upon&#xD;
      inclusion in the study, and again after study days 17 and 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will receive the capsules in Nolato 50 ml/34 mm containers (box: Art.no&#xD;
      C112863 Cerbo Classic 50 ml white, lid: Art.nr.: C112820 Cerbo Classic SC 34 white) with all&#xD;
      relevant information . The patients will also be encouraged to contact the conductors by&#xD;
      phone if they have any questions or worries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be informed that it is necessary to follow the treatment protocol precisely&#xD;
      as described, and that any variance will compromise the study. The patients will be equipped&#xD;
      with a &quot;study journal&quot;. In the study journal the patients have to register what time they&#xD;
      take their treatment and if they consume all the capsules. The patients also have to register&#xD;
      what substances they consume on non-study days. The study journal will also have a note&#xD;
      section. In this section the patients can note what they think of the treatment, how they&#xD;
      feel, if they experience any side effects, if they experience any new medical incidences or&#xD;
      if they feel stressed and uncomfortable. They also have to register if they have followed the&#xD;
      treatment plan as requested and if they have answered the questionnaires. When the study is&#xD;
      completed the patients will be asked if they did follow the treatment protocol exactly, and&#xD;
      encouraged to be truthful. If they report any mistakes or variance, it will be noted and&#xD;
      included in the analysis.&#xD;
