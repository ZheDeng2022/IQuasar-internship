    <textblock>
      This study is being initiated to create a normal database including measures of optic nerve&#xD;
      head (ONH), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and macula using the Heidelberg&#xD;
      Spectralis OCT device. The range will be determined for each structural parameter across&#xD;
      normal eyes in Japanese subjects, and the measurements stratified according to age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, prospective, observational (non-interventional) study is the second in a&#xD;
      series to measure structural parameters of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary retinal&#xD;
      nerve fiber layer, and the macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device. This study is&#xD;
      conducted in normal Japanese volunteers. The main goal of the study is to provide the range&#xD;
      of these structural parameters in normal eyes. The study will include at least 224&#xD;
      (enrollment target: 249) normal volunteers; each study site will recruit 32 to 40 subjects&#xD;
      with an age range of 18 to 90 years and an approximately equal number of females and males.&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo Spectralis OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination,&#xD;
      disc photography and visual field testing in one single visit. All examinations performed on&#xD;
      the subjects are non-significant risk procedures because the medical devices are cleared for&#xD;
      marketing in Europe and in the U.S.&#xD;

        At least 224 Japanese subjects (enrollment target: 249 subjects) will be selected from&#xD;
        qualifying normal volunteers. Age ranges will be from ≥18 to 90 years. Recruitment will be&#xD;
        from persons who respond to recruitment initiatives at the individual centers or have&#xD;
        signed a release saying that they are willing to be approached for participation in&#xD;
        research.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is not an employee of the eye clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 to 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to undergo the test procedures, give consent, and to follow&#xD;
             instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy eye without prior intraocular surgery (except cataract surgery) and without&#xD;
             clinically significant vitreal, retinal or choroidal diseases, clinically significant&#xD;
             diabetic retinopathy (subject may have diabetes), or disease of the optic nerve. Small&#xD;
             Drusen are acceptable in older subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Japanese decent (self-reported).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative history of glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intraocular pressure ≤21mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best corrected visual acuity ≥0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refraction between +6 and -6 diopters and astigmatism ≤ 2 diopters.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Axial length ≤ 26.0 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal visual field with Glaucoma Hemifield Test and Mean Deviation within normal&#xD;
             limits, or not abnormal visual field by judgment of the ophthalmologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically normal appearance of the optic disc, with normal appearing neuroretinal rim&#xD;
             with respect to color and shape. The optic disc is examined ophthalmoscopically and by&#xD;
             evaluation of stereo photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  When both eyes are eligible, both eyes enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unreliable visual field. The reliability indices should be used as guide as well as&#xD;
             the perimetrist's notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unusable disc stereo photos.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to undergo the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insufficient quality of Spectralis OCT images (this is not determined until after&#xD;
             Spectralis OCT examination, and is an unusual circumstance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Minimum requirements are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Retina completely included in image frame,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Quality Score ≥ 20 in the stored ART mean images, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For ONH-R scan: Center position error ≤ 100 μm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Inability of a subject to perform one of the two scan patterns or insufficient image&#xD;
        quality in one scan pattern does not exclude the subject or eye from the study.&#xD;
