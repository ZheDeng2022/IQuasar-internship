  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center, Phase II study to evaluate dabrafenib and&#xD;
      trametinib combination therapy in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive, unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic Acral lentiginous or cutaneous melanoma. This study will evaluate the objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), duration of response, overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), safety and efficacy, to assess steady state (all subjects) exposure to dabrafenib,&#xD;
      dabrafenib metabolites, and trametinib and characterize the population pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) of dabrafenib and trametinib. Subjects will be enrolled and will&#xD;
      receive dabrafenib 150 milligram (mg) orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once&#xD;
      daily. Treatment will continue until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, or study closure. After treatment discontinuation, subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for survival and disease progression as applicable.&#xD;
