  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, fixed sequence study in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation&#xD;
      positive tumors. Subjects will receive single oral doses of 10 milligram (mg) of rosuvastatin&#xD;
      and 3 mg of midazolam in the morning of Day 1 (alone), Day 8 (with first dose of dabrafenib&#xD;
      150 mg), and Day 22 (during repeat dose dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily [BID]). Dabrafenib 150&#xD;
      mg BID will be administered from Day 8 to Day 23. Blood samples for PK analysis will be&#xD;
      obtained over 32 hours post-dose on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 22. The last dose of dabrafenib&#xD;
      will be taken in the morning of Day 23 and the last blood sample in the evening of Day 23.&#xD;
      Subjects will be considered to have completed the study once the 32 hour PK sample has been&#xD;
      collected on Day 23. Once they have completed the study, eligible subjects may have the&#xD;
      option to enter study BRF114144, an open-label roll-over study of dabrafenib (no follow-up&#xD;
      visit required) and continue receiving dabrafenib.&#xD;
