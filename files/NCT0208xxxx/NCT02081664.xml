  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients report relief of symptoms after amalgam removal. However, a large group of&#xD;
      patients are still suffering from partly severe health complaints even after the removal of&#xD;
      amalgam. To date, no biological/medical explanation for these Amalgam attributed health&#xD;
      complaints is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to develop an integrated medical care rehabilitation program&#xD;
      and determine if it is a valid and feasible treatment for patients with persistent symptoms&#xD;
      after amalgam removal. Such a comprehensive concept has to date not been operationalized in&#xD;
      Norway, but information about the feasibility and the challenges around such a rehabilitation&#xD;
      program are required, in order to prepare for a possible controlled and randomized study&#xD;
      evaluating the effects of the suggested integrative care treatment program. This treatment&#xD;
      program will focus on &quot;learning by practicing&quot;, hence the study participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      into a group program focusing on life-style changes. In addition to the life-style oriented&#xD;
      group program, an individualized treatment strategy with therapies out of the spectrum of&#xD;
      Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) will be part of the treatment program. This part&#xD;
      of the program is based on the results of a survey, related to use of CAM therapies,&#xD;
      conducted in 2012 among the members of the patient organization &quot;Forbundet Tenner og Helse&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of this treatment program must amongst other inclusion criteria have removed all&#xD;
      dental amalgam fillings and experience symptoms which have not disappeared after removal of&#xD;
      the dental fillings. Specific exclusion criteria are stated. The group program consists of 12&#xD;
      sessions which are held once per week for a whole day. Added to this is a choice of CAM&#xD;
      therapies from a hierarchic list, established from the survey, and which accordingly is based&#xD;
      on risk/benefit judgment. Data collection will take place at baseline, after 12 weeks (end of&#xD;
      treatment), and three month later. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of an&#xD;
      integrated medical care rehabilitation program for patients in Norway who have had their&#xD;
      Amalgam fillings removed, but still suffer from Amalgam attributed symptoms. It combines a&#xD;
      lifestyle oriented group program with individualized CAM therapies in form of an outpatient&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
