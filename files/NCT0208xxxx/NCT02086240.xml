    <textblock>
      The Translocator Protein (TSPO) is a protein which reaches very high levels when there is&#xD;
      inflammation in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, radioligands have been developed which attach to the TSPO (a radioligand is a drug&#xD;
      which has been tagged with radioactivity). Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging,&#xD;
      the radioligand can be detected following injection into a patient. However, it is difficult&#xD;
      to accurately measure the amount of TSPO using PET at the moment. This is because the brain&#xD;
      does not have a &quot;reference region&quot; for TSPO (ie an area in the brain with no TSPO at all).&#xD;
      &quot;Reference regions&quot; are very useful to help work out how much of a PET signal represents&#xD;
      &quot;specific binding&quot; (of the radioligand to the target of interest), and how much represents&#xD;
      &quot;non specific binding&quot; (of the radioligand to many other structures which are not of&#xD;
      interest). In the absence of a reference region, non specific binding can be estimated by&#xD;
      giving a drug which binds to the TSPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug prevents the radioligand binding the TSPO and (in a manner of speaking) &quot;creates&quot; a&#xD;
      temporary reference region so non specific binding can be measured. To do this, we will use&#xD;
      XBD173 (Emapunil is an anxiolytic drug which acts as a selective agonist at the peripheral&#xD;
      benzodiazepine receptor) to bind TSPO and block binding of the PET ligand ([11C]PBR28), a&#xD;
      TSPO ligand from the phenoxyarlyacetamide class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most TSPO PET studies (and in one of our previous studies approved by West London REC)&#xD;
      quantify the signal using a ratio of specific binding in the brain to radioactivity in the&#xD;
      blood. This requires arterial line insertion which is burdensome for subjects, and increases&#xD;
      variability. In this study we aim to determine the ratio of specific binding in the brain to&#xD;
      nonspecific binding in the brain by using the temporary reference region. For more accuracy&#xD;
      the participants will repeat the scanning procedure so determine test-retest variability of&#xD;
      the amount of TSPO.&#xD;

      The Translocator Protein (TSPO) is a protein which reaches very high levels when there is&#xD;
      inflammation in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, radioligands have been developed which attach to the TSPO (a radioligand is a drug&#xD;
      which has been tagged with radioactivity). Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging,&#xD;
      the radioligand can be detected following injection into a patient. However, it is difficult&#xD;
      to accurately measure the amount of TSPO using PET at the moment. This is because the brain&#xD;
      does not have a &quot;reference region&quot; for TSPO (ie an area in the brain with no TSPO at all).&#xD;
      &quot;Reference regions&quot; are very useful to help work out how much of a PET signal represents&#xD;
      &quot;specific binding&quot; (of the radioligand to the target of interest), and how much represents&#xD;
      &quot;non specific binding&quot; (of the radioligand to many other structures which are not of&#xD;
      interest). In the absence of a reference region, non specific binding can be estimated by&#xD;
      giving a drug which binds to the TSPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug prevents the radioligand binding the TSPO and (in a manner of speaking) &quot;creates&quot; a&#xD;
      temporary reference region so non specific binding can be measured. The aim of this study,&#xD;
      therefore, is to develop a method to allow accurate quantification of TSPO expression in the&#xD;
      brain of healthy subjects. The study will also include patients with multiple sclerosis to&#xD;
      determine the reproducibility of the 11C-PBR28 PET signal in a population which is&#xD;
      characterised by a raised TSPO signal. This is vital since 11C-PBR28 PET signal is being&#xD;
      evaluated as a marker of disease activity and treatment response, in conditions characterised&#xD;
      by neuroinflammation including MS. If there is high test re-test variability in people with&#xD;
      raised TSPO signal, this argues against the usefulness of 11C-PBR28 PET for these purposes.To&#xD;
      do this, we will use XBD173 (Emapunil is an anxiolytic drug which acts as a selective agonist&#xD;
      at the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) to bind TSPO and block binding of the PET ligand&#xD;
      ([11C]PBR28), a TSPO ligand from the phenoxyarlyacetamide class. Because different people&#xD;
      possess different types of TSPO (due to a genetic difference between subjects, there are 3&#xD;
      types of TSPO expression patterns) it will be important to study subjects from each of the 3&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study healthy volunteers and patients with multiple sclerosis. Each subject will&#xD;
      undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening visit, to take blood and determine the TSPO subtype of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study day 1: the subject will undergo two PET/CT scans and an MRI scan of the brain.&#xD;
           This will involve insertion of an arterial line. In between the two PET scans, the&#xD;
           subject will be given an oral dose of XBD173 (up to 90mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study day 2: Repeat of the procedures of Study day 1. Only one MRI scan will be done&#xD;
           during one of the two study visits. Recruitment Healthy volunteers will be recruited&#xD;
           from posters (including e-posters on electronic notice boards and emails), announcements&#xD;
           in lectures, and word of mouth around Imperial College campuses. MS patients will be&#xD;
           recruited from Neurology clinics across the Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust Hospitals,&#xD;
           such as Charing Cross Hospital and St Mary's Hospital. Patients may be referred from&#xD;
           University College London Hospital and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery&#xD;
           if suitable for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male or female participants between 18 to 70 will be included. Women of child bearing&#xD;
      potential will undergo a urinary pregnancy test prior to scanning to ensure they are not&#xD;
      pregnant.&#xD;
