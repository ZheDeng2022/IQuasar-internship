      All patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for any&#xD;
      underlying disease will be monitored for severe infections by gram negative bacteria (SIGNB)&#xD;
      during the engraftment period. The follow up will be stopped at 4 months from the day of&#xD;
      transplant. About 50 transplant centers will be involved in the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Severe Infections by Gram Negative Bacteria (SIGNB) remain an important cause of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in patients submitted to stem cell transplant particularly during engraftment&#xD;
      while patients suffer of profound and prolonged neutropenia or during subsequent neutropenia&#xD;
      periods related to loss of engraftment or viral infections. Epidemiology of severe infections&#xD;
      by gram negative bacteria in stem cell transplant patients has varied in the last decades due&#xD;
      to the increasing use of highly immunosuppressive stem cell transplant procedures, and in&#xD;
      relation to global epidemiological phenomena involving several populations of&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients including those submitted to stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidemiological evolution of severe infections by gram negative bacteria in&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients is represented also by the emergence of infections caused by&#xD;
      Gram-negative bacilli, in particular enterobacteria, resistant to several antimicrobials.&#xD;
      Such pattern of susceptibility to antibacterial agents represents a challenging issue in the&#xD;
      currents strategies of the use of antibiotics in prophylaxis or therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite an increasing attention to the clinical and therapeutic aspects of infection in stem&#xD;
      cell transplant recipients, contrasting data are available on the incidence, microbiologic&#xD;
      characteristics and clinical outcome of Severe Infections by Gram Negative Bacteria in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of patients submitted to stem cell transplant is frequently complicated by Severe&#xD;
      Infections by Gram Negative Bacteria which may represent an obstacle to the transplant&#xD;
      procedure. Severe Infections by Gram Negative Bacteria caused by microorganisms resistant to&#xD;
      betalactamic antibiotics, which are the golden standard in the empirical antibacterial&#xD;
      therapy of febrile neutropenia, represent a challenging problem. A revision of the&#xD;
      antibacterial strategies and the consideration of new molecules with different antibacterial&#xD;
      mechanism of action should be considered in the light of the emerging epidemiology.&#xD;
      Antimicrobial prophylaxis, diagnostic approaches and antimicrobial therapy should be adapted&#xD;
      to the infectious risk of the transplant population according to stem cell source,&#xD;
      conditioning regimen and also to the infectious history before transplant. A crucial problem&#xD;
      in the definition of these strategies is represented by the continuous change in the&#xD;
      epidemiological patterns of infections as a result of the modification of risk factors in the&#xD;
      transplant population and of the global epidemiology of hospital and community acquired&#xD;
      infections. In particular the emergence of antibiotic resistant enterobacteria represents a&#xD;
      serious problem which dramatically impacts on the antibacterial prophylaxis and treatments&#xD;
      choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator think that a continuous epidemiology survey is required in order to better&#xD;
      define proper prevention, diagnostic and treatment approaches. A common problem in the&#xD;
      infections control in immunocompromised populations is represented by the lack of&#xD;
      epidemiological consciousness in the single centres and its relationship with the local&#xD;
      policy in the use of antibacterial drugs. A prospective, multicenter survey of Severe&#xD;
      Infections by Gram Negative Bacteria by antibiotic resistant pathogens, in particular&#xD;
      enterobacteria, may be a useful tool to evaluate the epidemiological patterns of infections,&#xD;
      their impact on the overall survival, and a critical analysis of the use of antibacterial&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator of this study think that the results of this survey may offer precious&#xD;
      indications for the timely update of the prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment strategies of&#xD;
      Severe Infections by Gram Negative Bacteria in patients undergoing a stem cell transplant&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important aspect of this study is represented by the involvement of both stem cell&#xD;
      transplant and microbiology Italian societies, the GITMO Gruppo Italiano per il Trapianto di&#xD;
      Midollo Osseo, cellule staminali emopoietiche e terapia cellulare and the AMCLI Associazione&#xD;
      Microbiologi Clinici Italiani respectively, as a &quot;joint venture&quot; in the study of the clinical&#xD;
      and microbiological aspects of Severe Infections by Gram Negative Bacteria in the autologous&#xD;
      and allogeneic stem cell transplant populations. Investigators of both GITMO and AMCLI are&#xD;
      involved in the design, writing and monitoring of the study and for each participating&#xD;
      transplant center a clinician, responsible for the clinical data, and a microbiologist,&#xD;
      responsible for the microbiological data, will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objectives of this study are to prospectively evaluate the epidemiology of Severe&#xD;
      Infections by Gram Negative Bacteria by antibiotic resistant pathogens in autologous and&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplant patients during the engraftment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients submitted to autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant for any&#xD;
      underlying disease in about 50 Italian transplant centers will be prospectively monitored for&#xD;
      severe infections by gram negative bacteria during the engraftment period. The follow up will&#xD;
      be stopped at 4 months from the day of transplant. Risk factors, incidence and prognostic&#xD;
      factors of Severe Infections by Gram Negative Bacteria will be evaluated in the overall&#xD;
      population and in subpopulations according to different transplant characteristics. Data on&#xD;
      in vitro susceptibility patterns of the microorganisms and on the antibacterials used in&#xD;
      prophylaxis and therapy will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses will be performed for all Severe Infections by Gram Negative Bacteria&#xD;
      cases occurring among patients enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles derived from the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, the CGP and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will use the E-CRF in apposite web site. Data will be&#xD;
      collected in E-CRF (electronic case report form) for the registration of clinical data&#xD;
      through a special web portal dedicated to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are responsible for the preparation and storage of clinical data concerning the&#xD;
      clinical trial in accordance with ICH guidelines for good clinical practice. Access to&#xD;
      clinical data should be reserved exclusively to authorized personnel. Investigators will have&#xD;
      to verify and ensure the strict confidentiality of records that could identify patients in&#xD;
      compliance with standards on privacy and personal data in accordance with Italian&#xD;
      legislation. On data collection forms (and related documentation) patients should be uniquely&#xD;
      identified by date of birth and the code of enrolment. The full name of the patient will&#xD;
      never be used in any communication and / or correspondence. Will be required direct access to&#xD;
      the patient's original medical records for verification and monitoring of clinical data. The&#xD;
      investigators are obliged to inform patients that their medical records could be verified,&#xD;
      without breach of confidentiality of personal data. Investigators will have to allow&#xD;
      monitoring of clinical data related to the study, the revisions IRB / IEC and inspections by&#xD;
      regulatory authorities in accordance with Italian legislation, providing direct access to the&#xD;
      medical records of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The national coordination of the study is carried out by the Office of Clinical Trials GITMO.&#xD;
      The Office of Clinical Trials GITMO will act as the Data Management Center and quality&#xD;
      control, providing for data management and administrative support throughout the course of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
