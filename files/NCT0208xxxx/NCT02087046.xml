  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the ANS&#xD;
      Totally Implantable Deep Brain Stimulation System in the VIM nucleus of the thalamus&#xD;
      implanted for the treatment of tremor due to essential tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be included in the Pre-Market Approval Application to support the safety of&#xD;
      this device in use.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, multi-centered study for 365 days in duration from&#xD;
      device implantation. A maximum of 12 sites will enroll 160 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be screened and then undergo a baseline evaluation followed by unilateral&#xD;
      or bilateral implantation of the DBS system. During the implantation procedure, each patient&#xD;
      will undergo a trial of stimulation in the operating room. The device may be internalized&#xD;
      after a successful intra-operative trial or at a later surgery (no later than 4 weeks after&#xD;
      initial lead placement). If the device is not activated immediately postsurgery, the patient&#xD;
      may return to the clinic to determine optimum stimulation programming. Device programming&#xD;
      will be optimized in as many visits as necessary following implantation. The day that the&#xD;
      device is fully implanted will be classified as &quot;Day 0&quot; for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After &quot;Day 0&quot; the patient will return to clinic for evaluations at, Day 90 (±14 days), and&#xD;
      Day 180 (±14 days) and Day 365 (approximately 12 months ± 30 days after Day 0). These&#xD;
      evaluations consist of the CRST, the QUEST, the SF36, Patient and caregiver Global Ratings&#xD;
      and the Patient Satisfaction Rating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Baseline and Day 180, the CRST evaluation session will be video recorded for analysis by&#xD;
      an independent evaluator unaware of the functioning of the device. Additionally, at the Day&#xD;
      180 visit, the physician will have the option to provide the patient with amplitude control.&#xD;
      A comparison of measures within the same person from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be&#xD;
      performed. Also, pre-treatment and post-treatment group means and standard deviations will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients completed follow-up visits as part of the original protocol (C-04-02) for one year&#xD;
      (or in some cases longer if patient was bilaterally implanted) and continued to complete&#xD;
      additional visits as part of the Long-Term Follow-up protocol (C-06-03) for up to 5 years&#xD;
      post implant.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of Life in Essential Tremor (QUEST): Overall Summary Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The QUEST questionnaire consists of 30 items, which are rated from 0 to 4, corresponding to the frequency (from never to always). Those 30 items assess how tremor impacts a function or how it can be associated with feelings or attitudes. The 30 items contribute to five sub scales (number of items contributing to each scale in parentheses): Physical/ADL (9), Psychosocial (9), Communication (3), Hobbies/Leisure (3), and Work/Finances (6). The score on each sub scale is expressed as a percentage of the total score possible, with a higher score indicating greater dissatisfaction with that domain of QOL. As the scores were expressed as percentages, if a question was unanswered it was excluded and percentages were calculated based on the remaining answers. A total or quest summary index (QSI) was computed by calculating the mean of the five scales. Maximal score of 100 indicates worse quality of life, while minimal score 0 corresponds to best quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline for Quality of Life in Essential Tremor (QUEST): Overall Summary Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>The QUEST questionnaire consists of 30 items, which are rated from 0 to 4, corresponding to the frequency (from never to always). Those 30 items assess how tremor impacts a function or how it can be associated with feelings or attitudes. The 30 items contribute to five sub scales (number of items contributing to each scale in parentheses): Physical/ADL (9), Psychosocial (9), Communication (3), Hobbies/Leisure (3), and Work/Finances (6). The score on each sub scale is expressed as a percentage of the total score possible, with a higher score indicating greater dissatisfaction with that domain of QOL. As the scores were expressed as percentages, if a question was unanswered it was excluded and percentages were calculated based on the remaining answers. A total or quest summary index (QSI) was computed by calculating the mean of the five scales. Maximal score of 100 indicates worse quality of life, while minimal score 0 corresponds to best quality of life.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 questionnaire is a measure of health status with 36 items across 8 domains. The eight domains are separated into two summary scores of four domains, the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). The SF-36 score is transformed into a scale of 0-100, with 100 indicating no disability. PCS and MCS are scaled in comparison to population norms to reflect a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 for the general population of the United States.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI - II) Score for Depression Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory II is A clinical rating scale designed for detecting depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. This widely used instrument consists of 21 items to assess the intensity of depression in clinical and normal patients. Each item is a list of four statements arranged in increasing severity about a particular symptom of depression. The BDI II questionnaire contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. A score between 0-13 indicates minimal depression, 14-19 mild depression, 20-28 moderate depression and 29-63 severe depression. Total scores are obtained by computing the sum of each score. The scores range from 0 to 63, with higher score indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 127 patients were enrolled from 12 investigational sites and implanted with the study device. The first patient was implanted with the SJM DBS Systems on 21 October, 2005. Of the 127 implanted subjects, 80 received unilateral implants and the remaining 47 patients received bilateral implants.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 150 subjects who were screened, 23 subjects were excluded from implantation due to inclusion or exclusion criteria, or the patient's decision to discontinue before surgery.</pre_assignment_details>

The CRST utilizes a 0 to 4 point scale where 0 indicates non-symptomatic (normal) and 4 indicates the most severe rating of the patient's tremor symptoms.&#xD;
The motor score adds together all responses to the tremor assessment for questions 1-9 of the CRST (whether or not the specific side is being treated).</description>

        <description>The Fahn, Tolosa, Marin Tremor Rating Scale (referred to as the CRST), is a rating tool to assess the severity of postural, isometric, kinetic and task specific tremor in the dominant and non-dominant sides of the head, trunk and limbs of patients with ET. The CRST utilizes a 0 to 4 point scale where 0 indicates non-symptomatic (normal) and 4 indicates the most severe rating of the patient's tremor symptoms. The activity of daily living score adds together all responses to questions 15-21 of the CRST.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life in Essential Tremor (QUEST): Overall Summary Index</title>
        <description>The QUEST questionnaire consists of 30 items, which are rated from 0 to 4, corresponding to the frequency (from never to always). Those 30 items assess how tremor impacts a function or how it can be associated with feelings or attitudes. The 30 items contribute to five sub scales (number of items contributing to each scale in parentheses): Physical/ADL (9), Psychosocial (9), Communication (3), Hobbies/Leisure (3), and Work/Finances (6). The score on each sub scale is expressed as a percentage of the total score possible, with a higher score indicating greater dissatisfaction with that domain of QOL. As the scores were expressed as percentages, if a question was unanswered it was excluded and percentages were calculated based on the remaining answers. A total or quest summary index (QSI) was computed by calculating the mean of the five scales. Maximal score of 100 indicates worse quality of life, while minimal score 0 corresponds to best quality of life.</description>

        <title>Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI - II) Score for Depression Symptoms</title>
        <description>The Beck Depression Inventory II is A clinical rating scale designed for detecting depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. This widely used instrument consists of 21 items to assess the intensity of depression in clinical and normal patients. Each item is a list of four statements arranged in increasing severity about a particular symptom of depression. The BDI II questionnaire contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. A score between 0-13 indicates minimal depression, 14-19 mild depression, 20-28 moderate depression and 29-63 severe depression. Total scores are obtained by computing the sum of each score. The scores range from 0 to 63, with higher score indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms.</description>
