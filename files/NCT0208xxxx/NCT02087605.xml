      The objective of this work is the development and validation (reliability and validity) of&#xD;
      the Automatic image analyzer to assess it retinal vessel caliber (ALTAIR) platform to analyze&#xD;
      and validate its utility in different clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods / Design Design : In the first phase , will be a cross- sectional study and a second&#xD;
      phase will be a prospective observational study with annual follow-up for 4 years. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted in primary care including 386 subjects. Main measurements: blood pressure,&#xD;
      carotid intima-media thickness using carotid ultrasound , central blood pressure and wave&#xD;
      velocity pulse by SphygmoCor system, Cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) by VASERA® VS1500 ,&#xD;
      evaluation of hypertrophy ventricular using a digital ECG and renal injury . Retinal vascular&#xD;
      evaluation will be done by a non-mydriatic TOPCON TRCNW200 getting focused papilla, nasal and&#xD;
      temporal and developed by software images automatically calculate the thickness of the&#xD;
      retinal vessels , the arteriovenous index, the vascularized area and branching pattern . For&#xD;
      validation software retina intra and inter - observer variability , the correlation of the&#xD;
      tool measurement with AVindex , and concurrent validity with parameters of vascular structure&#xD;
      and function and target organ damage and association analysis will analyze the different&#xD;
      parameters of the estimated retina and evolution or appearance of new lesions in the target&#xD;
      organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion The validation of the tool contribute to the analysis of retinal vessels improved&#xD;
      reliability by reducing the intervention of the observer and further validate the use of more&#xD;
      information than the previously used , especially surface vascularization and vessel&#xD;
      branching patterns .&#xD;

      Design and setting In the first phase, will be an observational descriptive study, with the&#xD;
      primary objective of validating the instrument developed. Later, in a second phase will be a&#xD;
      prospective observational study, with annual follow-up for 4 years. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in the field of primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be subject 30 to 75 years with a cardiovascular risk factor defined&#xD;
      by the European Hypertension Guide 2013 and does not meet any of the defined exclusion&#xD;
      criteria: patients who can not comply with the requirements of the protocol due to mental and&#xD;
      / or cognitive impairment, no partners, educational and understanding limitations and severe&#xD;
      comorbidity that would endanger his life in the next 12 months. By consecutive sampling of&#xD;
      all patients referred to the research unit for assessment of cardiovascular risk, their&#xD;
      participation is requested from those who meet the inclusion criteria and have no reason for&#xD;
      exclusion to the size of the estimated sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was estimated to detect a correlation coefficient between velocity and the pulse&#xD;
      wave parameters retinal 0.15, alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20, and an estimated&#xD;
      loss by difficulty technical or abandonment of monitoring 10%, so 386 subjects, who will be&#xD;
      included in the study required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Software Validation retina For validation of the retina software Follow these steps after a&#xD;
      previous training of evaluators who will make the evaluation of the images . 1 - intra-&#xD;
      observer variability . Assessing the repeatability of the measurement, an operator must&#xD;
      measure the same picture in the same individual, at least twice. To do this, an operator will&#xD;
      evaluate 100 images of a random subsample of 50 patients with a gap of one week between the&#xD;
      two embodiments . In this case , the operator and the images analyzed are the same on both&#xD;
      days and will not have information on the previous assessment . 2 - inter-observer&#xD;
      variability . To assess the reproducibility of the measurement system , a new operator,&#xD;
      different from phase 1, evaluated the same 100 images previously analyzed . This operator&#xD;
      will ignore the results that have been obtained in the previous phase. The two operators have&#xD;
      the same experience in the field and in the use of software , in addition, both receive the&#xD;
      same previous training. 3.- And with retina developed software program provides the results&#xD;
      on the evaluation of arterial / venous , thickness of the vein and the artery index. To&#xD;
      assess the degree of agreement between the two methodologies (AVindex ) valuation of 100&#xD;
      images were made with the two tools . In this way, we can show that the new method and&#xD;
      provides the same results improves daily practice having more objective and faster processing&#xD;
      of results. 4.- The validity of the measurement was analyzed in the total sample, 386 and 772&#xD;
      subjects fundus , analyzing the relationship of the results to the carotid intima-media&#xD;
      thickness as a measure of vascular structure , the speed of the pulse wave as measure of&#xD;
      vascular function and arterial stiffness gold standard (arterial stiffness ) in Cardio Ankle&#xD;
      vascular Index , renal function , and electrocardiographic parameters estimated with the&#xD;
      Framingham cardiovascular risk. 5.- also the association of the different parameters of the&#xD;
      estimated retina and evolution or appearance of new lesions in target organs and&#xD;
      cardiovascular monitoring of patients during the four years of the second phase of this&#xD;
      project will be analyzed events&#xD;
