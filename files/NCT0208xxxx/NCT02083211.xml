    <textblock>
      This study evauates the global survival of patients following administration of mAb&#xD;
      Nimotuzumab hR3 + chemotherapy in the treatment of cervical cancer in first line therapy,&#xD;
      after relapsing from chemo-radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a Phase III, multi-centric, randomized, double blind study; 168 patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to Nimotuzumab + Cisplatin/Vinorelbine or placebo + Cisplatin/Vinorelbine. After&#xD;
      progression, a second line chemotherapy based on carboplatino/taxol will be administered in&#xD;
      both groups. Concomitant administration of Nimotuzumab will be continued every 14 days until&#xD;
      limiting toxicity or ECOCG &gt;3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor markers such as Kras, p53, KI67, and EGFR will be identified. Cardiac toxicity will be&#xD;
      evaluated using MRI.&#xD;

      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the global survival of patients treated with mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 in&#xD;
           patients with cervical tumors of epithelial origin relapsing from first line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine disease free survival in patients treated with mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 for&#xD;
           cervical tumors of epithelial origin when relapsing from first line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the anti-tumoral response of mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 in patients with cervical&#xD;
           tumors of epithelial origin relapsing from first line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine progression time of patients with cervical tumors of epithelial origin&#xD;
           relapsing from first line treatment who were treated with mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 in&#xD;
           combination with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the safety of mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 when treating patients with cervical&#xD;
           tumors of epithelial origin relapsing from first line treatment in combination with&#xD;
           Cisplatin/Vinorelbine chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the appearing of HAMA response in patients treated with mAb Nimotuzumab hR3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To evaluate the diminishing of associated symptoms in patients with cervical tumors of&#xD;
           epithelial origin in relapse treated with mAb Nimotuzumab hR3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To evaluate the quality of life of both groups using questionnaires QLQ C-30 and QLQ CX&#xD;
           24 for patients with cervical cancer (See appendixes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To evaluate the toxicity using V3 Toxicity criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To evaluate cardiac toxicity through MUGA or cardiac USG in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. For feasibility purposes it will be conducted a MUGA and Rs MG only in Mexican patients&#xD;
           to evaluate their cardiac function in order to compare both studies before and after&#xD;
           clinical evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever possible, researcher shall perform a pre-treatment biopsy to assess the EGF-R&#xD;
      expression and its characteristics using immunohistochemical techniques. EGFR expression will&#xD;
      not constitute an inclusion criterion in this trial but will be correlated retrospectively&#xD;
      with the antitumor clinical response of those patients on whom a pre-treatment biopsy was&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A QLQ-c30v3 test will be applied for it has the characteristic of evaluating the impact of&#xD;
      the disease and its treatment on the patient's functioning in the physical, psychological and&#xD;
      social areas. The QLQ Cx24 Questionnaire is a specific instrument for measuring the quality&#xD;
      of life in patients with cervical cancer through different clinical phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION PHASE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 mg mAb Nimotuzumab will be administered once a week (12 weeks) in combination with a&#xD;
      Platin based chemotherapy (Cisplatin/Vinorelbine) in cycles administered every 21 days (up to&#xD;
      6). Both therapies will be administered endovenously. Response will be assessed after the 3rd&#xD;
      chemotherapy + mAb vs placebo cycle through physical examination, CAR, or MRI. IF THERE IS A&#xD;
      PARTIAL RESPONSE OR STABLE DISEASE in line with RECIST, patient shall continue planned&#xD;
      treatment until 6th CT + mAb vs placebo cycle is completed. In case of PROGRESSION, another&#xD;
      treatment scheme should be considered according to researcher criteria. Following 6th&#xD;
      Chemotherapy + mAb vs placebo cycle patient should be assessed again after 28 days through&#xD;
      physical examination, MRI and CAT to measure lesions and through RECIST criteria. 6th cycle&#xD;
      evaluation will be based on basal target lesions measured at the beginning of study. IF&#xD;
      STABLE DISEASE OR ANTITUMORAL RESPONSE IS ESTABLISHED patient will continue to the next&#xD;
      planned study phase. In the event of PROGRESSION, a second line chemotherapy should be&#xD;
      considered. During second line chemotherapy evaluation, Nimotuzumab administration every 14&#xD;
      days will be maintained&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP THERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of STABLE DISEASE or ANTITUMORAL RESPONSE (complete or partial), an mAb hR3 vs&#xD;
      Placebo dose will be maintained every 14 days without chemotherapy after this concomitancy&#xD;
      phase until patient shows progression. mAb Nimotuzumab hR3 will be administered endovenously&#xD;
      in a 250 mL saline solution in 30 min. infusion ambulatory. Following drug administration,&#xD;
      patient should remain in the health care institution for at least 4 hours in order to&#xD;
      guarantee immediate adverse reactions detection and its appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATION OF RESPONSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival of patient will be determined from the moment of inclusion until death, for two&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic success will be considered to have occurred when the patient survives more than&#xD;
      10.5 months in the branch treated with mAb Nimotuzumab, or when the difference between both&#xD;
      groups is not less than 4 months and that of the mAb group is not greater than 10.5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic failure will be considered to have occurred when the patient does not survive the&#xD;
      6.5 months that are habitually reported in the literature, which is the median survival of&#xD;
      patients treated only with Platinum&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMAGE RESPONSE CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation of target lesions will be made (complete response, partial response,&#xD;
      progressive disease, stable disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAMA RESPONSE WITH ELISA&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGF-R EXPRESSION The EGF-R expression will be evaluated in the samples of tumors from the&#xD;
      patients using Immunohistochemical techniques. The pre-inclusion EGFR expression will not&#xD;
      constitute an inclusion criterion, but it will be correlated retrospectively with the&#xD;
      antitumoral clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DETERMINATION OF KRAS, KI 65, P53. Evaluation of the QLQ- 30 and Cx24 questionnaires will be&#xD;
      done in cycles 3 and 6 of the first line of chemotherapy, and in the 3rd and 6th cycles of&#xD;
      the second line of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EVENTS All adverse events during the trial will be documented in patient's file and&#xD;
      in the report forms of each case. Every adverse event will be reported including the strat&#xD;
      date, termination date, severity, and possible relation with the drug studied (occurrence of&#xD;
      and AE, description of AE, intensisity of AE, casualty relation, attitude following AE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of adverse events will be evaluated according to the following taxonomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse event (Grade 3): Event that threatens the life of patient. Hospitalization of&#xD;
      patient is required with the possible interruption of the drug studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate adverse event (Grade 2): Patient requires a symptomatic treatment to continue with&#xD;
      her customary daily actvities. A more frequent evaluation is required until adverse event&#xD;
      disappears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild adverse event (Grade 1): Patient may continue with her daily activities and does not&#xD;
      requiere complementary pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterization of Adverse Events Main researcher will evaluate each adverse event and will&#xD;
      determine their relation with the drug being studied according to the following possible&#xD;
      cases. He/she will record his/her evaluation in the Adverse Event Report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0.- Unrelated The adverse event cannot be related to the use of the drug studied or there is&#xD;
      no temporal or causal relation of the identified effect (other than the use of the drug&#xD;
      studied)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Possibly related There is a temporal association or the cause of the effect may be&#xD;
           related with other ethiologies (probable causes). The relation with the drug studied&#xD;
           cannot be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Probably related There is a temporal association although there are other possible but&#xD;
           not probable causes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of Adverse Events will be made as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Report to the monitor no later than 24 hours when a patient is still being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reporting of adverse event within 30 days when the patient has finished the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A summary of the clinical history will be prepared including a detailed description of&#xD;
           adverse events (regardless the adverse event might be associated or not to the drug or&#xD;
           procedures of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All serious adverse events shall be reported to the Institutional Ethic Committee and to&#xD;
           the Research Host Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A Report on Adverse Events will be made using the Health Secretariat format&#xD;
&#xD;
      A report will be delivered to the monitor to perform the pertaining actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why Study Cardiac Function In different toxicities, cardiac toxicity was mentioned previously&#xD;
      as one of the side effects of treatment with chemotherapy. In other studies, in which a&#xD;
      molecular target directed against the VEG + chemotherapy has been studied, it has&#xD;
      demonstrated cardiac toxicity, which makes it necessary to consider it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the evaluation of cardiac function takes place through Nuclear Medicine and has&#xD;
      been established as a safe, effective, and low-cost method. Basal, MUGA and ECG measurements&#xD;
      will be made prior chemotherapy in cycle 6 of first line CT. In case of second line&#xD;
      chemotherapies, measurements will be made in cycles 3 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of quality of life means: good state of mental, physical, and social health in&#xD;
      patients that survive the cancer (Brunner et al.1995). Patients treated with radiotherapy vs.&#xD;
      surgery or both, in local advanced cervical cancer, demonstrate that they do not achieve the&#xD;
      same quality of life two years after the treatment compared to the control group (Klee et al.&#xD;
      2000, Cull et al. 1993). The EORTC developed and validated a program in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients that suffer from cancer (above all, cervical and breast cancer)&#xD;
      before and during the treatment. The QLQ-c30v 3 (Holzner et al. 2001, Fayer et al. 2002,&#xD;
      Aaronson 1993), has the characteristic of evaluating the impact of the disease and its&#xD;
      treatment on the patient's functioning in the following areas: physical, psychological, and&#xD;
      social.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the QLQ Cx 24 questionnaire (Greimel et al. 2006) is a specific instrument for&#xD;
      measuring the quality of life in patients with cervical cancer, validated by the EORTC. It&#xD;
      has the capacity to assess quality of life in different clinical stages; it evaluates aspects&#xD;
      of the female reproductive system, sex life, and the discomforts caused by the local&#xD;
      treatment; it has a Cronbach Alfa coefficient of 72%-82%; the disadvantage is that this&#xD;
      questionnaire must be self-evaluative, and the majority of our patients have to be helped due&#xD;
      to the fact that 80% of our population has an incomplete primary school education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal measurements will be made prior chemotherapy in cycle 3, then in cycle 6 of first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In the case of second line chemotherapies, measurements will be made at the&#xD;
      beginning of second line chemotherapy and in cycles 3 and 6 of such chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow-up, Questionnaires QLQ 30 and CX 24 will be preformed every 6 months during the&#xD;
      first two years and afterwards, annually until completion of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP Post-study follow-up visits will be made every 3 months during the first 2 years;&#xD;
      every 4 months during third year; every 6 months in the following year, and later on,&#xD;
      annually or until progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected during that period will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited clinical history and physical examination; performance status assessment including&#xD;
      weight and tumor lesion measurements for lesions than can be measured through a physical&#xD;
      examination or image studies: BH, QS, PFH; relapsing, progression or recurrence date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac function will be assessed with MUGA every 6 months during the first year and later&#xD;
      on, annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Questionnaires QLQ- 30 and Cx24 will be performed every 6 months during the&#xD;
      follow-up and for the first twol years, and then, annually up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding procedure and methods for code treatment opening and access. Main clinical&#xD;
      researcher is the ultimate person responsible for the appropriate patient attention and&#xD;
      he/she will determine if patient shall continue or not the treatment being researched in the&#xD;
      event an adverse event appears bearing a risk to the life of patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each clinical site, the researcher or pharmaceutical person responsible for the&#xD;
      institution will be provided with sealed envelopes stating the treatment each patient is&#xD;
      receiving. If a patient needs clinical management due to the presence of severe or unexpected&#xD;
      adverse events related to the product being studied and for which it is required to know the&#xD;
      treatment patient is receiving, randomization envelopes will be opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opening the randomization envelope will only be justified when a severe or unexpected averse&#xD;
      event is present. In that case, the procedure followed and explanations for that procedure&#xD;
      shall be recorded on patient's clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sealed envelopes containing the treatment assigned for each patient will be prepared by the&#xD;
      designated person at the CIM Regulatory Affairs Department and he/she will also label the&#xD;
      vials based on the randomized list stating the treatment each patient is receiving.&#xD;
