  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plants from the genus Artemisia, and specifically Artemisia dracunculus L. (Russian tarragon)&#xD;
      have had a long history of medicinal (health) and culinary (food) use and have been reported&#xD;
      as effective as a traditional treatments for diabetes in various parts of the world. The&#xD;
      overall objective of this study is to conduct early human investigation and to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of nutritional supplementation with a well characterized extract of Artemisia&#xD;
      dracunculus L. The primary objectives would be to evaluate safety, tolerability and effective&#xD;
      dose in non-diabetic human subjects. Secondary objectives would assess metabolism of the&#xD;
      extract and evaluate effects on proposed mechanisms such as insulin secretion, lipid levels&#xD;
      and/or insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single Oral Dose Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing a screening visit and meeting qualifications for the single oral dose&#xD;
      evaluation, subjects will receive three single doses (two different doses of the supplement&#xD;
      and one dose of placebo) on three separate test periods which are separated by a washout&#xD;
      period of at least 7 days. Each testing period requires an overnight stay on the inpatient&#xD;
      unit. The inpatient stay will be approximately 26 hours. The doses that will be used in the&#xD;
      study are 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20 and 30 grams plus the placebo. The supplement and the placebo&#xD;
      will be mixed with sugar-free flavoring in water. There will be an opportunity to sample the&#xD;
      liquid drink during the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit 1 (about 1 hour) - Fasting (Nothing to eat or drink other than water for at&#xD;
      least 10 hours prior to appointment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sign informed consent if willing to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body weight and height will be measured (body mass index will be calculated from these&#xD;
           measures)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure, pulse and temperature will be measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and ECG (electrocardiogram)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Report any medications taken over the past 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw (about 2 teaspoons) to assess overall health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taste test&#xD;
&#xD;

      EACH SINGLE DOSE TESTING PERIOD (1,2,3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing Period 1: Day -3, Day 1, Day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7 Day Washout&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing Period 2: Day -3, Day 1, Day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7 Day Washout&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing Period 3: Day -3, Day 1, Day 2&#xD;
&#xD;

      hours prior to appointment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure, pulse and temperature will be measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An IV line will be placed in an arm vein for blood draw purposes and will remain there&#xD;
           throughout the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood draw (approximately 2 teaspoons) will be done before and after dosing to assess&#xD;
           any changes in glucose or insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) will be done A blood sample will be drawn from the&#xD;
           IV line, and then the subject will drink a sugar solution consisting of 75 grams of&#xD;
           glucose. Blood will be drawn at specific times after the drink is consumed. Each blood&#xD;
           sample will be about 1 tablespoon. (6 tablespoons total for the test). During the IV&#xD;
           procedure, a small amount of the subject's own blood (less than 1 teaspoon) will&#xD;
           immediately be returned into the vein through the IV after each specimen is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;

           coin. The subject and the study staff will not know what dose the subject is receiving&#xD;
           or if the subject is receiving a placebo (inactive drink).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single dose of extract given (either the supplement or placebo). The dose will be given&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  A physical exam will be done&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 24 hour post dose blood draw (approximately 1 teaspoon) will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study staff will schedule the next testing period if applicable and then the subject&#xD;
           will be discharged from the inpatient unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Oral Dose Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing a screening visit and meeting qualifications for the multiple oral dose&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  OGTT as described above (at Day -3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood draw (approximately 3 tablespoons) before and after dosing will be done to&#xD;
