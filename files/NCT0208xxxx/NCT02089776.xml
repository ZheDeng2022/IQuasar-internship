      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People can learn to use feedback about brain activity to change that activity. Researchers&#xD;
      want to see if people who have had a stroke can change their brain activity by practice and&#xD;
      thought with feedback, and if that improves motor control. They will study brain activity in&#xD;
      people who have and have not had strokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if people with stroke can change their brain activity and improve motor control by&#xD;
      practice and thought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults 18 80 years old who have had a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers 18 80 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, MRI, and physical exam. For MRI, a&#xD;
           magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the brain. Participants lie on a table&#xD;
           that slides in and out of a cylinder. They will be in the scanner less than 2 hours,&#xD;
           lying still for up to 15 minutes at a time. The scanner makes loud noises. Participants&#xD;
           will get earplugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have up to 3 scanning visits and up to 3 follow-up visits within 24&#xD;
           weeks. Visits may include screening, MRI, functional MRI (fMRI), questionnaires, and&#xD;
           simple motor tests. Stroke participants may take additional motor tests, including&#xD;
           transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fMRI: During this MRI, small metal disks may be taped to the skin or a fabric glove with&#xD;
           small wires in it may be used to monitor hand movements. Heart rate and breathing may&#xD;
           also be monitored. Participants may be monitored by video and asked to perform tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMS: A brief electrical current goes through a coil on the scalp. It creates a magnetic&#xD;
           pulse that stimulates the brain. Participants may be asked to perform simple actions.&#xD;
           Finger or hand movements may be recorded.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to understand whether healthy volunteers and patients with&#xD;
      chronic stroke resulting in hemiparesis can learn how to modulate their brain activity using&#xD;
      feedback during real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI), and whether such&#xD;
      feedback training can lead to improvement in motor rehabilitation in chronic stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in two parallel phases. In Phase 1, we will study learning to&#xD;
      control brain functional activation (feedback technique using rtfMRI) in adult healthy&#xD;
      volunteers; in Phase 2, we will study adult patients with chronic stroke. In both phases, we&#xD;
      intend to study whether feedback training with rtfMRI leads to increased control of brain&#xD;
      activity and whether this correlates with improvements in motor control in healthy&#xD;
      participants and improvement in motor function, in chronic stroke patients, both immediately&#xD;
      after training and at later time points. The reason for carrying out this study in parallel&#xD;
      is that, as stated recently by Dr Petra Kaufman during a PIRC meeting, patients with brain&#xD;
      lesions may benefit from this approach even if healthy volunteers do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: We will test if healthy volunteers can learn to modulate their own brain&#xD;
      connectivity using feedback of connectivity patterns between two brain regions during an&#xD;
      rtfMRI neurofeedback paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: We will test if chronic stroke patients can learn to modulate their brain activity&#xD;
      and connectivity similar to the healthy volunteers, and if such learning can improve&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for Phases 1 and 2 is the difference in brain activation and brain&#xD;
      connectivity after feedback training compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes for both phases&#xD;
      include: 1) changes in brain connectivity during rest, and when no feedback image is&#xD;
      displayed (structural and/or functional connectivity), 2) changes in motor behavior after&#xD;
      training compared to baseline, both immediately after and following a time delay, and 3)&#xD;
      correlations between changes in behavior and changes in brain activity and brain connectivity&#xD;
      (as measured in 1 and 2).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for healthy volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 to 80&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a normal neurological exam&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have the capacity to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for healthy volunteers:&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any report on the MRI safety questionnaire that prevents them from safely undergoing&#xD;
             an MRI scan (e.g., metal implants) as per MRI center questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to carry out the task during scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition that would prevent them from lying flat for up to 2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for all patients with hemiparesis after stroke (regardless of doing TMS&#xD;
        or not):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 to 80&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stroke onset greater than 3 months prior to participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemiparesis due to stroke involving the upper extremity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have the capacity to give informed consent. If the investigator feels the volunteer s&#xD;
             capacity to give informed consent is questionable, the NIH Human Subjects Protection&#xD;
             Unit (HSPU) will be requested to determine the individual s ability to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for patients with hemiparesis after stroke:&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any report on the MRI safety questionnaire that prevents them from safely undergoing&#xD;
             an MRI scan (e.g., metal implants) as per the MRI center questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to carry out the task during scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition that would prevent them from lying flat for up to 2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        Given the heterogeneity of our population after stroke, we do not have a strong hypothesis&#xD;
        about the effects of any specific medications on the experimental outcomes. Thus,&#xD;
        medications are not listed as an exclusion criteria because they do not pose a concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Furthermore, to take advantage of the heterogeneity of the lesion location on the&#xD;
        experimental outcomes, we will perform a post-hoc stratification by lesion location in this&#xD;
        initial study with stroke patients. There is little data to support a specific hypothesis&#xD;
        that lesion size/location will contribute to differences in the participant s ability to&#xD;
        successfully perform the task (e.g., control his/her neural activity using rtfMRI&#xD;
        neurofeedback). The one prior study using rtfMRI with individuals with stroke recruited two&#xD;
        participants with internal capsule lesions only. Thus, in this study we will stratify&#xD;
        participants by lesion location in posthoc analyses and use this resulting information to&#xD;
        inform future protocols for stroke patients using rtfMRI neurofeedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion for TMS portion specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have metal in the body, such as a cardiac pacemaker, brain stimulator, shrapnel,&#xD;
             surgical metal, clips in the brain, cochlear implants, metal fragments in the eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have epilepsy or history of seizures, or being on medication for epilepsy.&#xD;
