  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, yet it is not easy to&#xD;
      control. Recent studies show that survival improves for patients who get aggressive surgery&#xD;
      to remove a tumor before starting radiation (RT) and chemotherapy (chemo) treatment. Surgery,&#xD;
      RT and chemo are part of regular cancer care for GBM. RT is usually done in daily doses 5&#xD;
      days a week over about 6 weeks. Beams of radiation are aimed at the tumor site plus some of&#xD;
      the normal brain tissue around the tumor area. GammaKnife® (GK) radiosurgery also delivers&#xD;
      radiation but in a larger dose over one day. GK sends beams to a precise target (tumor&#xD;
      location) and very little normal brain tissue that is nearby. This study will compare GK&#xD;
      treatment to the usual RT treatment after surgery, and with chemo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to know:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How well each treatment keeps the tumor from growing back.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What the effects (good and bad) of the treatments are.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How you rate your quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How the treatment affects your ability to think, understand, reason, and remember.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How you rate your ability to think, understand, reason, and remember.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If using a certain type of MRI scan can show the difference between new tumor growth and&#xD;
           changes caused by treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If certain features found in tumor cells can help doctors predict how tumors will&#xD;
           respond to treatment.&#xD;

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if single fraction GK radiosurgical&#xD;
      treatment to the resection bed can achieve equivalent local control and survival for patients&#xD;
      with GBM after GTR, Gliadel® implant and temozolomide therapy compared to patients receiving&#xD;
      standard postoperative RT with temozolomide, but offer improved quality of life and preserve&#xD;
      cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase I, it is proposed that 20 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme&#xD;
      (GBM) undergo gross total resection (GTR) with Gliadel® (carmustine) wafer implantation to&#xD;
      the resection cavity at that time will be eligible for study. These patients will then&#xD;
      receive Gamma Knife® (GK) radiosurgery to the resection cavity margin within 4 weeks&#xD;
      following surgical resection and within 24 hours of starting temozolomide (Temodar®)&#xD;
      induction therapy. Temozolomide (Temodar®) maintenance therapy would be administered for 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II, it is proposed that 60 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme&#xD;
      (GBM) undergo gross total resection (GTR) with Gliadel® (carmustine) wafer implantation to&#xD;
      the resection cavity at the time of initial resection will be eligible for study. These&#xD;
      patients will then be randomized to either standard fractionated conformal radiation therapy&#xD;
      (RT) or Gamma Knife® (GK) radiosurgery to the resection cavity margin. Fractionated RT would&#xD;
      be administered with concurrent temozolomide Gamma knife® radiosurgery to the resection&#xD;
      cavity margin will be administered within 24 hours of starting temozolomide induction&#xD;
      therapy. Both the GK and RT will be administered within 4 weeks following surgical resection.&#xD;
      Temozolomide (Temodar®) maintenance therapy would be administered to all patients in both&#xD;
      arms of the study for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that all patients will benefit from enrollment in the study regardless of the&#xD;
      treatment arm to which they are randomized. All patients will be receiving focally aggressive&#xD;
      surgical resection with Gliadel® implant in addition to temozolomide for prevention of both&#xD;
      focal and distant recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are randomized to receive GK radiosurgical treatment to the resection bed margin&#xD;
      may benefit from increased local control based on a prior non-randomized study. However these&#xD;
      patients will be treated in a non-standard fashion and may be subjected to a higher incidence&#xD;
      of focal radiation necrosis or a higher incidence of failure beyond the resection margin&#xD;
      compared to standard patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GK treated patients however, will be spared the standard 6 weeks of RT postoperatively.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that those receiving GK will therefore have an improved quality of life&#xD;
      with respect to having less fatigue, lack of hair loss and a decreased incidence of delayed&#xD;
      cognitive decline associated with standard RT.&#xD;
