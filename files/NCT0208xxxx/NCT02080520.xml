      The potential for nattokinase to &quot;thin&quot; blood and to reduce blood clotting by positive&#xD;
      antithrombotic and fibrinolytic effects presents a unique opportunity to safely study such&#xD;
      effects on cardiovascular disease and cognition. Unfortunately, such studies of&#xD;
      antithrombotic and fibrinolytic pathways of prevention have been limited due to lack of safe&#xD;
      compounds and the adverse reactions associated with current agents such as Coumadin.&#xD;
      Nattokinase, an over-the-counter supplement used for cardiovascular health, is the most&#xD;
      active functional constituent of natto, a fermented soy product. Natto has been consumed&#xD;
      primarily by the Japanese for over 1000 years, a population with one of the lowest risks for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and dementia. Cardiovascular disease and dementia remain the most&#xD;
      challenging age-related health risks of the 21st century for Americans necessitating&#xD;
      development of further effective preemptive strategies. Whether reducing the propensity for&#xD;
      thrombus formation and/or increasing fibrinolytic activity can prevent the progression of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and cognitive decline has not yet been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using nattokinase under primary prevention conditions, the investigators propose to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether decreasing&#xD;
      atherothrombotic risk can reduce the progression of atherosclerosis and cognitive decline.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to randomize 240 healthy non-demented women and men to nattokinase&#xD;
      supplementation or to placebo for three years. The primary trial end points will be&#xD;
      measurement of carotid arterial wall thickness and arterial stiffness, early changes of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis that can be measured safely by non-invasive imaging techniques. The secondary&#xD;
      trial end point will be ascertained through change in cognition measured by a&#xD;
      neuropsychological battery. In addition, biochemical blood measurements and in vitro studies&#xD;
      will be conducted to compare the effects of nattokinase relative to placebo on blood&#xD;
      coagulation and thrombus break-down capabilities, blood flow properties, inflammation and&#xD;
      inflammatory activation of endothelial cells that line blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of this trial, the investigators expect to have sufficient evidence as to&#xD;
      whether reducing the propensity for thrombus formation and/or increasing fibrinolytic&#xD;
      activity can prevent the progression of atherosclerosis and cognitive decline. These results&#xD;
      will provide novel and important data that will be informative concerning primary prevention&#xD;
      through the atherothrombotic pathway. Providing evidence for a reduction in atherosclerosis&#xD;
      progression and cognitive decline with nattokinase is likely to shift the current clinical&#xD;
      paradigm for the prevention of these chronic age-related processes. In addition, such&#xD;
      evidence will serve to create a new field of discovery and opportunity for prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and dementia.&#xD;

      Objectives and Hypotheses: The goal of the proposed study is to determine under randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) conditions whether nattokinase reduces subclinical atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      cognitive decline in healthy women and men. The investigators' hypotheses are: 1) Compared to&#xD;
      placebo, nattokinase will show less subclinical atherosclerosis progression and cognitive&#xD;
      decline in healthy women and men; 2) The reduction in subclinical atherosclerosis progression&#xD;
      and cognitive decline with nattokinase will be correlated; and, 3) The reduction in&#xD;
      progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and cognitive decline with nattokinase will be&#xD;
      mediated through hemostatic, fibrinolytic and hemorheological factors as well as attenuation&#xD;
      of inflammation, monocyte activation, vascular endothelium injury and activation of vascular&#xD;
      endothelium by circulating monocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: To conduct a RCT to determine the effect of nattokinase on the progression of&#xD;
      subclinical atherosclerosis (primary trial end point) and cognitive decline (secondary trial&#xD;
      end point). Healthy non-demented women and men &gt;55 years old without pre-existing symptomatic&#xD;
      CVD and diabetes mellitus will be randomized over a 2 year period to oral nattokinase (2,000&#xD;
      fibrinolysis units) daily versus placebo in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial;&#xD;
      randomized treatment will be 3-years. The following 5 major specific aims will be completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of nattokinase on the progression of subclinical carotid artery&#xD;
           atherosclerosis determined as the rate of change of the common carotid artery&#xD;
           intima-media thickness (CIMT) and arterial stiffness in computer image processed B-mode&#xD;
           ultrasonograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of nattokinase on cognitive decline determined with a&#xD;
           neuropsychological battery designed to evaluate 7 cognitive domains including:&#xD;
           attention, concentration, working memory, executive function;&#xD;
           visuospatial/visuoconstructive skills; naming/semantic memory; and verbal and nonverbal&#xD;
           episodic memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2a. To determine the effect of nattokinase on cognitive decline according to apolipoprotein&#xD;
      (Apo) E e4 genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. To determine the association of subclinical atherosclerosis progression with cognitive&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. To determine whether the effects of nattokinase on subclinical atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      cognitive decline are mediated through hemostatic (fibrinogen, factor VIII, platelet&#xD;
      activity), fibrinolytic (tPA, PAI-1, D-dimer), hemorheological (plasma and blood viscosity,&#xD;
      red blood cell aggregation) and inflammatory (MCP-1, IL-8, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-10, monocyte cell&#xD;
      surface markers CD11b/CD11c and VLA-4, expression of adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in&#xD;
      cultured human aortic endothelial cells) factors as well as blood pressure.&#xD;
