      Egg, milk and cereal allergies are the most important food allergies in Finnish children, the&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Egg, milk and cereal allergies are the most important food allergies in Finnish children, the&#xD;
      prevalence in western countries is 1-4 %. In some individuals food-allergy is maintained in&#xD;
      to adulthood. The mainstay of treatment of IgE-mediated milk and egg allergy is an avoidance&#xD;
      diet and carrying an epinephrine injector in case of an allergic reaction. Avoidance diet is&#xD;
      very difficult and has negative effects on quality of life. Accidentally having milk or egg&#xD;
      can cause life-threatening reactions, even lead to death. Recent studies suggest that&#xD;
      specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) provides a treatment option in children with&#xD;
      continuing allergy with high success rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is obvious that oral immunotherapy has impact on the milk and egg specific immune&#xD;
      responses, but the mechanisms of this treatment have been studied only little and its effects&#xD;
      on the cell and molecular level is practically unknown. There neither are any laboratory&#xD;
      studies to monitor the efficacy or predict the outcome in advance or at the early stages of&#xD;
      treatment. No research data is available on the humoral IgE, IgG4 and Immunoglobulin A (IgA)&#xD;
      responses or the cell-mediated or cytokine responses induced by the individual major cow's&#xD;
      milk and egg allergen components during oral immunotherapy. No tools exist for forecasting&#xD;
      the outcome of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims at specific oral tolerance induction in adults allergic to cow's milk or hen's&#xD;
      egg. Oral immunotherapy involves taking very small amounts of the allergen, and slowly&#xD;
      increasing the amount. Consequently, an elimination diet may be wholly or partially&#xD;
      cancelled, without the fear of serious allergic reactions. Another aim is to explore changes&#xD;
      in antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immune response to individual components of cow's milk&#xD;
      and egg allergens during tolerance induction and compare these with the effect of the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 40 adult patients with either milk or egg allergy. Eligibility&#xD;
      criteria are: 1) adults over 16 years, 2) elevated serum levels of specific IgE (≥ 5 kU/l,&#xD;
      (kilounit per liter) milk or egg) or a positive skin-prick- test (≥ 5 mm, milk or egg), and&#xD;
      3) a positive milk- or egg-challenge. The recruited subjects meeting entry criteria are&#xD;
      randomized to a tolerance induction group receiving milk or egg (n = 20) or to a control&#xD;
      group to be followed on an avoidance diet (n = 20). Oral immunotherapy involves initially&#xD;
      taking a very small amount of the allergen, and slowly increasing the amount gradually until&#xD;
      a maintenance dose is reached. Up-dosing is monitored in hospital. Thereafter, the patient&#xD;
      will continue the daily use of milk or egg at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin-prick-tests with milk or egg specific allergen components are performed, a symptom&#xD;
      questionnaire is filled and blood samples are taken before commencement of the study, when&#xD;
      the maintenance dose is reached and after 12 months from initiation of the study. Patient&#xD;
      visits are carried out in outpatient clinic as part of the normal routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commercially available (Thermo Fisher Scientific Phadia) specific allergen components are&#xD;
      examined (IgE and IgG4), as well as IgA, IgA1 and IgA2. Cow's milk allergen components are:&#xD;
      alfa-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, casein, lactoferrin and bovine serum albumin, and egg&#xD;
      allergen components are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, conalbumin and lysozyme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mononuclear leukocytes are isolated from the blood samples and cultured in 37 ° C incubator&#xD;
      10^6 cells per millilitre of RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium) medium containing&#xD;
      5% autologous plasma and cows' milk allergen components: alfa-lactalbumin,&#xD;
      beta-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin, casein and lactoferrin, or egg allergen components:&#xD;
      ovomucoid, ovalbumin, conalbumin and lysozyme. Mitogen is used as the positive control and&#xD;
      medium without stimulation as the negative control. Milk and egg allergen components are&#xD;
      cleaned with Detoxi-Gel Endotoxin Removal Gel columns (Thermo Scientific Pierce Chemicals) to&#xD;
      remove effects of endotoxins during cell stimulation. Lymphoproliferation is studied using&#xD;
      three parallel samples and cytokine expression is studied using two parallel samples&#xD;
      (Luminex/Lincoplex: interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, IL-22,&#xD;
      IL-23, IL-27, interferon gamma(IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and transforming growth&#xD;
      factor beta (TGF-β)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study follows instructions and regulations used in biomedical research. The Turku University&#xD;
      Ethics committee approved the study 15th February 2011. Each participant will give written&#xD;
      informed consent. Research participation is voluntary and may be suspended without any reason&#xD;
      at any time during the study and the refusal or termination shall not affect the patient's&#xD;
      other treatment. Patient samples and the data collected are processed and stored according to&#xD;
      the instructions and regulations used in biomedical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimate, schedule and results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient visits are carried out in outpatient clinics as part of the normal reception of&#xD;
      allergy patients and do not entail additional costs to the patients. The expenses related to&#xD;
      antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immune response studies are covered by external funding.&#xD;
      The study will begin in autumn 2014 and aims being completed in the spring of 2016. The&#xD;
      results will be published in international scientific journals.&#xD;
