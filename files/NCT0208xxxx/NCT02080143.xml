        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who complete an appropriately administered informed consent process that&#xD;
             includes signing the IRB-approved consent form;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects 18-75 years old of each sex;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are of any skin type or race, providing the skin pigmentation will allow discernment&#xD;
             of erythema;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who are in good general health and free of any disease state or physical&#xD;
             condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who are willing and able to have the study products applied as directed, and&#xD;
             comply with study instructions;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects must be willing to restrict their activity for the 8 hour patch wear time so&#xD;
             that patches and thermocouples do not come loose;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects must be willing to wear a pouch containing the thermologger and thermocouple&#xD;
             wiring for the entire 8 hours;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who are 55 years or older agree to wear a t-shirt provided by the site for&#xD;
             the entire 8 hour patch wear time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant or nursing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects with excessive hair at the application site, scar tissue, tattoo or&#xD;
             coloration that would interfere with the placement of the study product or the skin&#xD;
             assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects with diabetes or poor circulation or have any clinically significant chronic&#xD;
             illness which could place the subject at increased risk during participation or result&#xD;
             in inappropriate dermal response during the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects unable to feel pain or heat (e.g., subjects with neuropathy);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects with active dermatitis (including sunburn) in the treatment area or other&#xD;
             visible dermatological disease which, in the investigator's opinion, might interfere&#xD;
             with the response to the study products or interfere with the skin assessments&#xD;
             associated with the study products;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have history of significant dermatologic cancers or neoplasms in the treatment area;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who have used topical dermatological products in the application area within&#xD;
             24 hours prior to anticipated study product application;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects using a concomitant medication that, in the investigator's opinion, could&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results. Examples of such drugs include&#xD;
             vasoactive (constrictor or dilator) medications, prescription or OTC, that could&#xD;
             modulate blood flow, within 24 hours prior to or during the application of study&#xD;
             products, including nitroglycerin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory products (NSAIDs,&#xD;
             e.g., ibuprofen, aspirin (&lt;=81 mg/day is acceptable)), topical corticosteroids and OTC&#xD;
             cough/cold products including antihistamines and/or either phenylpropanolamine or&#xD;
             phentolamine;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who have used systemic steroids (i.e., oral, IV, IM or intra-articular) 30&#xD;
             days prior to the application of test articles (intranasal/inhaled steroids are&#xD;
             acceptable);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who have received an investigational medication or device within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to enrollment into this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who have a history of sensitivity to any of the study products or adhesion&#xD;
             materials;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who are currently participating in an investigational study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who are known to be noncompliant or are unlikely to comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the study protocol (e.g., due to alcoholism, product dependency,&#xD;
             mental incapacity) in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
