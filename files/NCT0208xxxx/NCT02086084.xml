  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the UKs commonest chronic diseases and&#xD;
      is responsible for a significant number of acute hospital admissions. COPD is characterised&#xD;
      by progressive destruction in the elastic tissue within the lung, causing respiratory&#xD;
      failure. The clinical course of COPD is characterised by recurrent acute exacerbations&#xD;
      (AECOPD), causing considerable morbidity and mortality. Patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      acute exacerbations present with increased work of breathing and hypercapnia. The standard&#xD;
      for respiratory support in this setting is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), a management&#xD;
      strategy underpinned by a considerable evidence base. However despite NIV, up to 30% of&#xD;
      patients with AECOPD will 'fail' and require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The&#xD;
      mortality rate for patients requiring NIV is approximately 4%, if conversion to mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation occurs the mortality is 29%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last decade has seen an increasing interest in the provision of extracorporeal support&#xD;
      for respiratory failure. The key element that has underpinned improving survival has been&#xD;
      technological advancement. This has resulted in pumps causing less blood trauma and&#xD;
      inflammatory response, better percutaneous cannulation techniques and coated circuits with&#xD;
      reduced heparin requirements. Overall this has significantly reduced the complications&#xD;
      associated with the provision of extracorporeal support. One variation of this technique&#xD;
      (extra-corporeal CO2 removal ECCO2R) allows CO2 clearance from the blood. This approach has&#xD;
      been the subject of a number of animal experiments and uncontrolled human case series&#xD;
      demonstrating improved arterial CO2 and reduced work of breathing. Our own unpublished series&#xD;
      demonstrates the same physiological changes. However to date the benefits of this approach&#xD;
      have not been tested in a randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the addition of ECCO2R to NIV will shorten the duration of NIV and&#xD;
      reduce likelihood of intubation.&#xD;
