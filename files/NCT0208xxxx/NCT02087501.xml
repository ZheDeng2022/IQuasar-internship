      Clinical Investigation Design A prospective, open-label, non-randomized, interventional&#xD;
      clinical study, sponsored by Endospan Ltd. Patients will be followed-up for five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Device The Horizon™ Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Stent Graft System and its&#xD;
      designated Delivery System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Horizon™&#xD;
      AAA Stent Graft System for the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic and/or aortoiliac&#xD;
      aneurysms. The results of this study will be used as supportive data for CE Marking&#xD;
      submission in the European Union (EU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and performance of&#xD;
      the Horizon™ AAA Stent graft System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End Points Safety endpoints include proportion of patients free from device related&#xD;
      Major Adverse Events (MAEs) within 1 month of the endovascular procedure. Performance&#xD;
      endpoints include successful delivery and deployment of the device; and absence of the&#xD;
      following at 1 month follow-up: aneurysm growth ≥5mm, type I or III endoleaks, stent graft&#xD;
      occlusion, conversion to open surgery, rupture and stent graft migration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population Thirty (30) patients having infrarenal abdominal aortic and/or aortoiliac&#xD;
      aneurysms, having Iliac/femoral access vessel morphology that is compatible with vascular&#xD;
      access techniques and devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment All patients will be treated by implantation of the Horizon™ Abdominal Aortic&#xD;
      Aneurysm Stent graft System.&#xD;

      Possible benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that the Horizon™ AAA Stent Graft System implantation may offer a number of&#xD;
      benefits over conventional and recently developed treatment options for patients suffering&#xD;
      from AAA. These other treatment modalities include open surgery and the more recently evolved&#xD;
      EVAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Horizon™ AAA Stent graft System has a low profile of 14Fr and is implanted through a&#xD;
      percutaneous approach. The modular bottom-up construction requires a single-sided femoral&#xD;
      access and there is no need for cannulation of the contralateral limb, a requirement present&#xD;
      in the majority of commercially available devices. These features are anticipated to result&#xD;
      in a simplified procedure with less surgical trauma, shorter procedure time, lower levels of&#xD;
      radiation exposure and shorter hospitalization periods. Moreover, the device is flexible&#xD;
      enough to reach also tortuous anatomies and its fixation elements reduce the concern of&#xD;
      migration and type I endoleaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, it is believed that the Horizon™ AAA Stent graft System may have potential clinical&#xD;
      advantages and may exhibit benefits over commercially available stent-grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical study safety and performance primary endpoints are compared between HORIZON™&#xD;
      and those reported for the Lifeline Registry of Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (Control).&#xD;
