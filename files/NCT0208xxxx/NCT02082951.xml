  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective was to compare the frequency and intensity of symptoms of anxiety in patients&#xD;
      of preoperative cardiac surgery who received empathic behaviour from nurse or family or those&#xD;
      who received no specific type of empathic behaviour. This is a randomized clinical trial. The&#xD;
      sample consisted of 66 patients in preoperative of cardiac surgery, who were divided in three&#xD;
      groups: empathic behaviour by nurses, without specific empathic behaviour and by family.&#xD;
      Anxiety was assessed at two time points: before and after the intervention. The instrument&#xD;
      used was developed and validated, comprising 19 defining characteristics of the nursing&#xD;
      diagnosis anxiety. The hypothesis is that the group who received empathic behaviour from&#xD;
      nurse or family will reduce the anxiety.&#xD;

      Primary outcome is anxiety. Anxiety was assessed by a nurse using of an instrument developed&#xD;
      and validated previous, based on 19 defining characteristics described by NANDA-International&#xD;
      for the nursing diagnosis anxiety: verbalization of fear (expressed concern); apprehension,&#xD;
      nervousness, tension, restlessness, anxiety, anxious, insomnia, abnormal respiratory rate,&#xD;
      increased pulse, dry mouth, increased perspiration, fatigue, cranky; voice / ends trembling,&#xD;
      chest / abdominal pain, urinary urgency, nausea, and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were evaluated for the presence and absence of these anxiety symptoms through&#xD;
      scores: 0 (no symptom) and 1 (presence of symptom). For analysis of the results was carried&#xD;
      out the sum of the scores of each symptom, ranging from 0 to 21, with the higher the score,&#xD;
      the greater was the anxiety symptoms presented by the patient.&#xD;
