  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur in 20-40% of patients with metastatic cancer. The standard treatment&#xD;
      is based on whole brain radiation therapy and local treatment of metastases as neurosurgery&#xD;
      or radiosurgery. However, many cases can not receive a standard local treatment, and local&#xD;
      relapse occurs in almost 50% of cases treated with only whole brain irradiation. There are&#xD;
      retrospective studies of increased radiation dose at the site of metastasis with&#xD;
      hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) with favorable results, but there are no&#xD;
      controlled studies regarding the safety of radiation dose in these situations. This study is&#xD;
      a phase I study to evaluate the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) with HSRT as a way to increase&#xD;
      the dose of radiation after the WBRT for patients with 1-3 brain metastases not eligible for&#xD;
      surgery or RS.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study model It'll be recruited 3 patients to the initial scheme of 4 fractions of 5 Gy on&#xD;
      each brain metastasis with HSRT and if no patient has unacceptable toxicity, more 3 patients&#xD;
      for subsequent scheme will be recruited. If 2 patients had unacceptable toxicity, the study&#xD;
      ends and it'll be considered the study initiated with toxic regimen. If 1 patient has&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, it'll be recruited 3 more patients for this scheme and if 1 or more&#xD;
      patients had unacceptable toxicity, the scheme will be considered toxic and the study will be&#xD;
      closed. If no patient develops unacceptable toxicity, the study will follow to the next&#xD;
      cohort of 3 more patients with next dose level. The same criteria of recruitment will be&#xD;
      performed till any scheme reach the MTD or up to the scheme of 4 fractions of 9 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of fractions of HSRT will be kept in 4 fractions for all cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial dose is 5 Gy per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing the dose of one cohort to another will be more than 1 Gy per day of HSRT. For&#xD;
           example: If the scheme of 4 fractions of 5 Gy will not have unacceptable toxicity, the&#xD;
           study continues to recruit patients for the scheme of 4 fractions of 6 Gy, and so&#xD;
           subsequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will recruit patients to the fractionation scheme up to four fractions of 9 Gy&#xD;
           according to the BEDGy3 be similar to a maximum dose of RS studies to brain metastasis&#xD;
           of 24 Gy in one fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the discretion of the responsible investigator for the safety of the study, the&#xD;
           number of patients may be increased in each cohort during the study.&#xD;
