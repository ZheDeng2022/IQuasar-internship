  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retained placenta (RP) is a complication after a normal birth, which affects nearly 11,000&#xD;
      women in the UK per year. This is where the placenta is not delivered spontaneously after&#xD;
      giving birth. It is a major cause of postpartum haemorrhage (major loss of blood) which can&#xD;
      lead to the death of the mother. The recommended treatment for RP is a surgical procedure -&#xD;
      manual removal of placenta (MROP). This is a painful and unpleasant intervention for the&#xD;
      women, involving additional hospital stay, and is an expensive outcome for the NHS. It is&#xD;
      widely recognised that non-surgical management options for RP are limited and it has been&#xD;
      recommended that research is needed into new medical treatments for RP. New effective&#xD;
      treatments for RP would dramatically reduce the number of women requiring MROP with the&#xD;
      operation being restricted to the small minority of women with particularly stuck placentae.&#xD;
      The reduction in operative interventions would have cost benefits for the NHS and also for&#xD;
      women in terms of increased satisfaction, less separation of mother and baby immediately&#xD;
      after birth, and reduced morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will try to prove the clinical and cost effectiveness of a known treatment for&#xD;
      angina, Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) used to treat RP. The investigators will compare GTN&#xD;
      against a placebo (dummy treatment) in a randomised controlled blinded trial (GOT-IT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GOT-IT Trial will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will involve an internal&#xD;
      pilot study where the aim will be to test out and refine trial procedures in a small number&#xD;
      of hospital sites. The second phase will be the main trial where recruitment will be extended&#xD;
      to a larger number of hospitals in order to determine clinical and cost effectiveness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although a growing body of evidence supports a use for GTN for treatment of RP, much of this&#xD;
      evidence is based on anecdotal case-reports or clinical &quot;trials&quot; which are non-randomised, do&#xD;
      not include a placebo arm and are underpowered. Further, in the context of constrained&#xD;
      maternity resources in a publicly funded health system, it is important to quantify the costs&#xD;
      associated with the use of GTN (including any subsequent monitoring costs and costs&#xD;
      associated with complications) in relation to its effectiveness and any subsequent cost&#xD;
      savings it may deliver over standard practice. There is therefore an urgent need for a&#xD;
      pragmatic clinical trial of GTN for RP to determine whether GTN is efficacious, safe,&#xD;
      acceptable and cost-effective as a treatment for RP before a treatment which may (or may not)&#xD;
      work is embedded within routine clinical practice. Our proposed randomised placebo controlled&#xD;
      double blind pragmatic UK wide GOT-IT trial RCT (with internal pilot study) will definitively&#xD;
      determine whether sublingual GTN is (or is not) clinically and cost effective for management&#xD;
      of RP.&#xD;
