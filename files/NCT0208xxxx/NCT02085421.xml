  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study is a randomized controlled study to assess effectiveness of&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to enhance cognitive remediation therapy in&#xD;
      patients with psychotic disorders. tDCS. Patients will be randomized into two arms: active&#xD;
      tDCS vs. sham tDCS. The active tDCS will be applied at a current of 1-2 mA (milliamperes) via&#xD;
      two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x 4.5 cm) applied to the side of the head. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesis is that the use of tDCS will enhance the improvement seen with&#xD;
      cognitive remediation therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study is a randomized controlled study to assess effectiveness of tDCS to&#xD;
      enhance cognitive remediation therapy in patients with psychotic disorders. All patients will&#xD;
      participate in cognitive remediation therapy (CRT). After initial consent form has been&#xD;
      signed, all participants will undergo various neurocognitive and psychological assessments&#xD;
      including the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), an EEG, and several&#xD;
      other tasks/assessments. Participants will then complete 2-4 CRT sessions per week, each&#xD;
      lasting approximately one hour, for a total of 10 sessions. The CRT will use a commercially&#xD;
      available PositScience software package. Each CRT session involves an in-session assessment&#xD;
      of skill acquisition, as collected by commercially available CRT software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two arms: active tDCS vs. sham tDCS. The tDCS will be&#xD;
      applied at a current of 1-2mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x 4.5 cm) each&#xD;
      CRT session. The anode will be placed over left DLPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) at F3,&#xD;
      according to the 10-20 international system for EEG electrode placement. The cathode will be&#xD;
      placed over the contralateral supraorbital area (Fp2). This placement is consistent with&#xD;
      previous protocols targeting working memory. Both active and sham conditions will have&#xD;
      identical electrode placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After electrodes have been placed, the participants will be instructed to log into CRT&#xD;
      software using a unique patient identifier. Once logged in to CRT software they will be&#xD;
      instructed to begin the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tDCS will be applied at a current of 1-2mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm&#xD;
      x 4.5 cm) for the first 20 minutes of each CRT session in the active condition. In the sham&#xD;
      condition, tDCS will be ramped up to 1-2 mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x&#xD;
      4.5 cm) over the first 30 seconds of each CRT session and then turned off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the hour long CRT session. The software program instructs the&#xD;
      patient when the end of the session has been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the 10 sessions of CRT, both active and sham tDCS patients will repeat&#xD;
      the the same assessments from the beginning, including the BACS, another EEG, and several&#xD;
      other tasks/assessments. Patients will also be asked to return for a 1-month follow-up where&#xD;
      most of the same tasks/assessments are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent and baseline assessments take about 8 hours in total and can be split up into 2-4&#xD;
      appointments. Each of the 10 training sessions lasts approximately 1 hour for a total of 10&#xD;
      hours of training. The post-training assessments take about 6 hours and can be split up into&#xD;
      2-3 appointments. The 1-month follow-up takes approxmately 3.5 hours and can be completed in&#xD;
      1-2 appointments. The total time commitment for this study is approximately 28-32 hours.&#xD;
