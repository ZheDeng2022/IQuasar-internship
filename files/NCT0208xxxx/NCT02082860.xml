      This is a Phase I trial aimed to determine the safety of the investigational gene therapy&#xD;
      product (rAAV2/5-PBGD) for the treatment of Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to eight patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria will participate in this&#xD;
      multicentre, open label, single dose, dose-ranging Phase I clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolled patients will be followed up to assess the safety profile of the investigational&#xD;
      gene therapy product and to establish the maximum therapeutic safe dose to be administered in&#xD;
      future confirmatory/pivotal clinical trial(s). In addition, the biological and clinical&#xD;
      response to the treatment with rAAV2/5-PBGD in AIP patients will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete evaluation of the clinical (symptoms and quality of life assessment) and&#xD;
      laboratory (blood and urine) data will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder of the heme&#xD;
      biosynthesis pathway. AIP is caused by a genetic defect in porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD),&#xD;
      a key enzyme for heme synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIP is characterized by acute episodes and asymptomatic periods. Neuropathic symptoms are&#xD;
      predominantly in these attacks, which may be related to the toxic effect produced by the&#xD;
      precursors delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), accumulated because the&#xD;
      enzyme deficiency. It occurs with very low prevalence (1 in 50,000), but figures for&#xD;
      prevalence based on clinical manifestations (i.e., acute attacks) greatly underestimate the&#xD;
      number of patients with latent AIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal pain is the most common symptom, sometimes with constipation. Paresthesia and&#xD;
      paralysis also occur, and death may result from respiratory paralysis. Other symptoms,&#xD;
      including seizures, psychotic episodes, and hypertension, develop during acute attacks. They&#xD;
      may be precipitated by porphyrogenic drugs such as barbiturates, progestogens and&#xD;
      sulfonamides, some of which are known to induce the first rate-controlling step in heme&#xD;
      synthesis, ALA synthesis. Other known precipitants are alcohol, infection, starvation, and&#xD;
      hormonal changes; attacks are more common in women. Acute attacks rarely occur before&#xD;
      puberty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I clinical trial mainly aimed to evaluate the safety of a recombinant adeno&#xD;
      associated vector with a liver-specific promoter for the PBGD expression (rAAV2/5-PBGD), for&#xD;
      the treatment of Acute Intermittent Porphyria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be enrolled in an adaptive dose-escalation, multicentre trial to assess&#xD;
      safety profile, and to establish the maximum therapeutic safe dose to be administrated to&#xD;
      patients in further confirmatory or pivotal clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is preceded by an &quot;Observational study of acute intermittent porphyria&#xD;
      patients&quot; (DIG-API-2011-01). In this observational study, severe AIP patients have been&#xD;
      followed for 6 to up to a maximum 24 months. During this time, the clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      (blood and urine biochemistry) conditions of the patients were evaluated, in order establish&#xD;
      clinical and biological baseline and history to compare the future results of this clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this clinical trial, the safety will be evaluated by the Adverse Events (AEs) and&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) assessment. A complete evaluation of the clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory (blood and urine) data will be collected. The study will also investigate as&#xD;
      secondary endpoints the effect of this treatment to modify other aspects of the patient&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the heterogeneity of genetic mutations and inter-individual variation, clinical&#xD;
      symptomatology and ALA/PBG levels in AIP subjects showed an evident variability in urine&#xD;
      samples both during acute attacks and during remission; each subject will be its own control,&#xD;
      so this study will be an intra-individually controlled clinical trial. At the end of the&#xD;
      clinical trial the efficacy evaluation will be performed based on the clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical changes compared to the baseline established in the previous observational study.&#xD;
