  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the southwest region of Alaska where the project takes place, 79% of Alaska Native women&#xD;
      smoke cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco (ST) during pregnancy. In addition, pregnancy&#xD;
      appears to be a high risk period for initiation of tobacco use, primarily ST, among women&#xD;
      reporting no use of tobacco 3 months before pregnancy. Intervention efforts targeting the&#xD;
      entire community, not only pregnant women, to address social norms about tobacco use may be&#xD;
      effective. Thus, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of a novel, multi-component,&#xD;
      theory-based intervention for reducing tobacco use during pregnancy, incorporating both&#xD;
      individually targeted and community level components delivered by female elders &quot;Native&#xD;
      Sisters.&quot; The intervention builds on effective community and individual-based approaches for&#xD;
      tobacco cessation and lay health advisor approaches for cancer prevention among Native&#xD;
      American women. As part of the intervention, a social marketing campaign including digital&#xD;
      stories and other small media will be developed with community feedback. Individually&#xD;
      targeted components will be six 30-40 minute telephone or home-based peer counseling sessions&#xD;
      with pregnant women.&#xD;

      The project will be conducted in two phases. In Phase I, the investigators will develop the&#xD;
      social marketing components by obtaining qualitative feedback from pregnant women, family&#xD;
      members and elders on message content and delivery channels. In Phase II, the investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the intervention using a group-randomized design with village as the unit of&#xD;
      assignment. Sixteen villages will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention or control&#xD;
      condition (usual care), with &gt; 20 pregnant women enrolled from each village. Assessments will&#xD;
      be completed by enrolled women through 6 months postpartum. All aspects of the project will&#xD;
      be guided by a Community Advisory Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To develop and pre-test the social marketing campaign messages and delivery channels&#xD;
      through focus groups and individual interviews of pregnant women, family members, and elders.&#xD;
      The focus group work will assess reasons for initiating or continuing tobacco use during&#xD;
      pregnancy and the potential role of other community members in addressing tobacco use in&#xD;
      pregnancy. Findings will be used to develop campaign messages and media that will be&#xD;
      pre-tested through individual interviews and refined. Session content for the individually&#xD;
      targeted intervention components will also be developed to align with the campaign messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To evaluate the efficacy of the intervention compared with the control condition on&#xD;
      the biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence tobacco use rate at week 36 gestation and&#xD;
      at 6 months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared with the control condition, the intervention will be associated with&#xD;
      significantly lower rates of tobacco use in late pregnancy (80% vs. 65%) and at 6 months&#xD;
      postpartum (70% vs. 55%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To examine the effect of the intervention on proposed social cognitive-theory based&#xD;
      mediators of change including perceived social norms about tobacco use and self-efficacy for&#xD;
      non-tobacco use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Intervention effects on tobacco use at week 36 gestation and at 6 months&#xD;
      postpartum will be mediated by perceived self-efficacy and anti-tobacco norms.&#xD;
