  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with marked bladder dysfunction as a result of secondary progressive multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis are being recruited to receive AIMSPRO or placebo by subcutaneous injection, in&#xD;
      this double-blind crossover study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment periods of 4 weeks' duration are separated by a 6 week wash-out phase. After 14&#xD;
      weeks of randomised therapy there is a 38 week period of &quot;open-label&quot; AIMSPRO treatment.&#xD;
