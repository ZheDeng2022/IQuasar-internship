      Introduction: Iron deficiency anaemia remains a significant public health challenge.&#xD;
      Localized food based approaches may offer a large opportunity to improve lives and address&#xD;
      the widespread micronutrient deficiencies such as iron in affected households. Viable&#xD;
      solutions where iron rich foods are not readily available may come through diversification&#xD;
      approaches using foods such as amaranth grain reported to contain high iron content and good&#xD;
      quality protein in conjunction with the use of in-home fortification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To determine the efficacy of maize porridge enriched with amaranth flour on&#xD;
      improving diet quality, iron intake and status in children 12-59 months in a semiarid area in&#xD;
      Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population will comprise children aged 12-59 months in Migwani,&#xD;
      within the larger Mwingi district, Kenya. Mothers or principal caretakers will be interviewed&#xD;
      on behalf of the children. In total, 270 children will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a randomized controlled trial design conducted over a period of 4 months/16&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment/hypothesis: All participating children will be required to take the provided&#xD;
      porridge equivalent to 80g of flour 5 days a week for 16 weeks. There will be 3 treatments&#xD;
      groups as follows; (1) maize porridge enriched with amaranth grain flour at 70:30&#xD;
      maize/amaranth ratio, (2) maize porridge fortified with a multiple micronutrient powder&#xD;
      (MixMe™) and (3) plain maize porridge group. Hypothesis: there will be a significant&#xD;
      difference in hemoglobin and iron status between the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Blood samples (5ml) will be collected by veni-puncture at baseline and after&#xD;
      intervention. Hb concentration, Zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) and malaria infection will be&#xD;
      assessed in the field. Analyses of serum ferritin, serum transferrin receptor and C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) will be done at the participating laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameter/Endpoints: Change in Hb concentration is the primary outcome of this&#xD;
      study. Body iron measured by serum ferritin (SF) and serum transferrin receptor (STfR) are&#xD;
      the secondary outcome. Iron deficiency will be defined as SF concentration &lt;12 µg/L and&#xD;
      tissue iron deficiency will be defined as serum transferrin receptor concentration of&#xD;
      &gt;8.3mg/L. Infection will be assessed by raised CRP (&gt;10mg/L) as an indicator of acute&#xD;
      inflammation and presence of malaria.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale The most severe problems of micronutrient deficiency are found&#xD;
      amongst resource poor, food insecure and vulnerable households in developing countries. From&#xD;
      the 1999 Kenya national survey on micronutrients, it was estimated that seven out of every&#xD;
      ten children under five years are likely to be anaemic (Hb&lt;110g/L) and nearly half (43.2%)&#xD;
      were iron deficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period of complementary feeding is a critical and vulnerable time in the growth and&#xD;
      development of children. Poor complementary feeding practices combined with chronic food&#xD;
      insecurity are found to substantially contribute to the widespread multiple micronutrients&#xD;
      deficiencies in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent food consumption study in Mwingi district in Kenya, showed that ugali (stiff maize&#xD;
      porridge) was the primary complementary food. The use of ugali as the primary complementary&#xD;
      food suggests that the children may be at risk of inadequate micronutrient intake among&#xD;
      children 12-23 months. These findings underscore the need to establish solutions to increase&#xD;
      dietary diversity and to promote use of foods that are rich in nutrients such as iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amaranth grain offers the prospect of considerably improving dietary food diversification in&#xD;
      semi arid areas. Agronomic investigations indicate that amaranth grain contains high iron&#xD;
      concentrations ranging from 7.6-27 mg/100g of edible portion. Amaranth grain is a hardy crop&#xD;
      and can withstand low rainfall. As such, grain amaranth may offer a viable solution in&#xD;
      semi-arid areas where iron rich foods such as animal and fortified products are not readily&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has therefore been designed to investigate the efficacy of porridge made from&#xD;
      amaranth enriched maize flour in improving the diet quality and iron intake in children 12-59&#xD;
      months in a semi-arid area in Kenya. Home fortification of complementary foods using&#xD;
      micronutrient powders has also been shown to reduce iron deficiency anaemia in many&#xD;
      resource-poor settings including Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The primary objective of this study is To determine the efficacy of maize porridge&#xD;
      enriched with amaranth grain flour on improving iron intake and status in children 12-59&#xD;
      months in a semi arid area in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition we aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of amaranth grain enriched maize porridge compared to maize&#xD;
           porridge fortified with micronutrient multi-mix powder (MixMe™) to improve iron status&#xD;
           and intake of children 12-59 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the iron, zinc and nutritional status of children 12-59 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children receiving amaranth grain enriched maize porridge will show greater improvement&#xD;
           in iron status than those receiving plain maize porridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children receiving amaranth enriched maize porridge will show less improvement in iron&#xD;
           status than those receiving maize porridge fortified with micronutrient multi-mix powder&#xD;
           (MixMe™).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Area and Population The study will be conducted in Migwani within the larger Mwingi&#xD;
      District in Eastern Kenya. This area falls within the arid and semi arid area (ASAL) and thus&#xD;
      experiences food shortage for most part of the year. The study population will comprise&#xD;
      children aged 12-59 months. Mothers or principal caretakers will be interviewed on behalf of&#xD;
      the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study will have a randomized controlled trial design conducted over a period&#xD;
      of 4 months/16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administrative study area has been purposively selected as it falls within an&#xD;
      agro-ecological zone of a semi-arid area. Random sampling out of a total of six Sub-locations&#xD;
      in Migwani will be done to get 4 Sub-locations. Within a Sub-location, individual sampling&#xD;
      units (Household with a child aged 12-59 months) will be selected using a random walk method&#xD;
      until the required sample size of 68 children is achieved per Sub-location. Children who meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria shall be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maize porridge enriched with amaranth grain flour&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maize porridge fortified with a multiple micronutrient powder (MixMe™)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Plain maize porridge&#xD;
