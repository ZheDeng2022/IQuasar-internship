  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lamellar ichthyosis (IL) is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis with a defect of&#xD;
      keratinization of the skin which results in a severe generalized cutaneous xerosis with dark&#xD;
      brown big scales, an ectropion, an eclabion, an alopecia and a palmo-plantar keratodermia.&#xD;
      They are due to mutations of the gene TGM1 coding for the transglutaminase keratinocyte 1&#xD;
      (TG1) in 1/3 of the cases. Other genes were recently identified, ABCA12 coding for the&#xD;
      triphosphate-binding adenosine cassette A12 and FLJ39501 which codes for a protein of the&#xD;
      cytochrome p450 ( CYP4F2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No etiological treatment is available. Symptomatic treatment consists on twice application of&#xD;
      emollients and keratolytic ointments which decrease the dryness of the skin and reduce&#xD;
      scales. Oral isotretinoin is usually partially effective but is only suspensive and has&#xD;
      numerous side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies showed that the epigallocatechin-3-gallate (POLYPHENON E®), extracted from&#xD;
      green tea increases the differentiation of the normal human keratinocytes, as showedb by the&#xD;
      increase of the involucrine, TG1 and caspase-14 genes expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this pilot study is to estimate the action and the tolerance of a daily&#xD;
      application of topical Polyphénon E 10% ® to improve the desquamation and the cutaneous&#xD;
      roughness of patients with lamellar ichthyosis, after 4 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the duration of remission obtained after the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the action of cutaneous Veregen® to improve the palmar and plantar&#xD;
           involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the action of cutaneous Veregen on the pruritus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  And to estimate the global level of acceptability by the patient of the Veregen 10 %&#xD;
