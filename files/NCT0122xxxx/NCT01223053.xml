  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study examines the use of TDLP-110 (a.k.a. Ketotransdel® or ketoprofen 10%&#xD;
      cream), as a topical treatment for pain associated with mild to moderate acute soft tissue&#xD;
      injury of the upper and lower extremities to serve as a confirmatory trial. The first&#xD;
      completed Phase 3 study showed efficacy and safety of TDLP-110 compared to placebo in&#xD;
      improving the patient assessment of pain.&#xD;
