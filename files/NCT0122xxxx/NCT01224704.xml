      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - One area in which obese and lean individuals may be different is how their bodies handle&#xD;
      water balance and thirst. Studies done in animals suggest that individuals with greater body&#xD;
      fat may tolerate periods without water better than lean animals. Other research has found a&#xD;
      link between the ability to tolerate periods without water and increased body weight.&#xD;
      Researchers are interested in studying whether the ability to tolerate periods without water&#xD;
      and ability to feel thirst might differ in lean versus obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effects of water deprivation and feelings of thirst in lean and obese&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy individuals at least 18 years of age who are either lean (body mass index less than&#xD;
      26 kg/m(2)) or obese (body mass index at least 35 kg/m(2)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood&#xD;
           and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will spend the entire study (13 days) as inpatients at the National&#xD;
           Institutes of Health Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition assessment (using low-level x-rays) to determine the percentage of fat&#xD;
           tissue in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test (similar to that often used to diagnose diabetes).&#xD;
           Individuals who are suspected to have diabetes will not be allowed to continue with the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High salt infusion test, in which an infusion of saline (salt water) will be given for 2&#xD;
           hours and participants will respond to questions about how hungry and thirsty they feel&#xD;
           during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Water deprivation test, in which participants will go for 24 hours without water or food&#xD;
           and respond to questions about how hungry and thirsty they feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour stay in a metabolic chamber to determine how many calories participants burn in&#xD;
           a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A series of questionnaires about participants' eating habits, feelings about food, and&#xD;
           personal feelings, as well as computer-based tests involving the performance of various&#xD;
           tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of free-living energy using doubly-labeled water, in which participants will&#xD;
           drink a sample of water with extra-heavy atoms of hydrogen and oxygen to evaluate the&#xD;
           amount of water in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequent blood samples, urine collection, and fat tissue biopsies during the various&#xD;
           study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the end of the 13-day study, participants will return after 1 week for a final&#xD;
           urine collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The percentage of people with overweight / obesity in the United States has reached very high&#xD;
      levels, with 65% of adults over the age of 20 being overweight. Recently, there have been a&#xD;
      number of advances in our understanding of the underlying causes of obesity, including&#xD;
      greater understanding of both the effects of the environment and effects that are hereditary&#xD;
      (i.e., genetic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One area in which obese versus lean individuals may be different is how their bodies handle&#xD;
      water balance and thirst. Studies done in animals suggest that individuals with greater body&#xD;
      fat may tolerate periods without water better than lean animals. Thus, at least in animals,&#xD;
      others have found a link between ability to tolerate periods without water and increased body&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are studying whether the ability to tolerate periods without water and ability to feel&#xD;
      thirst might differ in lean versus obese individuals. To do so, we will ask lean and obese&#xD;
      individuals to undergo tests that include a period of approximately 24 hours without drinking&#xD;
      any water, and on a separate day a shorter period of an intravenous high salt solution&#xD;
      infusion. We will be looking at how the ability to withstand thirst (dehydration), subsequent&#xD;
      water intake (rehydration), changes in hormone levels during these periods, and behavioral&#xD;
      and physiological responses to thirst and rehydration differ in lean versus obese&#xD;
      individuals. We hope that the data gathered from this study will give us more information&#xD;
      about important differences in how water balance is regulated in lean versus obese&#xD;
      individuals. Understanding these questions may provide new insights into differences between&#xD;
      lean and obese individuals.&#xD;
