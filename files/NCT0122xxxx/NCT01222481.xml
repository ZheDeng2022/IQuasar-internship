  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer survivorship has dramatically improved within the last four decades and a greater&#xD;
      number of Americans are living after cancer diagnosis. An increase in the number of survivors&#xD;
      has highlighted the need to investigate the quality of life experienced by these survivors.&#xD;
      While Survivorship research has improved our understanding of the challenges faced by some&#xD;
      cancer survivors, there is a paucity of research on the functional and cognitive health&#xD;
      status of head and neck cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional and cognitive changes that occur in&#xD;
      head and neck cancer patients as a result of cancer treatment, in an attempt to increase our&#xD;
      understanding of the complex interactions between cancer treatment, comorbid health ailments&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States today, accounting for nearly&#xD;
      a quarter of total deaths. Due to advancements in cancer management, specifically in the&#xD;
      areas of surveillance, early diagnosis, and utilization of evidenced-based therapies, there&#xD;
      has been an increase in the number of survivors in the United States. As at 2007, there were&#xD;
      over 11 million cancer survivors in the United States and this number is projected to reach&#xD;
      15 million by the end of 2010. Investigations into the quality of life experienced by these&#xD;
      survivors have therefore become necessary if these survivors are to be effectively managed&#xD;
      through their course of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in the number of cancer survivors has opened up a relatively new avenue of&#xD;
      cancer research termed Cancer Survivorship Research. Cancer Survivorship Research seeks to&#xD;
      investigate the physical, functional and psychosocial consequences of cancer. Despite&#xD;
      advances made in survivorship research, gaps remain in our knowledge concerning the ability&#xD;
      of the cancer survivor to reintegrate into life and function at pre-cancer levels. These&#xD;
      knowledge-gaps are especially true for head and neck cancer patients as demonstrated by the&#xD;
      paucity of studies in the literature evaluating the functional and psychosocial consequences&#xD;
      of cancer in this cohort. This is a significant short-coming especially since head and neck&#xD;
      cancer patients are at increased risks for adverse consequences due to their advanced age at&#xD;
      the time of cancer diagnosis, comorbidity burdens and substantial history of alcohol or&#xD;
      tobacco use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the functional and cognitive changes that occur in head and neck&#xD;
      cancer patients as a result of cancer treatment, in an attempt to understand the consequences&#xD;
      of cancer treatment on the quality of life experienced by these survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will use self-report questionnaires, neurocognitive assessments and novel&#xD;
      performance-based assessments to evaluate functional and cognitive health status at two&#xD;
      time-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At Baseline (before any cancer treatment modality)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After the first stage of cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation or surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments to be utilized include the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale&#xD;
      (CES-D), University of Alabama Life Space Assessment Aids form (LSA Aids), Dysexecutive&#xD;
      Questionnaire (DEX), Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), Lawton Index of&#xD;
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), University of Alabama Life Space Assessment&#xD;
      (LSA), Short Blessed Test (SBT), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Adult Comorbidity&#xD;
      Evaluation-27 (ACE-27), and the Delis Kaplan Executive Function Scale (DKEFS) - Sorting task,&#xD;
      Color Word Interference task, and Trail Making task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be assessed using the Executive Function Performance Test (EFPT). The&#xD;
      EFPT is a performance-based measure of cognitive function developed at the Program for&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy at Washington University School of Medicine that assesses (under direct&#xD;
      observation) the amount of assistance needed by participants to complete five basic tasks&#xD;
      essential for self-maintenance and independent living. The tasks include hand-washing,&#xD;
      cooking, using the telephone, taking medications and paying bills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head and Neck cancer patients will undergo these comprehensive assessments at each of the two&#xD;
      time-points, allowing for the ability to follow changes in function and cognition over the&#xD;
      course of cancer therapy. Statistical analyses will be performed with the SASÂ® software&#xD;
      version 9.1.3 to obtain descriptive statistics and to investigate statistically-significant&#xD;
      changes in functional and cognitive health status between the time-points evaluated.&#xD;
