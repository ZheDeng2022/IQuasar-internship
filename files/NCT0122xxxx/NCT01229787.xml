      Obesity has been recognized as a risk factors for developing asthma. In a cohort of 5384&#xD;
      children aged 15-17, we aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the association of asthma prevalence at age 15-17 with body mass index&#xD;
           (BMI) at age 15-17 and BMI at age 11-12 years Part II&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the association of BMI in adolescence and BMI at age 11-12 years with:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Prevalence of allergic sensitization&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Lung function&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Levels of airway inflammation at age 16-18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Severity of asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, to assess diet and physical activity involvement as effect modifiers in these&#xD;
      possible associations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional studies in Northern America, Northern Europe and Asia indicate an increased&#xD;
      prevalence and severity of asthma in the obese whereas longitudinal studies have indicated&#xD;
      that increasing BMI is associated with increased risk of incident asthma in women. However,&#xD;
      the mechanisms through which where-by obesity increases the risk for asthma remain unclear.&#xD;
      There are only few studies from North America and Asia that suggested that obesity is&#xD;
      associated with increased skin test reactivity and atopic diseases and many more that suggest&#xD;
      obesity has no association with atopy. In adult asthmatics, it has also been shown that both&#xD;
      medical and surgical weight loss is consistently associated with dramatic improvements in&#xD;
      lung function, asthma symptoms, and medication usage. However, in children no study has&#xD;
      elaborated on the potential benefits of reducing weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total fat intake has also been associated with the diagnosis of asthma. N-3 fatty acids have&#xD;
      been noted to inversely correlate with body fat, while levels of N-6 fatty acids correlated&#xD;
      positively with body fat. Increased dietary intake of N-3 fatty acid (such as&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acid) (mainly fish oils) has been generally associated with protection from&#xD;
      asthma, while intake of N-6 fatty acids (such as linoleic acid) may increase asthma risk,&#xD;
      although this remains controversial. Linoleic acid may act as a precursor of arachidonic acid&#xD;
      which subsequently serves as a precursor of 4-series leukotrienes that are highly active&#xD;
      mediators of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are only two studies that investigated the levels of exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) as&#xD;
      indicator of airway inflammation in relation with obesity and asthma. One study showed&#xD;
      significant increase of ENO with increasing BMI in healthy adults. However, the levels of ENO&#xD;
      and exhaled leukotriene B4 were recently found to be increased in lean and obese asthmatic&#xD;
      children but not related to their BMI's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Southern European countries, there are no representative epidemiological data on the&#xD;
      contribution of obesity to asthma burden. In this area of the world, there are also no&#xD;
      studies on the effect of important lifestyle factors including diet and physical activity on&#xD;
      the association of adiposity with asthma pathophysiology. In addition, no information exists&#xD;
      on levels of airways inflammation both in non-asthmatics and asthmatics subjects in relation&#xD;
      to body content in fat and the impact of weight reduction on airway inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In years 2001-2003, a national health survey was conducted in Cyprus focusing on nutrition&#xD;
      and physical fitness of all children aged 11-12 years (attending the 6th form of all primary&#xD;
      schools). With this project we proposed to approach this group of children in years 2007-2009&#xD;
      to investigate the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I To investigate the association of asthma prevalence at age 15-17 with body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) at age 15-17 and independently with BMI at age 11-12 years Part II&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the association of BMI at age 16-18 and independently of BMI at age 11-12&#xD;
      years with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prevalence of allergic sensitization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lung function&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Levels of airway inflammation at age 16-18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Severity of asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, to assess diet and physical activity involvement as effect modifiers in these&#xD;
      possible associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Part I took place during the months of January 2007 to June 2007 and&#xD;
      children attending the 1st (15-16 years) and 2nd (16-17 years) classes in all public and&#xD;
      private Lyceia schools across the Republic of Cyprus were invited to participate. The&#xD;
      targeted population were 19849 children that participated in an earlier study in years 2001-3&#xD;
      and had amongst other assessments anthropometric measurements, assessment of&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory fitness and serum lipids taken at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the assessment of children's asthma status we used the Greek version of the ISAAC&#xD;
      (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) core questionnaire supplemented&#xD;
      with questions relating to potential person-based risk factors such as the place of birth of&#xD;
      the child, ethnic origin of the parents, birth order, parental education level, parental&#xD;
      smoking, history of atopy in the immediate family (siblings and parents with a history of&#xD;
      asthma, eczema and or hay fever), personal uptake of smoking, pet ownership and place of&#xD;
      residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating students had also their weight, percentage body fat and Body Mass Index&#xD;
      (BMI) measured. The subjects' BMI had been classified as normal weight, overweight or obese&#xD;
      according to sex and age specific cut-offs (six months intervals), suggested by the&#xD;
      International Obesity Task Force (IOTF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compilation of Dataset&#xD;
&#xD;
      An effort to match subjects on the 2007 cross-sectional database with subjects on the&#xD;
      2001-2002 old cross-sectional database was carried out using various matching parameters. A&#xD;
      dataset of 5384 subjects was constructed with matched BMI values in 2007 (aged 15-17 years)&#xD;
      and in 2001-2003 (aged 11-12 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using answers to the basic questions for asthma and respiratory morbidity of the ISAAC&#xD;
      questionnaire the case definition was further refined to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Active asthma: positive answers to questions on ever having asthma and current wheeze&#xD;
           and or night time cough unrelated to colds in the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inactive asthma: positive answer to question on ever having asthma and negative answers&#xD;
           to questions for current wheeze and night time cough unrelated to colds in the past 12&#xD;
           months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Respiratory symptoms without asthma: negative answer to question on ever having asthma&#xD;
           and positive answer(s) to questions on current wheeze and or night time cough unrelated&#xD;
           to colds in the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The associations between disease outcomes and obesity predictors (BMI z-score and body fat&#xD;
      %), were analyzed through univariate analysis and the odds ratio (OR) were calculated with&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals (CI). In addition to the univariate analysis, multiple logistic&#xD;
      regression was also performed to further investigate the associations of obesity predictors&#xD;
      and disease outcomes adjusting for confounders and stratifying by significant effect&#xD;
      modifiers. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;

        Part I took place in 2007 and children 15-16 and 16-17 years across Cyprus were invited to&#xD;
        participate. The targeted population were 19849 children that participated in an earlier&#xD;
        study in years 2001-3 and had anthropometric measurements, assessment of cardio-respiratory&#xD;
        fitness and serum lipids taken at that time. The subjects of the second part of the study&#xD;
        were selected from the 5384 subjects that had participated in the first part and had&#xD;
        matched data on current and past BMI. We targeted subjects for part two of the study with&#xD;
        the following criteria:1. Current Wheezers: All active asthmatics across all BMI subgroups.&#xD;
        Definition of Current Wheezer: Positive answer to the question in ISAAC questionnaire:&#xD;
        &quot;Have you had wheezing in the past 12 months?&quot; 2. Never Wheezers: 700 controls selected in&#xD;
        a random way across all BMI groups. Definition of Never Wheezer: Negative answers to both&#xD;
        of the following two questions: &quot;Have you ever had wheezing?&quot; and &quot;Have you ever had&#xD;
