  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use and tobacco-caused illnesses and death are increasing in developing countries&#xD;
      globally, so it is critical to study these countries in order to effectively address the&#xD;
      tobacco epidemic. The proposed project will test the effectiveness of community-based&#xD;
      interventions for secondhand smoke and quitting smoking in eight underserved communities in&#xD;
      the Dominican Republic. The project will also partner with communities and national and&#xD;
      international groups to determine whether the methods and interventions from this study in&#xD;
      the Dominican Republic can also be used to help other countries in the region and underserved&#xD;
      groups in the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The globalization of the tobacco epidemic poses significant morbidity and mortality burdens,&#xD;
      with the brunt of impact increasingly borne by low-middle income countries. Research&#xD;
      partnerships between investigators from high-income countries with well developed tobacco&#xD;
      control research programs and their counterparts in low-middle income countries are needed to&#xD;
      effectively address this global public health crisis. The Dominican Republic (DR) is a key&#xD;
      site that mirrors the trends in Latin America: it is a low-middle income tobacco growing&#xD;
      country with significant tobacco use and high levels of secondhand smoke exposure, and it is&#xD;
      at a very early stage of tobacco control. The proposed project will assess baseline&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes, exposures, and behaviors regarding tobacco use and secondhand smoke,&#xD;
      provide a randomized controlled trial of community-partnered interventions around secondhand&#xD;
      smoke and tobacco cessation, and develop and implement a dissemination plan for national and&#xD;
      regional impact and translation of methods and results to other underserved groups as&#xD;
      appropriate. A multimethod assessment approach will be used, to include qualitative community&#xD;
      assessments (RAPs), a series of quantitative surveys (household surveillances, community and&#xD;
      smoker cohort surveys, and health care provider surveys), and a biomarker assessment of&#xD;
      secondhand smoke exposure. Eight economically disadvantaged communities will be randomized to&#xD;
      intervention or control conditions in a lagged treatment design; interventions will be&#xD;
      developed and implemented based on the evidence base from other countries and from a current&#xD;
      DR trial, and on input from national and local DR workgroups using a community partnered&#xD;
      approach. The intervention is hypothesized to decrease tobacco use rates, increase the number&#xD;
      of smokefree homes, denormalize smoking, increase awareness of and change attitudes regarding&#xD;
      tobacco use and secondhand smoke risks, decrease exposure to secondhand smoke, and increase&#xD;
      health care provider intervention in intervention- relative to control communities, with&#xD;
      differences by geographic and demographic characteristics to be examined. The project will&#xD;
      also engage international, national, and local DR workgroups to maintain communication of&#xD;
      findings to key partners, host a national DR tobacco control conference with regional&#xD;
      representation, and develop other action steps for local and regional dissemination of&#xD;
      findings and evidence based interventions, resources, and infrastructures. Finally, the&#xD;
      project will coordinate with the University of Rochester Clinical and Translational Sciences&#xD;
      Institute for translation of current evidence based approaches and methodologies for&#xD;
      implementation in the DR, and to explore whether any methodologies or interventions from the&#xD;
      proposed trial in the DR can be translated to underserved groups in the United States.&#xD;
      Effectively engaging early stage low-middle income countries in tobacco control research will&#xD;
      be critical to reducing tobacco use and the burden of tobacco-caused illnesses globally.&#xD;
