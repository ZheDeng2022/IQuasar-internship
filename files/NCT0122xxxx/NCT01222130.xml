      This study is designed to develop and evaluate a set of non-virologic diagnostic algorithms&#xD;
      to monitor HIV-exposed children of unknown infection status for treatment eligibility during&#xD;
      the first year of life. The results of this cross sectional study are expected to be used in&#xD;
      development of a series of non-virologic algorithms to determining treatment eligibility&#xD;
      among HIV-exposed children in settings where polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is not&#xD;
      available and to guide the judicious use of PCR testing among HIV-exposed children in&#xD;
      settings where PCR is available. These results will directly inform program implementation in&#xD;
      Zambia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite recent scientific advances in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT),&#xD;
      substantial donor investment, and national commitments to PMTCT program roll-out, pediatric&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS remains a largely uncontrolled epidemic. Unless some intervention is undertaken,&#xD;
      more than half of children who become HIV-infected will die by their second birthday. Yet in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of infected children die without ever having confirmation of&#xD;
      their HIV status, having never had the chance to begin life-saving antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (ART). Recognizing the need to provide children with greater access to care, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) has advised countries that at least 10% of patients receiving ART should&#xD;
      be children. However, most programs fall well short of this target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike diagnosis in adults, definitive diagnosis of HIV in children less than 18 months of&#xD;
      age requires virologic testing. Maternal IgG antibodies cross the placenta into the fetal&#xD;
      circulation through pregnancy and are also secreted in breast milk. As infants may retain&#xD;
      these maternal antibodies for up to 18 months after birth, conventional HIV antibody tests&#xD;
      are of limited use in determining positive infection status. Instead it is necessary to&#xD;
      directly identify HIV infection using a virologic method, typically polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR) testing to detect viral DNA or RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR testing is expensive and, in most developing countries, available only through specialty&#xD;
      laboratories. Because PCR testing is more complex than other common HIV laboratory assays&#xD;
      (e.g. CD4+ cell counting), it requires technicians with considerably more training and&#xD;
      technical skill, involves longer sample preparation time, and can be considerably more costly&#xD;
      than other diagnostic tests. Thus, most countries with large populations of HIV-infected&#xD;
      children have extremely limited capacity to carry out PCR testing. Even where PCR is&#xD;
      available, pediatric HIV diagnosis may remain difficult in breastfeeding populations because&#xD;
      infants are at continued risk of infection until breastfeeding is completely stopped. A&#xD;
      negative PCR test during breastfeeding does not guarantee that the infant will remain&#xD;
      uninfected. The alternative - serial testing for HIV infection - would result in an&#xD;
      exponential increase in cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, a convincing argument can be made that rather than monitoring HIV-exposed&#xD;
      breastfeeding children for HIV infection, it may be more appropriate to simply monitor for&#xD;
      treatment eligibility, followed by a definitive antibody test at 15-18 months or a few months&#xD;
      after breastfeeding has stopped. Those children who meet criteria for treatment could be&#xD;
      commenced on ART; those who do not would continue to undergo periodic screening until they&#xD;
      were weaned and old enough to have a final (definitive) antibody test. For HIV-exposed&#xD;
      infants without access to HIV PCR testing - the vast majority in Africa - development of such&#xD;
      an algorithm would have the obvious benefit of providing reliable evaluation for treatment&#xD;
      eligibility in the first 18 months of life. Even in settings where HIV PCR testing is&#xD;
      available - but may be limited - the introduction of such algorithms could reduce the volume&#xD;
      of HIV PCR tests required at a programmatic level, and thus lead to substantial cost-savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this protocol is to develop and evaluate a set of non-virologic&#xD;
      diagnostic algorithms that can be used to monitor HIV-exposed children of unknown infection&#xD;
      status for treatment eligibility during the first 12 weeks of life, with validation of our&#xD;
      model among HIV-exposed children up to 12 months of age. We will evaluate the performance of&#xD;
      different algorithms in two separate but common scenarios in Africa: (1) where infant PCR&#xD;
      testing is not available, and (2) where infant PCR may be available, but poorly accessible&#xD;
      due to cost and resource considerations. Although DNA PCR testing has become available in&#xD;
      Zambia, only three sites currently provide this type of testing and capacity may be limited&#xD;
      for country-wide screening. Our study was designed to determine HIV infection and&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) eligibility using more commonly used &quot;non-virologic&quot; tests, such&#xD;
      as CD4, CD8, HIV antibody, total lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, and clinical staging. Previous&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that these indicators by themselves do not perform well in the&#xD;
      absence of DNA PCR testing. In this exploratory study, we hypothesize that combinations of&#xD;
      these tests - in formalized algorithms - can yield high performance and be used in rural&#xD;
      settings where reliable DNA PCR services are not yet available or remain limited.&#xD;
