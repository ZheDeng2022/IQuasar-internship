  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, open label, multicentre Phase II clinical trial to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of the treatment of large defects with 3 different doses&#xD;
      of the autologous chondrocyte transplantation product co.don chondrosphere® (ACT3D-CS) in&#xD;
      subjects with cartilage defects of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening visit patients were booked for arthroscopy and had their cells harvesting&#xD;
      from healthy cartilage. After the arthroscopy the patients were randomised in one of the&#xD;
      three dose-groups. The cells are cultivated for 8-10 weeks in vitro to develope 3-dimensional&#xD;
      spheroids, that are transplanted in an open knee procedure (treatment surgery)into the&#xD;
      defect. Patients of all dose groups subsequently followed the same rehabilitation program and&#xD;
      had post-surgery visits. The 12-month-visit is defined as final assessment. Then patients&#xD;
      have follow-up assessments up to 60 months.&#xD;
