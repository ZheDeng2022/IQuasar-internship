      Objective/Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators objective is to demonstrate that an intervention program based on motor&#xD;
      learning principles can be applied to train subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) who suffer&#xD;
      from freezing to walk in a way that minimizes the occurrence of freezing. Since sufficient&#xD;
      motor learning capabilities are preserved in PD, the investigators hypothesize that an&#xD;
      intervention program that targets the time periods just prior to an approaching freezing&#xD;
      episode can modify the walking strategies so that the episode will now be averted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The freezing burden will be quantified in subjects with PD before and after 6 weeks of&#xD;
      training. Two types of interventions (20 subjects in each group) will be tested: 1) Open-loop&#xD;
      group (OLG); 2) Closed-loop group (CLG). Each session of the OLG training includes walking&#xD;
      courses aimed at provoking freezing episodes. The experimenter will trigger an auditory&#xD;
      rhythmic stimulation (RAS) in walking conditions likely to invoke freezing (e.g., turning)&#xD;
      and the subject will learn to synchronize his/her gait with the auditory cues, i.e., to keep&#xD;
      the walking pace and coordination and, as a result, to avoid freezing. Similar principles&#xD;
      will apply for the CLG training; however, the RAS will be elicited automatically by a device&#xD;
      that recognizes an approaching freezing episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance to Diagnosis/Treatment of Parkinson's Disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If even partially successful, the investigators will show, for the first time that freezing&#xD;
      of gait is amenable to motor learning and that appropriate training with external cueing can&#xD;
      alleviate these motor blockades. While future studies will be needed to further assess&#xD;
      long-term efficacy and other important questions about clinical efficacy and the mechanisms&#xD;
      involved, this study should go a long way towards improving the investigators understanding&#xD;
      of freezing of gait and its amenability to appropriate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that after intensive training, the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      of subjects with PD will be able to anticipate impending freezing episodes based on awareness&#xD;
      of the environmental conditions (e.g., an approaching turn) and/or based on sub-conscious&#xD;
      response to a deteriorating gait pattern. As a result, an automated motor response that paces&#xD;
      and coordinates gait will be internally triggered by the CNS and the approaching freezing&#xD;
      episode will be averted. The overall freezing burden will therefore decrease in trained&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

      Overview: This will be a randomized trial to demonstrate the effects of 6-weeks of training&#xD;
      with open-loop or triggered, closed-loop cueing. PD+ FOG patients will be studied before and&#xD;
      after 6 weeks of training (total of 18 sessions) and one month later (to begin to assess&#xD;
      retention). The two intervention groups will receive training sessions designed to enhance&#xD;
      implicit motor learning and avoidance of FOG. This will be the first study to assess these&#xD;
      novel paradigms. If the results support the hypotheses, further studies will be needed&#xD;
      including a placebo-controlled trial. 20 subjects will be included in the feed-forward,&#xD;
      open-loop group (OLG) and 20 in the feedback, closed-loop group (CLG) (based on power&#xD;
      analysis to provide 80% power at Î±=0.05). Participants will be recruited on a rolling&#xD;
      admission basis (about 2 subjects per week over ~20 weeks) and will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of the 2 groups. Pre, post and retention effects will be tested without knowledge of&#xD;
      group assignment. A (repeated measures) mixed models statistical approach will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate within and across group effects over time, adjusting for baseline values. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted under the auspices of the Laboratory for Gait and Neurodynamics and the&#xD;
      Movement Disorders Unit (MDU) at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. At all times during&#xD;
      training and testing, the subjects will be closely monitored by a research assistant to&#xD;
      ensure safety.&#xD;
