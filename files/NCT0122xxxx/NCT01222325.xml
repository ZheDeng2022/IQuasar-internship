  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to check if a reduction in the frequency and total number of shocks delivered during&#xD;
      extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) results in a great number of stone-free&#xD;
      patients,the investigators compared two different ways of treating urinary stones using SWL.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Two different regimens of SWL delivery for treating urinary stones were compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: After informed consent, patients with previously untreated renal and ureteric stones&#xD;
      were admitted for an initial treatment by SWL between June 2008 and May 2009. Patients were&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups; one group received 3000 impulses at a rate of 60 impulses&#xD;
      per minute, and the other received 4000 impulses at a rate of 90 impulses per minute.&#xD;
      Patients submitted to re-treatment of the same stone were excluded. All treatments were done&#xD;
      using the Dornier Compact Delta lithotripter. Stones were located by x-ray or ultrasound.&#xD;
      Prior to treatment, patients were submitted to laboratory tests and a cardiologic evaluation&#xD;
      when indicated. Urinary infections were treated prior to the SWL session. All procedures were&#xD;
      performed under general anesthesia. Briefly, Tramadol 1-2 mg/kg associated to Propofol&#xD;
      2.5-3.0 mg/kg and scopolamine were employed in the majority of the procedures. Patients&#xD;
      received 50-100 mg of diluted Tramadol and 20 mg of scopolamine just before the beginning of&#xD;
      the SWL session and Propofol was maintained on continuous bomb infusion during the treatment&#xD;
      and interrupted three minutes before the end of the session. All patients were maintained&#xD;
      under spontaneous breathing, and a facial or a laryngeal oxygen mask was used according to&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist's judgment. The potency of the lithotripter was increased progressively&#xD;
      by 300 shocks until reaching the final stage, which occurred at a mean of 1500 shocks. The&#xD;
      maximum potency employed was level 4 (equivalent to 14 kV) for renal stones and level 6 (16&#xD;
      kV) for ureteric stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were treated on an outpatient basis and were discharged from the hospital six&#xD;
      hours after treatment. All patients received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
      and Dipyrone in combination with to Hyoscine for three days postoperatively unless&#xD;
      contraindicated and were instructed to come to the emergency department in case of severe&#xD;
      pain, fever or hematuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final results for each patient were assessed with a kidney and urinary bladder scan (KUB)&#xD;
      plus an abdominal ultrasound three months after the procedure. Success was defined as&#xD;
      stone-free status or the detection of residual fragments â‰¤ 3 mm on final evaluation. Partial&#xD;
      fragmentation was considered to have occurred if a significant reduction in the stone burden&#xD;
      was observed but residual fragments bigger than 3 mm remained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We evaluated overall stone-free rates, the incidence of unchanged stones and the occurrence&#xD;
      of partial fragmentation as well as the occurrence of significant complications in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size required was based on the assumption that the estimated success rate would be&#xD;
      70% in the 3000 impulses at 60 impulses per minute group and 50% in the 4000 impulses at 90&#xD;
      impulses per minute group, with a type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.05 (power of&#xD;
      80%). This yielded a projected sample size of 93 stones in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed using the Fischer's exact, Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests; a level of&#xD;
      significance of 5% was adopted.&#xD;
