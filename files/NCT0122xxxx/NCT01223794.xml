      Goals and future prospects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To finish the survey of the high risk factor ratios and high incidence rates associated&#xD;
           with falls among inpatient fallers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the risk factors associated with falls and the consequential analysis&#xD;
           related to falls among inpatient fallers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A good precautionary measure of falls will reduce damages and injuries for the fallers,&#xD;
           especially inpatients welfare. Our accomplishments of this research proposal will&#xD;
           provide sufficient information and reference for the precautionary strategies associated&#xD;
           with fall incidents. More importantly, the experiences and results will be further&#xD;
           explored and shared among all other hospitals.&#xD;

      Introductions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fall is a very important and challenging question among acute care and long-term care&#xD;
      facilities. The average incidence rate of fall is approximately 40% of total anomalous&#xD;
      reports among hospitals in United States. Fallers may suffer many severe injuries, including&#xD;
      fracture and brain concussions. Even fall had become interesting and popular topics for&#xD;
      medical issues, the efforts of precaution for the fall incidents are still not evident. After&#xD;
      Wanfang Hospital was established in 1997, the fall problems associated with inpatient fallers&#xD;
      is one of most emphasizing issue in our medical cares. Since 1998, we began to implement&#xD;
      policies in screening the risk factors associated with falls and to involve in the&#xD;
      precautionary measures for the fallers. But the results come out not effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this research proposal are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Among inpatients, we will investigate the causes/reasons and risk factors associated&#xD;
           with fallers and the incidence rates of falls. The consequences related to falls will&#xD;
           also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will evaluate our strategies on the efficacy of the precautionary measures for&#xD;
           inpatients fallers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: The &quot;Observational cohort experimental design&quot; will be applied in this&#xD;
      research proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data are collected mainly from wards of medicine and surgery. The project period is from&#xD;
           1/1/2009 to 12/31/2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The inpatients history, diagnosis, prescribed drugs, hemoglobin value, and blood sugar&#xD;
           value of inpatients fallers will be collected and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Associations between variables and falls among each individual faller will be assessed&#xD;
           and evaluated thoroughly. If fall incident actually occurred, data on patient falls will&#xD;
           be gathered within 48 hr and compared with each own relevant individual case by full&#xD;
           evaluators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The Student-t test, Chi-square test, and one-way ANOVA will be preformed&#xD;
      for the whole experimental data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals and future prospects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To finish the survey of the high risk factor ratios and high incidence rates associated&#xD;
           with falls among inpatient fallers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the risk factors associated with falls and the consequential analysis&#xD;
           related to falls among inpatient fallers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A good precautionary measure of falls will reduce damages and injuries for the fallers,&#xD;
           especially inpatients welfare. Our accomplishments of this research proposal will&#xD;
           provide sufficient information and reference for the precautionary strategies associated&#xD;
           with fall incidents. More importantly, the experiences and results will be further&#xD;
           explored and shared among all other hospitals.&#xD;
