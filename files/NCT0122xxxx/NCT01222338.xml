  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is 100 times more expensive than treatment of&#xD;
      drug-susceptible TB, requiring intensive clinical management for prolonged time (18-24&#xD;
      months) and more toxic treatment course. In prior open label study the investigators have&#xD;
      shown that adding V-5 Immunitor (V5), can reduce treatment duration to one month and enhance&#xD;
      by 4-5 fold the efficacy of TB drugs. Furthermore, V5 has been shown to reverse or reduce&#xD;
      liver damage caused by chemotherapy. The cost of V5 will be very modest. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to conduct placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with treatment refractory TB&#xD;
      so that the clinical benefit of V5 is confirmed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first-diagnosed Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (TB) is curable with the first line&#xD;
      of anti-tuberculosis drugs (ATT) in over 90% of cases within 6 months. The treatment of TB,&#xD;
      refractory to conventional ATT, requires the deployment of second line TB drugs. This&#xD;
      represents a significant challenge, particularly in resource-poor countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of TB in Ukraine prior to 1992 was about 40 cases per 100,000 people. Ten years&#xD;
      later, TB cases increased to over 80/100,000, with mortality doubled from 10.2/100,000 to&#xD;
      21.6/100,000. Drug-resistant TB is now common in Ukraine. Isoniazid and rifampicin&#xD;
      resistance, which defines the MDR-TB, has been found in 44% and 32.9% of TB isolates. The&#xD;
      first Ukrainian case of HIV was reported in 1987. Today, Ukraine has the highest HIV rate in&#xD;
      the Eastern Europe, with increasing proportion of dual infection. For example, in 2002 the&#xD;
      prevalence of TB and HIV co-infection was 6.3%, but in 2006 at least 15.5 % of TB patients&#xD;
      had HIV co-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clear that alternative and improved treatment options are needed. If such an&#xD;
      intervention is found, the impact on the healthcare and clinical management of&#xD;
      treatment-refractory TB and TB-HIV patients will be tremendous. The significant efforts are&#xD;
      directed at finding new drugs and vaccines against TB. Immune-based interventions are&#xD;
      actively sought as an adjunct therapy to conventional ATT. In earlier study the investigators&#xD;
      have accidentally observed that when patients with chronic hepatitis C and HIV-TB were given&#xD;
      V5 together with TB drugs it resulted in negative sputum conversion in 95% of patients within&#xD;
      one month. This startling finding had prompted this study. The aim of the present study is to&#xD;
      compare the clinical benefit of TB therapy in combination with V5 versus combination of&#xD;
      placebo with ATT in a representative population of patients who are poorly manageable due to&#xD;
      relapsing TB, MDR-TB, or TB-HIV co-infection.&#xD;
