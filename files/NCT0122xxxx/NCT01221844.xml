    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bovine lactoferrin is effective in&#xD;
      preventing and curing iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in Hereditary Thrombophilia&#xD;
      affected women during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed clinical trial is considered as PHASE IV because in Italy bLf is commercialized&#xD;
      by Grunenthal, as Lattoglobina® (capsules with 100 mg of bLf), to prevent and cure iron&#xD;
      deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In industrialized and developing countries, iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
      (IDA) are highly prevalent in pregnant women. ID and IDA, in pregnant women as a consequence&#xD;
      of an increased iron requirement, due to enhanced blood volume and development of&#xD;
      fetal-placenta unit, represent a high risk for maternal and infant health: preterm delivery,&#xD;
      fetal growth retardation, low birth weight, and inferior neonatal health. However, the degree&#xD;
      of fetal ID is not always as severe as that in mother, being iron transfer from the mother to&#xD;
      the fetus regulated by the placenta. In particular, the placental syncytiotrophoblast&#xD;
      acquires ferric iron bound to maternal transferrin at the apical membrane through transferrin&#xD;
      receptors (TfR-1), which noticeably increase in pregnant women suffering of ID and IDA.&#xD;
      Recently, it has been suggested that most iron transfer to the fetus, occurring after the&#xD;
      30th week of gestation, also involves placental expression of hepcidin and ferroportin, two&#xD;
      proteins known to modulate systemic iron homeostasis in adults. As matter of fact, iron&#xD;
      homeostasis is tightly regulated through iron absorption, storage and transport. The&#xD;
      absorption of nearly all dietary iron (1-2 mg daily), ensuring iron supplies in the bone&#xD;
      marrow, at second and third trimester of pregnancy increases until to about 4 and 8 mg/day,&#xD;
      respectively. The iron absorption takes place in the proximal duodenum and includes the&#xD;
      following steps: (i) reduction of iron from the ferric state (III) to the ferrous state (II)&#xD;
      by a ferrireductase (duodenal cytochrome B; (ii) apical uptake by enterocytes followed by&#xD;
      trans-cellular trafficking via divalent metal transporter 1; (iii) storage into ferritin; and&#xD;
      (iv) basolateral efflux by the iron transporter ferroportin. Ferroportin, the only known&#xD;
      cellular iron exporter from tissues into blood, has been found in all cell types involved in&#xD;
      iron export, including the enterocytes, hepatocytes, placental cells and macrophages which&#xD;
      require ferroportin to daily recycle 20 mg of iron from lysed erythrocytes for&#xD;
      erythropoiesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another pivotal component of systemic iron homeostasis is hepcidin, a circulating peptide&#xD;
      hormone synthesized by hepatocytes in iron loading conditions and secreted in plasma and&#xD;
      urine. Hepcidin regulates the entry of iron into plasma through ferroportin. Hepcidin, by&#xD;
      binding to ferroportin, causes ferroportin phosphorylation, internalization and degradation&#xD;
      in lysosomes, thus hindering iron export and enhancing cytosolic iron storage in ferritin.&#xD;
      Iron homeostasis disorders appear to arise from hepcidin and/or ferroportin dysregulation.&#xD;
      Similarly to the regulation of maternal systemic iron homeostasis, fetal hepcidin controls&#xD;
      the transfer of maternal iron across the placenta to the fetus and the enhanced&#xD;
      placental-fetal iron transport is related to an increased expression of ferroportin on&#xD;
      placental basal fetal-facing membrane, consistent with unidirectional mother-fetus iron&#xD;
      transport. Even if the interaction of hepcidin with ferroportin can explain the regulation of&#xD;
      iron homeostasis at systemic level, the influence of iron metabolism on critical stage of&#xD;
      fetal development, is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulation of hepcidin expression seems to occur at transcriptional level and its production&#xD;
      is increased by iron loading and inflammation and decreased by anemia and hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if the molecular mechanisms of hepcidin regulation by iron, oxygen and anemia are still&#xD;
      unclear, it is known that Interleukin 6 (IL-6) induces transcription of the hepcidin gene in&#xD;
      hepatocytes. In inflammatory and infection disorders, cytokine induced hepcidin excess,&#xD;
      through ferroportin binding, contributes to development of anemia of inflammation,&#xD;
      characterized by ID and IDA despite adequate iron stores. When iron export is hindered, iron&#xD;
      is stored in host cells. However, inflammation may contribute to ID and IDA by&#xD;
      hepcidin-independent mechanism(s) as the down-regulation of ferroportin. Independently on&#xD;
      hepcidin synthesis, high levels of serum IL-6 seem to down-regulate ferroportin mRNA&#xD;
      expression, thus sequestering iron inside cells and blocking iron flow into plasma. The&#xD;
      inability to export iron leads to hypoferremia, decreased pool of serum transferrin-Fe(III)&#xD;
      and iron-limited erythropoiesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent discovery of hepcidin-ferroportin complex has greatly contributed to clarify the&#xD;
      enigmatic mechanism of systemic iron homeostasis. Notwithstanding, iron homeostasis&#xD;
      disorders, as ID and IDA, are still treated with oral administration of large quantity of&#xD;
      iron as fer¬rous sulfate due to its poor bio-availability. Ferrous sulfate oral&#xD;
      administration often fails to exert significant effects on ID and IDA, and frequently causes&#xD;
      many adverse effects, including gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a significant decrease of total serum iron and serum ferritin concentrations&#xD;
      related with an increase of serum IL-6 concentration has been observed in pregnant women and&#xD;
      in hemodialysis patients, orally treated with ferrous sulfate. Therefore, it can be&#xD;
      hypothesized that supplemented iron was not exported from cells to circulation, but it was&#xD;
      accumulated inside the cells, thereby increasing inflammatory status, similarly to that&#xD;
      reported in animals treated with ferrous sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weight of evidences, which let to doubt on the efficacy and safety of ferrous sulfate&#xD;
      oral administration, has stimulated the research of more effective approaches to prevent ID&#xD;
      and toxicity associated with iron overload. The treatment of ID and IDA during pregnancy&#xD;
      should be entirely reconsidered taking into account not only the enhanced blood volume and&#xD;
      development of fetal-placenta unit, but also other factors, as IL-6, which, inducing hepcidin&#xD;
      up-regulation and ferroportin down-regulation, can play a pivotal role in iron homeostasis&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, lactoferrin (Lf), a cationic iron-binding glycoprotein, able to chelate at&#xD;
      high affinity (KD w10/20 M) two ferric ions per molecule (30), is emerging as an important&#xD;
      regulator of systemic iron homeostasis, able to cure ID and IDA. Lf is synthesized by&#xD;
      exocrine glands and neutrophils in infection and inflammation sites. In humans, free iron&#xD;
      does not exceed 10-18 M to avoid precipitation, microbial growth and formation of reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species. Lf in tissues and secretions and transferrin in blood assure that iron was&#xD;
      bound and scarcely available as free-ion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if several functions, dependent and independent on its iron binding ability, have been&#xD;
      attributed to Lf, our recent clinical trials have demonstrated that this natural compound may&#xD;
      represent an interesting approach in the therapy for ID and IDA in pregnant women. As matter&#xD;
      of fact, a milk derivative bovine lactoferrin (bLf) restores the physiological transport of&#xD;
      iron from tissues to circulation, thus curing ID and IDA. Moreover, differently from ferrous&#xD;
      sulfate, bLf oral administration exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by decreasing serum IL-6&#xD;
      concentration in uncomplicated pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypercoagulable state represents one of the physiological changes occurring during&#xD;
      pregnancy. The hereditary thrombophilia (HT), a genetic predisposition to inappropriately&#xD;
      form clots, significantly increases adverse outcomes including recurrent miscarriages,&#xD;
      intrauterine fetal death and growth retardation, preeclampsia and placental abruption. It is&#xD;
      well known that inflammation promotes coagulation and IL-6 high levels in plasma of HT&#xD;
      affecting pregnant women with severe preeclampsia have been found. Moreover, elevated&#xD;
      intra-amniotic IL-6 and IL-8 levels have been correlated to preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, iron supplementation via oral administration of ferrous sulfate increasing serum&#xD;
      IL-6 levels in uncomplicated pregnancies, could be deleterious in HT affecting pregnant women&#xD;
      and could contribute to enhance iron overload in tissues, inflammation and cell damages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bLf capability to prevent and cure ID and IDA together with its ability of decreasing&#xD;
      serum IL-6 concentration could be effective even in the treatment of ID and IDA in pregnant&#xD;
      women affected by HT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial, pregnant women affected by hereditary thrombophilia (HT), suffering&#xD;
      of ID and IDA, receive an oral administration of bovine Lf (bLf) 100 mg/twice a day or&#xD;
      ferrous sulfate 520 mg/day. The number of red blood cells, the values of hemoglobin, total&#xD;
      serum iron, serum ferritin, haematocrit, serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and prohepcidin are&#xD;
      assayed before therapy, every 30 days until delivery.&#xD;
