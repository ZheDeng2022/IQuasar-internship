    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study which will analyze any food-drug effects as well as QTc effects of&#xD;
      perifosine. Safety and efficacy will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who complete the first 24 days on single agent perifosine may have the opportunity&#xD;
      to 1) continue on single agent perifosine; 2) switch to the combination of capecitabine +&#xD;
      perifosine; or 3) switch to the combination of sorafenib + perifosine.&#xD;

      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with prior exposure to perifosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients receiving any other chemotherapy, targeted agents, investigational agents or&#xD;
           devices within four weeks (28 days) or 5 half-lives of the agent(s), whichever is&#xD;
           longer, prior to Day1 of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients must have finished radiotherapy 28 days prior to start of treatment.&#xD;
           Radiotherapy is not permitted in the Treatment Phase. Palliative radiotherapy to single&#xD;
           sites for symptom control is allowed only during the Continuation Phase. The clinical&#xD;
           coordinator should be contacted prior to initiating radiotherapy in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients who have had a major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic&#xD;
           injury â‰¤4 weeks prior to Day 1 of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with a serious non-healing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients with known central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with CNS&#xD;
           metastases that have been treated and are stable and who do not require corticosteroid&#xD;
           treatment for the metastases (off steroids &gt; 4 weeks) will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Serious active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics or antifungal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
           composition to perifosine (miltefosine or edelfosine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patients with known dipyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency or prior severe reaction&#xD;
           to 5-FU (for patients electing to receive capecitabine therapy in the Continuation&#xD;
           Phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Patients with known HIV or acute or chronic active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
           infection and psychiatric illness/social situations that would Limit compliance with&#xD;
           study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Patients with a history of unstable or newly diagnosed angina pectoris, recent&#xD;
           myocardial infarction (within 6 months of enrollment), or New York Heart Association&#xD;
           class II-IV congestive heart failure (Appendix B).&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating. All females of childbearing potential&#xD;
           must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours of treatment. Women of&#xD;
           childbearing potential and men with partners of child-bearing potential, must agree to&#xD;
           employ adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy while on therapy and for 4 weeks&#xD;
           after the completion of treatment (see Appendix C).&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (e.g. familial long QT&#xD;
           syndrome, hypokalemia, heart failure (Appendix B), left ventricular hypertrophy, slow&#xD;
           heart rate (&lt;45 bpm)).&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Required use of concomitant medications known to prolong the QT/QTc interval&#xD;
