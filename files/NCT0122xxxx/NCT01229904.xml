    <textblock>
      Post traumatic Stress disorder (PTSD) is a common condition for persons who have served in&#xD;
      the Armed services during combat or deployment. Treatments include medications, cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy, and other social support mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim in this project is to critically evaluate the effects of a novel music therapy&#xD;
      intervention on the symptoms of PTSD. Estimates developed by the Global Burden of Disease&#xD;
      Study reveal that mental illness accounts for over 15% of the burden of disease on health and&#xD;
      productivity in established market economies--more than the disease burden caused by all&#xD;
      cancers combined.[1] Perhaps no industry has had the burden of mental disorders affect its&#xD;
      labor force as severely and pervasively as the Armed Forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common sequelae of severe emotional trauma that is&#xD;
      often associated with combat exposure. The condition has been well documented in returning&#xD;
      soldiers and is characterized by recurrent and distressing thoughts and feelings related to&#xD;
      the trauma, persistent avoidance of reminders of the trauma, and increased arousal that&#xD;
      disturbs sleep, concentration, and the ability to modulate anger. Persons suffering from PTSD&#xD;
      often have difficulty relating to others, leading to loneliness and isolation, which further&#xD;
      intensifies their psychiatric symptoms. Current treatment options for PTSD include&#xD;
      psychotherapy, medication management, or a combination of those. Although these treatments&#xD;
      have been shown to be effective, returning soldiers are often hesitant to seek and adhere to&#xD;
      mental health therapies. PTSD-related avoidance, including difficulty trusting, may serve as&#xD;
      a barrier to seeking or completing treatments. Furthermore, some PTSD medications have&#xD;
      unacceptable side-effects in some individuals. The need is great, therefore, to identify and&#xD;
      promote safe, effective strategies for self-management of PTSD among Veterans.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post traumatic Stress disorder (PTSD) is a common condition for persons who have served in&#xD;

      behavioral therapy, and other social support mechanisms.&#xD;

      labor force as severely and pervasively as the Armed Forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common sequelae of severe emotional trauma that is&#xD;
      often associated with combat exposure. The condition has been well documented in returning&#xD;
      soldiers and is characterized by recurrent and distressing thoughts and feelings related to&#xD;

&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective was to assess the effectiveness of a novel music therapy on ammelorating the&#xD;
      effects of PTSD. Specifically a 6 week guitar training program under the direction of&#xD;
      seasoned instructors through a partnership with Guitars for Vets was assessed before and&#xD;
      after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial we recruited veterans in the Milwaukee region and the Zablocki VA Medical&#xD;
      Center with significant PTSD symptoms. Forty subjects were recruited and randomized to either&#xD;
      an immediate entry or a 6 week delayed entry group. Both groups received the intervention,&#xD;
      but the delayed group received it after a 6 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject received a guitar that they keep after the study, music, supplies and&#xD;
      instructions. They each had an hour of individual training each week and a weekly group&#xD;
      instruction session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection and analyses are complete, we are writing the final manuscript. In&#xD;
      addition, we submitted a grant for a multicenter MERIT funded project this past June.&#xD;
      Unfortunately it will not be funded. We plan to resubmit at the next cycle.&#xD;
