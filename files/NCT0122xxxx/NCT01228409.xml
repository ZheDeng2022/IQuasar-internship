  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1-3% worldwide. At&#xD;
      present, there is no curative therapy available and the clinical course is unpredictable, but&#xD;
      in the majority of cases psoriasis is a chronically remitting and relapsing disease. Several&#xD;
      clinical subtypes of psoriasis exist with differences in manifestations and skin areas&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic stable plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Vulgaris) is the commonest form of the disease,&#xD;
      accounting for 85-90% of cases. The circumscribed infiltrated skin lesions are scaly and&#xD;
      erythematous and often symmetrically distributed over the body. Several types of palliative&#xD;
      therapies exist. The therapies are either topical or systemic. The severity of chronic plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis is often determined by the percentage of body surface area (BSA) involved. For&#xD;
      mild, moderate and severe chronic plaque psoriasis with BSA involvement of up to 20%, initial&#xD;
      therapy is topical. Phototherapy and numerous systemic therapies are usually indicated when&#xD;
      more than 20% of skin is affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe plaque-type psoriasis requires systemic and long-term therapy in order to induce and&#xD;
      maintain remission. Acitretin 25mg/day combined with a phototherapy regimen is a standard&#xD;
      treatment that provides clinically significant efficacy, however many patients experience&#xD;
      tolerability issues due to retinoid-related adverse events. Retinoid-related adverse events&#xD;
      include but are not limited to: alopecia, dry mucus membranes, pruritus, photosensitivity,&#xD;
      elevation of liver enzymes, elevation of serum triglycerides, cholesterol and decrease of&#xD;
      HDL, arthralgias, myalgias, eye irritation, blepharitis, photophobia, conjunctivitis,&#xD;
      headaches, nausea, anemia and leukemia. Reducing the acitretin dose from 25mg/day to&#xD;
      17.5mg/day may provide improved tolerability without compromising efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to ascertain if reducing the acitretin dose from 25mg/day to&#xD;
      17.5mg/day will provide improved tolerability without compromising efficacy.&#xD;
