    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of&#xD;
      Risperidone formulations after administration of single doses to normal, healthy subjects&#xD;
      under fasted conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A single dose two way crossover bioequivalence study in 44 normal healthy males and females&#xD;
      was utilized to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of Risperidone ODT (orally&#xD;
      dissolving tablet) formulations. The test product was a 1 mg ODT tablet formulation of&#xD;
      Risperidone manufactured by Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. The reference product was commercially&#xD;
      available Risperidone 1 mg ODT tablets (Risperdal®), Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, LP. Each&#xD;
      single oral dose (1 mg) will be administered orally as a 1 mg tablet. Blood samples were&#xD;
      collected at intervals over a 72-hour period after medication administration. There was a&#xD;
      washout period of 14 days between the two periods of the study.&#xD;
