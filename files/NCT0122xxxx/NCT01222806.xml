      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cocaine addiction is often difficult to treat, particularly because exposure to others&#xD;
      using cocaine or to pictures of cocaine may evoke cocaine craving and lead a person to resume&#xD;
      cocaine use after having quit. Breaking this link with cocaine craving might improve&#xD;
      treatment for cocaine addiction. Research suggests that repetitive pulses of transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the skull can change nerve cell firing in the brain.&#xD;
      rTMS was recently approved as a treatment for depression, and is being studied as a way to&#xD;
      reduce drug craving. However, because only a few small studies have looked at the effects of&#xD;
      rTMS on cocaine craving, more research is needed on whether it is effective in reducing&#xD;
      cocaine craving and use in individuals who currently use cocaine on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation can lower craving for cocaine when&#xD;
      given in connection with cocaine-related images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have used cocaine for at least 2 years and&#xD;
      currently using at least 3 times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves an initial screening visit, two brain imaging sessions, five rTMS&#xD;
           sessions, and two follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, urine&#xD;
           samples, questions about drug use history and previous efforts to quit, and tests for&#xD;
           breath alcohol and nicotine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan sessions: one baseline&#xD;
           scanning session before starting their rTMS sessions and a second scanning session after&#xD;
           their last rTMS session . Part of each scanning session involves functional MRI (fMRI)&#xD;
           scans. During the fMRI scans, participants will look at pictures related to cocaine use&#xD;
           and pictures that are not related to cocaine use. Participants will also perform a&#xD;
           simple decision task during the scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have five rTMS sessions, one per day for 5 days in a row. Each session&#xD;
           will last 1 to 2 hours. Participants will have either real or sham (simulated) rTMS&#xD;
           while looking at pictures that may or may not be related to cocaine use, and will also&#xD;
           perform a simple decision task that is the same as the one given during the MRI scans.&#xD;
           The decision as to whether participants get real or sham rTMS will be made by chance.&#xD;
           Neither the participants nor the investigators will know which type the participants are&#xD;
           getting. - Participants will have two follow-up visits one and two weeks after their&#xD;
           last rTMS session. At each visit they will be checked for cocaine and other substance&#xD;
           use and for possible side-effects from rTMS.&#xD;

      Primary objective: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) provides a&#xD;
      non-invasive means of altering brain neural activity. This pilot study will test whether 5&#xD;
      days of rTMS reduces cue-induced cocaine craving and cocaine use in cocaine users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We predict that active rTMS will significantly lower craving for cocaine compared&#xD;
      with sham rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Thirty healthy adult cocaine users (for at least 2 years, currently&#xD;
      averaging at least 3 times weekly) with no other major psychiatric disorders except nicotine&#xD;
      dependence (DSM IV criteria) will be recruited from the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Following a baseline phase to evaluate subject characteristics, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive 5 days of active or sham rTMS treatment. rTMS at 1 Hz and&#xD;
      strength 120% of the motor threshold will be applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC) using an H-coil (HADD version) contained in a helmet, beginning 1 second before&#xD;
      presentation of a cocaine-associated visual cue and lasting for 30 seconds. Brain site&#xD;
      localization will use a computerized navigation system based on structural MRI scans obtained&#xD;
      before the first session. Each treatment session (lasting around 31 minutes) will consist of&#xD;
      54 trials (cue presentations): 36 with cocaine-associated cues and 9 each with&#xD;
      non-drug-associated positive or neutral cues. No rTMS will be administered with the&#xD;
      non-cocaine-associated cues. Subjects return for follow-up assessments one and two weeks&#xD;
      after the final rTMS session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure will be cocaine craving assessed by 100-mm&#xD;
      visual analog scales before and after every TMS treatment and at one- and two week follow-up.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be the 14-item Cocaine Craving Questionnaire, self-reported&#xD;
      cocaine use, and urine drug testing at each rTMS session and follow-up visit, and changes in&#xD;
      regional brain responses to cocaine-associated visual cues assessed by fMRI done before and&#xD;
      after the 5 rTMS sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits: There is no direct benefit to individual subjects. The future benefit to society&#xD;
      may be development of better methods for treatment of cocaine addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: The primary risks from rTMS are transient headache, scalp discomfort, decreased&#xD;
      spatial recognition memory, and hearing loss (minimized by wearing ear plugs). Seizures are&#xD;
      very rare when rTMS is administered within accepted safety guidelines and individuals at&#xD;
      increased risk of seizures are excluded. The risk of inducing a manic episode is minimized by&#xD;
      excluding individuals with a history of non-drug-induced mania/hypomania.&#xD;
