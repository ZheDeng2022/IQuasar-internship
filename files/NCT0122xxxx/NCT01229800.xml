  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : In several studies comparing of sodium phosphate solutions versus PEG, both regimen had&#xD;
      similar efficacy of bowel cleansing and sodium phosphate solutions are more acceptable to&#xD;
      patients because patient are required to consume smaller volume. But sodium phosphate&#xD;
      solutions are associated with fluid and electrolyte disturbances, so use of sodium phosphate&#xD;
      solution in routine medical check-up of outpatients is problematic. PEG can provide a rapid&#xD;
      peroral approach to colon lavage without causing fluid and electrolyte disturbance. However,&#xD;
      the need to ingest a large volume of fluid reduces patient compliance, and results in&#xD;
      suboptimal bowel preparation. In order to overcome this disadvantage, several studies proved&#xD;
      that split dose of PEG regimens were better quality preparation and more acceptable than&#xD;
      single dose regimens. In Korea, need for outpatient or screening colonoscopy without&#xD;
      laboratory test is increasing and split dose of PEG is used more frequently than other&#xD;
      country in bowel preparation because of safety. But, superiority of split dose of PEG to&#xD;
      sodium phosphate solution has not been demonstrated. The study was not yet existed about&#xD;
      comparison of split dose PEG solution with sodium phosphate solution for bowel cleansing and&#xD;
      tolerability in colonoscopy preparation. To use split dose of PEG in bowel preparation with&#xD;
      medical evidence, we want to demonstrate split dose bowel preparation with PEG compared to&#xD;
      sodium phosphate solutions provide a better colon cleansing efficacy and similar&#xD;
      tolerability.&#xD;

      Study design: Investigator-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Entry criteria: Adult outpatients(at least 18 years of age, under 65 years) who undergo&#xD;
           scheduled colonoscopy for screening, cancer surveillance or want procedure with/without&#xD;
           non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      age under 18 years, elderly patients(&gt;65 yrs), pregnancy, breast feeding, patient with bowel&#xD;
      obstruction, and other structural intestinal disorders, gut hypomotility(chronic&#xD;
      constipation(&lt; 2 bowel movement/week for 1yr), hypomotility syndrome, megacolon, idiopathic&#xD;
      pseudoobstruction), renal failure, congestive heart failure, liver failure, pre-existing&#xD;
      electrolyte disturbance(hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia); refusal of consent to participate&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling design: Consecutive recruitment of consenting patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables Predictor: split dose of PEG and sodium phosphate Primary Outcome: Quality of bowel&#xD;
      preparation (Ottawa scale) Secondary Outcome: Tolerability (preparation completion, side&#xD;
      effect) Confounding variables: age, gender, BMI, experience of colonoscopy, surgical history,&#xD;
      bowel movement, comorbidity, indication, presence of GI symptoms, medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Split dose bowel preparation with PEG will provide a better quality preparation&#xD;
      and similar tolerability than that with sodium phosphate for morning colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size.: Improving rate 20% in bowel cleansing efficacy(Ottawa scale), study power 80%,&#xD;
      alpha-error(level of significance, P-value) 5%, mean value scale=5, effect size 1, SD=2.5-&gt;&#xD;
      sample size= 100/100&#xD;
