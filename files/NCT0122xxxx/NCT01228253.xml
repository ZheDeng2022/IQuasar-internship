      This preliminary study will examine the differential effects of rTMS on the recall of&#xD;
      extinction of conditioned fear in patients suffering from PTSD (post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder ) compared with subjects without PTSD but with high risk of relapse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that nearly 70% of individuals will experiment at least once in their life a&#xD;
      traumatic event (eg war, natural disaster, accident or assault). The psychotrauma, whose&#xD;
      symptoms (including revivalism, hypersensitivity to the environment, anxiety, avoidance&#xD;
      behavior), may be sustainable and thus constitute a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One&#xD;
      characteristic of PTSD can be studied in the laboratory is the lack of recall of extinction&#xD;
      of conditioned fear, caused largely by a lack of induction of hyperactivation in the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex. Knowing that this hyperactivation may occur in some cases of remission of&#xD;
      symptoms of PTSD, it is possible that the deficit in recall of extinction is lifted in such&#xD;
      cases. This idea is also supported by animal models showing that the induction of natural or&#xD;
      artificial prefrontal hyperactivation facilitates the recall of extinction. However, no study&#xD;
      has yet addressed so far the effects of different treatments (conventional: pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      and psychotherapy, or rTMS: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) for PTSD, supposed&#xD;
      to induce prefrontal hyperactivation and avoid the recall deficit of extinction of&#xD;
      conditioned fear. The persistence of this deficit beyond the remission of PTSD symptoms could&#xD;
      represent a situation with a high risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. Our main objective is to examine performance in recall of extinction of&#xD;
      conditioned fear on the one hand, in patients in remission of PTSD after conventional&#xD;
      treatment and, secondly, in patients who received rTMS at 10 Hz&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY will include 9 patients with PTSD, 3 individuals in&#xD;
      remission from PTSD, 3 psychotraumatized subjects without secondary PTSD and 3 individuals&#xD;
      without a history of psychotrauma. These groups will be matched for age, sex and&#xD;
      sociocultural level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: All studies will be conducted at the Nice University Hospital. The pre-inclusion&#xD;
      visit (D-7), including different clinical evaluations (MINI-DSM-IV, CAPS, PDI, Hamilton&#xD;
      Depression Scale and Covi Anxiety), will be held at the Emergency Psychiatric Unit (Hospital&#xD;
      Saint-Roch). The study will take place at the Psychiatry University Department and at the&#xD;
      Neurology Exploration Department (Hospital Pasteur), where the subjects will have other&#xD;
      clinical assessments (at D0, D17-D19, D21), the conditioning test and extinction (day 0) and&#xD;
      recall test of extinction (at D21). The fear conditioning (measured by increases in heart&#xD;
      rate and skin conductance) corresponds to presentations coupled with an image and tactile&#xD;
      stimulation (the intensity of which will be chosen by the subject), while sessions of&#xD;
      extinction and extinction recall that correspond to presentations of the image alone (without&#xD;
      tactile stimulation). In addition to these sessions, one third of PTSD patients will be&#xD;
      treated with rTMS at 10 Hz (D3 to D7 and D10-D14, 1 session / day), another third with&#xD;
      placebo treatment and one third without treatment. Eventually (D21), two other tests will&#xD;
      indirectly assess prefrontal hyperactivation (emotional Stroop and attentional bias) and&#xD;
      self-questionnaires will be performed in all subjects immediately after the recall of&#xD;
      extinction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The persistent failure to recall extinction in some individuals in remission from PTSD would&#xD;
      sign the maintenance of prefrontal dysfunction, and therefore a high risk of relapse. The&#xD;
      induction of hyperactivation using prefrontal rTMS at 10 Hz would not only reduce symptoms of&#xD;
      PTSD, but also reduce the risk of recurrence of these symptoms.&#xD;
