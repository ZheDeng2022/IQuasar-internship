&#xD;
        6. Record the following labs if obtained in the 72 hours following the 1st dose of study&#xD;
           drug. Use the laboratory values closest to the end of this 72 hours period if there have&#xD;
           been multiple tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Hematology: hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood cell count with differential, platelet&#xD;
      count b. Serum chemistry: glucose, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, aspartate transaminases&#xD;
      (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, sodium,&#xD;
      potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin. (* A serum creatinine must&#xD;
      be recorded within (before or after) 72 hours of the 1st dose of study drug) g. Record the&#xD;
      results of cultures from sterile body fluids (blood, urine, CSF, peritoneal fluid, or any&#xD;
      other sterile body fluid) as obtained per standard of care. Record urine cultures only if&#xD;
      obtained by sterile catheterization or suprapubic aspiration&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.3 Procedures following Study Drug Administration (Day 3/4 to Day 9/10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Record AEs (definitely and probably related to study drug) for 72 hours following the&#xD;
           last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Record SAEs for 7 days following the last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Protocol Deviations When a deviation from the protocol is deemed necessary for an&#xD;
      individual infant, the investigator or other responsible physician must contact study PI&#xD;
      immediately, unless a delay would endanger the subject, so that a timely decision can be made&#xD;
      as to whether or not the infant should be enrolled or continue in the study. The deviation&#xD;
      from the protocol will be authorized only for that particular infant. A description of the&#xD;
      departure from the protocol and the reason(s) for it must be recorded on the appropriate CRF.&#xD;
      Additionally, sites will adhere to local IRB reporting rules for protocol deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence such as&#xD;
      a sign(s), symptom (s), and/or laboratory finding(s) concurrent with the use of a drug in&#xD;
      humans. AEs include worsening of any baseline symptoms. The event may/may not necessarily&#xD;
      have a causal relationship with the administration of the drug. AEs may be reported by the&#xD;
      subject, or detected by the investigator, or other competent observer. The investigator will&#xD;
      also evaluate any change in laboratory values. If the investigator determines a laboratory&#xD;
      abnormality to be clinically significant, it is considered a laboratory AE; however, if the&#xD;
      laboratory value abnormality is consistent with a current diagnosis, it may be documented&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2 Reporting period AEs (definitely or probably related to study drug) will be recorded&#xD;
      from the time of first dose of study drug until 72 hours following the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug. All SAEs will be recorded form the time of the first dose of study drug 7 days after&#xD;
      the last dose of study drug. The AE reporting period will not be extended if subjects&#xD;
      continue on ticarcillin-clavulanate following the 6 doses of study drug. AEs not or possibly&#xD;
      related to study drug will NOT be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.3 Procedures for assessing, recording and reporting AEs Throughout the duration of the&#xD;
      study, the investigator will closely monitor each subject for clinical evidence of drug&#xD;
      intolerance and monitor all clinically obtained laboratory values for laboratory evidence of&#xD;
      AEs. All SAEs will be reported to study's medical monitor within 24 hours. The description of&#xD;
      the AE will include description of event, start date, stop date, intensity, if it was&#xD;
      serious, and relationship to the study drug. The investigator must verify this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity or severity of AEs will be graded as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild - awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. Not expected to have a&#xD;
           clinically significant effect on the subject's overall health and well-being. Not likely&#xD;
           to require medical attention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate - discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity or affects&#xD;
           clinical status. May require medical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe - incapacitating or significantly affecting clinical status. Likely requires&#xD;
           medical intervention and/or close follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs that increase in intensity will be recorded with a stop date on the AE CRF of the milder&#xD;
      AE equal to the date that the condition worsened. A new AE with a start date equal to the&#xD;
      date of worsening will then be reported. AEs that decrease in severity need not be reported&#xD;
      in this way. The start date will be the date entered above and the date of resolution should&#xD;
      be reported as the stop date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship to study medication using the&#xD;
      following definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not related: An AE that is due to a pre-existing illness or use of another drug, and is&#xD;
           not related to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possibly related: An AE that has little or no relationship to the study drug and there&#xD;
           exists a more likely alternative cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probably related: An AE that is likely to be related to the administration of the study&#xD;
           drug and an alternative cause less likely when compared to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definitely Related: An AE that has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug. AE&#xD;
           will recur with continued or repeated use of the study drug, and another cause is&#xD;
           unlikely or less likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.4 Follow-up of AEs AEs will be followed until resolution or until stability is reached&#xD;
      using good clinical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Serious Adverse Event&#xD;
&#xD;
      A SAE is defined (21 Code of Federal Regulations part 312.32) as those AEs, which meet any of&#xD;
      the following serious outcome criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is fatal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is life-threatening, meaning, the subject was, in the view of the investigator, at&#xD;
           immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a&#xD;
           reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, i.e., the event causes a&#xD;
           substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is an important medical event, based on appropriate medical judgment, that may&#xD;
           jeopardize the subject or subject may require medical or surgical intervention to&#xD;
           prevent one of the other outcomes above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.1 Procedures for assessing, recording and reporting SAEs All SAEs must be reported by&#xD;
      facsimile or electronic transmission to the study's medical monitor within 24 hours after the&#xD;
      onset of the SAE (or the awareness of the investigator of the event). The study's medical&#xD;
      monitor then notifies the study PI of the SAE within one working day after receiving the&#xD;
      report from a clinical site. In addition, a clinical site must report a death or&#xD;
      life-threatening event by telephone as soon as possible and within 24 hours to the study's&#xD;
      medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An SAE CRF must be completed and signed by the site investigator. All SAEs must also be&#xD;
      entered into the AE CRF (select &quot;serious&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA requires that all SAEs that are unexpected and potentially related to the study&#xD;
      medication must be reported to the FDA in writing within 15 calendar days. SAEs that are&#xD;
      unexpected and related to study drug that meet the criteria for death or immediately&#xD;
      life-threatening also require the study's medical monitor to notify the FDA by telephone,&#xD;
      facsimile transmission or in writing as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days,&#xD;
      with a follow-up written report within 15 calendar days. The study's medical monitor will&#xD;
      prepare an expedited report for the FDA and copies will be distributed to all site&#xD;
      investigators. Expedited reports will be placed in the Study Binder by the investigator upon&#xD;
      receipt. The investigators will also forward a copy of all expedited reports to their local&#xD;
      Investigational Review Boards in accordance with local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.2 Follow-up of SAEs All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization or 7 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of study drug, whichever occurs, first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Blood Volume for PK and Safety Laboratory Tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample volume will be minimized by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Most of the hematology and chemistry laboratory measures will be recorded from&#xD;
           laboratories drawn as standard of care. Any labs needed for the protocol will count&#xD;
           against the total blood volume for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A limited PK sampling scheme will be employed such that no more than 1.4 mL of blood (7&#xD;
           samples) is obtained from each subject for PK analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Trial Termination A data safety group with members that have expertise in biostatistics,&#xD;
      neonatology, clinical pharmacology, and pediatric infectious disease will monitor the data&#xD;
      during the study for AEs, patient safety, and potential toxicity. If two subjects develop an&#xD;
      unexpected SAE related to study drug, we will stop enrollment to evaluate the data and safety&#xD;
      of the product in this population. Dr. Brian Smith (neonatologist) will receive SAEs and call&#xD;
      ad hoc meetings of the safety group as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Investigational Product&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.1 Description of Investigational Product Ticarcillin-clavulanate is a sterile injectable&#xD;
      antibacterial combination consisting of the semisynthetic antibiotic ticarcillin disodium,&#xD;
      and the β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanate potassium (the potassium salt of clavulanic acid)&#xD;
      for intravenous administration. Ticarcillin is derived from the basic penicillin nucleus,&#xD;
      6-amino-penicillanic acid. Clavulanic acid is produced by the fermentation of Streptomyces&#xD;
      clavuligerus. It is a β-lactam structurally related to the penicillins and possesses the&#xD;
      ability to inactivate a wide variety of β-lactamases by blocking the active sites of these&#xD;
      enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Drug Accountability Study drug will be provided by the local site pharmacy.&#xD;
