    <measure>Blinded Evaluations of First Impression</measure>
    <time_frame>After the 1-month post optimal correction visit for 20 subjects (averaged)</time_frame>
    <description>Upon completion of the study, 300 blinded evaluators will evaluate one of three binders comprised of a random visit photographs from baseline, optimal cosmetic result, and 1 month post optimal cosmetic result of 20 subjects. The 10-point (1=Not at all to 10=Extremely well) First Impression Scales consisting of 8 criteria. A score of 10 means favorable results and a score of 1 means unfavorable results.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-esteem</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Self-esteem change will be determined by patient self-evaluation using the Heatherton &amp; Polivy State Self-Esteem (HPSS). The primary variable will be measured as improvement in self-esteem from baseline self-evaluations.&#xD;
A 20-item scale that measures a participant's self-esteem at a given point in time. The 20 items are subdivided into 3 components of self-esteem: (1) performance self-esteem, social self-esteem, and appearance self-esteem. All items are answered using a 5-point scale (1= not at all, 2= a little bit, 3= somewhat, 4= very much, 5= extremely).&#xD;
Scores range from 20-100.&#xD;
Scores closer to 100 indicate a more favorable outcome.</description>

    <description>Each subject will complete a 10-point (1-Not at all to 10-Very Much) scale evaluating their own first impression at Baseline and 1-month post-OCR.&#xD;
First impression scores were recorded at baseline and 1-month post-OCR, and an average of the two scores were reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Malar Deficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Live subject malar deficiency severity will be rated by PI at Visits 1-4 according to the SOBER scale (Weeks 1-4 correspond to Visits 1-4).&#xD;
SOBER Scale (Solish Beer Remington Scale): is used to grade facial rhytids in the malar region.&#xD;
Grade 1: Mild Grade 2: Moderate Grade 3: Severe Grade 4: Extreme Grade 5: Extreme&#xD;
Scores closer to 1 is a more favorable outcome, while scores closer to 5 is a less favorable outcome</description>

        <description>Self-esteem change will be determined by patient self-evaluation using the Heatherton &amp; Polivy State Self-Esteem (HPSS). The primary variable will be measured as improvement in self-esteem from baseline self-evaluations.&#xD;
A 20-item scale that measures a participant's self-esteem at a given point in time. The 20 items are subdivided into 3 components of self-esteem: (1) performance self-esteem, social self-esteem, and appearance self-esteem. All items are answered using a 5-point scale (1= not at all, 2= a little bit, 3= somewhat, 4= very much, 5= extremely).&#xD;
Scores range from 20-100.&#xD;
Scores closer to 100 indicate a more favorable outcome.</description>
