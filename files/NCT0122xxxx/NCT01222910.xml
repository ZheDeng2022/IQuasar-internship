      The study was conducted as an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioequivalence study comparing valacyclovir&#xD;
      hydrochloride tablets 1 gram manufactured by OHM Laboratories Inc. NJ 08901 with VALTREX®&#xD;
      caplets 1 gram manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 in healthy,&#xD;
      adult, male, human subjects under fasting condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a single oral dose of valacyclovir&#xD;
      hydrochloride 1 gram of either test or reference investigational product was administered&#xD;
      during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature&#xD;
      under low light condition and under supervision of trained study personnel. Both test and&#xD;
      reference products were administered to all the study subjects, one in each period (except&#xD;
      subject numbers 04, 21 and 27 who dropped out from the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical&#xD;
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical&#xD;
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done&#xD;
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood&#xD;
      glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study.&#xD;
