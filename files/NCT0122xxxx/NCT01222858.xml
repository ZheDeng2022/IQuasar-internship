  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight/obesity is a major health problem that affects over two-thirds of Americans,&#xD;
      increases morbidity and mortality and has annual medical costs exceeding $75 billion.&#xD;
      Although many Americans indicate that they are trying to lose weight, adherence to weight&#xD;
      loss regimens is often poor. Programs are needed that can improve adherence and weight loss&#xD;
      for overweight/obese individuals. Physicians play an important role in motivating patients to&#xD;
      improve health behaviors and recent reviews suggest that having physicians advise patients to&#xD;
      lose weight and then referring patients to an effective program produces the best behavior&#xD;
      change and maintenance. The problem, however, is that physicians currently have limited&#xD;
      options for such referrals. The challenge for the field is to develop a program to which&#xD;
      physicians can refer their overweight/obese patients. The program must be low cost, easily&#xD;
      accessible, and must promote adherence to the weight loss regimen and consequently improve&#xD;
      weight loss outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this Challenge Grant application is to develop and test an innovative web-based&#xD;
      program that would provide an accessible and effective approach to enhancing adherence to&#xD;
      clinical recommendations for weight loss. If effective, the program would provide an&#xD;
      outstanding resource for physicians and their patients and could consequently have important&#xD;
      clinical and public health impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to develop a program based on our prior research that uses innovative Internet&#xD;
      technology to provide a low cost, easily disseminated program that captures two critical&#xD;
      elements of effective behavioral weight loss programs-namely, training in key behavioral&#xD;
      weight control strategies and increased participant accountability. Patients, referred by&#xD;
      their physician for weight loss, will be offered a 12 week program that they can view at&#xD;
      their convenience on their computer. The program will use Web-based interactive multi-media&#xD;
      approaches for presentation of the behavioral skills and provide a Web-based form for&#xD;
      submission of self-monitoring and weight data; to maximize patient accountability, the&#xD;
      program will include a system of automated feedback for participants, which comments on their&#xD;
      weight loss to date and their performance within several behavioral weight-loss domains, with&#xD;
      suggestions tailored to the characteristics and performance of the individual. Periodic&#xD;
      reports on the patients' progress will also be sent to the referring physician. We will test&#xD;
      this program in a randomized trial with 250 patients referred by their physicians who will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either Internet Education (Control) (N=125) or to the Innovative&#xD;
      Technology program (N=125). Participants in both groups will receive a 12 week Internet&#xD;
      program of either basic weight loss education or the Innovative Technology program and will&#xD;
      be weighed at the start and end of the 3 month program and at 3 month follow-up. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that patients who are assigned to the Innovative Technology program will&#xD;
      achieve larger average weight losses than those in the control group over the 12-week&#xD;
      program. Secondary hypotheses are that the Innovative technology group will adhere better&#xD;
      over the 12-weeks (assessed by log-ins to the web site and self-reported changes in diet and&#xD;
      activity) and achieve better weight losses at 6 months than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project addresses the significant problem of obesity and uses innovative&#xD;
      technology to improve adherence to a behavioral weight loss strategies. If the program is&#xD;
      effective, it would provide an outstanding resource for physicians to use with their patients&#xD;
      and thus would have tremendous clinical impact.&#xD;
