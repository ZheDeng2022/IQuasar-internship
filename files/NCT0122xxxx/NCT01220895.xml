      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential clinical benefit of pre-emptive&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific adoptive cellular therapy following T cell depleted allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for reducing recurrent CMV reactivation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As with other herpes viruses, infection with CMV is thought to result primarily from&#xD;
      reactivation of latent virus. Transmission of the virus can also occur from donor marrow&#xD;
      infusion or from allogeneic red cell, leukocyte or platelet transfusions. However, in&#xD;
      immunocompromised bone marrow transplant recipients, CMV is frequently reactivated and&#xD;
      disease resulting from the progression of CMV infection is a major cause of infectious&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. CMV infection is a consequence both of the immunosuppression these&#xD;
      patients receive and also may reflect delayed immune reconstitution in these patients&#xD;
      following transplant. It is of particular concern to recipients of VUD (HLA-Volunteer&#xD;
      Unrelated Donor) transplants who often receive lower doses of donor T cells in the transplant&#xD;
      and who also require greater post-transplant immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis. CMV&#xD;
      reactivation is most frequent in this group of transplant recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach to improve reconstitution of immunity against viruses following allogeneic HSCT&#xD;
      is to adoptively transfer donor-derived virus-specific T lymphocytes, which has been well&#xD;
      documented with proven success. Existing evidence suggests that adoptive cellular therapy&#xD;
      (ACT) can be an effective approach for treating viral reactivation following allo HSCT, with&#xD;
      a minimal risk of inducing GVHD. The major advantage to the patient is likely to be avoidance&#xD;
      of extended periods of therapy with antiviral medications that have significant associated&#xD;
      morbidities, and sometimes require inpatient care. From a pharmacoeconomic viewpoint this&#xD;
      would translate into a reduction of costs associated with standard antiviral therapies&#xD;
      compared to the cost of adoptive cellular therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the use of very small numbers of highly specific T-cells will allow&#xD;
      enough CMV-specific T-cells to be obtained in vitro from normal healthy CMV-seropositive&#xD;
      donors from the peripheral blood transplant product after a single leucapheresis procedure&#xD;
      and that the absence of concurrent lympholytic immunosuppression combined with a profoundly&#xD;
      lymphopenic environment should allow for expansion and maintenance of the anti-CMV response&#xD;
      in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study is a randomised prospective phase II study of pre-emptive adoptive&#xD;
      cellular therapy for CMV following T cell depleted allogeneic HSCT from an unrelated donor.&#xD;
      The study is based on earlier phase I-II studies of CMV-specific cellular therapy and our&#xD;
      ongoing phase III study of CMV-specific adoptive cellular immunotherapy in immunocompromised&#xD;
      recipients of allogeneic sibling donor HSCT based on selection of CMV-specific T cells by two&#xD;
      different methodologies (CMV-IMPACT). The proof of safety in the sibling donor setting now&#xD;
      strengthens the case for extending the therapy to the unrelated donor setting, where both&#xD;
      potential risks and benefits are greater. The current study will investigate the use of&#xD;
      CMV-specific T cells selected from mobilised blood collected at the time of stem cell&#xD;
      apheresis by the multimer technology in the unrelated donor setting. The selection of&#xD;
      CMV-specific T cells selected from a mobilised blood at the time of stem cell apheresis is in&#xD;
      contrast to the methodology used in the CMV-IMPACT study where selection is performed on a&#xD;
      non-mobilised blood product produced from a second study-dedicated apheresis. Two significant&#xD;
      issues remain unresolved for the CMV-ACE/ASPECT study; are these infusions safe in the&#xD;
      HLA-matched un-related donor setting and do CMV-reactive T cells derived from the transplant&#xD;
      product have equivalent activity in vivo to cells derived from a second apheresis as used in&#xD;
      the sibling donor study (CMV-IMPACT study). The study will test the hypothesis that ACT can&#xD;
      augment the impaired CMV immune function post-transplant and reduce the requirement for CMV&#xD;
      antiviral drug therapy without causing an increase in GVHD; and to determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      pre-emptive CMV-specific adoptive cellular therapy following T cell depleted allogeneic HSCT&#xD;
      with respect to reconstitution of CMV-reactive T cells. There are multiple methods for T cell&#xD;
      depletion available, and differences between them will likely have an effect on immune&#xD;
      reconstitution. The study will be restricted to patients receiving alemtuzumab-containing&#xD;
      conditioning protocols, where the risk of CMV infection is greatest. ACT will be administered&#xD;
      from day 21 post transplant for those receiving ex-vivo T-cell depleted grafts and day 28 for&#xD;
      those receiving in vivo T cell depletion, as a single dose immediately upon a single CMV-DNA&#xD;
      PCR+ result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary the study is a multicentre, prospective, controlled, open label, randomised (2:1)&#xD;
      study of pre-emptive infusion with CMV-specific T cells selected by the multimer selection&#xD;
      technique plus standard CMV antiviral therapy versus standard CMV antiviral therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be determine the efficacy of pre-emptive CMV-specific ACT&#xD;
      following T cell depleted allogeneic HSCT with respect to reconstitution of CMV-reactive T&#xD;
      cells and subsequent in vivo expansion of CMV-reactive T cells post infusion of ACT. In&#xD;
      addition individual groups will be compared for duration of antiviral therapy and number of&#xD;
      reactivation episodes, plus GVHD incidence.&#xD;
