      The aim of the study is to assess the value of whole body diffusion weighted MR imaging&#xD;
      (WB-DWI) as a non-invasive method. On one hand for pretreatment lesion detection and&#xD;
      post-therapeutic tumor recurrence but also for early therapy monitoring with the intention to&#xD;
      early identify patients with a poor tumor response. Our research group demonstrated that this&#xD;
      technique is accurate in patients with head and neck cancer it could differentiate between&#xD;
      viable tumor tissue and inflammatory or necrotic tissue at variable time points after&#xD;
      completion of radiotherapy. In the literature it is stated that DWI can also predict the&#xD;
      response to chemotherapeutic therapy. This is only true for focal MRI images (eg only in&#xD;
      liver). This study aims to determine whether the whole body technique can efficiently be used&#xD;
      because the distribution of metastases is systemic. The study includes two phases: In a first&#xD;
      phase, a baseline study will be conducted; all possible injury types will be gathered to&#xD;
      determine the variability in signal characteristics to finally determine appropriate&#xD;
      thresholds to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. This should allow us later&#xD;
      on to perform prospective studies. In a second phase, different applications such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pretherapeutic staging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection of post-therapy recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early evaluation of systemic cytotoxic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the DW-MRI will be compared with those of PET, CT and conventional MRI which&#xD;
      are now routinely performed for the diagnosis of colorectal tumors. The scans will be&#xD;
      performed in a group of patients on a 3 Tesla MR system. This system is fully approved by the&#xD;
      European and American standards and the patients will not be exposed to radiation or contrast&#xD;
      agents. In principle, all patients treated for gastrointestinal cancer were included after&#xD;
      informed consent from the patient. This study is important to investigate whether DWI is&#xD;
      accurate in the pre-therapeutic injury detection and staging of gastrointestinal tumors&#xD;
      compared with PET / CT and DWI. In addition it is important to predict the outcome after&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

    <description>These studies will be performed on a 3Tesla (T) MR system (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems). A major advantage of 3T compared to 1.5 T is the improved signal to noise ratio that allows whole-body studies to be faster and without application of external antennas, which greatly improves patient comfort.</description>
