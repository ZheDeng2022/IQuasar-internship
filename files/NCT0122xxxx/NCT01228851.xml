      The purpose of this study is to assess the facilitation of balance in Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD) patients using the Nintendo Wii fit, with the ultimate goal of developing a program for&#xD;
      function and fitness in this patient population. In this study, PD patients will participate&#xD;
      in group exercise classes using the Wii Fit and the effects on balance, postural sway, and&#xD;
      quality of life assessed.&#xD;

      The study is a cohort study using outpatients with Parkinson's Disease in Hoen and Yahr Stage&#xD;
      2.5 - 3. Participants will have pre- and post-exercise testing, as well as participate in an&#xD;
      8-week balance-training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Subjects will be recruited from the outpatient clinics (physician, therapy) at the&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC) as well as the Northwestern Movement Disorders&#xD;
      Clinic, through the Department of Neurology. Approximately 20 subjects will be screened for&#xD;
      inclusion from these institutions and 12 subjects will be enrolled in the study. (see Power&#xD;
      analysis below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be approached by their treating outpatient physician (Physiatrist or&#xD;
      Neurologist) or Physical or Occupational Therapist to see if they would be interested in&#xD;
      participating in the study. The principal investigator will also send introductory letters to&#xD;
      his outpatients at RIC informing them of the study. Letters will only be sent to the PI's&#xD;
      patients (Dr. Marciniak, Dr. Toledo). Potential subjects will be educated regarding study&#xD;
      procedures, risks and benefits, and privacy risks. Informed consent will be obtained only&#xD;
      during initial screening and signed if the patient is interested in proceeding. Eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be screened for (See below). Subjects who lack decisional capacity will not&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures This study will involve an initial visit (Visit 1) for screening and&#xD;
      baseline data collection. The therapy/intervention sessions will be held 3 times per week for&#xD;
      8 weeks, (Visits 2 - 25), and there will be 1 post-intervention visit for data collection&#xD;
      (Visit 26). Subjects will be reimbursed 11 dollars for parking expenses that will be mailed&#xD;
      to them weekly in the form of a check. All visits will take place at Abbott Hall, 3rd floor&#xD;
      exercise room and all visits will take approximately 1 Â½ hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent, the following baseline measures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physician screening with a medical history (including falls in the month prior to the&#xD;
           visit) and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hoehn and Yahr Staging&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Activities-Specific Balance Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life measure (PDQ-8 c. Geriatric Depression Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Berg Balance Scale, performed by a trained physical therapist&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Dynamic Gait Index, performed by the physical therapist&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Gait and mobility subscales of the UPDRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Sharpened Romberg with eyes open and closed&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Balance will also be measured using the Wii balance board. Subjects will stand on the&#xD;
           board and a gait belt will be placed around their waist. Subjects will have an&#xD;
           accelerometer (done via smart phone) clipped to their waist to measure sway, they will&#xD;
           stand on the Wii board, and the subject's ability to performing a reaching task will be&#xD;
           assessed, as measured by postural sway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will remain immediately next to the subject during the testing procedures&#xD;
      for safety purposes with the gait belt in place, and a balance bar will also be next to the&#xD;
      patient during the testing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2- 25 (3x/ week for 8 weeks) (Within 2 weeks of initial testing) The subjects will be&#xD;
      seen at the Wirtz Sports Center exercise room. They will participate in 3 Wii balance board&#xD;
      games: a marble game, a skiing game, and a bubble game. Each subject will stand on a balance&#xD;
      board and participate in each of the 3 games for 10 minutes per game with 10 minutes rest in&#xD;
      between each of the games, a total of 30 minutes of balance training time per session.&#xD;
      Subjects will have a gait belt in place during the exercises, and will be supervised by a&#xD;
      physical therapist or research assistant. Either the Physical therapist or Research Assistant&#xD;
      will always be immediately next to the subjects during the training program. A balance bar&#xD;
      will also be next to the subject if needed for balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly, subjects will be asked about any changes in medications or falls that they may have&#xD;
      experienced at home or in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 26&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will seen for follow up assessments within 2 weeks of the final training session and&#xD;
      the following tests repeated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interval history (including falls), exam, Hoehn and Yahr Staging&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Activities-Specific Balance Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. PDQ-8&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Geriatric Depression Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Berg Balance Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dynamic Gait Index&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, subscales&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sharpened Romberg&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Wii Balance Board Testing&#xD;
