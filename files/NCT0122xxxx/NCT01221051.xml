      The purpose with this study was to compare blood loss and women's experience of afterpains&#xD;
      during the third stage when handled with active or expectant management of the third stage of&#xD;
      labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1. To detect a 5% difference (15% vs 10%) in blood loss &gt;1000 mL between the two&#xD;
      groups with 80% power (α=0.05), at least 726 subjects were required in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2. Afterpains are more pronounced in active compared to expectant management&#xD;
      during the third stage of labour&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Management of the third stage of labour has been focus for investigation during decades and&#xD;
      active management of the third stage of labour (AMTSL)has been recommended in all women&#xD;
      giving birth vaginally at hospitals. In Sweden the recommendation has been to give an&#xD;
      injection of oxytocin immediately after birth of the neonate but not the entire AMTSL&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in labour were asked to participate voluntarily when entering the hospital and after&#xD;
      acceptance they were randomised to either active or expectant management of the third stage&#xD;
      of labour(EMTSL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMTSL included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early cord clamping&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 UI oxytocin i.v&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  controlled cord traction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  uterine massage after placenta expulsion&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMTSL included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  early cord clamping&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 mL saline solution i.v&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  wait for signs of placenta detachment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  encourage the women to push out placenta by her own effort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  uterine massage after placenta expulsion&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood was measured by weighing bed pads and sanitary towels up to two hours postpartum&#xD;
      Assessment of afterpains was performed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Pain-o-meter&#xD;
      (POM-WDS) two hours after the delivery of placenta, and the day after childbirth.&#xD;
