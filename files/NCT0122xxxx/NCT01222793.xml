      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Although second-generation antipsychotic medications have fewer serious side effects and&#xD;
      complications than first-generation ones, they are strongly associated with weight gain for&#xD;
      reasons that are as yet unknown. Comparing the effects of second-generation antipsychotics&#xD;
      with a high weight-gain liability (HWGL) low weight-gain liability (LWGL) antipsychotics may&#xD;
      provide more information on which medications are best suited for different individuals.&#xD;
      Researchers are interested in studying how people taking various antipsychotics compare with&#xD;
      controls in regard to food craving and eating behavior. This knowledge should help to guide&#xD;
      practitioners when advising patients about the weight-gain effects of these medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To examine eating behavior and food craving in patients with schizophrenia who are taking&#xD;
      HWGL antipsychotics compared with those taking LWGL antipsychotics and with healthy controls&#xD;
      taking no antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 45 years of age who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia or&#xD;
           a related disorder, have a body mass index between 25 and 29.9, and have never had an&#xD;
           eating disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy individuals between 18 and 45 years of age who have a body mass index between 25&#xD;
           and 29.9 and have never had an eating disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves an initial screening visit and four study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, as well&#xD;
           as questionnaires about stress levels, food cravings, smoking, exercise, and eating&#xD;
           habits; a taste test; and saliva collection (to measure stress hormones).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Participants will have an optional overnight stay, and will provide blood&#xD;
           samples before having a breakfast beverage and answering questions about tiredness,&#xD;
           anxiety, hunger, and alertness during a 1.5 hour session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Participants will have an optional overnight stay and a light breakfast, followed by&#xD;
      blood draws and questions about hunger and food cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Participants will have an optional overnight stay, followed by questions about food&#xD;
      preference. Participants will not be allowed to eat until mid-morning of the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: Participants will eat normally before arriving at the research site, and will have&#xD;
      tests to measure food craving and questionnaires about mood and feelings.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some second-generation antipsychotics, such as olanzapine and clozapine, seem especially&#xD;
      prone to induce metabolic complications and substantial increases in weight. The mechanisms&#xD;
      of these side effects are unknown, but may include antagonism at histamine H1 receptors. We&#xD;
      will refer to olanzapine and clozapine as antipsychotics with a high weight-gain liability&#xD;
      (HWGL). The primary aim of this project is to examine eating and food craving in patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia who are taking HWGL antipsychotics compared with those taking LWGL&#xD;
      antipsychotics (mid- to high-potency first-generation antipsychotics, aripiprazole, or&#xD;
      ziparasidone) and compared with healthy controls taking no antipsychotics. The antipsychotics&#xD;
      we are classifying as LWGL group do not have appreciable H1 receptor antagonism. We will&#xD;
      exclude participants taking antipsychotics that have middling degrees of H1 receptor&#xD;
      antagonism (e.g. quetiapine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help us understand how people with schizophrenia differ from controls on&#xD;
      eating and food craving, as well as the effects of different classes of antipsychotics. This&#xD;
      knowledge should help to guide practitioners when advising patients about the weight-gain&#xD;
      effects of these medications. For example, if we find that participants on HWGL&#xD;
      antipsychotics tend to crave high-fat foods, practitioners can work with patients to&#xD;
      anticipate and mitigate this side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. The study population will be in- or outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of&#xD;
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder stabilized on either olanzapine or clozapine (HWGL&#xD;
      antipsychotics) (N=20), aripiprazole, ziprasidone, or a first-generation antipsychotic (LWGL&#xD;
      antipsychotics) (n=20), and normal controls (people with no Axis I psychiatric disorder&#xD;
      taking no antipsychotic medication) (n=20), for a total of 60 participants. All participants&#xD;
      will be between the ages of 18 to 45 years and considered overweight (BMI greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 25 and less than or equal to 29.9 kg/m(SqrRoot)). The pediatric population has been&#xD;
      excluded to rule out certain hormonal effects (e.g. puberty) on eating behavior. A BMI range&#xD;
      encompassing participants that are overweight was selected to maximize recruitment and to&#xD;
      minimize confounding effects of BMI on eating behavior. Exclusion criteria will include&#xD;
      weight-related conditions and current dietary restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods. In a between-subjects design, the three study groups will be&#xD;
      compared in terms of four domains of eating behavior: (1) food craving, (2) satiety&#xD;
      signaling, (3) meal size (satiation), and (4) food preferences. Assessments will occur during&#xD;
      five study visits (including an initial visit for consenting and screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Primary outcome measures will include a preload-test meal paradigm&#xD;
      (satiety), meal size perception and satiation, food preference, food craving, and gustatory&#xD;
      functioning. Secondary measures will include: Weight and Eating Assessment questionnaire,&#xD;
      Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire (RPAQ), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Exercise&#xD;
      Motivations Inventory (EMI), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Tobacco Craving&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Short Form (TCQ-SF), Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), BMI,&#xD;
      hip/waist measurements, and fasting blood work: CBC, CMP14, lipid panel, leptin, ghrelin,&#xD;
      adiponectin, and thyroid panel.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  be between age 18 and 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a BMI between 25 or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants in the antipsychotic-medication groups must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. meet DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and have been&#xD;
        stabilized on an antipsychotic medication for the past 3 months. Antipsychotics include&#xD;
        olanzapine, clozapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, and first-generation antipsychotics (mid&#xD;
        to high potency). Polypharmacy is allowed as long as both medications fit into the same&#xD;
        grouping (HWGL or LWGL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy controls must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. have no DSM IV Axis I disorder (Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, Depression,&#xD;
        Bipolar Disorder) based on a SCID interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be excluded if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        meet DSM-IV criteria for a past and/or current eating disorder via the SCID, or if they&#xD;
        have a past medical history of an eating disorder, received treatment/counseling for an&#xD;
        eating disorder and/or required hospitalization for an eating disorder. (If an otherwise&#xD;
        undiagnosed eating disorder is detected during screening, referral to treatment will be&#xD;
        provided.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        are taking risperidone, quetiapine, paliperidone, iloperidone, or low-potency&#xD;
        first-generation antipsychotics (see Appendix A for complete list of excluded medications).&#xD;
&#xD;
        are taking weight-loss medications, whether over-the-counter (i.e. Hydroxycut, Stacker&#xD;
        products, Metabo-Plus, CortiSlim), or prescribed, including appetite suppressants (Didrex,&#xD;
        Tenuate, Sanorex, Mazanor, Adipex-P, Meridia, and Phentermine) and fat-absorption&#xD;
        inhibitors (Xenical).&#xD;
&#xD;
        are currently enrolled in a nutrition-based weight-loss program (i.e. Weight Watchers,&#xD;
        Jenny Craig, Nutri-System).&#xD;
&#xD;
        have undergone weight-loss surgery (i.e. banding, gastric bypass surgery, sleeve&#xD;
        gastrectomy, liposuction).&#xD;
&#xD;
        have Cushing's syndrome, polycystic-ovary syndrome, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or a&#xD;
        DSM-IV diagnosis of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        have Type I or Type II diabetes, defined as a fasting blood glucose level of greater than&#xD;
        or equal to 99.&#xD;
&#xD;
        have cognitive impairment severe enough to preclude informed consent or valid responses on&#xD;
        questionnaires. This is defined an as a score of less than 10 on the Evaluation to Sign&#xD;
        Consent (ESC) and judged by the treating clinician. Participants obtaining a 10 on the ESC&#xD;
        are re-briefed on the item that they missed, and are asked the question again until they&#xD;
        get it correct to ensure their understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        have a medical illness that, in the view of the investigators, would compromise&#xD;
        participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        have dietary restrictions or food allergies that, in the view of the investigators, would&#xD;
        compromise participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        are pregnant (as this might alter appetite or cravings).&#xD;
&#xD;
        have begun or stopped smoking in the previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Also, participants will be excluded from the control group if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        are taking antipsychotics, antidepressants or mood stabilizers.&#xD;
