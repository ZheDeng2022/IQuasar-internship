      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that causes respiratory tract&#xD;
           infections, and is frequently responsible for hospital visits in infants and children.&#xD;
           It can also trigger severe breathing problems for individuals who have asthma, but these&#xD;
           infections are generally better tolerated in non-asthmatics. Some research suggests that&#xD;
           lack of an efficient immune system response in people with asthma may make it difficult&#xD;
           for the body to fight the effects of RSV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-[beta]) is a chemical in the body that is more&#xD;
           prevalent in the lungs of people with asthma and related respiratory disorders. More&#xD;
           information is needed about the effects of TGF-[beta] and whether it makes individuals&#xD;
           with asthma more prone to developing RSV. Researchers hope to use this information to&#xD;
           determine possible treatments and therapies for individuals with asthma who contract&#xD;
           RSV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the possible role of TGF-[beta] in increased asthmatic susceptibility to RSV&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 60 years of age who are either healthy nonsmokers or mild&#xD;
      asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves a screening visit and a study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, as well&#xD;
           as blood samples and a pulmonary function test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the study visit, participants will receive mild anesthetic and have a bronchoscopy,&#xD;
           in which researchers insert a bronchoscope through the participant s nose or mouth and&#xD;
           into the lungs to examine the lungs and collect lung cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be contacted by a research team member 24 36 hours after the&#xD;
           bronchoscopy to ask about any side effects from the procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional, controlled study designed to investigate whether Transforming&#xD;
      Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) mediates increased asthmatic epithelial susceptibility to&#xD;
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection by examining responses to RSV infection in&#xD;
      epithelial cells cultured from asthmatic and non-asthmatic participants. Non-smoking healthy&#xD;
      adults and mild asthmatics, aged 18-60 years old, will be recruited to participate. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be prescreened and scheduled for a final eligibility visit that will&#xD;
      include medical history review, vital signs, physical examination, blood draw, and pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests (PFTs). After eligibility is confirmed, the participant will be scheduled for&#xD;
      bronchoscopy. During the bronchoscopy, bronchial epithelia and alveolar macrophages will be&#xD;
      obtained from the participant for analysis. Alveolar macrophages will be evaluated ex-vivo&#xD;
      for inflammatory activity at baseline and after stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the laboratory analysis is to determine if TGF-beta mediates&#xD;
      increased asthmatic epithelial susceptibility to RSV infection. The study has three aims&#xD;
      which are interrelated: 1) To determine if asthmatic bronchial epithelia express more&#xD;
      TGF-beta than normal epithelia; 2) to determine if RSV replication is greater in asthmatic&#xD;
      epithelia than normal epithelia; and 3) to determine if TGF-beta mediates asthmatic bronchial&#xD;
      epithelial susceptibility to RSV infections.&#xD;
