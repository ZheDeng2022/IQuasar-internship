      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients starting peritoneal dialysis with a glucose-based regimen have high sympathetic&#xD;
      activity in response to an increase in leptin and insulin. Converting patients from a regimen&#xD;
      of only glucose containing dialysate to a regimen with non-glucose-based solution,&#xD;
      icodextrin, will reduce the insulin and leptin levels and will reverse dialysis-induced&#xD;
      increases in sympathetic activity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular mortality remains higher among patients treated with peritoneal dialysis as&#xD;
      compared to patients treated with hemodialysis. Sympathetic hyperactivity is considered a&#xD;
      significant emerging risk factor for cardiovascular mortality among patients with ESRD&#xD;
      (End-Stage Renal Disease). Sympathetic activity, via its hemodynamic effects and trophic&#xD;
      effects, and in interaction with RAAS (Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System), does play a&#xD;
      major role in cardiac and vascular remodelling, development of LVH and vascular hypertrophy,&#xD;
      as well as progression to CHF. Glucose-based dialysate induces hyperinsulinemia and&#xD;
      hyperleptinemia. We propose that hyperleptinemia induced by glucose-based peritoneal solution&#xD;
      is a significant contributing factor to sympathetic hyperactivity in ESRD patients treated&#xD;
      with PD, and could be prevented by non-glucose-based PD solution such as icodextrin-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with ESRD starting PD as their first renal replacement therapy modality will&#xD;
      be studied. Patients will be recruited 1-3 weeks prior to starting PD treatment. At baseline,&#xD;
      specific studies for microneurography (MSNA), fasting plasma insulin, leptin, catecholamines&#xD;
      and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) will be performed. EKG will be recorded and digitized for&#xD;
      further assessment of heart rate variability using power spectral analysis. Extracellular&#xD;
      fluid volume status will be assessed by bioelectrical impedance. Central vascular volume will&#xD;
      be assessed from inferior vena cava (IVC) by heart ultrasound. Consequently 24-h ambulatory&#xD;
      blood pressure monitoring(ABPM)and a 24-h urine collection for urea clearance and creatinine&#xD;
      clearance will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants into the study will receive a PD treatment for 6 weeks with standard&#xD;
      glucose-based PD solution Dianeal. The specific studies are repeated at 6 weeks.Then,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to one of the two groups (arms). One group will continue with&#xD;
      Dianeal PD solution for another 12 weeks. The other group will receive Dianeal during the day&#xD;
      and Extraneal, icodextrin or non-glucose based solution, during the night only, for the next&#xD;
      12 weeks. The specific studies are repeated at 12 weeks after randomization (18 weeks of PD&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
