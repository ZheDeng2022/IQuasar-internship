      The present study is designed to examine the expression of VDR, CaSR, PTH, Cyclin D1, Ki67&#xD;
      and PCNA and to find out its relationship with clinical parameters in parathyroid adenomas.&#xD;
      Examination of the contribution of genes expression can elucidate the critical link between&#xD;
      proliferation and functional abnormalities in parathyroid adenomas. Alternative to DNA and&#xD;
      RNA, protein expression can provide a better understanding of this disease.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the third most frequent endocrine disorder, after&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders, that predominantly affects postmenopausal women,&#xD;
      with an incidence of 1 -5 in 1000 people. It can occur at any age though young people are&#xD;
      rarely affected. PHPT is characterized by hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and&#xD;
      resultant hypercalcemia. Most cases of PHPT (&gt;85%) result from a solitary adenoma in one of&#xD;
      the parathyroid glands. Multi-gland hyperplasia is found in about 10-15% of the patients&#xD;
      while carcinoma occurs rarely (1-2%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parathyroid glands regulate calcium homeostasis. The major target organs for parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone (PTH) are bone and the kidneys. PTH increases bone resorption to mobilize calcium&#xD;
      into the circulation. In the kidney, PTH enhances calcium reabsorption and increases&#xD;
      phosphate excretion. PTH also stimulates renal production of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D&#xD;
      [1,25(OH)2D], which in turn enhances intestinal absorption of calcium. Thus, the&#xD;
      physiological effects of PTH are to increase the concentration of calcium in the circulation.&#xD;
      Negative feedback from calcium and 1,25(OH)2D modulate parathyroid function. These effects&#xD;
      are mediated via the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) expressed on the parathyroid cell&#xD;
      surface. Similarly, 1,25(OH)2D, acts through vitamin D receptor (VDR) and suppresses PTH&#xD;
      synthesis and secretion . Thus, PTH secretion is tightly coupled to the parathyroid cell's&#xD;
      ambient calcium level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased parathyroid cell proliferation and decreased calcium-mediated control of the PTH&#xD;
      secretion are characteristic findings in all types of hyperparathyroidism (1-4). Calcium via&#xD;
      its receptor, the CaSR and the 1,25(OH)2D-VDR complex are the most important regulators, in&#xD;
      this respect. Decreased actions of these regulators would stimulate the parathyroid cells to&#xD;
      proliferate. Molecular analyses have revealed the presence of tumor-specific DNA&#xD;
      rearrangements in a subset of adenomas. In such rearrangements, the 5' PTH gene regulatory&#xD;
      region combines upstream of the Cyclin D1 gene, which results in over expression of cyclins&#xD;
      that could induce proliferation by increasing mitotic rate. In fact Cyclin D1 over expression&#xD;
      was first demonstrated in a patient with parathyroid adenoma (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired CaSR gene expression is found in parathyroid lesions of both primary and secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism (6-11). No mutations could be found in CaSR gene in parathyroid&#xD;
      neoplasias (11,12). Similar present findings shows reduced VDR gene expression (8,13-15) and&#xD;
      concur with studies on the apparent lack of VDR gene mutations in hyperparathyroidism&#xD;
      (16-18). Differential expression of VDR and CaSR gene has been reported in a few parathyroid&#xD;
      adenomas, but exact mechanism is not known. These observations raise the possibility that&#xD;
      altered expression of these genes could be related to the pathogenesis of parathyroid&#xD;
      adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: To achieve the above aim, the following objectives would be under taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of expression of VDR and CaSR genes in parathyroid adenomas with normal&#xD;
           parathyroid tissue obtained during surgery from non-hyperparathyroid patients by Real&#xD;
           Time-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To confirm expression of VDR, CaSR,PTH cyclin D1, Ki67 and PCNA in parathyroid cells by&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of protein expression profile of parathyroid adenomas with normal parathyroid&#xD;
           tissue by proteomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the PHPT patients attending outdoor patient clinic of Endocrinology and General Surgery&#xD;
      department of Nehru Hospital, PGIMER, Chandigarh will be included for this study with&#xD;
      following inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Patients with surgically verified sporadic PHPT and controls will be&#xD;
      included as follows; Group A: ~ 20 sporadic PHPT patients Group B: ~10 normocalcemic&#xD;
      euthyroid patients operated for thyroid disorders will provide normal parathyroid tissue to&#xD;
      serve as control tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Patients with hyperplasia, renal failure and multiple endocrine neoplasia&#xD;
      will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection: Parathyroid tissue samples will be collected immediately after surgery,&#xD;
      snap frozen and stored at -80oC until use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assay Methods: Preoperative levels of total serum calcium (reference range, 8.6-10.2 mg/dL)&#xD;
      will be determined by auto-analyzer (Modular P: Roche Diagnostics, Germany). The serum&#xD;
      Calcium level will be corrected with the serum albumin level. The serum intact PTH (reference&#xD;
      range, 12-55 ng/L)and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (11.1-42.9 ng/ml) will be measured using&#xD;
      immunochemiluminiscence (ELECSYS-2010: Roche Diagnostics, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gene expression study for VDR and CaSR-&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. RNA extraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Total RNA will be extracted from the cryopreserved normal and adenomatous&#xD;
                parathyroid tissue samples by using the TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.),&#xD;
                according to the vendor's instructions. The samples will be pretreated with DNase&#xD;
                and stored at -80oC until use. The cDNA will be generated from the 3-4 mg of RNA by&#xD;
                reverse transcriptase with random hexamers as primers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The mRNA levels of VDR and CaSR will be estimated by Real-PCR (Stratagene Robocycler&#xD;
           Gradient 40 system) using specific primer sequences and PCR conditions. The PCR products&#xD;
           will be separated by electrophoresis on 6% agarose gel; the products will be then&#xD;
           stained with ethidium bromide and located by fluorescence using UV light. Bio Max 1D TM&#xD;
           1.5.1 (Kodak, Rochester, NY) would be used to evaluate the band intensities of the PCR&#xD;
           bands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Expression study of VDR, CaSR,PTH, Cyclin D1, Ki67 and PCNA protein-&#xD;
&#xD;
           Immunohistochemistry: Monoclonal antibodies will be used for immunostaining of VDR,&#xD;
           CaSR, PTH, Cyclin D1, Ki67 and PCNA proteins on paraffin sections (Source- Pharmingen,&#xD;
           USA). Secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse horse radish peroxidase conjugated (BD&#xD;
           Biosciences, Pharmingen, USA), specific for primary antibodies will be used in each&#xD;
           test. Indirect immunoperoxidase method will be used for the staining of paraffin&#xD;
           sections. In this assay, the unconjugated primary antibody binds to the antigen in the&#xD;
           specimen. To localize this attachment, a peroxidase conjugated specific secondary&#xD;
           antibody is used which binds to the primary antibody. A substrate is than added to&#xD;
           localize the reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The slides will be then examined under the light microscope. Staining will be graded as&#xD;
           negative (0), mild (+), moderate (++) and marked (+++) depending on intensity of&#xD;
           immunoreactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of protein expression profile-&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Extraction of Proteins 100mg of tissue will be homogenized with 0.5 ml of cold&#xD;
                (4°C) lysis buffer. Protein will be estimated by Bicin chronic Acid (BCA) method&#xD;
                and store the remaining at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. First Dimension (IEF) and Second Dimension (SDS-PAGE) separation The concentrated&#xD;
                sample will be solubilized in rehydration buffer. A total 125 - 200 µl will be&#xD;
                loaded onto 7 cm IPG strip (Amersham). IEF run will be according to manufacturer's&#xD;
                protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
                For second dimension the IPG strips will be equilibrated for 15 min with 6 ml&#xD;
                equilibration buffer. Each IPG strip will be loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide gel and&#xD;
                electrophoresed (100 or 200 V for ~6 h). After electrophoresis, proteins will be&#xD;
                fixed and are visualized using Coomassie and Silver stains.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Image Analysis, In-gel trypsin digestion and MALDI mass spectrometry analysis&#xD;
                Stained gels will be scanned with GS-800 densitometer (Bio-Rad) using PDQuest&#xD;
                software (Bio-Rad) and the proteins of interest will be analyzed by the MALDI-TOFMS&#xD;
                (Voyager DE-PRO, Applied Biosystems) at Institute of microbial technology (IMTech).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteins will be identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using Mascot web based Search&#xD;
      engine with the help of peptide mass spectra.&#xD;
