  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of smoking on cortical GABA levels in males and&#xD;
      females. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we will examine the impact of sex and&#xD;
      menstrual cycle phase on brain neurochemistry in healthy smokers and non-smokers. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that female, but not male, smokers will have reduced cortical GABA levels&#xD;
      compared to their non-smoking, sex-matched counterparts.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to measure and compare gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in&#xD;
      the occipital cortex of a group of healthy smoking and non-smoking women and men ages 18-50.&#xD;
      We will recruit women with regular menstrual cycles so that we can assess premenstrual impact&#xD;
      of smoking cessation in that population and compare GABA level concentrations across all&#xD;
      groups. Although there are several note-worthy differences between male and females in regard&#xD;
      to smoking behavior, ultimately none are as worrisome as the disparity in ability to quit&#xD;
      smoking. While multiple explanations for why women are less successful in their abstinence&#xD;
      attempts have been proffered, the observation that women are more likely to experience&#xD;
      emergence of depressive symptoms during smoking cessation, a known risk factor for relapse,&#xD;
      may be the most important contributor to this sex-specific recidivism. Several lines of&#xD;
      evidence suggest that nicotine modulation of GABA may play an important role in this&#xD;
      interplay between sex, depression, and smoking recidivism.&#xD;
