    <textblock>
      All patients who participate in this study will receive pazopanib. Pazopanib is an oral drug&#xD;
      (pill) that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced kidney cancer. In this study, the investigators plan to learn more&#xD;
      about the way this drug works by using special scans (MRIs and Ultrasounds) to help evaluate&#xD;
      how this drug is working on this disease. Approximately 20 people with advanced kidney cancer&#xD;
      will be enrolled on this study.&#xD;

      Overall objectives PRIMARY: - Assessment of early changes in DCE-MRI and ultrasound measures&#xD;
      of tumor perfusion in the setting of pazopanib therapy for patients with metastatic clear&#xD;
      cell renal cell carcinoma SECONDARY: - Correlation of baseline DCE-MRI and ultrasound&#xD;
      parameters and clinical outcome - Correlation of early (48 +/- 24 hr after treatment) changes&#xD;
      in DCE-MRI and ultrasound parameters and clinical outcome - Correlation of baseline (and&#xD;
      changes) in DCE-MRI and ultrasound parameters with VHL status in tumors and histocytometric&#xD;
      analysis of endothelial cell activation in archival nephrectomy specimens - Provide an&#xD;
      insight in the respective predictive values of DCE-MRI and US for pazopanib treatment&#xD;
