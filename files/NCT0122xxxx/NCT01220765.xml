      Rationale: The current standard of respiratory monitoring for patients during deep sedation&#xD;
      is continuous pulse oximetry with visual assessment of the patient. Clinical research has&#xD;
      demonstrated that depressed respiratory activity is a principal risk factor for hypoxemia&#xD;
      during sedation. Capnography may provide early detection of alveolar hypoventilation before&#xD;
      hypoxemia has occurred in nonintubated patients and thereby improve patient safety during&#xD;
      sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: At the Centre for Contraception, Sexuality and Abortion Leiden, abortion&#xD;
      procedures are performed under deep sedation using propofol. Patient's monitoring is&#xD;
      performed by nurses qualified in patient sedation management, using pulse oximetry and their&#xD;
      clinical judgement. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of capnography in&#xD;
      early detection of alveolar hypoventilation during deep sedation in comparison to standard&#xD;
      monitoring with pulse oximetry in abortion procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This protocol describes a prospective, open, randomized controlled trial with&#xD;
      two study arms. All patients receive standard care of monitoring performed by the medical&#xD;
      staff. The study investigates whether capnography prevents patients from having respiratory&#xD;
      events during deep sedation in abortion procedures by early detection and therapy. Patients&#xD;
      randomized to the standard care group receive standard of respiratory monitoring using pulse&#xD;
      oximetry. In the capnography arm, respiratory monitoring is performed with pulse oximetry and&#xD;
      capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population comprises female patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing&#xD;
      abortion procedures during first or second trimester pregnancies. Abortion procedures are&#xD;
      performed until 22 weeks of gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capnography: In addition application of capnography during deep sedation with propofol is&#xD;
      performed. Before the trial starts, all nurses qualified in patient sedation management and&#xD;
      abortion doctors will be trained in assessment of capnography. In the capnography arm,&#xD;
      patients' breathing is additionally monitored with capnography. If alveolar hypoventilation&#xD;
      is detected medical staff will intervene by arousing the patient, performing chin lift,&#xD;
      repositioning the head, provision of oxygen, or abandon from giving additional propofol.&#xD;
      These interventions represent the standard of care currently used by the clinical staff to&#xD;
      respond to hypoventilation and hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is the occurrence of oxygen saturations&#xD;
      to ≤90% in the population, as measured by continuous pulse oximetry. Secondary study outcomes&#xD;
      include occurrence of oxygen saturations &lt; 80%, dose of administered propofol, arousal or&#xD;
      movement of the patient during the procedure, airway interventions, early termination of the&#xD;
      procedure due to respiratory problems, episodes of bradycardia, and administration of&#xD;
      atropine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The risks related to the conduct of this study are negligible and the burden&#xD;
      minimal. Patients in both groups receive the current standard of care. Patients randomized in&#xD;
      the capnography group could get benefit from the addition of capnography to the monitoring by&#xD;
      early detection of alveolar hypoventilation. Capnography is a noninvasive measurement by&#xD;
      means of a cannula under the nose, which before the sedation may tickle, but during sedation&#xD;
      no inconvenience is expected.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Since sedation is increasingly administered by&#xD;
           non-anesthesiologists, patient safety during sedation became of increased interest by&#xD;
           the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organisations (JCAHO). The current&#xD;
           standard of respiratory monitoring for patients during sedation is continuous pulse&#xD;
           oximetry with visual assessment of the patient. Clinical research has demonstrated that&#xD;
           hypoxemia, secondary to depressed respiratory activity, is a principal risk during&#xD;
           sedation. Microstream capnography is a relatively new technology for carbon dioxide&#xD;
           (CO2) monitoring. The technique is based on emission of selective infrared wavelengths&#xD;
           exactly matching for CO2 absorption. Due to this efficient and selective emission&#xD;
           process only small samples of CO2 are necessary to detect alveolar hypoventilation, and&#xD;
           accuracy is maintained with a low flow sample rate. Therefore, capnography can provide&#xD;
           more useful information on the frequency, effectiveness and regularity of ventilation,&#xD;
           than pulse oximetry during procedures accomplished under deep sedation. According to&#xD;
           previous reports capnography provides early detection of alveolar hypoventilation before&#xD;
           hypoxemia has occurred in nonintubated patients and thereby can improve patient safety&#xD;
           during sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will provide new information on the efficacy of capnography for early&#xD;
           detection of hypoxemia during nurse-administered propofol sedation in adults. Previous&#xD;
           studies, involving a paediatric randomized study and a study in adult gastrointestinal&#xD;
           endoscopy, were outcome studies with capnography in patients sedated with midazolam in&#xD;
           combination with fentanyl or meperidine.4 5 Therefore, we will assess the efficacy of&#xD;
           interventions based on capnographic monitoring of respiratory function in&#xD;
           nurse-administered propofol sedation. In previously conducted studies independent&#xD;
           observers monitored the capnographic display and prompted the medical team of the&#xD;
           changes in respiratory activity. In the following clinical trial we will examine normal&#xD;
           practice by assessment of the capnogram by the nurse qualified in sedation management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES At the Centre for Contraception, Sexuality and Abortion (CASA) Leiden&#xD;
           abortion procedures are performed under deep sedation using propofol. These procedures&#xD;
           are not attended by an anesthesiologist and patient's monitoring is performed by nurses&#xD;
           qualified in patient sedation management, using pulse oximetry and their clinical&#xD;
           judgement. Supplementary oxygen is not routinely given.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of capnography to improve patient&#xD;
           safety during deep sedation. This study examines the effectiveness of capnography in&#xD;
           early detection and therapy of alveolar hypoventilation during deep sedation in&#xD;
           comparison to standard monitoring with pulse oximetry in abortion procedures. The&#xD;
           randomized controlled trial determines whether utilizing capnography in women undergoing&#xD;
           deep sedation with propofol (monotherapy) for abortion procedures will provide early&#xD;
           detection of suboptimal ventilation and reduce hypoxemia. Unlike previous studies we are&#xD;
           determined to investigate daily practice when nurses qualified in sedation management&#xD;
           assess capnography instead of an independent observer assessing capnography. Therefore,&#xD;
           all nurses qualified in patient sedation management and abortion doctors will be trained&#xD;
           in assessment of capnography before the trial starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The implications of this study for monitoring deep sedation may be generalized to all&#xD;
           healthy patients having minimal invasive procedures, particularly when a trained&#xD;
           anesthesiologist is not in attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN This protocol describes a prospective, open, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
           with two study arms. All patients receive standard care of monitoring performed by the&#xD;
           medical staff. The study examines whether capnography prevents patients from having&#xD;
           respiratory events during deep sedation in abortion procedures.Patients randomized to&#xD;
           the standard care group receive standard of care using pulse oximetry. In the&#xD;
           capnography arm, respiratory monitoring is performed with pulse oximetry and&#xD;
           capnography. If the capnogram indicates sub-optimal ventilation and/or apnea, denoted as&#xD;
           a flat line on the capnometer for ≥ 15 seconds, a respiratory rate ≤ 6, or a end-tidal&#xD;
           CO2 &gt; 50 mmHg, medical staff will intervene by arousing the patient, performing chinlift&#xD;
           or jawthrust, abandon from giving additional propofol, or provision of oxygen. The nurse&#xD;
           qualified in sedation management will assess capnography him/ herself. Medical staff and&#xD;
           patients are not blinded for the allocation assignment and the study has an open design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY POPULATION 4.1 Population Participants are recruited at the Centre for&#xD;
           Contraception, Sexuality and Abortion Leiden, the Netherlands. The study population&#xD;
           comprises female patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing abortion procedures during first or&#xD;
           second trimester pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Inclusion criteria Patients were considered for enrolment if they fulfil all of the&#xD;
           following inclusion criteria: age 18 years or older, abortion procedures performed until&#xD;
           22 weeks of gestational age, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) classes I to&#xD;
           II, and ability (mental competence) to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Exclusion criteria Exclusion criteria were inability to provide informed consent,&#xD;
           history of allergic reactions to propofol, soybeans or egg proteins, American Society of&#xD;
           Anaesthesiologists (ASA) classes III- V, sleep apnea syndrome, and seizure disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Sample size calculation The sample size calculation for the prospective randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial is based on a comparison of two proportions. The proportion of patients&#xD;
           developing hypoxemia during sedation is reported between 47% and 51% in observational&#xD;
           studies.1 2 Qadeer et al. reported a reduction of hypoxemia (saturation &lt;90%) with&#xD;
           additional capnography monitoring from 69% to 46% and Lightdale et al. reported a&#xD;
           reduction of hypoxemia (saturation &lt;95%) in children from 24% to 11%.4 5 Based on an&#xD;
           observation of daily practice in 58 patients at the CASA clinic Leiden hypoxemia (oxygen&#xD;
           saturation &lt; 90%) was recorded in 12 patients, corresponding to an incidence of 20.7%.&#xD;
           To show a decrease in hypoxemia from 20% to 10% with a significance level of 0.05 and a&#xD;
           power of 0.80, 219 patients are required within each arm, yielding 440 patients to be&#xD;
           included in total. Give the annual number of 1600 patients and expecting a participation&#xD;
           rate of 60%, we expect to include these patients within a period of 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. METHODS 5.1 Study parameters/endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.1 Main study parameter/ endpoint The primary outcome is the occurrence of oxygen&#xD;
      saturations to &lt;90% in the population, measured by continuous pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2 Secondary study parameters/endpoints Secondary study outcomes include occurrence of&#xD;
      oxygen saturations to &lt;80%, total administered propofol dose, airway interventions&#xD;
      (repositioning the head, chinlift, supplemental oxygen, bag-mask ventilation), problems&#xD;
      during the abortion procedure (e.g. arousal or movement of the patient), early termination of&#xD;
      the procedure due to respiratory problems, episodes of bradycardia, administration of&#xD;
      atropine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.3 Other study parameters Carbon dioxide monitoring with capnography will provide the&#xD;
      following parameters: apnea (absence of respiratory activity) denoted as a flat line on the&#xD;
      capnometer for ≥ 15 seconds, abnormal ventilation denoted as a respiratory rate ≤ 6, and&#xD;
      end-tidal CO2 &gt; 50 mmHg (CO2 &gt; 6.7 kPa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline values are age, height, body weight, duration of pregnancy, American Society of&#xD;
      Anaesthesiologists class, smoking, abuse of alcohol or drugs, and use of soporifics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Randomisation, blinding and treatment allocation During the trial patients are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the capnography group (standard care and monitoring with capnography) or the&#xD;
      control group (standard care) by randomisation. The randomisation is computer-generated and&#xD;
      stratified for each abortion doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are recruited by an independent observer or nurse. The patient and medical staff&#xD;
      will not be blinded to the allocation assignment and also the independent observer is aware&#xD;
      of the randomisation assignment before the start of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily practice at the CASA clinic: If patients opt for an abortion procedure after five&#xD;
           days of statutory reflection they are coming to the clinic with an appointment. Before&#xD;
           any procedure starts, patients have again a conversation with a doctor or nurse about&#xD;
           their decision to have an abortion. If an abortion is inevitable and pregnancy lasts no&#xD;
           longer than 16 weeks, the patient is immediately admitted to the clinic. If an abortion&#xD;
           is inevitable and pregnancy lasts between 16 and 22 weeks, cervical priming with&#xD;
           misoprostol is administered at least 90 minutes before the abortion procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A routinely performed health questionnaire, blood pressure, heart rate and blood group&#xD;
           determination are performed in preparation for the procedure. Peripheral venous access&#xD;
           is established at the holding area. Baseline characteristics for the study are obtained&#xD;
           by this routinely performed questionnaire including health questions (e.g. weight,&#xD;
           height, and smoking).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are asked to be a participant for this study by one of the nurses or by the&#xD;
           researcher at the holding area. They receive an information letter and are able to&#xD;
           question the researcher about their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the procedure starts monitoring, including pulse oximetry and blood pressure, is&#xD;
           attached to each patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients receive standard monitoring with continuous display of pulse oximetry and&#xD;
           heart rate. In the intervention group capnography is measured using a cannula under the&#xD;
           nose connected to the capnograph, Capnostream TM 20, Oridion Medical 1987 ltd. This&#xD;
           capnographic device displays respiratory rate, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) levels,&#xD;
           and continuous waveforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients are sedated with an initial dose of 100 milligrams (mg) propofol. In&#xD;
           addition 20-50 mg propofol is administered when patient discomfort or lighter levels of&#xD;
           sedation are noticed. The nurse qualified in sedation management determines the doses of&#xD;
           propofol on a previously described sedation protocol for the CASA clinics. Local&#xD;
           anesthesia of the cervix is performed with 10-20 ml lidocaine 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the abortion procedure has finished patients are monitored at the recovery area. If&#xD;
           they are fully awake and no extensive bleeding has occurred, they are allowed to leave&#xD;
           the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Withdrawal of individual subjects Subjects can leave the study at any time for any reason&#xD;
      if they wish to do so without any consequences. It should however be noted that patients&#xD;
      during sedation no longer have the ability to express their wishes.&#xD;
