  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When given to men with recurrent prostate cancer, the investigators hypothesize that POMx is&#xD;
      effective in slowing the rise of PSA as measured by PSA doubling time in men following&#xD;
      initial therapy for prostate cancer. Further, the investigators believe that POMx will be&#xD;
      shown to be safe and well tolerated.&#xD;

      The study will be an 18-month, prospective, multi-center, double-blind, dose finding study&#xD;
      with subjects who have undergone definitive treatment (surgery, cryotherapy, radiation&#xD;
      therapy or brachytherapy) for primary prostate tumor and have had documented rising PSA on a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 time points each at least 1 month apart, higher than the reference value noted&#xD;
      within 1 year of study entry.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has undergone definitive treatment (surgery, surgery with radiation therapy,&#xD;
             cryotherapy, radiation therapy or brachytherapy) for the primary prostate tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with a rising PSA post-prostatectomy may consider radiation as an alternative.&#xD;
             If subject declines radiation, he may be considered eligible in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a rising PSA on a minimum of 3 time points each at least 1 month apart,&#xD;
             higher than the reference value noted within 1 year of study entry and defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute level of PSA &gt;0.4 ng/mL following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute level of PSA &gt;1.5 ng/mL following radiation or cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute level of PSA &gt;0.4 ng/mL for subjects treated with multiple treatment&#xD;
             modalities (e.g., surgery + radiation, radiation + cryotherapy, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
