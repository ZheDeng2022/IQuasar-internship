      This open label, non-blinded, proof of concept efficacy and safety study of eculizumab in&#xD;
      patients with biopsy proven DDD or C3 nephropathy. The trial will consist of adult patients&#xD;
      with these diseases who have &gt; 1 gram of proteinuria or a decreased glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate (GFR), both predictors of a poor long-term outcome in many glomerular diseases. The&#xD;
      patients will be treated with eculizumab for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals will be to determine whether treatment leads to an improvement in kidney function,&#xD;
      defined by remissions of proteinuria and improvements in estimated GFR (measured by serum&#xD;
      creatinine), and to improvement in histologic parameters, including percentage of&#xD;
      non-affected glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis, intensity of C3 staining of&#xD;
      immunofluorescence, and amount of electron dense deposits by electron microscopy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dense deposit disease (DDD), also called membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type&#xD;
      II, is a rare form of glomerulonephritis named because of the characteristic appearance of&#xD;
      electron-dense material in the glomerular basement membrane observed on kidney biopsy. The&#xD;
      principle immune defect in DDD is excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway,&#xD;
      with deposition of complement components in the glomerular basement membrane. Hence, by&#xD;
      immunofluorescence microscopy, there is heavy C3 deposited along the basement membrane. Some&#xD;
      patients have been found to have deficiencies of Factor H or Factor I, inhibitors of C3&#xD;
      activation. Others have a C3 nephritic factor, an antibody that activates the alternative&#xD;
      complement cascade. It has recently been recognized that C3 nephropathy, a rare glomerular&#xD;
      disease with mesangial cell proliferation and C3 deposition by immunofluorescence microscopy,&#xD;
      is associated with similar over-activation of the alternative complete cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While DDD affects mostly children and young adults, in the series of 32 patients from&#xD;
      Columbia with DDD whose biopsies were read from 1977-2007, 18 patients (56%) were older than&#xD;
      16 years of age at the time of diagnosis, and about 40% of patients were over 30 years old.&#xD;
      The age division is important for two reasons. First, in the Columbia series, children&#xD;
      appeared to have better clinical outcomes than adults. While 25.9% of all patients had a&#xD;
      complete remission, there was a significant distinction between adults, of whom only 7.1%&#xD;
      achieved complete remission, and children, of whom 46.1% achieved complete remission. Of the&#xD;
      remaining patients who did not achieve remission, 42.9% of adults, compared to only 7.7% of&#xD;
      children, progressed to end stage renal disease (ESRD) over a mean follow-up of over 5 years.&#xD;
      Second, as there are no large clinical trials to guide specific interventions for DDD and the&#xD;
      role of immunomodulatory therapies still remains controversial, many nephrologists advocate&#xD;
      using immunomodulatory therapy only in selected adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunomodulatory therapies not specifically targeted to DDD, such as corticosteroids,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, and calcineurin inhibitors, have either been unsuccessful or not studied in&#xD;
      a meaningful number of patients to warrant routine use. However, as the principal defect&#xD;
      underlying DDD is excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway, with deposition&#xD;
      of complement components in the glomerular basement membrane, a therapy that directly targets&#xD;
      the alternative complement pathway may prove particularly beneficial for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to C5. The drug&#xD;
      is FDA-approved for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (in which mutations&#xD;
      of complement regulatory proteins on hematopoietic cells lead to alternative complement&#xD;
      pathway-mediated hemolysis). It is currently being studied for use in atypical hemolytic&#xD;
      uremic syndrome, a rare disease marked by diffuse micro-thromboses related to activation of&#xD;
      the alternative complement system. Eculizumab prevents cleavage of C5, thereby precluding&#xD;
      formation of C5a, which has been implicated in glomerular inflammation in animal models of&#xD;
      DDD. Moreover, by inhibiting the activation of C5, it prevents the formation of the membrane&#xD;
      attack complex C5-9. Speculatively, this drug could provide effective, targeted therapy for&#xD;
      patients with DDD.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive Eculizumab and be observed for 60 minutes after the first 5 infusions, then 30 minutes after all subsequent infusions. Patients will not be allowed to take other immunomodulatory therapies during the study period but will continue on their other non-immunomodulatory therapies (e.g. ACE inhibitors, -statins, aspirin) without modifications unless clinically indicated. All patients, if unvaccinated, will be given N. meningitides vaccine at least two weeks prior to first eculizumab exposure. All female patients of childbearing potential will be asked to use adequate contraception methods during treatment and up to 5 months following discontinuation of eculizumab treatment.</description>

        <description>This is designed to measure response to eculizumab through clinical and histological data, including a reduction in serum creatinine or in proteinuria, or histopathologic improvement.

Eculizumab: 900 mg IV once a week x 4 weeks, 1200 mg IV week 5, then 1200 mg IV every 2 weeks through week 53.&#xD;
Patients will be observed for 60 minutes after the first 5 infusions, then 30 minutes after all subsequent infusions. Patients will not be allowed to take other immunomodulatory therapies during the study period but will continue on their other non-immunomodulatory therapies (e.g. ACE inhibitors, -statins, aspirin) without modifications unless clinically indicated. All patients, if unvaccinated, will be given N. meningitidis vaccine at least two weeks prior to first eculizumab exposure. All female patients of childbearing potential will be asked to use adequate contraception methods during treatment and up to 5 months following discontinuation of eculizumab treatment.</description>
