    <textblock>
      The loratadine-pseudoephedrine combination has proven to be more effective than the use of&#xD;
      these individual components. This prospective, randomized, double-blind and paralel study, in&#xD;

      association drug for treatment of signs and symptoms during 4 weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of treatment in each drug group will be evaluate by global improvement of&#xD;
      signs (nasal mucous edema, ocular hyperemia, nasal secretion) and symptoms (itching eye,&#xD;
      tearing,itching nose, itching on the palate) of perennial allergic rhinitis, after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. Symptoms as rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, itching nose, sneezing and itching eye&#xD;
      were considered as secondary efficacy endpoint, along with the questionnaire of quality of&#xD;
      life SF-36. Safety evaluation data will include report of all adverse events (including type,&#xD;
      frequency, instensity, seriousness, severity and action taken related to investigational&#xD;
      product) reported by patients, parents or legal responsible, ou observed by Investigator.&#xD;
