  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase II trial to demonstrate the response rate, using the Response evaluation criteria in&#xD;
      solid tumours (RECIST) criteria, of patients with locally advanced / metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer treated with combination of irinotecan, oxaliplatin, UFT and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS Primary: Objective response rate (RECIST) Secondary: Progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS), Overall survival (OS) Toxicity (CTCAE), Resectability of liver, lung and pelvic&#xD;
      disease after chemotherapy, Time to progression (TTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION: The trial aims to recruit 50 patients with inoperable, metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer ELIGIBILITY: Histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma Normal haematology and&#xD;
      adequate renal and liver function Written informed consent and able to attend follow-up for&#xD;
      at least 3 months TREATMENT 4 weekly cycles of chemotherapy with alternating irinotecan (day&#xD;
      1) and oxaliplatin(day 15). Cetuximab every 2 weeks and oral UFT with Leucovorin for 3 weeks&#xD;
      every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION First patient recruited April 2009. Accrual to take place over 24 months Follow-up&#xD;
      will continue until death or for a minimum of 3 years&#xD;

    <description>Cetuximab will be prepared under Good Manufacturing practice (GMP) and supplied by Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany) as a solution for intravenous infusion. It will be made up into 250ml with N/Saline.&#xD;
Dose administered is 400mg/m2 and will be given on day 1 and day 15 of a 28 day cycle.Cetuximab will always be administered first, i.e. the cetuximab infusion should be completed one hour before any chemotherapy begins. The cetuximab dose must always be based on the body surface area(BSA). There is no restriction for cetuximab in patients with a BSA &gt; 2 m2 .</description>
