  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis for this study is that, in nicotine-dependent tobacco smokers,&#xD;
      baclofen will be superior to placebo for smoking abstinence measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis is that subjects assigned to the baclofen groups will exhibit higher&#xD;
      rates of medication compliance (i.e. take the medication as directed for the trial period)&#xD;
      than those in the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary hypothesis is that baclofen will lead to significant reductions in tobacco&#xD;
      withdrawal and craving ratings as compared to placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will test a new medication strategy designed to help smokers quit. It will&#xD;
      evaluate Baclofen, a drug currently approved and available in Canada as a myorelaxant. Forty&#xD;
      five nicotine-dependent smokers will enroll in this study. Fifteen will receive placebo&#xD;
      (inactive pill), fifteen will receive baclofen 30 mg/day, and fifteen will receive baclofen&#xD;
      60 mg/day. Once enrolled, subjects will visit CAMH on a weekly basis for assessment of&#xD;
      smoking behaviour, a brief health check (vitals, BP and AE screening), delivery of brief&#xD;
      individual smoking cessation counselling, and collection of breath, blood and urine samples&#xD;
      (as scheduled) to a) measure levels of nicotine and its metabolites, b) conduct pregnancy and&#xD;
      tox testing. The medication phase of this study lasts 12 weeks. Two follow-up visits will be&#xD;
      scheduled at week 13 and at six months after trial completion.&#xD;
