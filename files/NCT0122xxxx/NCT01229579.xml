  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pakistan is one of the 4 developing countries where cases of poliomyelitis are still being&#xD;
      identified. Despite the incessant efforts by WHO and UNICEF, this disease is far from&#xD;
      control. There is a need to develop new and innovative strategies to contain the disease and&#xD;
      eradicate it from the countries where new cases continue to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc is an essential component of scores of enzymes in the human body. Recent reports have&#xD;
      indicated that this trace element along with other micronutrients enhances the protective&#xD;
      functions of immune cells. Moreover, zinc deficiency leads to dysregulation of balanced host&#xD;
      responses to infection resulting into decreased antibody production and suppressed immunity.&#xD;
      Zinc is also an essential cofactor for thymulin which is known to modulate cytokine release&#xD;
      and induce immune cell proliferation. Zinc deficiency is also found to impair an individual's&#xD;
      epithelial barrier function, which may further depress the vaccine entry into the mucosal&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of zinc in the prevention of diarrheal diseases and other infections in children is well&#xD;
      documented. However, there are very few reports about its contribution to enhanced immunity&#xD;
      by supporting body's natural defense system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc insufficiency is widespread in socioeconomically deprived children in South Asia and the&#xD;
      recent most national nutrition survey (2003) . Moreover, diarrhea is also very common in&#xD;
      infants in Pakistan. Such diarrheal episodes can limit entry of attenuated polio virus into&#xD;
      the mucosal cells, thereby, leading to inadequate immune response. Association between recent&#xD;
      diarrheal history and increased vaccine failure in infants has been shown in a study from&#xD;
      Brazil. The recent Lancet Nutrition series has also recommended regular zinc supplementation&#xD;
      to address child undernutrition and stunting and underscored the need to treat diarrheal&#xD;
      episodes with zinc to expedite recovery. Other recent studies of zinc supplementation in low&#xD;
      birth weight infants in South Asia have also shown significant improvement in diarrheal&#xD;
      disease burden and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of these lines of evidence, it is possible that some of the cases of vaccine&#xD;
      failure in this region could be a consequence of compromised immunity and, hence, diminished&#xD;
      response to OPV. This could potentially be reversed by addressing such gross undernutrition&#xD;
      and micronutrient deficiencies. It can thus be hypothesized that zinc supplementation at&#xD;
      community scale would enhance the immune response in infants to OPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test this research question, the investigators propose to undertake 12-month&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial among a cohort of Pakistani infants of 0-14 days of age. Such a&#xD;
      trial would enable us to understand the synergistic role of zinc (if any) with OPV in&#xD;
      enhancing immune response against polio and sero-conversion rates.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to carry out a randomized controlled clinical trial in Pakistan to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of zinc supplementation in the first 18 weeks of life on seroconversion&#xD;
      due to OPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants of 0-14 days of age will be recruited and randomized into 2 groups; all the groups&#xD;
      would receive the respective OPV doses according to the EPI schedule, and the intervention&#xD;
      group, in addition, would receive 10 mg of elemental zinc on a daily basis, for 18 weeks,&#xD;
      starting at the age of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 18 weeks (after the 4 weeks of last OPV), the investigators provide an additional dose of&#xD;
      bOPV as a challenge and collect stool samples to at 0 and 7 days after delivery at of the&#xD;
      bOPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study settings The rural settlement of Hala (population ~ 200,000), located about 200 km&#xD;
      north-east of Karachi, Pakistan would be the selected study site, as a high proportion of&#xD;
      at-risk under 5 children reside in the area. The large proportion of this population falls in&#xD;
      the lower socioeconomic group, according to a recently conducted census in 2008, making the&#xD;
      site eminently suitable to test out the trial hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Pediatrics &amp; Child Health, AKU has established liaison with the community&#xD;
      members and local government stakeholders, with its research office located in a&#xD;
      district-level tertiary care hospital. The nearby vaccination center would assist in&#xD;
      delivering the OPV doses, according to the EPI schedule, along with other EPI vaccines. The&#xD;
      tertiary health care center (Taluka Hospital, Hala) would provide a place for evaluation and&#xD;
      treatment for any unforeseen adverse reactions / events, free of cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The trial would recruit full term healthy infants of either sex at or soon&#xD;
      after birth and randomize them for supplementation as soon as possible after birth (within 72&#xD;
      hours and in tandem with the first OPV dose). Infants beyond this age and preterm infants (&lt;&#xD;
      37 weeks gestation or &lt; 2 kg birth weight) would be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling strategy Eligible subjects would be identified and randomized to the respective&#xD;
      intervention and comparative groups using computer generated three cell block randomization&#xD;
      permutation tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Standard OPV schedule and oral zinc supplement (as 10 mg zinc sulfate liquid&#xD;
      preparation) daily for 18 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Will receive standard OPV schedule and standard care. An identical placebo&#xD;
      preparation, similar in taste, color and consistency will also be administered daily for 18&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups would receive standard OPV doses at birth, at 6 weeks, at 10 weeks and at 14 weeks&#xD;
      of age, as recommended by the expanded program of immunization (EPI). As practiced by WHO and&#xD;
      UNICEF, OPV doses would also be administered in the cohort, through the polio mass&#xD;
      vaccination campaign, scheduled twice in every 3 months. The zinc and placebo preparation&#xD;
      will be administered in equal volumes (2.5 ml daily), prepared by Atco Laboratories Limited,&#xD;
      one of the leading pharmaceutical industries in Pakistan. . They would hold the allocation&#xD;
      codes, replenish supplies at fortnightly intervals and maintain consumption records. The&#xD;
      research and monitoring staff will be fully blinded to these preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the need to follow individual level response, the investigators have chosen an&#xD;
      individual randomized trial as opposed to a cluster randomized trial. The investigators shall&#xD;
      employ a computerized block randomization strategy with groups matched in blocks of 20, with&#xD;
      the codes maintained by Atco Laboratories Limited and the Chair of the AKU ERC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained field workers will visit the households, 2 times a week to assess compliance to the&#xD;
      assigned intervention at their respective time schedules, motivate families and evaluate the&#xD;
      child as per a standard format. For the recruits in the research study, incentives would be&#xD;
      provided in the form of soaps and cloths to be provided when the field teams visit the&#xD;
      household for collection of blood samples from the study subjects. These have been selected&#xD;
      in view of the immediate need of these to the recruited child residing in the area of Hala&#xD;
      and through years of formative research for comparable projects in rural Sindh. These&#xD;
      incentives have deliberately been kept modest so as not to pose undue incentives for&#xD;
      participation. The health workers would replenish zinc or placebo supplies every 12 days (in&#xD;
      30 ml bottles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of participants Sample size estimates There is scarcity of research indicating the&#xD;
      seroconversion rates to OPV among infants residing in a rural population of Pakistan. The&#xD;
      investigators assumed that a conservative estimate of seroconversion to OPV among infants&#xD;
      till 14 weeks of age for a rural population of Pakistan would be about 50%. These&#xD;
      seroconversion rates are consistent with the lower limits of OPV seroconversion rates&#xD;
      observed among breastfed young infants in one solitary study on the subject in Pakistan. To&#xD;
      detect a 20% improvement in seroconversion rates upon zinc administration, the investigators&#xD;
      would require a minimum of 242 subjects (121 subjects occupying each group) at 5% level of&#xD;
      significance and 90% power. Estimating a 30% maximum dropout or refusal rate in comparable&#xD;
      studies involving serological testing, the investigators would require a total of 320&#xD;
      subjects, with 160 subjects occupying each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and informed consent A cohort of pregnant women (in their third trimester)&#xD;
      would be identified through the baseline census and subsequent updates during the&#xD;
      surveillance period. The investigators will then identify births within 24 hours of birth&#xD;
      through an information system employing the assistance of Lady Health Workers (LHWs) of the&#xD;
      area and the traditional birth attendants (TBAs). Families will be visited prior to birth to&#xD;
      sensitize them about the study and provide an information sheet. Following notification of&#xD;
      births, the families will be visited again and informed consent sought prior to initial&#xD;
      randomization. The recruited infants and families will be visited, 3 times per week to assess&#xD;
      morbidity and growth (height, weight, mid-arm circumference and head circumference). Close&#xD;
      liaison would be maintained with the local vaccination centers, where the OPV doses would be&#xD;
      administered to the infants according to the EPI schedule of Immunization. Efforts would be&#xD;
      made by the research staff to maintain a record of all vaccinations of the recruited cohort,&#xD;
      along with dates for subsequent vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance and data collection A research team would be assembled, constituting of research&#xD;
      supervisors, field supervisors, research medical officers, phlebotomists and community health&#xD;
      workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the census update, a data collector is capable of visiting at least 30 households per&#xD;
      day; thus the census update could be covered in a months' time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of subjects in the trial could get covered in less than 2 months. For the trial&#xD;
      activity, at least 8 teams would be delegated, with each covering at least 40 households per&#xD;
      day. Each household (bearing one potential subject) would be visited 2 times in a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3-day training program would be imparted to familiarize them of the research protocol, the&#xD;
      field operations for the activities of the census/survey and the research trial and measures&#xD;
      for completing the forms. A series of data collection forms would be drafted (initially in&#xD;
      English; then translated to Urdu and Sindhi languages) to collect information during the&#xD;
      entire research period. A case recruitment form (CRF) would be drafted, which would be filled&#xD;
      by research medical officers and would bear questions/items on birth history, immunization&#xD;
      status, medical history, anthropometry and physical examination. The subjects would be&#xD;
      followed up on a regular basis (2 times a week) by the research appointed community health&#xD;
      workers with a minimum qualification of matriculation (grade 10 education), using a&#xD;
      pre-defined follow up form. The CHWs will record data on immunization status, medical history&#xD;
      and management of any ailment (especially diarrhea), anthropometric assessment and medical&#xD;
      examination, and laboratory test results (blood serology and ELISA). Immunization status of&#xD;
      each recruit would be maintained for every OPV dose provided to the recruited infants. The&#xD;
      data would be collected by the CHWs during their regular follow ups in the area through&#xD;
      assessment of vaccination records and finger marking during or after campaigns. A&#xD;
      supplementation form would be maintained regularly to ensure compliance in all groups and&#xD;
      replenished. This would be recorded by the community health workers undertaking household&#xD;
      surveillance. All the forms would bear the general information of the child and the&#xD;
      intervention codes allotted by Atco laboratories. Research medical officers, in addition to&#xD;
      leading the field teams, would also be entrusted to oversee any untoward events/reactions,&#xD;
      among the study subjects. These would be brought to their notice by the circulating CHWs. If&#xD;
      encountered, the adverse events would be documented followed by its clinically appropriate&#xD;
      treatment. If a child, outside the recruited cohort is identified as in need of health care,&#xD;
      the CHWs may refer the child to the Taluka Hospital, Hala.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Analysis Blood samples (approximately 3 ml from the cubital fossa of either arm)&#xD;
      would be collected at birth, at 6 weeks and at 18 weeks of age of the recruited infant, by&#xD;
      phlebotomists with relevant experience of drawing blood among infants. The blood samples&#xD;
      would be analyzed for polio seroconversion rates. Neutralizing antibodies would be determined&#xD;
      using the methods recommended by WHO [9]. The investigators will evaluate antibody responses&#xD;
      to OPV by serotype in close collaboration with CDC (Atlanta). A subset of the samples will&#xD;
      also be locally tested by ELISA to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA as&#xD;
      compared to the gold standard neutralization assays in detecting polio antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate the impact of zinc on immune response to OPV, the investigators would&#xD;
      determine the status of zinc (serum levels) in infants in all the groups. These would be&#xD;
      determined from blood samples collected at birth, at 6 weeks and at 18 weeks of age and&#xD;
      analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry using established micromethods. Other&#xD;
      micronutrient indicators influencing systemic and mucosal immunity (hemoglobin, ferritin and&#xD;
      vitamin A) would also be analyzed from the collected blood specimens of the recruited&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples would be collected from the field and transported to the Nutrition Research&#xD;
      Laboratory, Department of Pediatrics &amp; Child Health, AKU. A transport mechanism is well&#xD;
      established which brings the blood and other biological samples from Hala/Matiari field site&#xD;
      to the main laboratory at AKU on a daily basis. To save costs the same mechanism would also&#xD;
      be employed for transportation of blood samples to the Research Laboratory at AKU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration The study is expected to last in total for 12 months; initial 3 months for&#xD;
      census activities and field preparation and training activities, 6 months for the actual&#xD;
      research trial, inclusive of recruitment, intervention, follow up and laboratory tests and&#xD;
      the last 3 months for finalization of data analyses and preparation of the final report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will collect stool samples to at 0 and 7 days after delivery&#xD;
      at of the bOPV. The stool samples would be collected from the field and transported to the&#xD;
      National Institute of Health (NIH), Pakistan and processed according to the standard protocol&#xD;
      used in the global polio laboratory network, including poliovirus isolation, ITD and&#xD;
      sequencing. Non-polio enterovirus (NPEV) will be isolated but not characterized. A transport&#xD;
      mechanism is well established which brings the stool and other biological samples from&#xD;
      Hala/Matiari field site to the Aga Khan University on a daily basis, where the samples will&#xD;
      be stored until shipment to the NIH (a WHO Regional Polio Network Laboratory) in Islamabad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome variables: Seroconversion rates of polio virus (type 1 and type 3), from blood&#xD;
           samples collected at the time of recruitment, at 6 weeks and 18 weeks, and prevalence of&#xD;
           excretion of poliovirus serotypes 1, 3 at 0 and 7 days after the administration of bOPV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other variables: Data would be collected on birth history, immunization status, medical&#xD;
           history and management, number and rates of diarrheal episodes, breast feeding&#xD;
           practices, laboratory nutritional indices, anthropometric measurements (weight for age,&#xD;
           weight for height and height for age), physical examination and vital signs, and other&#xD;
           laboratory parameters, like serum zinc, C-reactive protein, polio virus seroconversion&#xD;
           rates, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses The collected data would be dual entered in a data base developed using&#xD;
      Foxpro, and for further analysis using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version&#xD;
      18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequencies for continuous variables would be expressed as means ± standard deviations.&#xD;
      Proportions would be calculated for categorical outcomes. Means would be compared using&#xD;
      paired t-test. Chi square tests of independence would be employed for determining differences&#xD;
      in associations. Differences in seroconversion rates and prevalence of excretion, if any,&#xD;
      would be evaluated using ANOVA and non-parametric tests. Multiple logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis will be undertaken to determine the nature of relationship between serum zinc status&#xD;
      and optimal vaccine seroconversion.&#xD;
