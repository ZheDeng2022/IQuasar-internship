      1. To show that patients with greater pain sensitivity will show greater improvement in&#xD;
           their symptoms (self-reported pain intensity, mood, sleep, and quality of life) than&#xD;
           those with lower pain sensitivity, based on QST, after taking milnacipran.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare outcome differences (pain intensity, mood, activity interference, sleep, and&#xD;
           side effects) with those patients who are either taking or not taking opioids for their&#xD;
           pain 10 weeks after being prescribed milnacipran.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To show that patients who are older, male, with more medical comorbidities, greater&#xD;
           disability, and longer pain duration will report less improvement (pain, mood, sleep,&#xD;
           health-related quality of life) and treatment satisfaction while taking milnacipran&#xD;
           compared with others without such characteristics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a costly syndrome that influences every aspect of a patient's life.&#xD;
      Significant interference with sleep, employment, social functioning, and daily activities is&#xD;
      common. Chronic pain patients frequently report depression, anxiety, irritability, sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction, and decreased energy. Family roles are altered, and worries abound about&#xD;
      financial limitations and future consequences of a restricted lifestyle. Epidemiological&#xD;
      studies have independently documented that chronic pain is an immense international problem.&#xD;
      Chronic pain symptoms afflict one third of the American population (more than 80 million&#xD;
      people). Chronic pain accounts for 21% of emergency room visits and 25% of annual missed work&#xD;
      days. When direct and indirect costs are considered, chronic pain imposes a greater economic&#xD;
      burden than any other disease, with annual estimates up to $100 billion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete a number of questionnaires at baseline and undergo quantitative&#xD;
      sensory testing (QST) as well as complete a handheld electronic diary PDA throughout the&#xD;
      entire 10 weeks of the study. Patients will be evaluated by a physician and receive a&#xD;
      complete history and physical. Radiological studies will be consulted to confirm diagnosis.&#xD;
      All subjects who consent to participate in this study will be started on or converted to&#xD;
      milnacipran if they are currently taking an SSRI, buproprion, or a TCA. This will be done&#xD;
      over a 1 to 2 week period of gradually weaning the antidepressant and escalating milnacipran.&#xD;
      All other adjuvant medication will remain constant through the course of the 10-week trial.&#xD;
      Efforts will be made to recruit at least 40% of the patients (N= 24) who are not taking&#xD;
      opioids for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, all patients will repeat the baseline questionnaires listed above&#xD;
      except the demographic questionnaire. They will also be asked to complete the Treatment&#xD;
      Helpfulness Questionnaire. We will compare secondary outcome differences (treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction and helpfulness) between patients either on or off of opioids.&#xD;
