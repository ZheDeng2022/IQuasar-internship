      In a study published in 1995 in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Dolson et al&#xD;
      demonstrated that a rapid decrease of serum potassium concentrations during haemodialysis&#xD;
      would produce a significant increase in systolic blood pressure at the end of the session,&#xD;
      even though there were no clear effects on intra-dialytic blood pressure. The authors defined&#xD;
      this post-dialysis blood pressure behaviour as &quot;rebound hypertension&quot;. Paradoxically, in&#xD;
      animal models, other than in the context of end-stage renal disease, potassium is a&#xD;
      vasodilator. Considering that the removal of potassium during the haemodialysis session could&#xD;
      be theoretically modulated in profiles (as with sodium and bicarbonate), it was deemed&#xD;
      suitable to delve deeper into this argument by studying, in detail, the (non invasive)&#xD;
      hemodynamic repercussions of changes in the potassium concentration of the dialysate. Not&#xD;
      being able to linearly modify the concentration, we decided to divide the dialysis session in&#xD;
      3 tertiles, randomising the patients to all possible dialysate sequences containing the usual&#xD;
      concentration of potassium or two cut-off points at +1 and -1 mmol/l. Haemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements were performed using a finger beat-to-beat monitor.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potassium is the most abundant cation in the body (35-40 mmol/kg in haemodialysis patients&#xD;
      [1]), although only 2% of the pool is located extracellularly [2]. Whereas, on a short-term&#xD;
      basis, serum potassium is regulated by the shift of potassium between the intracellular and&#xD;
      the extracellular compartment by insulin, cathecolamines, acid-base balance, and osmolarity;&#xD;
      kidneys are responsible for long-term potassium homeostasis [2]. Patients with end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease are at high risk of hyperkalaemia [3-6], which may present itself as&#xD;
      generalised weakness, paralysis, and cardiac arrhythmia [2]. Recovering potassium homeostasis&#xD;
      is thus an important objective of dialysis. Still, considering that its location is mainly&#xD;
      intracellular, which connects to the pharmacological concept of great distribution volume,&#xD;
      its removal during a haemodialysis session is quantitatively modest (between 40 and 80 mmol&#xD;
      corresponding to 1-2% of total body potassium) [1]. As a consequence, even if, in order to be&#xD;
      suitable, potassium removal during dialysis should be equal to the amount accumulated during&#xD;
      the inter-dialytic phase, in clinical practice the potassium concentration in the dialysate&#xD;
      is usually adjusted with the suboptimal goal of avoiding pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of the body content and serum concentration of potassium to control blood&#xD;
      pressure remains controversial. Epidemiological data suggest a role for potassium depletion&#xD;
      as a co-factor in the development and severity of hypertension, while dietary potassium&#xD;
      inversely correlates with blood pressure [8-10]. In animal models, an acute increase in serum&#xD;
      potassium concentration produces vasodilatation mediated by the vascular endothelium; the&#xD;
      opposite effect is observed if it decreases [11,12]. In haemodialysis, the extent of the&#xD;
      difference between serum potassium and the potassium concentration in the dialysis fluid is&#xD;
      directly correlated to an increase in blood pressure at the end of the dialysis session,&#xD;
      producing what has been named &quot;rebound hypertension&quot; [1]. In this same study no significant&#xD;
      changes in blood pressure were found during the dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In haemodialysis the nephrologists are faced with sudden changes in blood pressure and&#xD;
      haemodynamic fragility phases that have a multi-factorial origin; ultrafiltration, decrease&#xD;
      in osmolarity with imbalance and correction of metabolic acidosis play a predominant role&#xD;
      [13-19]. Despite this, and thanks to some artifices, with particular reference to calcium&#xD;
      concentration in the dialysate [15], dialysate temperature [20] and ultrafiltration and&#xD;
      sodium concentration profiles [18,21-24], pressure stability is guaranteed as a general rule.&#xD;
      Some electrolytes, particularly sodium and bicarbonate, can be modulated in profiles with the&#xD;
      purpose of better respecting the gap in osmolarity or concentration that is established&#xD;
      during the haemodialysis session, but their haemodynamic effect still remains controversial&#xD;
      [20,22,24].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum potassium is an electrolyte whose concentration - in order to guarantee a negative&#xD;
      balance - varies rapidly and significantly during dialysis, frequently resulting in going&#xD;
      from pre-dialysis hyperpotassaemia to intra-dialysis hypopotassaemia. As mentioned above, in&#xD;
      Dolson's study [1], differences in dialyses blood pressure were not found between the groups&#xD;
      treated with dialysates containing 1, 2 or 3 mmol/l of potassium, but at the end of the&#xD;
      dialyses those patients treated with the lower potassium concentrations showed what was&#xD;
      called a &quot;rebound hypertension&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the purpose of better characterising this phenomenon, we redesigned the study dividing&#xD;
      the dialysis session into 3 phases (in fact, clinical practice suggests that the haemodynamic&#xD;
      pattern at the beginning, intermediate and final phases of the dialysis are not the same) and&#xD;
      programming for each a more or less sharp drop in serum potassium concentration, respecting&#xD;
      in the meantime the need to remove the amount of potassium that usually keeps the patient in&#xD;
      steady-state. Using a crossover research model, we divide the dialysis session in 3 tertiles&#xD;
      where the potassium concentration in the dialysate was modulated between the usual&#xD;
      concentration for the study subject and two cut-off points at +1 e -1 mmol/l respectively. To&#xD;
      complete the information provided by blood pressure, haemodynamics were measured in a&#xD;
      non-invasive manner using a finger beat-to-beat monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point was the difference in haemodynamic parameters between the extremes in&#xD;
      potassium concentration of the dialysate, while the incidence of hypotension during dialysis&#xD;
      was considered a secondary end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four chronic haemodialysis patients (13 male and 11 female) were enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Each patient was dialysed for 3 to 4 hours and 30 minutes three times a week and was&#xD;
      clinically stable and without intercurrent illnesses. Using a single blind crossover design,&#xD;
      patients were randomised in the six dialysate potassium sequences of the study. Each dialysis&#xD;
      session was divided into three equal parts (tertiles): during one part the potassium&#xD;
      concentration of the dialysate was the same as the one usually prescribed to the patient,&#xD;
      whereas during the other two parts it was either increased or reduced by 1 mmol/L. The 6&#xD;
      different permutations were repeated twice, so that each patient underwent 12 dialysis&#xD;
      sessions during the study (see Table 1 for sequence details).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The haemodialyses were performed using a 4008 H machine, equipped with a cartridge of&#xD;
      bicarbonate BibagÂ©, and a high flux single use polysulfone membrane, all from Fresenius&#xD;
      Medical Care (Bad Homburg, Germany). The prescribed dialyser effective surface area, dialysis&#xD;
      fluid conductibility, dialysate temperature and composition (with the exception of potassium&#xD;
      concentration), effective blood flow, and dry weight were recorded at the enrolment in the&#xD;
      study and were then left unchanged. The medications of the patients were also left unchanged.&#xD;
      Serum potassium and patient weight were measured at the beginning and at the end of each&#xD;
      dialysis session. Blood samples were taken from the arterial limb of the shunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kt/V was used to quantify haemodialysis adequacy and was calculated using a second generation&#xD;
      single-pool Daugirdas formula (Kt/V = -ln(R-0.03) + [(4-3.5 x R) x (UF/W)], where R =&#xD;
      post-dialysis BUN/pre-dialysis BUN, UF = net ultrafiltration, W = weight, K= dialyzer&#xD;
      clearance of urea, t= dialysis time, and V= patient's total body water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of hypotension episodes (defined as a systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg) was&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, stroke volumes (integrated mean of the&#xD;
      flow waveform between the current upstroke and the dicrotic notch) and total peripheral&#xD;
      resistances (ratio of mean arterial pressure to stroke volume multiplied by heart rate) were&#xD;
      evaluated at the beginning of the session and then every 30 minutes using a FinometerÂ© finger&#xD;
      beat-to-beat monitor (Finapres Medical Systems BV, Arnhem, The Netherlands). FinometerÂ©&#xD;
      measures finger blood pressure noninvasively on a beat-to-beat basis and gives waveform&#xD;
      measurements similar to intra-arterial recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean blood pressure (BPmean) was calculated using the following formula:&#xD;
      BPmean=(BPsyst+2BPdias)/3, where BPsyst and BPdias are systolic and diastolic blood pressure,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fluid loss as a function of the time was considered to be constant during the dialysis&#xD;
      session and was recorded as total ultrafiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS System (Statistical Analysis System).&#xD;
      Comparisons between body weight, potassium concentration and haemodynamic parameters were&#xD;
      done first with an ANOVA and followed, if significant by a paired t-test performed between&#xD;
      the mean values obtained in each patient with each modality. To improve the probability of&#xD;
      showing significant differences, the haemodynamic parameters within the tertiles were&#xD;
      compared against the dialysate potassium concentration cut-off points (-1 vs. +1 mmol/l).&#xD;
      Percentages were compared using a Fisher Exact test. In all cases, a P â¤ 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant; P was expressed as ns (not significant) and as significant (P&#xD;
      â¤0.05).&#xD;
