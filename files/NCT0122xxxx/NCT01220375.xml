      High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support is the current standard procedure in&#xD;
      the first-line treatment in younger patients with myeloma fit for intensive treatment.&#xD;
      Current practice in Switzerland for stem cell mobilization is the combination of chemotherapy&#xD;
      and G-CSF stimulation in myeloma patients fit for high-dose chemotherapy with melphalan and&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplant. In this trial the intravenous application of Plerixafor is&#xD;
      being investigated in respect of the capability of the mobilization of stem cells from the&#xD;
      bone marrow into the peripheral blood. In contrast to the twice daily application of G-CSF&#xD;
      (eg. Neupogen) for several days, Plerixafor has to be injected just one-time.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support is the current standard procedure in&#xD;
      the first-line treatment in younger patients with myeloma fit for intensive treatment.&#xD;
      Current practice in Switzerland for stem cell mobilization is the combination of chemotherapy&#xD;
      and G-CSF stimulation in myeloma patients fit for high-dose chemotherapy with melphalan and&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplant. For mobilization chemotherapy, a single dose of vinorelbine&#xD;
      is commonly used, producing mild myelosuppression. G-CSF is started at day 4 on a daily&#xD;
      basis, allowing stem cell apheresis usually at day 8. In a subsequent study, we evaluated the&#xD;
      use of pegylated G-CSF given as a single injection at day 4 together with vinorelbine. We&#xD;
      found this regimen equally feasible, reliable and allowing collection of stem cells in an&#xD;
      equally high percentage. In the current proposal, we suggest to continue this line of&#xD;
      research investigating the mobilization using chemotherapy with vinorelbine. We propose to&#xD;
      study the feasibility of this mobilization chemotherapy in the absence of growth factors,&#xD;
      thus without G-CSF, in combination with Plerixafor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To assess the feasibility of collection of &gt; 6 million CD34+ peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cells/kg body weight in 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Assessment of safety of plerixafor during mobilization and collection&#xD;
      of peripheral blood stem cells; feasibility of intravenous plerixafor application and stem&#xD;
      cell apheresis in a one-day procedure on an ambulatory basis; evaluation of engraftment of&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cells mobilized by vinorelbine and plerixafor; evaluation of the costs&#xD;
      for mobilization with plerixafor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy with vinorelbine is given at a standard dose at day 1, on an ambulatory basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part A (10 patients), G-CSF is given s.c., divided in two daily doses starting at day 4&#xD;
      until collection of stem cells. Plerixafor is given as an i.v. application on day 8 in the&#xD;
      dose of 240 microg/kg b.w. Stem cell collection is initiated 4 hours later at day 8, if at&#xD;
      least 20 x 103 of CD34+ cells / ml peripheral blood are detected. In case of insufficient&#xD;
      collection, the procedure is repeated at day 9, including repetition of plerixafor&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B (30 patients): If the combination of plerixafor and vinorelbine is found feasible and&#xD;
      in the absence of unexpected toxicity, additional 30 patients will be studied in part B of&#xD;
      this study. No G-CSF will be administered in part B, otherwise the treatment plan is as it is&#xD;
      in part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High dose Melphalan will be used as conditioning regimen. After transplantation, G-CSF will&#xD;
      be given to subjects starting at day +5 after PBPC reinfusion.&#xD;

    <description>Plerixafor is a bicyclam with hematopoietic stem cell-mobilizing activity. Plerixafor blocks the binding of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1alpha) to the cellular receptor CXCR4, resulting in hematopoietic stem cell release from bone marrow and HSC movement into the peripheral circulation.</description>
