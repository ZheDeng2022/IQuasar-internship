  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, open label, multicenter study evaluating the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of CetuGEX™ after intravenous administration in patients with EGFR positive,&#xD;
      locally advanced and/or metastatic solid cancers. The effect of CetuGEX™ on the development&#xD;
      of anti-drug antibodies and on tumour response was also evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male or female patients ≥18 years of age with a histologically confirmed locally advanced&#xD;
      and/or metastatic solid organ tumor. Patients enrolled in Germany were required to have a&#xD;
      positive EGFR overexpression status. Patients must have experienced a failure or&#xD;
      non-availability of standard therapy (had received at least one line of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      further standard therapy was not an option at study entry). Open-label, non-randomized,&#xD;
      inter-patient dose-escalation, multi-center study. Patients were to receive CetuGEX until&#xD;
      disease progression or until intolerable toxicities occurred.&#xD;
