      This prospective, multi-institutional randomized clinical trial of a silver ion eluting&#xD;
      dressing material compared to standard dry gauze for closed skin incisions after open&#xD;
      surgical revascularizations for peripheral vascular occlusive disease. Based on the ability&#xD;
      of the silver to lower the bacterial contamination of these vulnerable surgical skin&#xD;
      incisions, the investigators hypothesize that immediate application of Acticoat Absorbent® as&#xD;
      a post-operative dressing will reduce closed incisional wound complications in patients&#xD;
      undergoing lower extremity revascularizations involving infrainguinal skin incisions compared&#xD;
      to standard non-silver eluting dressing material.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common post-operative complications of surgical procedures remains surgical&#xD;
      site infection, which causes significant morbidity and healthcare costs (estimated at $1.5&#xD;
      billion per year) among hospitalized patients. Surgical wounds for lower extremity&#xD;
      revascularization are particularly prone to infection and dehiscence, with rates in some&#xD;
      series as high as 44%(Kent, Bartek et al. 1996). Currently, the Guideline for Prevention of&#xD;
      Surgical Site Infection recommends the use of sterile dressing to protect closed incisions&#xD;
      for 24 to 48 hour postoperatively. However, no evidence-based recommendations are made with&#xD;
      regards to dressing types for use in post-operative incision care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A plethora of wound dressings are available in the market, with silver-based dressing among&#xD;
      these recent innovations. Topical silver treatment is an effective bactericidal agent that&#xD;
      does not induce bacterial resistance when used in therapeutic levels. Acticoat&#xD;
      Absorbent®(Smith and Nephew, Inc.), an antimicrobial barrier dressing is coated with&#xD;
      nanocrystalline silver that delivers a controlled, sustained (up to three days) dose of&#xD;
      silver ions. Additionally, this dressing absorbs moisture (minimizing wound maceration), and&#xD;
      is safe and effective against a broad range of microorganisms. Acticoat Absorbent® (Acticoat)&#xD;
      is indicated for surgical wounds, chronic wounds, and burn wounds; however, data are lacking&#xD;
      regarding in its potential role in postoperative surgical incision wound infection&#xD;
      prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator recently completed a non-concurrent, single-institution study of&#xD;
      patients who received conventional non-silver containing dressing with Acticoat as&#xD;
      post-operative dressing following defined lower extremity revascularizations(Childress,&#xD;
      Berceli et al. 2007). The study population comprised 216 patients who underwent 248 cases&#xD;
      that met inclusion criteria. Both groups were similar with regards to age at the time of&#xD;
      first procedure, gender, race, diabetes, hypertension, current smoking, and renal&#xD;
      insufficiency (creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/L). Furthermore, both groups had tissue loss as the most&#xD;
      common indication for the lower extremity revascularization procedure, with 47% (55/118) for&#xD;
      the control group and 38% (49/130) for the treatment group. Moreover, autogenous vein bypass&#xD;
      graft was the most common procedure performed for the control (65/118, 55% of procedures) and&#xD;
      treatment (54/130, 42% of procedures) groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeons and other providers found the dressing regimen easy to apply and care for&#xD;
      post-operatively. Revascularization pulses could be palpated through the dressing, and the&#xD;
      low profile permitted identification of post-operative soft tissue changes such as hematomas.&#xD;
      Compressive ace bandages could be applied without disturbing the original dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the primary findings, no substantial dressing material specific complications were&#xD;
      noted, including no apparent allergic reactions. The wound complication rate for the control&#xD;
      group was 14% (17/118), and for the treatment group was 5% (7/130). Over the intervention&#xD;
      phase, the wound overall complication rate fell by 64% (c2 = 5.76, df = 1, p = 0.016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings provide clinical evidence that an Acticoat based dressing system offers a&#xD;
      potentially efficacious, cost-effective adjunct to reduce surgical site infections for lower&#xD;
      extremity revascularization. Based on this data, we believe that further investigation via&#xD;
      multi-center randomized clinical trial is warranted. Thus for the current proposal we&#xD;
      hypothesize that immediate application of Acticoat Absorbent® as a post-operative dressing&#xD;
      would reduce closed incisional wound complications in patients undergoing lower extremity&#xD;
      revascularizations involving infrainguinal skin incisions will result in a clinically&#xD;
      significant reduction in wound complication rates compared to standard non-silver eluting&#xD;
      dressing material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient randomized in OR after wound closure completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound closure technique at the discretion of the surgeon (Dermabond is a dressing and&#xD;
           can not be utilized)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final OR dressing is test (silver vs standard) dressing, secured per surgeon preference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Original OR dressing stays in place until gross soiling impairs standard wound hygiene,&#xD;
           clinical need to remove, or POD#3, whichever comes first&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subsequent dressings, wound care at the discretion of providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual wound checks at least at 2 and 4 weeks (+/- 5 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical, economic, patient quality of life, and resource utilization data is then collected&#xD;
      at standard clinical encounters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Any wound complication within 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and Sample Size Calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current endpoint rate at least 25%(Kent, Bartek et al. 1996; Nguyen, Brahmanandam et al.&#xD;
           2007)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anticipate 10% absolute (40% relative) wound complication rate reduction(Childress,&#xD;
           Berceli et al. 2007)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Power 0.8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  alpha 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  control event rate of 0.25&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treatment event rate of 0.15&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1:1 randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  --&gt;total study sample size 250 per group (500 total).&#xD;
