      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of Mindfulness Based Tinnitus Reduction (MBTR)&#xD;
      vs. Treatment As Usual (TAU). This study aims to determine patient's benefit from&#xD;
      participating in an 8-week MBTR program as measured by a reduction in clinical symptoms, if&#xD;
      present, and a tinnitus symptom perception shift. Sixty-four tinnitus patients who have&#xD;
      previously received Tinnitus Counseling (TAU) at the UCSF Audiology Clinic under the&#xD;
      direction of Robert Sweetow, PhD will be invited to participate in the MBTR study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups of 32 each. All subjects&#xD;
      will have received Tinnitus Counseling at least 6-months prior to entry into the study.&#xD;
      Tinnitus symptom activity and discomfort as well as psychological outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      by self-report questionnaires. The primary outcome measure is the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory&#xD;
      (THI) measuring tinnitus symptom severity. The secondary outcome measures include the&#xD;
      Tinnitus Visual Analogue Scale (TVAS), the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), Hamilton&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). In&#xD;
      addition to tinnitus symptom severity, secondary outcome measures are used to measure change&#xD;
      in mindfulness and other clinical symptoms such as anxiety and depression, if they exist. The&#xD;
      experimental group will complete measures at pre-, post-, at 3-months and 12-months&#xD;
      follow-up. A 12-month follow-up assessment will be conducted with the experimental group to&#xD;
      identify any enduring effects of the treatment. The control group will fill out measures at&#xD;
      pre-, post-, and 3-month time periods. The 12-month follow-up will be conducted with the&#xD;
      experimental group only and will be the uncontrolled portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to 1) Design and execute an MBTR program for patients with&#xD;
      tinnitus within the UCSF Department of Audiology. 2) Determine patient's benefit from&#xD;
      participating in an 8-week MBTR program as measured by a decrease in tinnitus distress, and a&#xD;
      reduction in clinical symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety), if present. 3) Compare the&#xD;
      responses on study measures to those of the control group. 4) Collect follow-up data at 6-&#xD;
      and 12-months post intervention to assess enduring effects, if any, in the experimental&#xD;
      group. 5) Use the data and patient feedback to modify UCSF's Audiology program and guide&#xD;
      future programming in regards to the treatment and care of patients with tinnitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is a medical term for acoustical perceptions heard in the ear(s) or head, not&#xD;
      produced by external sound. This sound can be experienced as a ringing, buzzing, whooshing,&#xD;
      or hissing. Estimates suggest that as many as 50 million people in the United States&#xD;
      experience tinnitus to some degree. Approximately 12 million of these people experience&#xD;
      tinnitus bothersome enough to seek medical treatment. Two to 3 million Americans are severely&#xD;
      affected by their tinnitus to the extent that their ability to function is severely impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an established treatment with broad&#xD;
      applicability to clinical science. MBSR has been scientifically shown to improve well-being&#xD;
      and health in the treatment of depression (Mason O, Hargreaves I. 2001), anxiety (Kabat-Zinn,&#xD;
      et al 1992), stress (Kabat-Zinn, et al. 1992), fibromyalgia (Grossman, et al. 2007), chronic&#xD;
      fatigue (Surawy, et al. 2005), psoriasis (Kabat-Zinn, et al. 2003), treatment of cancer&#xD;
      (Speca, et al. 2006), multiple schlerosis (Grossman, et al. 2010), and pain (Kabat-Zinn, et&#xD;
      al. 1985).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments used for pain management are of particular interest to those studying tinnitus&#xD;
      because many similarities between individuals suffering with tinnitus and pain can be drawn.&#xD;
      Both pain and tinnitus patients commonly express a perceived lack of control over their&#xD;
      symptoms, problems with aspects of attention and focus, maladaptive coping strategies,&#xD;
      catastrophic thinking, and the use of similar treatment methods (e.g., cognitive coping&#xD;
      strategies, CBT, relaxation techniques)(Moller, 2000, Tonndorf, 1987). Like intractable pain,&#xD;
      there is no single identifiable cause of tinnitus, there is no single medical or surgical&#xD;
      treatment that is effective, there are a wide range of psychological effects, and one's&#xD;
      lifestyle and general health are particularly affected. One of the first studies looking at&#xD;
      mindfulness as a means of pain management was conducted by Jon Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, and&#xD;
      Burney (1985). They took 90 patients with chronic pain and trained them in a ten-week stress&#xD;
      reduction and relaxation program. Significant reductions in present moment pain, negative&#xD;
      body image, inhibition of activity by pain, mood disturbance such as anxiety and depression&#xD;
      were shown. Significant improvements in activity level and feelings of self-esteem were also&#xD;
      reported. Reductions and improvements were maintained 15-months post-treatment. Due to the&#xD;
      success of mindfulness-based interventions with chronic pain, the healing benefits of&#xD;
      mindfulness are being translated to tinnitus care in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date only one pilot study has been conducted using mindfulness meditation as a treatment&#xD;
      for tinnitus. A study conducted in Wales by Sadlier, Stephens, &amp; Kennedy (2008) used a&#xD;
      combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness meditation to treat 25&#xD;
      individuals with chronic tinnitus. The subjects were split into two groups. The treatment&#xD;
      group received four one-hour sessions of CBT and Mindfulness Meditation practice while the&#xD;
      second group waited 3-months and was then treated with the same intervention. Significant&#xD;
      reductions in tinnitus post-treatment and at 4 to 6 months follow-up were recorded. The&#xD;
      proposed MBTR study isolates mindfulness from CBT approaches to tinnitus, and may be an&#xD;
      important contribution to the clinical literature on the care of tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction and Specific Aims This study aims to determine the efficacy of MBTR in reducing&#xD;
      symptoms of tinnitus in adults. Primary objectives include: 1) Design and execute an MBTR&#xD;
      program within the UCSF Department of Audiology for patients with tinnitus. 2) Determine&#xD;
      patient's benefit from participating in an 8-week MBTR program as measured by a reduction in&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, if present, and a tinnitus symptom perception shift. 3) Compare the&#xD;
      responses on study measures to those of the control group. 4) Use the data and patient&#xD;
      feedback to modify UCSF's Audiology program and guide future programming in regards to the&#xD;
      treatment and care of patients with tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above mentioned objectives will be met through testing the following primary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: MBTR + TAU will be more effective than TAU alone in reducing tinnitus symptoms&#xD;
      (25-item Tinnitus Handicap Inventory [THI]) in adult patients with chronic tinnitus over an&#xD;
      8-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: MBTR + TAU will be more effective than TAU alone in reducing tinnitus symptoms&#xD;
      (25-item Tinnitus Handicap Inventory [THI]) in adult patients with chronic tinnitus at&#xD;
      3-months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1c: Reduction in tinnitus symptoms (25-item Tinnitus Handicap Inventory [THI]) in&#xD;
      the MBTR + TAU will be maintained at 12-months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses and analyses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Effect on Functional Status: MBTR + TAU will be more effective than TAU alone&#xD;
      in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms, if they exist (17-item Hamilton Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale [HADS]) and in reducing additional clinical symptoms, if they exist (90-item&#xD;
      Symptom Checklist-90-Revised [SCL-90-R]) and enhanced mindfulness (39-item Five Factor&#xD;
      Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Mediators of MBTR Efficacy: The effect of MBTR on tinnitus severity (THI,&#xD;
      Tinnitus Visual Analogue Scale [TVAS]) and functional status (HADS and SCL-90-R) will be&#xD;
      mediated by enhanced mindfulness (FFMQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Length of Efficacy: We will assess whether treatment gains in tinnitus severity&#xD;
      (THI, TVAS), functional status (HADS, SCL-90-R), and mindfulness (FFMQ) are retained at&#xD;
      3-months and at 12-months follow-up for the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods Subject Recruitment A chart review of past patients&#xD;
      (approximately 700) from the UCSF Audiology Clinic who have been seen for Tinnitus Counseling&#xD;
      (Treatment as Usual-TAU) at least six-months prior to enrollment in the study will take&#xD;
      place. A list of the inclusion/exclusion criteria are below.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Three hundred letters will be mailed to those patients from the Clinic's database who meet&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and have been seen for tinnitus counseling at least six-months prior to&#xD;
      entry into the study. Patients will respond via postcard as to whether they would like to&#xD;
      learn more about the study. Patients will be informed in the letter that if no response is&#xD;
      received via postcard to the Clinic within two weeks, a research assistant will follow up&#xD;
      with a phone call as a reminder to respond. To prevent over-enrollment/recruitment of&#xD;
      subjects, letters will be sent out in waves of 100 at a time. Recruitment will stop when 80&#xD;
      patients respond to participate (a 20% drop out-rate is expected bringing the number down to&#xD;
      64).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 80 patients who express interest in participating in the study and meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria per chart review will be invited to take part in a 30-minute individual interview&#xD;
      with one of the two MBTR course instructors prior to beginning the program. The 30-minute&#xD;
      individual interview will serve as an orientation to the MBTR program at which time consents&#xD;
      will be signed. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 2 groups of 32 participants, and at the&#xD;
      completion of the 30-minute interview a research assistant will administer baseline&#xD;
      psychometric assessments (see below for the list of measures used).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) The THI is a self-report measure that can be used in a&#xD;
      busy clinical practice to quantify the impact of tinnitus on daily living. The measure is&#xD;
      brief, easy to administer and interpret, broad in scope, and psychometrically robust.&#xD;
      Convergent validity was assessed using another measure of perceived tinnitus handicap&#xD;
      (Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire). Construct validity was assessed using the Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory, Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire, symptom rating scales (annoyance, sleep&#xD;
      disruption, depression, and concentration), and perceived tinnitus pitch and loudness&#xD;
      judgments. The THI is comprised of 25-item items grouped into functional, emotional, and&#xD;
      catastrophic subscales. The total scales yield excellent internal consistency reliability&#xD;
      (Cronbach's alpha=.93).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tinnitus Visual Analogue Scale (TVAS) Tinnitus Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a&#xD;
           collection of straight lines 100mm in length anchored at the end with extremes (e.g.,&#xD;
           not bothersome, extremely bothersome) of the tinnitus sensation, feeling or response.&#xD;
           The strength of this method lies in the compellation of several measurements (e.g.,&#xD;
           weekly average of tinnitus annoyance). This method of measuring distress has been&#xD;
           recommended for use in research (Axelsson, Coles, Erlandsson, Meikle, &amp; Vernon, 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) The HADS (Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983) was&#xD;
           chosen as a measure of self-reported depression and anxiety. As compared to the Beck&#xD;
           Depression Inventory and State Trait Anxiety Inventory, the HADS is a 14 item&#xD;
           questionnaire and does not tend to overburden or exhaust patients regarding filling out&#xD;
           measures. The HADS is a more discrete measure that controls for complaints better&#xD;
           explained by the somatic problem than does the BDI or STAI (Hermann, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R)&#xD;
           will be used to assess psychological distress (Derogatis 1983). SCL-90-R is a 90-item&#xD;
           questionnaire measuring psychological distress over the past week. Reliability and&#xD;
           validity of the measure is found to be high. The Global Severity Index (GSI) is used as&#xD;
           a measure of overall psychological distress. The SCL-90-R has been used in several&#xD;
           previous MBSR studies to measure psychological status (Kabat-Zinn, et al. 1992;&#xD;
           Kabat-Zinn, et al. 1985; Kabat-Zinn, et al.1987; Kaplan, et al. 1993; Miller, et al.&#xD;
           1995; Majumdar, et al. 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ;&#xD;
           R. A. Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, &amp; Toney, 2006), is a 39-item inventory&#xD;
           assessing five facets of mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FFMQ has been shown to have strong psychometric characteristics, including adequate to&#xD;
      good internal consistencies for all facets and significant correlations in predicted&#xD;
      directions with a variety of other constructs (R. A. Baer et al., 2006, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of MBTR Course The Mindfulness Based Tinnitus Reduction (MBTR) program is an&#xD;
      8-week course held one evening per week for 2 ½ hours. Participants will also complete a&#xD;
      day-long Sunday retreat between the 6th and 7th sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modeled after the original Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program developed by Jon&#xD;
      Kabat-Zinn, PhD at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, the MBTR course will&#xD;
      introduce participants to mindfulness practice in the form of sitting meditation, body&#xD;
      awareness and mindful movement, and informal mindfulness practices of daily life (e.g.,&#xD;
      eating, communicating, working, coping). Meditation will be introduced in four formats:&#xD;
      sitting meditation using the breath as an anchor of attention, sitting meditation&#xD;
      characterized by a state of open awareness, progressive body relaxation, and contemplative&#xD;
      walking. Participants will be asked to practice at home for 30 minutes 6 days per week&#xD;
      between sessions, aided by an audio CD. The two MBSR trained co-investigators will co-lead&#xD;
      the classes. Participants will be provided with a copy of Full Catastrophe Living by Jon&#xD;
      Kabat-Zinn, PhD. Intervention participants will be asked to document the number of minutes&#xD;
      spent daily on each practice at home during their participation in the 8-week program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBTR Course Outline&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course in Mindfulness-Based Tinnitus Reduction (MBTR) takes place over eight weeks.&#xD;
      Classes are approximately 2-1/2 hours long and are held in the evening once a week. Each&#xD;
      class consists of guided meditations, gentle movement exercises, lecture, and group&#xD;
      discussion as mindfulness relates to their experience with tinnitus. The course includes an&#xD;
      all-day session on a Sunday between the sixth and seventh week. Between classes, subjects&#xD;
      will enhance their participation through working with meditation CDs, homework assignments,&#xD;
      and readings from the course materials and textbook. The in-class curriculum includes the&#xD;
      following components:&#xD;

Pre-assessment measures were individually administered to participants at the UCSF Audiology Clinic immediately after consents were signed, no earlier than 2 weeks prior to the start of the intervention. Post-assessment measures were filled out at home and mailed back to the Clinic by participants no more than 2 weeks after the intervention's completion.</description>
