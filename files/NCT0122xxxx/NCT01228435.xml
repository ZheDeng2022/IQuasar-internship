  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IPI-504 blocks a protein that is in cancer cells and is also in normal cells. This protein is&#xD;
      called Heat Shock Protein-90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 helps protect certain other proteins from being&#xD;
      destroyed by cells. These proteins can mutate to give off signals that allow cancer cells to&#xD;
      keep growing. By blocking the function of Hsp90, we hope that the cancer cell will block the&#xD;
      mutated protein and cause the cancer cells to die. This drug have been used in other research&#xD;
      studies and in the laboratory and information from those other research studies suggests that&#xD;
      thsi drug may help to treat lung cancer with ALK mutations. In this research study, we are&#xD;
      looking to see what effects IPI-504 has in patients with lung cancer who have an ALK&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;

      -  Participants will receive the study drug (IPI-504) twice weekly for two weeks followed&#xD;
           by 10 days without study treatment. This 3-week period is called a cycle. Participants&#xD;
           will receive a total of 4 doses per cycle. On the days the participant receives study&#xD;
           drug, they will come to the clinic and be given the IPI-504 by being. Participants will&#xD;
           continue to receive study drug for additional cycles as long as they are benefiting from&#xD;
           it and do not experience any severe side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have CT scans to assess the size and location of their tumor. They may&#xD;
           also have a PET scan or a combination of PET/CT scans. Imaging will be done at the&#xD;
           beginning of treatment and every five to six weeks while on study to assess how the&#xD;
           tumor is responding to IPI-504.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following tests and procedures will be done on the prior to the first dose of&#xD;
           IPI-504: physical examination, vital signs, routine blood tests, EKGs, serum or urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing potential).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the first dose of IPI-504, the following tests and procedures will be done: EKGs,&#xD;
           vital signs (pulse only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For all other visit days throughout the study, the following exams, tests and procedures&#xD;
           will be done: physical examination, vital signs, blood tests, tumor imaging assessments,&#xD;
           MRI of the brain (if applicable), review of medications and answer questions about any&#xD;
           side effects or changes in health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the final dose of study drug the following tests and procedures will be done&#xD;
           within 30 days: physical examination, ECOG Performance status, blood tests, review of&#xD;
           medications and answer questions about any side effects of changes in health.&#xD;

    <description>The response rate was defined as the number of patients achieving a RECIST 1.0 defined response divided by the number of patients treated and was to be calculated separately for each arm. A response by RECIST criteria means that the pre-defined target lesions (sum of the longest diameters) had to decrease by 30% or more and this response needed to be confirmed on a second scan at least 4 weeks later.</description>

    <description>Further document the safety of this regimen. Treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by MedDRA coding terms and separate tabulations will be produced for treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-emergent serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and treatment-emergent events of at least Grade 3 severity. A treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as an adverse event that was deemed to be related to the study intervention.</description>

        <description>The response rate was defined as the number of patients achieving a RECIST 1.0 defined response divided by the number of patients treated and was to be calculated separately for each arm. A response by RECIST criteria means that the pre-defined target lesions (sum of the longest diameters) had to decrease by 30% or more and this response needed to be confirmed on a second scan at least 4 weeks later.</description>
