  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial infections are a common complication in patients suffering from burns. These&#xD;
      infections can cause significant morbidity and often mortality. Antimicrobial resistance&#xD;
      coupled with the prevalence of burn-related infections warrants the identification of&#xD;
      alternative substances in the treatment of burn-related infections. The cranberry has been&#xD;
      examined as a potential agent in the prevention of other types of infections and it appears&#xD;
      to have anti-adherence effects on bacteria. In addition, the cranberry has demonstrated&#xD;
      general inhibitory effects against some types of bacteria suggesting that it may be a useful&#xD;
      agent in the prevention of bacterial infections in burn patients. The purpose of the present&#xD;
      study is to investigate the effect of cranberry extract on the incidence of infections in&#xD;
      burn patients.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The present study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study of the effect of taking three times daily doses of cranberry extract in capsule form on&#xD;
      the incidence of infection in burn patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. Eighty patients suffering from burns and admitted to the Saint Elizabeth&#xD;
      Regional Medical Center Burn Center, Lincoln, NE will take place in the proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria. Patients will be asked to participate in the study if the following&#xD;
      criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are admitted to the Saint Elizabeth Regional Medical Center Burn Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 19 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have an expected hospital stay of 7 days or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are able to consume oral medication capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria. Patients will not be asked to participate in the study if any of the&#xD;
      following are present:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have a known infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are not able to consume oral medication capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have any known allergies to cranberry or placebo components.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have known allergy to aspirin (cranberries may contain salicylic acid).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are taking warfarin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with known nephrolithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with renal impairment as evidenced by a creatinine clearance that is less than&#xD;
           predicted by Cockroft-Gault formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cranberry extract standardized by Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. will be placed into&#xD;
      capsules in the Saint Elizabeth Regional Medical Center pharmacy. Each cranberry capsule will&#xD;
      contain 500mg of cranberry extract. Placebo capsules will be made to look identical to&#xD;
      cranberry capsules and will also be made at the Saint Elizabeth Regional Medical Center&#xD;
      pharmacy. A staff pharmacist will separate the capsules into a cranberry extract group and a&#xD;
      placebo group. A staff pharmacist will randomly assign patients to either the cranberry&#xD;
      extract group or the placebo group. The patient, physicians, and research staff involved in&#xD;
      data collection will be blinded to patient group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. After admission to the burn unit and after the physician has deemed that the&#xD;
      patient is able to consume medication capsules orally, patients meeting all other selection&#xD;
      criteria will be asked to participate in the study. Study rationale and procedures will be&#xD;
      described to patients and informed consent will be obtained if patients indicate a&#xD;
      willingness to participate. Basic demographic data, burn/wound related information and&#xD;
      information pertaining to any other infections will be obtained. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the placebo or the cranberry group. Participants will be given&#xD;
      one capsule as soon as possible after hospital admission (or as soon as they have been deemed&#xD;
      capable of consuming medication capsules orally) and then as close as possible to 8 hours&#xD;
      after the first dose. Patients will then be placed on an 8 hour dosing schedule (i.e., one&#xD;
      capsule every 8 hours). Burn wounds will be examined for any clinical signs of infection as&#xD;
      judged by attending physician on a daily basis. The determination as to whether an infection&#xD;
      is present vs. absent will be made by a physician utilizing specific criteria. If signs of&#xD;
      infection are present, cultures of the wound site will be taken and bacterial type will be&#xD;
      recorded. After initial infection, wound sites will be observed to determine if infections&#xD;
      resolve with treatment. If treatment does not seem to eradicate the infection, another&#xD;
      bacterial culture will be taken and bacterial analysis will be performed and recorded. Data&#xD;
      pertaining to wound infection and wound appearance will be taken on a daily basis throughout&#xD;
      the duration of the patient's hospital stay. In addition, information pertaining to all&#xD;
      infections present in each patient will be recorded on a daily basis throughout the patient's&#xD;
      entire hospital stay. The determination as to whether other infections are present vs. absent&#xD;
      will be made by a physician utilizing specific criteria.&#xD;
