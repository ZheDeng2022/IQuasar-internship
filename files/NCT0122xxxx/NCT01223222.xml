  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Lytixar™ applied&#xD;
      topically to uncomplicated skin infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dose levels of Lytixar™ (1%, 2% and 5%) versus placebo will be tested.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of uncomplicated, Gram-positive, skin infection may include application of&#xD;
      antiseptics and desiccants, but most importantly topical antibiotics. Guidance on the use of&#xD;
      antimicrobial therapies has been published, poor prescribing practices still exist which&#xD;
      facilitate the development of bacterial strains resistant to available therapy. The issue of&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance is particularly important for Gram-positive cocci such as&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#xD;
      (MRSA) has been a problem for many years in the hospital setting, more recently community&#xD;
      acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has emerged posing additional challenges to physicians managing skin&#xD;
      infection. The medicinal product under development, Lytixar™, is a synthetic antimicrobial&#xD;
      peptidomimetic agent with a membrane lysing mode of action. Lytixar™ has demonstrated&#xD;
      activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. The compound&#xD;
      appears to be equally effective against antibiotic-resistant species such as methicillin&#xD;
      resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) and&#xD;
      multi-resistant Pseudomonas isolates. The novel membrane lysing mode of action may result in&#xD;
      a lower propensity to the development of resistance and to date Lytixar™ demonstrates no in&#xD;
      vitro target-specific cross-resistance with other classes of antibiotics.&#xD;
