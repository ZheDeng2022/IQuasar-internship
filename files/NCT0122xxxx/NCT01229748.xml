      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial with five aims: 1. To investigate the&#xD;
      engagement potential and effectiveness of a family-centered intervention (MDFT) and Family&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing Intervention (FMII)/group for teens with alcohol-related crises; 2.&#xD;
      To explore differential treatment effects with comorbid adolescents; 3. To examine the role&#xD;
      of motivation and family factors as treatment mediators; 4. To examine long-term abstinence,&#xD;
      patterns and predictors of relapse up to 18 months follow-up; and 5. To compare the total and&#xD;
      net monetary benefits to society of MDFT, FMII/group, and standard care.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To investigate in a randomized controlled trial the engagement potential and&#xD;
      effectiveness of family-centered intervention (MDFT) and family-involved MI (FMII) for teens&#xD;
      with alcohol problems&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1a: Treatment engagement will be higher in MDFT and FMII than in standard&#xD;
           care as evidenced by higher numbers of MDFT and FMII youth enrolled in substance abuse&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1b: Treatment completion will be higher for MDFT than FMII/group and standard&#xD;
           care as evidenced by more teens/families in MDFT completing a full course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1c: Youth assigned to MDFT and FMII/group will show greater decreases in&#xD;
           alcohol use and binge drinking than youth in standard care at the 3 month follow-up (end&#xD;
           of treatment). MDFT participants will show greater decreases in alcohol use and binge&#xD;
           drinking than FMII/group and standard care during the post-treatment period and up to 18&#xD;
           month follow-up, and they will be less likely to meet diagnostic criteria for an AUD at&#xD;
           18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1d: Youth assigned to MDFT and FMII/group will show greater reductions than&#xD;
           youth in standard care in problems related to alcohol use, including drug use, drinking&#xD;
           and driving, alcohol-related injury, health and mental health problems, school problems,&#xD;
           delinquency, and association with substance abusing peers at the 3 month follow-up (end&#xD;
           of treatment). Youth in MDFT will show greater reductions in these problems than&#xD;
           FMII/group and standard care in the post-treatment period and up to 18 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To explore differential treatment effects with comorbid adolescents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: For youth with low baseline levels of alcohol, drug, and psychiatric&#xD;
           problems, MDFT and FMII/group will both be more effective than standard care. MDFT will&#xD;
           reduce alcohol use more significantly than FMII/group for teens with more severe&#xD;
           baseline alcohol, drug, and psychiatric problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To examine the contribution of motivation and family factors as mediators of treatment&#xD;
      effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3a: In both MDFT and FMII/group, motivation to change at the end of the&#xD;
           initial engagement sessions in both teen and parent will predict treatment participation&#xD;
           and 3 month outcomes (end of treatment) to a greater extent than motivation in the teen&#xD;
           or parent alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3b: In both MDFT and FMII/group, effective parenting practices and strong&#xD;
           family relationships will predict better alcohol and related outcomes at 3 month&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To examine long-term abstinence, patterns and predictors of relapse up to 18 months&#xD;
      follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 4a: Four distinct patterns of relapse will emerge between 3 month and 18&#xD;
           month follow-up: high abstinence, low abstinence, decreasing abstinence, and increasing&#xD;
           abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 4b: MDFT youth will be more likely to be in the high abstinence and&#xD;
           increasing abstinence groups; youth in FMII/group will be more likely to be in the&#xD;
           decreasing abstinence group; and youth in standard care will be more likely to be in the&#xD;
           low abstinence group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 4c: Youth in MDFT will show more significant reductions in risk factors for&#xD;
           alcohol relapse (family dysfunction, lack of abstinence motivation, positive alcohol&#xD;
           expectancies, poor abstinence coping, lack of support for abstinence) than youth in&#xD;
           FMII/group or standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: To compare the total/net monetary benefits to society of MDFT, FMII/group, and&#xD;
      standard care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 5: MDFT and FMII/group will generate significantly higher total and net&#xD;
           monetary benefits to society than youth in standard care at 18 months post-ER visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research Question 5: Will MDFT or FMII/group generate higher total/net benefits to&#xD;
           society?&#xD;
