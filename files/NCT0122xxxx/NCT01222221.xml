      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response&#xD;
      to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving vaccine&#xD;
      therapy together with temozolomide and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy when given&#xD;
      together with temozolomide and radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine&#xD;
           IMA950 plus sargramostim (GM-CSF) in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
           comprising temozolomide and radiotherapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide in patients&#xD;
           with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the immunogenicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the anti-tumor effect of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of pre-treatment levels of regulatory T-cells on the&#xD;
           immunogenicity of this regimen in these patients. (Exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the potential effect of steroid dose on the immunological response to&#xD;
           glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 plus GM-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the level of O6-methyl-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation in&#xD;
           tumor tissue and any potential association with any observed anti-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the kinetics of the observed immunogenicity of glioblastoma multiform&#xD;
           multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 plus GM-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the possible biomarker signatures that may predict immunological response to&#xD;
           glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 plus GM-CSF. (Exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the possible effects of this regimen on any observed pseudo-progression and&#xD;
           pseudo-regression in these patients. (exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are recruited to cohort 1 or 2 with priority&#xD;
      recruitment to cohort 1. All patients undergo standard chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      temozolomide as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard therapy (chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant temozolomide): Beginning after surgery,&#xD;
           patients receive chemoradiotherapy comprising oral temozolomide daily for 6 weeks and&#xD;
           radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Beginning 35 days after completion&#xD;
           of radiotherapy, patients receive adjuvant oral temozolomide alone on days 1-5.&#xD;
           Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days for 6 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccine therapy: Patients also receive vaccine therapy beginning at one of two time&#xD;
           points. Patients are recruited into 1 of 2 cohorts that differ in the timing of the&#xD;
           vaccination schedule in relation to a patient's standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 1: Vaccination begins 7-14 days prior to chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Induction phase: Patients receive the first 6 doses of sargramostim&#xD;
                     intradermally (ID) followed by glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine&#xD;
                     IMA950 ID on days 1, 2, 3, 8, 15, and 22 in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
                     or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Maintenance phase: Patients receive sargramostim followed by glioblastoma&#xD;
                     multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 ID on days 50 and 78 and then on day 21&#xD;
                     of each adjuvant temozolomide course, beginning in course 1, for 3 courses in&#xD;
                     the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 2: Vaccination begins at least 7 days after chemoradiotherapy and 28 days&#xD;
                prior to adjuvant temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Induction phase: Patients receive the first 6 doses of sargramostim followed&#xD;
                     by glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 ID as in cohort 1&#xD;
                     induction phase, beginning at a different time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Maintenance phase: Patients receive sargramostim followed by glioblastoma&#xD;
                     multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 ID on day 21 of each adjuvant&#xD;
                     temozolomide course, beginning in course 1, for 5 courses in the absence of&#xD;
                     disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacodynamic, biomarker, and immunologic&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 41 weeks.&#xD;
