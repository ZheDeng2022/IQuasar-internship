  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAD/CAM technology has been introduced to the field of implant dentistry in the beginning of&#xD;
      1990's (Priest 2005). Since their introduction, the use of CAD/CAM technology in the&#xD;
      production of dental implant restorations has been rapidly expanding. However, little&#xD;
      evidence is currently present supporting its clinical viability (Henriksson 2003, Canullo&#xD;
      2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the suggested prospective randomized study includes bone level placed Straumann&#xD;
      implants restored with transmucosal elements and crowns fabricated using either CAD/CAM&#xD;
      &quot;Etkon&quot; technology (Zirconia abutment and ceramic crown) or a conventional technique&#xD;
      (Crossfit titanium abutment and a ceramometal crown).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to examine single-tooth implant&#xD;
      restorations in the esthetic zone. An esthetic area is defined as any area that is visible in&#xD;
      the patient's full smile. [3rd ITI consensus conference 2004] The rehabilitations will be&#xD;
      fabricated using two different techniques. Zirconia CAD/CAM (ZCC) implant restorations&#xD;
      (tests) will be compared to Titanium conventionally-fabricated (TCF) implant restorations&#xD;
      (controls) using, reproducible esthetic (objective/subjective) and biologic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This in vivo study is a randomized study with two groups of 15 patients with one implant each&#xD;
      for a total of 30 patients and 30 implants. The implants will be examined for successful&#xD;
      tissue integration according to the criteria of success (Buser et al. 1990) at every recall&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the following parameters will be evaluated for each restoration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Esthetic: A. Objective: PES/WES Score (Belser et al. 2009) from 1:1 digital photograph,&#xD;
           study casts, and spectrophotometric measurements, and B. Subjective: VAS questionnaire&#xD;
           for patients and VAS questionnaire from experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biologic (mPI, mB, simplified GI, microbial sample, periapical radiograph for DIB, and&#xD;
           width of keratinized facial mucosa)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, an evaluation of the mechanical, biologic and technical complications will be&#xD;
      performed at every recall visit. Mechanical complications would be defined as those&#xD;
      complications that involve the prosthesis such as abutment screw loosening, fracture of the&#xD;
      veneer material, fracture of the crown framework, abutment screw fractures, and implant&#xD;
      fractures. The category of biologic complications will include those complications that&#xD;
      involve the soft tissues (e.g., fistula, suppuration, bleeding, gingival inflammation, and&#xD;
      soft tissue dehiscence). Technical complications are defined as those related to restorative&#xD;
      components and crowns (e.g. crown emergence profile, abutment and crown fit, screw loosening,&#xD;
      ceramic fracture).&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term prospective studies demonstrate a high success rate of Straumann implants in&#xD;
      partially or fully edentulous patients both with early and conventional loading (Salvi et al.&#xD;
      2004, Lambrecht et al. 2003, Cochran et al. 2002, Weber et al. 2000, Buser et al. 1997).&#xD;
      Before the introduction of CAD/CAM technology to the field of implant dentistry in the&#xD;
      beginning of 1990's (Priest 2005), the available approach for restoring single dental&#xD;
      implants was either with stock or cast custom abutments and a ceramo-metal crowns. In spite&#xD;
      of the satisfactory results that this conventional treatment approach has achieved, several&#xD;
      disadvantages have been recognized. First, non tooth-colored abutments possess the problem of&#xD;
      bluish appearance of overlying tissue in cases of thin gingival biotype (Barclay et al. 1996,&#xD;
      Prestipino and Ingber, 1996). Second, with stock abutments ideal emergence profile can not be&#xD;
      achieved (Daftary 1997), a disadvantage that was reduced with the use of custom abutments.&#xD;
      However, custom abutments present other disadvantages including possible imprecision of fit&#xD;
      due to inaccuracies associated with impression, waxing, investing and casting procedures and&#xD;
      the negative effect of the gold alloy on the peri-implant mucosal barrier as demonstrated by&#xD;
      Abrahamsson in 1998 (Abrahamsson et al 1998 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of CAD/CAM technology to implant dentistry was meant to provide higher&#xD;
      quality restorations. Since its introduction, the use of this technology in the production of&#xD;
      implant ceramic frameworks and crowns especially in esthetic regions has been rapidly&#xD;
      expanding because of the promising esthetic, biologic, and mechanical properties. Alumina as&#xD;
      well as Zirconia abutments are characterized by good tissue compatibility (Abrahamsson et al.&#xD;
      1998). In a study by Barclay et al in 1996 it was found that plaque accumulation scores for&#xD;
      ceramic-coated transmucosal elements were significantly lower than those recorded in titanium&#xD;
      transmucosal elements (Barclay et al. 1996). These results suggest that the further&#xD;
      development of a ceramic implant transmucosal collar may assist plaque control at the soft&#xD;
      tissue-implant interface and may favorably influence the tissues in this region (Barclay et&#xD;
      al. 1996). Other studies documented no significant differences in plaque accumulation and&#xD;
      microbial colonization between titanium and ceramic abutment samples (Andersson et al. 2003,&#xD;
      Rasperini et al. 1998). The bacterial colonization of Zirconia ceramic surfaces was recently&#xD;
      studied in vitro and in vivo (Rimondini et al. 2002). The authors found that, overall,&#xD;
      Zirconia ceramic surfaces developed for implant abutments accumulate fewer bacteria than&#xD;
      commercially pure titanium, and may therefore be considered as a promising material for&#xD;
      abutment manufacturing (Rimondini et al. 2002). A comparison of the recorded superficial soft&#xD;
      tissue responses to titanium and ceramic surfaces of transmucosal elements of implants&#xD;
      revealed no significant differences between both groups (Barclay et al. 1996, Andersson et&#xD;
      al. 2001). Almost no marginal bone loss was recorded, indicating a stable bone situation both&#xD;
      at ceramic and titatium abutments on single-tooth implants (Andersson et al. 2001). However,&#xD;
      it seems to be that the peri-implant soft tissues adjacent to titanium and ceramic surfaces&#xD;
      may differ in features that are not apparent when routine clinical parameters are used&#xD;
      (Barclay et al. 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of their specific mechanical properties, all-ceramic restorations demonstrate a lower&#xD;
      fracture resistance than ceramic restorations supported by metal substructures. The ceramic&#xD;
      abutments on implants are more sensitive to fracture and to handling procedures than the&#xD;
      titanium abutments (Andersson et al. 2001). However, advances have been made in the&#xD;
      fabrication of high-strength all-ceramic abutments for anterior implants (Yildirim et al.&#xD;
      2003). The hardness of the Zirconium ceramic also allows it to undergo conventional&#xD;
      prophylaxis with ultrasonic scalers without alteration of its surface quality of abutment&#xD;
      (Marzouk, 1996). Moreover, Zirconia has a flexural strength and fracture toughness almost&#xD;
      twice as high as alumina (Glauser et al. 2004, Yildirim et al. 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently very limited number of clinical studies is present supporting the clinical&#xD;
      viability of CAD/CAM ceramic restorations (Henriksson 2003, Canullo 2007) and no reports were&#xD;
      found on the performance of CAD/CAM ceramic implant restorations in comparison to&#xD;
      conventional implant restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to examine single-tooth implant&#xD;
      abutments and restorations in the esthetic zone. Restorations will be fabricated using two&#xD;
      different techniques. Zirconia CAD/CAM (ZCC) implant abutments and restorations will be&#xD;
      compared to conventional, prefabricated Titanium (TCF) implant abutments and&#xD;
      porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations using reproducible aesthetic (objective/subjective) and&#xD;
      biologic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this investigation is that ZCC implant abutments/restorations (test group)&#xD;
      will achieve better biologic and esthetic outcomes when compared with TCF types (control&#xD;
      group). The null hypothesis is defined as follows: ZCC implant abutments/restorations and TCF&#xD;
      implant restorations are indistinguishable when biologic and esthetic outcomes are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAD/CAM technology has been involved in the fabrication of dental abutments and restoration&#xD;
      for the purpose of improving the biologic and esthetic results. This assumption has been&#xD;
      formulated primarily from subjective interpretations as objective assessments from randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials are sparse at best. This study will be significant for clinical dentistry&#xD;
      in that it will create evidence on the clinical long-term performance of Zirconium CAD/CAM&#xD;
      abutments and ceramic crowns compared to stock titanium abutments and&#xD;
      porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations using subjective and objective evaluation parameters&#xD;
      that will be statistically compared.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Subject population Patients will be recruited from the patient pool of the Teaching and&#xD;
      Faculty Practice at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. A 12-month period will be allowed&#xD;
      to enroll the patients in this study. The mean treatment outcome will be compared between the&#xD;
      two randomized patient groups, allowing for detection of the smallest clinically important&#xD;
      differences between these means (TheSealedEnvelope™- http://www.thesealedenvelope.com/&#xD;
      power.php).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient entry (informed consent, patient registration, randomization and blinding) An&#xD;
      informed consent approved by the Harvard Medical School/Harvard School of Dental Medicine&#xD;
      Committee on Human Studies will be obtained for all subjects to be entered in this study. Its&#xD;
      conduct will adhere to the principles outlined by the Office for Research Subject Protection&#xD;
      of the Harvard Medical School / Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Each subject will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the two treatment options. A random permuted block approach will&#xD;
      be used to allocate patients into one of the treatment groups. A sealed envelope containing&#xD;
      the treatment group (control or test group) will be assigned to each patient. Subsequently&#xD;
      and according to the assigned treatment, a ZCC restoration (test group) or a TCF ceramo-metal&#xD;
      (control group) will be fabricated and delivered to the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjective evaluation the trial design will be on a double blinding level, which means&#xD;
      that neither patients nor expert clinicians will know which treatment the patients are&#xD;
      randomized to. This can be achieved by concealing allocation information from patients and by&#xD;
      using expert clinicians, who are otherwise not involved in the patients' care, to assess&#xD;
      treatment difficulties and outcomes without knowing their treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients will be randomly allocated to control or test group presented in Table (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (n= 30 patients) Implant Abutment Crown Loading Test group (n=15) ZCC BL Straumann&#xD;
      Etkon Zirconia Cement-retained Etkon Zirconia 6-8 weeks control group (n=15) TCF BL Straumann&#xD;
      Crossfit titanium Cement-retained PFM 6-8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Parameters and time schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for esthetic (objective and subjective parameters) and biologic&#xD;
      parameters as well as the success criteria through out the study period. The baseline&#xD;
      measurements are defined as the measurements taken during the healing period after insertion&#xD;
      of bone level implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the healing period, after insertion of a Straumann Bone Level implant following&#xD;
      standard surgical procedures, patients will use removable provisional prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implants will be examined for successful tissue integration according to the criteria of&#xD;
      success (Buser et al. 1990) at every recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria of success:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Absence of persistent subjective complaints, such as pain, foreign body sensation and/or&#xD;
           dysaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Absence of a recurrent peri-implant infection with suppuration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Absence of mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Absence of a continuous radiolucency around the implant&#xD;

      Esthetic parameters :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardized intra-oral digital photograph (1:1 magnification) An intra-oral photograph&#xD;
           will be taken, positioning the plane of the camera body parallel to the vestibular face&#xD;
           of the teeth adjacent to the single edentulous gap. (Figure 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Papilla Height: Distance between the mesial and distal papilla and the zenith of the&#xD;
           mid-facial gingival margin of the adjacent teeth The distance from the most coronal part&#xD;
           of the mesial and distal papillae to the zenith of adjacent teeth, will be measured from&#xD;
           study casts and digital photographs. (Figure 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Buccal gingival margin measurement: Distance between the mid-facial gingival margin and&#xD;
           the incisal edge of adjacent teeth The distance from the zenith of adjacent teeth to the&#xD;
           most coronal part of the incisal edge, will be measured from study casts and digital&#xD;
           photographs. This measurement will serve to determine the buccal gingival&#xD;
           recession/growth when compared with further measurements. It will be recorded as &quot;0&quot; at&#xD;
           baseline. (Figure 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study cast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spectrophotometer recording at adjacent teeth. A spectrophotometer (Crystaleye, Olympus,&#xD;
           Japan) will be used to select and digitally record the shade for each adjacent tooth.&#xD;
           The sterilizable adapter of the spectrophotometer's intra-oral camera will be positioned&#xD;
           on the alveolar process over the respective adjacent tooth. Once the resulting video&#xD;
           image of the tooth is centered in an orthoradial way in the measuring square depicted on&#xD;
           the computer screen, the spectrophotometric data will be recorded three consecutive&#xD;
           times for each tooth. This data will be later compared with records obtained from final&#xD;
           crowns by repeating the spectrophotometer measurement over the control and test group&#xD;
           restorations. (Figure 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Buccal periimplant mucosa margin: Distance between mid-facial gingival margin and&#xD;
           incisal edge of the implant restoration At implant crown insertion, the distance from&#xD;
           the zenith of the implant restoration to the most coronal part of the incisal edge will&#xD;
           be measured from study casts and digital photographs. This measurement will serve to&#xD;
           determine the buccal gingival recession/growth when compared with further measurements.&#xD;
           It will be recorded as &quot;0&quot; at the implant crown insertion. (Figure 5)&#xD;

           periodontal probe is passed a long the gingival margin adjacent to the implant; 1:&#xD;
           Isolated bleeding spots visible; 2: Blood forms a confluent red line on margin; 3: Heavy&#xD;
           or profuse bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. simplified GI Simplified Gingival Index (Apse et al. 1991): 0: Normal mucosa; 1: Minimal&#xD;
           inflammation with color change and minor edema; 2: Moderate inflammation with redness,&#xD;
           edema and glazing; 3: Severe inflammation wit redness, edema, ulceration and spontaneous&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Microbiological sample Microbial samples from a tooth in the same sextant as the implant&#xD;
           and from the implant healing cap prior to its initial removal at the start of the&#xD;
           restorative procedures will be obtained. Additional samples will be taken at 1month, 6,&#xD;
           12, 36 and 60 months after the insertion of the restoration. The samples will be&#xD;
           analysed for P. gingivalis, T. forsythia (B. forsythus) T..denticola, .F. nucleatum, P.&#xD;
           micra (P. micros) P. nigrescens, P. intermedia, C. rectus, C. gracilis, E. nodatum and&#xD;
           S. constellatus. (Quirynen et al. 2002, Keller et al. 1998, Conrad et al. 1996). Sample&#xD;
           analysis will be performed at the Forsyth Institute, Boston, MA, on a contractual basis.&#xD;
           Samples will be identified only by their number for this purpose. No patient identifying&#xD;
           data will be revealed. The correlation between the periimplant microflora before and&#xD;
           after loading within the same subject as well as potential differences in quantity and&#xD;
           composition of the microflora of ZCC and TCF implant abutments and restorations will be&#xD;
           analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Standardized periapical radiograph to assess DIB values. Standardized peri-apical long&#xD;
           cone parallel radiographs of the implant (Harris et al. 2002) will be taken. For&#xD;
           standardization of radiographs, a film holder will be attached to a custom-made bite&#xD;
           splint. This same device will be used during the whole study for radiographic records.&#xD;
           From these radiographs, bone resorption will be measured as distance from the implant&#xD;
           shoulder to first bone-to-implant contact (DIB). (Figure 6)&#xD;

      and technical complications will be performed at every recall visit. Mechanical complications&#xD;
      would be defined as all those complications that involve the prosthesis such as abutment&#xD;
      screw loosening, fracture of the veneer material, fracture of the crown framework, abutment&#xD;
      screw fractures, and implant fractures. The category of biologic complications will include&#xD;
      the complications that involve the soft tissues ex. fistulas, suppuration, bleeding, gingival&#xD;
      inflammation, and soft tissue dehiscence. Technical complications would be defined as those&#xD;
      complications that are related to lab procedures and fabricating techniques ex. abutment and&#xD;
      crown emergence profile, abutment and crown fit.&#xD;

      Statistical Analysis: After data collection and completion of the investigation, a one-way&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare the mean values of all objective and&#xD;
      subjective parameters. Their variance will be broken down into two components: (a) &quot;between&#xD;
      groups&quot; component (control group vs. test group) at baseline, crown insertion, and each&#xD;
      follow-up period and (b) &quot;within group&quot; component at baseline, crown insertion, and each&#xD;
      follow-up period. A multiple LSD range test (confidence level 95%) will be applied to&#xD;
      determine which means differ statistically from each other.&#xD;
