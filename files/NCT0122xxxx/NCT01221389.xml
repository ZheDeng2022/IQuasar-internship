      Information on the management of casualties from the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and&#xD;
      Iraq has brought in to question the traditional approach to blood transfusion in hemorrhaging&#xD;
      patients. Present recommendations for when to transfuse plasma products is when coagulation&#xD;
      tests become abnormal. The proposed trial will investigate whether the more aggressive plasma&#xD;
      transfusion strategies as advocated from researchers based on the Central Asian conflicts is&#xD;
      valid. Since a study to determine the full impact of an altered plasma transfusion practice&#xD;
      would require thousands of patients, a feasibility trial is appropriate and is being&#xD;
      proposed. The hypotheses are thus:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis- A multicentre trial that investigates the earlier use of plasma in&#xD;
      patients with hemorrhagic shock going for emergency surgery will be feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses- The early use of a universal donor blood plasma (AB+ plasma) in&#xD;
      patients with shock due to blood loss (i.e. hemorrhagic) going for emergency surgery will&#xD;
      reduce overall exposure to the total number of blood donor products (so-called allogeneic&#xD;
      blood exposure). A reduction in allogeneic blood exposure would then reduce the total number&#xD;
      of blood transfusion-related complications. The early use of this plasma product is safe and&#xD;
      will not increase the incidence of blood clotting or other transfusion-related complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Investigations that have arisen from reviews of casualty management in the ongoing conflicts&#xD;
      in Afghanistan and Iraq have challenged the standard approach to blood transfusion in&#xD;
      hemorrhaging patients. Present recommendations are to ideally transfuse non-red blood cell&#xD;
      blood products as indicated by coagulation and other blood tests. In the event that testing&#xD;
      is not available or feasible, then clinical judgment is advised with two recommendations. The&#xD;
      first is that platelets are usually required after red blood cell (RBC) transfusions of one&#xD;
      blood volume (approximately 5 liters of blood loss); and the second is that plasma is not&#xD;
      usually required until RBC transfusion of well over one blood volume. Contrary to these&#xD;
      recommendations is evidence from these conflicts indicating that delays in plasma transfusion&#xD;
      or reduced plasma dosing are associated with increased mortality. Although the evidence is&#xD;
      primarily retrospective and at times circumstantial in nature, the relationship between&#xD;
      plasma administration and mortality appears to be causation rather than simple association.&#xD;
      Matching of injury severity and other important variables does not alter this conclusion. If&#xD;
      this conclusion is true, the question becomes whether or not the transfusion practice of&#xD;
      patients in a civilian setting should be changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present plasma transfusion recommendations were largely based on studies of plasma&#xD;
      exchange patients and the use of data from the 1970's. In plasma exchange, patients have a&#xD;
      controlled removal of their plasma that is ultimately replaced with donor plasma.&#xD;
      Coagulopathy develops solely from the amount of plasma removal since no consumption of&#xD;
      factors exists. Hemorrhaging patients however lose coagulation factors both in shed blood and&#xD;
      due to ongoing consumption at sites of injury. Further, the hemodynamic instability and&#xD;
      hypovolemia experienced by hemorrhaging patients further exacerbates the reduction in&#xD;
      clotting factor levels. Prior to the late 1980's, hemorrhaging patients often received whole&#xD;
      blood transfusions. Whole blood, no longer used in most circumstances, contains approximately&#xD;
      1 unit of plasma in each unit. Thus, patients receiving whole blood will not develop a&#xD;
      coagulopathy as quickly as patients who receive the now standard packed red blood cell units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a lack of prospective studies and significant limitations of the supporting evidence,&#xD;
      the practice of waiting to administer plasma was rapidly adopted. Reasons for this were&#xD;
      several but included concerns about infectious transmissions, shortage of blood products and&#xD;
      the financial costs of the blood products. Regardless of the reasons for their development&#xD;
      however, the present transfusion recommendations including those for plasma may no longer be&#xD;
      applicable in all circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A strong argument against waiting for the coagulopathy to develop before treating is that the&#xD;
      consequences of the coagulopathy are so grave that they should be avoided. The coagulopathy&#xD;
      of hemorrhagic shock is a major component of the 'lethal triad' seen in hemorrhaging patients&#xD;
      (in conjunction with acidosis and hypothermia). The lethal triad has a very high mortality&#xD;
      rate (over 70%) with limited ability of physicians to treat it. Evidence supporting this&#xD;
      argument has primarily come from the conflicts in Central Asia. Several retrospective studies&#xD;
      have been published by the US Army Institute of Surgical Research that have not only&#xD;
      challenged this practice but have resulted in changes in how the US armed forces manage&#xD;
      trauma patients. The US military now uses plasma in a 1:1 ratio in their traumatized soldiers&#xD;
      (i.e. 1 unit of plasma given for every unit of packed RBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major hemorrhagic injuries in non-military situations consist primarily of traumatic injuries&#xD;
      and major blood vessel (i.e. vascular) injuries. Although all of these injuries or problems&#xD;
      are not exactly the same as military casualties, there are major commonalities between these&#xD;
      population groups that allow the results of the military studies to be applicable to these&#xD;
      civilian populations. Retrospective and case-control trials in non-military trauma and in&#xD;
      ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) offer indirect evidence to support a different&#xD;
      plasma transfusion practice that is more akin to the military recommendations. Computer&#xD;
      simulations to model massive blood transfusion scenarios also gives credence to the premise&#xD;
      that traditional transfusion practice is incorrect for actively hemorrhaging patients and&#xD;
      advocates the earlier use of plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective chart review of 5 years of the perioperative management of Priority 1 AAA&#xD;
      ruptures at The Ottawa Hospital was conducted with research ethics board approval. Of 145&#xD;
      reviewed cases, there was a 64% survival rate. The use of plasma occurred in over 75% of&#xD;
      patients and over 99% of patients were exposed to allogeneic blood products. Plasma use was&#xD;
      associated with poor outcomes and served as a marker for cases with higher blood loss and&#xD;
      blood product exposure. The use of plasma was however consistent with the present&#xD;
      recommendations and thus appeared to be reactive in nature, rather than proactive use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A definitive trial that assesses the role of early plasma has not been performed.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, a study to determine the full impact of an altered plasma transfusion practice&#xD;
      would require thousands of patients. The emergency nature of these surgical patients would&#xD;
      also make the ability to randomize patients challenging. The goal of the present trial will&#xD;
      therefore be to assess the feasibility of such a trial. We need to assess the ability to&#xD;
      randomize patients, to prepare plasma and deliver it in a timely fashion. Further, the&#xD;
      logistics of having physicians to administer the study fluid (i.e. plasma or colloid control)&#xD;
      in a timely fashion will be determined. Finally, the ability to accurately measure outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
