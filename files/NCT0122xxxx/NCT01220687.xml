  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study hopes to determine whether nitric oxide along with oxygen during the first 20&#xD;
      minutes of life in infants needing help with breathing will reduce the percentage and total&#xD;
      exposure to oxygen during that time frame. Although the use of oxygen in management of&#xD;
      breathing is an important part of supporting baby immediately after delivery, there is more&#xD;
      evidence that too much exposure to oxygen may lead to potential problems for your baby later.&#xD;
      Oxygen exposure can be harmful to premature babies developing lungs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines suggest the use of supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen up to fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0 during neonatal resuscitation for both term&#xD;
      and preterm newborns. Exposure to supplemental oxygen in preterm babies has been shown to&#xD;
      have significant toxicity. Even minimal exposure in the first hours of life has been shown to&#xD;
      be associated with morbidity including later onset of cancer. The transition from fetal&#xD;
      circulation to neonatal circulation is a complex process requiring lung inflation and&#xD;
      decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance. Endogenous nitric oxide, along with oxygen, plays&#xD;
      a major role in facilitating this transition by decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance. It&#xD;
      is not known whether exogenous nitric oxide would facilitate this transition. In this study,&#xD;
      we propose a novel approach to resuscitation of preterm infants where inhaled nitric oxide&#xD;
      (iNO) will be used as an adjunct to oxygen with the primary goal of reducing supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen exposure. This study is designed to be a double-blind, randomized, -placebo-&#xD;
      controlled pilot trial with strict monitoring of parameters during transition in the delivery&#xD;
      room.&#xD;
