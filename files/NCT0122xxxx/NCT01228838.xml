      This study is a 12-week multicenter randomized, double-blind, controlled evaluation of the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of NGX-1998 for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia&#xD;
      (PHN). Eligible subjects will have pain from PHN, with average numeric pain rating scale&#xD;
      (NPRS) scores during screening of 4 to 9 (inclusive). Painful areas of up to 1500 cm2 will be&#xD;
      treated during a single Test Article application. Subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive NGX-1998 (10% or 20% w/w) or placebo according to an unequal allocation scheme of&#xD;
      2:2:1. Subjects will also be stratified by gender.&#xD;
