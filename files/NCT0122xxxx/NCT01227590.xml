    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to evaluate whether African potato, an herbal medicine, can be&#xD;
      used together with anti-HIV medicines without affecting the amounts of the anti-HIV medicines&#xD;
      in the blood. African potato is an African herbal medicine widely used in Africa,&#xD;
      particularly sub-Saharan Africa. Although it has not been proven, it is believed to help&#xD;
      boost the immune system. Similar studies have been done on herbal medicines especially those&#xD;
      that are used in developing countries. In some cases, the herbal treatments can affect the&#xD;
      blood levels of other medicines when the medicines are used together. This study will measure&#xD;
      the effect of African potato on lopinavir/ritonavir (KaletraÂ®), a common anti-HIV medicine.&#xD;
      Lopinavir/ritonavir is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The&#xD;
      information obtained from this study will tell us if African potato and anti-HIV treatments&#xD;
      can be used together to treat HIV infected patients in Africa and other resource poor&#xD;
      regions.&#xD;

    <measure>Pharmacokinetic drug interaction study to evaluate the effects of African potato(hypoxis obtusa) on the PK of lopinavir/ritonavir.</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>The study is to evaluate the effects of African Potato (hypoxis obtusa) on the steady state PK of lopinavir/ritonavir by measurement of the PK parameters of LPV/r in presence and absence of AP in healthy volunteers. The baseline PK of LPV/r will be established after 14 days of taking LPV/r at a dose of 400/100 mg twice daily. This will be followed by a 7 day course of LPV/r and hypoxoside (15 mg/kg/day) together. PK analysis of LPV/r will be repeated following the 7 days of co-administration. Each subject will act as their own control.</description>
