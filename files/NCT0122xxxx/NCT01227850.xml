      Background and study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refeeding syndrome is a dangerous condition which could arise if patients who have had little&#xD;
      or no food for many days, are started on any form of feeding. The metabolic consequences of&#xD;
      this condition could affect the heart, lungs and nervous system of the patient and cause&#xD;
      serious imbalance in the level of salts in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The available guidelines for predicting that refeeding syndrome may occur are very subjective&#xD;
      since they depend mainly on a history which is sometimes difficult to obtain from the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main biochemical landmark that refeeding syndrome has occurred is a fall in the phosphate&#xD;
      levels once feeding has been started. There are currently no biochemical markers that can&#xD;
      identify patients at risk of developing refeeding syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leptin and IGF1 are hormones which have been observed to go down if someone has had little or&#xD;
      no food for a while. The investigators therefore hypothesized that using a combination of&#xD;
      leptin and IGF1 values in a 'Refeeding Index' would make the latter a useful biochemical&#xD;
      marker to predict that refeeding may occur, hence take the precautionary measures to avoid&#xD;
      its occurrence before starting feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Thirty five consecutive patients referred for commencement of parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      (PN) were included. Serum leptin and IGF1 were measured prior to starting PN. Electrolytes,&#xD;
      liver and renal function tests were measured before and daily for one week after initiating&#xD;
      PN. The primary outcome was a decrease in phosphate on day two or three after initiating PN.&#xD;
      A 'Refeeding Index' (RI) was defined as leptin x IGF1 divided by 2800 to produce a ratio of&#xD;
      1.0 in patients who are well nourished.&#xD;

        Patients referred to our department at King's College Hospital, for commencement of&#xD;
        parenteral nutrition (PN).These included all ages above 18 and both sexes. Consent to&#xD;
        commence PN was taken from the patients prior to starting it. Daily bloods were taken for&#xD;
        routine laboratory analysis as part of the usual patient care.&#xD;
