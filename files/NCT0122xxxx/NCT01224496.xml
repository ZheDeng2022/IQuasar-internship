      The purpose of this study is to study the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) on&#xD;
      anaemic and cytopenic haematological disorders including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),&#xD;
      aplastic anaemia (AA), myelofibrosis (MF) and thalassemia intermedia who do not have or did&#xD;
      not respond to available treatment options.&#xD;

    <description>The following parameters will be monitored serially&#xD;
symptoms : ie reflection of any subjective symptoms that may be due to the treatment&#xD;
Serial biochemistry ( urea, electrolyte, creatinine, liver function test ) will be done at baseline, one week into the study and then every 7-8 weekly till end of the 6 months. This will monitor for any organ toxicity</description>

    <description>Patients must have a marrow study to confirm diagnosis of MDS, AA or MF. MDS is classified according to the WHO criteria and scored according to IPSS. The AA group is further classified into AA, SAA or VSAA . MF is defined by the Italian criteria and risk stratified by the Lilles Scoring system. Diagnosis of thal intermedia and major is based on previously done Hb electrophoresis and severity of disease is assessed by degree of anaemia.and frequency of blood transfusions&#xD;
TCM diagnosis: Syndrome differentiation according to TCM theory will be assessed as a baseline by experienced TCM collaborators and classified into one of the few defined syndromes as follows&#xD;
Yin deficiency of spleen and kidney&#xD;
Yang deficiency of spleen and kidney&#xD;
Deficiency of both Yin and Yang&#xD;
Stagnation of dampness and poison in the blood&#xD;
Excessive heat and poison</description>
