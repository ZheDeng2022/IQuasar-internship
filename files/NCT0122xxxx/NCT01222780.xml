  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marqibo(Registered Trademark) is a new anticancer drug. It combines Vincristine sulfate,&#xD;
           which is a widely used anticancer drug, and packages it into a tiny fat bubble known as&#xD;
           a liposome. The goal of this is to improve the drug's ability to destroy cancer cells&#xD;
           and help reduce the potential side effects of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vincristine sulfate was originally developed from chemicals found in the periwinkle&#xD;
           plant and acts against multiple types of malignant cancer. It is approved for multiple&#xD;
           cancer types including solid tumors and blood cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research has shown that Marqibo(Registered Trademark) is able to slow or stop the growth&#xD;
           of cancer cells in some adults, both alone and in combination with other chemotherapy&#xD;
           drugs, but more research is needed to determine its use in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There has been one previous small study of Marqibo(Registered Trademark) in children.&#xD;
           Although some anti-cancer activity was seen, side effects and optimal dosing were not&#xD;
           fully determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As is seen with standard Vincristine suflate, the most common side effect of&#xD;
           Marqibo(Registered Trademark) involves the nervous system. It can cause numbness and&#xD;
           tingling in the hands and feet. Symptoms commonly improve when the drug is discontinued&#xD;
           or the dose is lowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the safety and efficacy of Marqibo as a treatment for children who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with certain types of malignant cancer that has not responded to standard&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and adolescents between 2 and 21 years of age who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
           certain types of malignant cancer that has not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These cancer types include solids tumors, primary brain tumors, leukemias, and&#xD;
           lymphomas.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vincristine sulfate is a widely used antineoplastic agent of the alkaloid class of drugs&#xD;
           derived from the periwinkle plant (Vinca rosea Linn.). It has activity against a wide&#xD;
           number of malignancies. It is a cell-cycle-specific agent that arrests cell growth in&#xD;
           the M-phase (metaphase) by binding specifically with tubulin and disrupting cell&#xD;
           division. Its dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is virtually always neurological.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigations over the past two decades have demonstrated that liposomal drug carriers&#xD;
           are capable of increasing the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs by altering the drug&#xD;
           s pharmacological behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marqibo(Registered Trademark) is vincristine encapsulated in sphingomyelin/cholesterol&#xD;
           (SM/CHOL) liposomes, developed to increase the activity of vincristine. It has been&#xD;
           shown to have activity in Phase 2 studies in adults. Previous investigation of&#xD;
           Marqibo(Registered Trademark) in children is limited. A small phase 2 study was&#xD;
           conducted with dosing of 2.0mg/m2 every 14 days. The agent appeared to be well tolerated&#xD;
           and some activity was seen, although data were quite limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicities,&#xD;
           and pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents with solid tumors or hematologic&#xD;
           malignancies receiving weekly intravenous doses of Marqibo(Registered Trademark).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the tolerability and potential activity of Marqibo(Registered Trademark) in&#xD;
           children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)&#xD;
           at the pediatric MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children and adolescents (greater than or equal to 2 years and &lt; 21 years of age) with&#xD;
      histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory malignant disease that is measurable or&#xD;
      evaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marqibo(Registered Trademark) will be administered intravenously over 60 minutes (+ or&#xD;
           -10 minutes) every 7 days (+ or - 3 days) (Days 1, 8, 15, 22) for four doses (1 cycle).&#xD;
           Cycles may be repeated every 28 days for a maximum of 6 cycles; additional cycles may be&#xD;
           offered with evidence of acceptable toxicity and clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial follows a standard phase I design with 3 to 6 subjects per dose level and&#xD;
           standard definitions of MTD and DLT. At the MTD, a total of 6 additional subjects with&#xD;
           relapsed or refractory ALL will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed pharmacokinetic studies will be performed during the first treatment cycle.&#xD;

        or organ dysfunction, which in the judgment of protocol investigators would compromise the&#xD;
        subject s ability to tolerate the investigational agent or interfere with the study&#xD;
        procedures or results. This includes any condition or circumstance that in the opinion of&#xD;
        the investigator would significantly interfere with the subject s protocol compliance and&#xD;
        put the subject at increased risk.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded because Marqibo(Registered Trademark)&#xD;
             may be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving other investigational agents.&#xD;

             sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposomes, sodium phosphate injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are eligible for stem cell transplantation. This implies that a suitable donor is&#xD;
             readily available, that the primary oncology team and Principal Investigator recommend&#xD;
             this as a preferred treatment option at the time of protocol evaluation, and that the&#xD;
             subject is willing to undergo stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
