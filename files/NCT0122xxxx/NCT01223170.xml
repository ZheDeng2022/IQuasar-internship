  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) are leading&#xD;
      causes of death and represent 30% of all global deaths and 48% of the deaths in Europe.&#xD;
      Moreover, the current trends predict increase in deaths caused by Cardiovascular Diseases&#xD;
      over the next years. Secondary preventive efforts can decrease mortality risk as well as&#xD;
      improve health among Cardiovascular Disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study suggests an innovative approach in supporting the self-management of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease patients after rehabilitation. The implied Randomized Controlled Trial&#xD;
      has two arms and aims to investigate the effectiveness of tailoring in an Information and&#xD;
      Communication Technology (ICT) based intervention. The tailoring will be based on concepts&#xD;
      derived from health psychology theories, and will contribute in their further development.&#xD;
      More specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To assess the needs of CVD rehabilitation patients that can potentially be met&#xD;
           through the use of ICT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To assess the effects of a tailored Internet-based intervention on maintenance of&#xD;
           self-management behaviors after a rehabilitation stay. Hypothesis: The intervention&#xD;
           group (tailored) will have higher adherence a) to the Internet-based intervention, and&#xD;
           b) to self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To assess the effect of mobile technology with activity sensors on physical&#xD;
           activity. Hypothesis: There will be a relationship between the data collected from&#xD;
           activity sensors and the self-reported physical activity levels.&#xD;

      A parallel group, cluster randomized controlled trial. The study population is adult&#xD;
      participants of a cardiac rehabilitation programme in Norway with home Internet access and&#xD;
      mobile phone, who in monthly clusters are randomized to the control or the intervention&#xD;
      condition. Participants have access to a website with information regarding cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation, an online discussion forum and an online activity calendar. Those randomized&#xD;
      to the intervention condition, receive in addition tailored content based on models of health&#xD;
      behaviour, through the website and mobile text messages. The objective is to assess the&#xD;
      effect of the intervention on maintenance of self-management behaviours after the&#xD;
      rehabilitation stay. Main outcome is the level of physical activity one month, three months&#xD;
      and one year after the end of the cardiac rehabilitation programme. The randomization of&#xD;
      clusters is based on a true random number online service, and participants, investigators and&#xD;
      outcome assessor are blinded to the condition of the clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study suggests a theory-based intervention that combines models of health behaviour in an&#xD;
      innovative way, in order to tailor the delivered content. The users have been actively&#xD;
      involved in its design, and because of the use of Open-Source software, the intervention can&#xD;
      easily and at low-cost be reproduced and expanded by others. Challenges are the recruitment&#xD;
      in the elderly population and the possible underrepresentation of women in the study sample&#xD;
