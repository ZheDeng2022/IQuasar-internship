  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is one of the most common complications after surgery&#xD;
      and neuraxial anesthesia of which the treatment of choice is bladder catheterization 1. It&#xD;
      has been a common practice to place an indwelling catheter in the bladder in patients&#xD;
      receiving epidural analgesia and to leave the catheter as long as the epidural analgesia is&#xD;
      maintained despite a lack of evidence supporting this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transurethral catheterization is associated with significant morbidity such as patient&#xD;
      discomfort, urethral trauma and urinary tract infections (UTI). Prolonged catheterization is&#xD;
      the primary risk factor for catheter associated UTI (CAUTI), which is one of the most common&#xD;
      nosocomial infections and can prolong hospitalisation 2. For this reason there is a growing&#xD;
      focus on limiting the duration of catheterization and finding methods to avoid unnecessary&#xD;
      catheterization in perioperative medicine 3,4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower urinary tract function depends on coordinated actions between the detrusor muscle and&#xD;
      the external urethral sphincter. Motorneurons of both muscles are located in the sacral&#xD;
      spinal cord between L1 and S4. Most afferent fibers from the bladder enter the sacral cord&#xD;
      through the pelvic nerve at segments L4-S2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because epidural analgesia can be performed at various levels of the spinal cord, it is&#xD;
      possible to block only a portion of the spinal cord (segmental blockade). Based on the&#xD;
      innervation of the bladder and sphincter between L1 and S4 it can be assumed that epidural&#xD;
      analgesia within segments T4-6 to T10-12 has no or minimal influence on lower urinary tract&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, we found, against our expectations that thoracic epidural analgesia&#xD;
      (TEA) significantly inhibits the detrusor muscle during voiding, resulting in clinically&#xD;
      relevant post-void residuals which required monitoring or catheterisation 5. Because the&#xD;
      study adopted a before-after design, we could not definitively identify the mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for this change in bladder function. In particular, we could not determine&#xD;
      whether TEA per se or surgery was the main cause. Concerning TEA, it remains unclear which&#xD;
      compounds of the solution, the local anesthetic, the opioid or both are responsible for the&#xD;
      observed changes in lower urinary tract function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare lower urinary tract function before and during TEA with&#xD;
      two different epidural solutions (group 1: bupivacaine 1.25 mg/ml vs group 2: bupivacaine&#xD;
      1.25 mg/ml combined with fentanyl 2 µg/ml) within segments T4-6 to T10-12 for postoperative&#xD;
      pain treatment in patients undergoing lumbotomy for open renal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that a better understanding of lower urinary tract function during TEA could lead&#xD;
      to a more restrictive use of indwelling transurethral catheters perioperatively.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute urinary retention is one of the most common complications after surgery and anesthesia.&#xD;
      It can occur in patients of both sexes and all age groups and after all types of surgical&#xD;
      procedures. It is linked to several factors including increased intravenous fluids,&#xD;
      postoperative pain and type of anaesthesia 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micturition depends on coordinated actions between the detrusor muscle and the external&#xD;
      urethral sphincter. Motorneurons of both muscles are located in the sacral spinal cord and&#xD;
      coordination between them occurs in the pontine tegmentum of the caudal brain stem.&#xD;
      Motorneurons innervating the external urethral sphincter are located in the nucleus of Onuf,&#xD;
      extending from segment S1 to S3. The detrusor smooth muscle is innervated by parasympathetic&#xD;
      fibers, which reside in the sacral intermediolateral cell group and are located in S2-4.&#xD;
      Sympathetic fibers innervating the bladder and urethra play an important role in promoting&#xD;
      continence and are located in the intermediolateral cell group of the lumbar cord (L1-L4).&#xD;
      Most afferent fibers from the bladder enter the sacral cord through the pelvic nerve at&#xD;
      segments L4-S2 and the majority are thin myelinated or unmyelinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies on the urodynamic effects of various anaesthetic agents 2-8, which&#xD;
      mainly focused on lumbar epidural anaesthesia. Under the influence of epidural analgesia,&#xD;
      patients may not feel the sensation of bladder filling, which can result in urinary retention&#xD;
      and bladder overdistension. Overfilling of the bladder can stretch and in some cases&#xD;
      permanently damage the detrusor muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because epidural anesthesia can be performed at various levels of the spinal cord, it is&#xD;
      possible to block only a portion of the spinal cord (segmental blockade). Based on knowledge&#xD;
      of the bladder innervations, it can be assumed that epidural analgesia within segments T4-6&#xD;
      to T10-12 has no or minimal influences on lower urinary tract function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, we found, against our expectations that thoracic epidural analgesia&#xD;
      significantly inhibits the detrusor muscle during voiding, resulting in clinically relevant&#xD;
      post void residuals which required monitoring or transurethral catheterisation 9. Because the&#xD;
      study adopted a before-after design, we could not definitively identify the mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for bladder dysfunction. In particular, we could not say whether thoracic&#xD;
      epidural analgesia per se or surgery was the cause of bladder dysfunction. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      remains which ingredients, whether the local anesthetic, the opioid or both are behind&#xD;
      changes in voiding function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our previous studies, we found that TEA significantly inhibits the detrusor muscle during&#xD;
      voiding, resulting in clinically relevant post-void residuals which required monitoring or&#xD;
      catheterization with similar findings 5,30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because these studies adopted a before-after design, we could not definitively identify the&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible for lower urinary tract dysfunction. In particular, we could not say&#xD;
      whether TEA per se or surgery was the cause of lower urinary tract dysfunction. Furthermore,&#xD;
      it remains unclear which compounds in the epidural solution, the local anesthetic, the opioid&#xD;
      or both are behind the observed changes in lower urinary tract function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to determine if TEA per se or surgery are the cause of&#xD;
      bladder dysfunction and which drugs in the epidural solution are responsible for this effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised controlled double-blind study. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the&#xD;
      two groups by a computer-generated randomization list. Randomization will be stratified by&#xD;
      gender, in order to reach an equal number of male and females in the two groups. Patients and&#xD;
      investigators will be blinded to the epidural solution administrated.&#xD;
