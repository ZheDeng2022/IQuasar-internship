  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether or not a perioperative therapy with surgery can improve the outcomes among&#xD;
      patients with potentially curable squamous carcinoma of esophagus as compared to a&#xD;
      preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative chemotherapy has been shown to significantly improve the R0 resection rate, the&#xD;
      disease free survival and the overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      esophagus, the gastroesophageal junction and the stomach. Therefore, perioperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy is the new therapeutic standard (Cunningham NEJM 2006, MRC, Lancet 2002, Boige&#xD;
      ASCO 2007). The best-evaluated regime is the combination of Epirubicin, Cisplatin and 5-FU&#xD;
      (ECF) (Cunningham, NEJM 2007). Cisplatin and 5-FU are considered to be the most important&#xD;
      components to form the cornerstone of this regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel is a new and highly active cytotoxic agent. In a randomized phase II study, the&#xD;
      dual combination of Paclitaxel and 5-FU seemed to show similar effects as ECF, administered&#xD;
      as first line treatment. The triplet combination of Paclitaxel, Cisplatin and 5-FU has&#xD;
      significantly superior efficacy than a combination of Cisplatin und 5-FU (Van Cutsem, JCO&#xD;
      2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that Capecitabine is more active than 5-FU and can replace intravenous 5-FU&#xD;
      in the combination with Cisplatin in the treatment of esophageal cancer. Capecitabine&#xD;
      therefore is FDA approved for esophageal cancer (Cunningham, ASCO 2006, Kang ASCO 2006).It&#xD;
      seems reasonable to optimize perioperative chemotherapy by including this modern&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with squamous carcinoma of esophagus and gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      who seem operable with curative intent according to oncological and surgical assessment are&#xD;
      treated with 2 preoperative cycles of PCF followed by surgical resection, followed by 2&#xD;
      postoperative cycles of PCF. Among patients with no responses to preoperative chemotherapy,&#xD;
      Capecitabine 625 mg/m² twice-daily dose is defined as alternatives to infused 5-Fluorouracil&#xD;
      in the postoperative chemotherapy regimen Postoperative chemotherapy will start within 4-6&#xD;
      weeks after the operation. 3 weeks after the end of the last chemotherapy the final&#xD;
      investigation (end of study visit) will be done.&#xD;
