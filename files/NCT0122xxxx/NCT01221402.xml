  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intermediate saphenous vein graft (SVG) lesions are common, have high rates of progression to&#xD;
      severe lesions or occlusion, and are associated with high incidence of adverse clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ALPINE-SVG trial is a randomized-controlled trial of extended-release niacin vs. placebo&#xD;
      in patients with intermediate saphenous vein graft lesions. The main hypothesis of the study&#xD;
      is that compared to placebo, niacin administration will result in reduction in percent&#xD;
      atheroma volume at 12-month follow-up angiography.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-center, double-blind trial that will randomize 138 prior CABG&#xD;
      patients with an intermediate SVG lesion (30%-60% angiographic diameter stenosis) on&#xD;
      clinically-indicated coronary angiography, and HDL-C&lt;60 mg/dL to ER-niacin at a dose of&#xD;
      1500-2000 mg daily or matching placebo (containing 50 mg of niacin that can cause flushing&#xD;
      but has no lipid lowering effect) for 12 months. All patients will receive a statin with goal&#xD;
      LDL-C &lt;70 mg/dL. Coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS), and&#xD;
      intravascular near-infrared intracoronary spectroscopy (NIRS), and optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) of the intermediate SVG lesion will be performed at enrollment and after 12&#xD;
      months in each patient, along with exercise stress testing at 1 month and 12 months, B-mode&#xD;
      carotid ultrasound imaging at enrollment and after 6 and 12 months, reactive hyperemia&#xD;
      peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) at enrollment and after 6 and 12 months, and with&#xD;
      peripheral blood sampling performed at enrollment and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, to&#xD;
      determine whether compared to placebo, administration of ER-niacin will result in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduction of the percent atheroma volume (PAV) of the intermediate SVG lesion at&#xD;
           12-month follow-up IVUS imaging (primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduction of total and normalized total intermediate SVG lesion atheroma volume,&#xD;
           reduction of atheroma volume in the most diseased 10-mm subsegment of the target&#xD;
           intermediate lesion, reduction of atheroma volume in the subsegment of the target&#xD;
           intermediate lesion with lipid core plaque by NIRS, reduction of lipid core burden index&#xD;
           as assessed by near-infrared intracoronary spectroscopy, increase in fibrous cap&#xD;
           thickness and reduction in the prevalence and number of microchannels, in the presence&#xD;
           and extent of necrotic lipid pool, plaque rupture, calcification, and thrombus, as&#xD;
           assessed by optical coherence tomography, and reduction of angiographic intermediate SVG&#xD;
           target lesion failure at 12-month follow-up SVG imaging (secondary endpoints)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increased exercise capacity and reduction in ischemia, as assessed by exercise stress&#xD;
           testing between 1 and 12 months (secondary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Less increase in mean carotid intima-media thickness at 6 and 12 months (secondary&#xD;
           endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Greater increase in natural logarithmic scaled reactive hyperemia index (L_RHI) at 6 and&#xD;
           12 months (secondary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Greater increase in EPC-CFU/mL of peripheral blood from baseline to 1, 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
           months post enrollment (secondary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Reduction of major adverse cardiac events (defined as the composite of death, acute&#xD;
           coronary syndrome, or coronary revascularization) during follow-up (secondary endpoint)&#xD;
