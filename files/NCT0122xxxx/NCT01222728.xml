      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) is associated with tumors of the nerves, brain, and&#xD;
           spinal cord. Most people with NF2 develop vestibular schwannomas, or tumors on the&#xD;
           hearing and balance nerves. As they grow, vestibular schwannomas can cause hearing loss&#xD;
           and balance problems. If they grow very large they can cause more serious problems, such&#xD;
           as seizures, loss of eyesight, weakness, speech problems, and problems with the sense of&#xD;
           touch. More research is needed into NF2 because researchers do not completely understand&#xD;
           why these tumors occur or what makes them grow over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, tumor size is measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,&#xD;
           MRI scans cannot predict how fast a tumor will grow. By using positron emission&#xD;
           tomography (PET) scanning, researchers hope to be able to predict sudden growth spurts&#xD;
           of tumors associated with NF2 and develop better treatment methods for this type of&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography to better understand the&#xD;
      growth of brain tumors in people with neurofibromatosis type II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who have been diagnosed with NF2 and have at&#xD;
      least three untreated intracranial tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires an initial set of outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center that&#xD;
           will last 7 to 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical and neurological examination and blood tests at the&#xD;
           first visit. Participants will then have the following imaging studies to examine the&#xD;
           tumors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scans of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET scans of the brain, combined with a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET scans&#xD;
           will be performed on separate days. Different contrast agents will be used for both&#xD;
           scans, so researchers will inform participants if they need to fast or follow other&#xD;
           procedures before having the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the initial imaging studies, participants will have additional MRI scans every 6&#xD;
           months for 2 years to track tumor growth.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this prospective observational study of intracranial tumors in patients with&#xD;
      neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is to gain insight into the use of 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose&#xD;
      (FDG) and 3 -deoxy-3 -18F-fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) as a predictive measure of future tumor growth patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve patients, ages 18-50, with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of NF2 and harboring at&#xD;
      least 3 unoperated intracranial tumors (meningiomas and/or vestibular schwannomas) will&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be evaluated with a thorough physical and neurologic examination upon&#xD;
      enrollment. This initial outpatient evaluation will include contrast-enhanced magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, FDG-PET/CT and FLT-PET/CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed as outpatients for two years, during which time MRI evaluation will&#xD;
      be performed every six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data derived from this study, we hope to correlate FDG-PET/CT and FLT-PET/CT scans&#xD;
      with metabolic activity and cellular proliferation within tumors. These findings will help us&#xD;
      better forecast tumor growth and senescence. These findings should permit the safer treatment&#xD;
      of the subset of tumors that will grow and cause symptoms and avoid the unnecessary treatment&#xD;
      of lesions that will remain stable (not requiring treatment) in these patients.&#xD;
