      The purpose of this study is to determine the level of agreement between QuantiFeron -TB Gold&#xD;
      test (QFT-G)and Tubeculin skin test (TST)for screening of latent tuberculosis in patients&#xD;
      suffering from psoriasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are candidates to receive anti-TNF alpha&#xD;
      therapies which require prior screening for latent tuberculosis (LTB). Currently, screening&#xD;
      for LTB is based on tuberculin skin test (TST) , chest X rays, and a questionaire on&#xD;
      predisposing factors for TB. The main drawbacks of TST are the lack of specificity due to&#xD;
      cross reactivity with Bacille Calmette- Guerin (BCG) and other nontuberculosis mycobacteria&#xD;
      and the risk of anergy in immunosuppressed patients. Furthermore, it has been suggested that&#xD;
      the skin of psoriatic patients may be more sensitive resulting in increased TST which does&#xD;
      not obligatory reflect the status of LTB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new assay for LTBI has been developed, which evaluates interferon (IFN) -γ&#xD;
      release by memory effector T-cells stimulated in vitro with specific mycobacterial antigens,&#xD;
      ESAT-6 (early secretory antigen target-6) and CFP-10 (culture filtrate protein-10) [9-10].&#xD;
      The QuantiFeron -TB Gold test (QFT-G) uses ELISA to measure IFN-γ concentrations in&#xD;
      supernatants in plate format and &quot;In tube&quot; format (QFT-GIT) while the enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunospot (ELISPOT) detects individual IFN-γ producing T-cells (TS-TB, Oxford Immunotech,&#xD;
      Abingdon, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole blood IFN-γ assays was approved by The Centers for Disease Control as an&#xD;
      alternative screening strategy to TST in immunocompetent individuals [11], but its clinical&#xD;
      utility as a single test for detection LTBI in immunocompromised patients is&#xD;
      controversial.Furthermore, its utility in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis has&#xD;
      not been yet established One hundred patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and 50&#xD;
      healthy control will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be requested to complete a detailed sociodemographic and TB screening&#xD;
      questionnaire including gender, age, place of birth and work, prior BCG vaccination, close&#xD;
      contact with TB patients or TB prophylaxis in the past. Screening workup will includ&#xD;
      assessment of clinical disease activity using the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS-28)and&#xD;
      Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI),documentation of past or current treatment with systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs, and imaging (chest X-ray).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects will undergo a TST and QFT-G test A 2-TU dose of PPD will be administered by&#xD;
      a certified technician using the Mantoux method and induration measured after 72 h. TST will&#xD;
      be deemed positive if bove or equally to 5 mm for RA patients and 10 mm for controls The&#xD;
      absence of induration of &lt;2 mm in diameter will be recorded as anergic and negative TST&#xD;
      results was defined as having more than 2 but less than 5 mm reactions for RA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QFT-G test The second-generation QuantiFeron® (QIFN) whole-blood IFN assay (Cellestis) will&#xD;
      be performed and interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, the test consisted of a negative control (nil well, i.e., whole blood without&#xD;
      antigens or mitogen),a positive control (mitogen well, i.e., whole blood stimulated with the&#xD;
      mitogen phytohemagglutinin [PHA]) and two sample wells, i.e., whole blood stimulated with&#xD;
      either of the M. tuberculosis-specific antigens, Early Secretory Antigen Target 6 (ESAT-6) or&#xD;
      Culture Filtrate Protein 10 (CFP-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five ml heparinized whole blood will be drawn for QFT-G before for PPD testing. The blood&#xD;
      specimens will be incubated for 16-20 h (overnight) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere. IFN-γ&#xD;
      levels in the nil well will be considered background and will be subtracted from the results&#xD;
      of the mitogen well and the antigen-stimulated wells. The results will be considered positive&#xD;
      if the concentration of.IFN-γ in the sample well after stimulation with ESAT-6 and/or CFP-10&#xD;
      will be greater than or equal to 0.35 IU/ml (after subtracting the value of the nil well),&#xD;
      regardless of the results of the positive control (mitogen well). The results will be&#xD;
      considered negative if the response to the specific antigens (after subtracting the value of&#xD;
      the nil well) is less than 0.35 IU/ml and if the IFN-γ levels of the positive control (after&#xD;
      subtracting the value of the nil well) is greater than or equal to 0.5 IU/ml. The results&#xD;
      will be considered indeterminate if both antigen-stimulated sample wells are negative (i.e.,&#xD;
      &lt;0.35 IU/ml after subtracting the value of the Nil well) and if the value of the positive&#xD;
      control well is less than 0.5 IU/ml after subtracting the value of the nil well&#xD;
&#xD;
      the nil well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QFT-G test The second-generation QuantiFeron® (QIFN) whole-blood IFN assay (Cellestis) was&#xD;
      performed and interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;

      levels in the nil well were considered background and were subtracted from the results of the&#xD;
      mitogen well and the antigen-stimulated wells. The results were considered positive if the&#xD;
      concentration of. IFN-γ in the sample well after stimulation with ESAT-6 and/or CFP-10 was&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 0.35 IU/ml (after subtracting the value of the nil well), regardless&#xD;
      of the results of the positive control (mitogen well). The results were considered negative&#xD;
      if the response to the specific antigens (after subtracting the value of the nil well) was&#xD;
      less than 0.35 IU/ml and if the IFN-γ levels of the positive control (after subtracting the&#xD;
      value of the nil well) were greater than or equal to 0.5 IU/ml. The results were considered&#xD;
      indeterminate if both antigen-stimulated sample wells were negative (i.e., &lt;0.35 IU/ml after&#xD;
      subtracting the value of the Nil well) and if the value of the positive control well was less&#xD;
      than 0.5 IU/ml after subtracting the value of&#xD;
&#xD;
      the nil well.&#xD;
