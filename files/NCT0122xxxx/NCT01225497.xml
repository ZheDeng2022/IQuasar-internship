  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain and disability are unfortunately common in Achilles tendon pain. Outcome after&#xD;
      surgery is often poor. Also tendon pain can be resistant to treatment and may lead to&#xD;
      cessation of hobbies or careers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently eccentric exercise (defined as muscle loading where tension develops as physical&#xD;
      lengthening occurs) has become a cornerstone in managing tendon pain due to an increasing&#xD;
      amount of favorable research. Eccentric exercises are considered to be non-invasive, safe,&#xD;
      and appear to be important for a successful outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One exercise program has been extensively adopted in research and clinical practice for&#xD;
      Achilles pain. It recommends individuals perform 180 repetitions a day. However there appears&#xD;
      to be little scientific rationale for this number. Consequently there may be significant&#xD;
      implications for patient compliance, satisfaction, and overall treatment efficacy in a&#xD;
      strategy which is encouraged to be uncomfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty two adults (18-70 years old), with mid-Achilles tendon pain will be randomised to&#xD;
      standard treatment (180 repetitions) or to a group where individuals are allowed to do what&#xD;
      they can. Participants will be recruited from participating physiotherapy departments (health&#xD;
      centres and hospital departments) across NHS Forth Valley. All individuals will be required&#xD;
      to complete the same type of eccentric exercise for six weeks attending an initial assessment&#xD;
      and two follow-up appointments at three and six weeks. Thereafter participants will be&#xD;
      discharged if better, or continue with individual care where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped this pilot study will establish if future larger scale investigation is warranted&#xD;
      examining whether it is necessary to subject individuals to 180 repetitions a day in an&#xD;
      activity recommended to be uncomfortable. Also will participant satisfaction differ between&#xD;
      exercise groups? If further investigation is warranted this pilot may provide population&#xD;
      specific data for future sample size calculations, and may provide a suitable methodology for&#xD;
      such investigations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: This project will be a prospective double-blinded randomised clinical controlled&#xD;
      trial comparing a &quot;standard&quot; volume eccentric exercise program (Group I-Control) versus a&#xD;
      participant determined volume program (Group II-Experimental).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Participant population The participant population of interest are those&#xD;
      attending NHS out-patient physiotherapy departments for the treatment of chronic mid-portion&#xD;
      Achilles tendinopathy in Scotland. Consequently both genders and varying pre-morbid activity&#xD;
      levels will be anticipated across a wide age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant recruitment and selection Physiotherapy colleagues across Forth Valley NHS Trust&#xD;
      will be contacted via a standardised email inviting individuals to participate in the&#xD;
      proposed investigation. Those volunteering will be required to identify potential&#xD;
      participants currently waiting to attend physiotherapy. Such waiting lists include&#xD;
      self-referral, orthopaedic and GP referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once identified potential participants will be sent standardised letters of introduction&#xD;
      identifying they may be eligible to participate in a research project concerning&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment of Achilles tendon pain. More detailed participant information sheets&#xD;
      will also be included to allow candidates have best opportunity to provide informed consent.&#xD;
      Any potential risks will be outlined. As part of the informed consent process participants&#xD;
      will be encouraged to seek opinions from friends and family. Participant recruitment will be&#xD;
      implemented over a 4 month period. Potential participants will be instructed that they will&#xD;
      receive an appointment in due course at the location they would normally attend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On initial contact participants will be assessed as per normal practice by participating&#xD;
      physiotherapists in the health centres or hospitals they would normally attend in an attempt&#xD;
      to minimise disruption to the patient journey. It is hoped travel will be minimised for&#xD;
      participants in order to minimise drop out and participant expense. In instances where&#xD;
      diagnosis is uncertain participating therapists are advised to seek a second opinion from&#xD;
      appropriate colleagues/senior clinical staff as they would do under normal circumstances. If&#xD;
      a diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy is still uncertain the potential participant will not be&#xD;
      included and will be informed why. Participating therapists will undergo training in&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent; diagnosing Achilles tendinopathy as defined in the following&#xD;
      inclusion criteria; and receive instruction in data collection procedures required for this&#xD;
      investigation from the principle researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Again any potential risks will be outlined in the process of obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
      Participants will be given time to consider their options. It will be made clear that&#xD;
      deciding not to participate will not affect future treatment. If potential participants agree&#xD;
      to take part, eligibility to participate will be assessed against the following criteria. If&#xD;
      potential participants are suitable they will then be randomised to either group.&#xD;
      Participants will be reminded of their right to withdraw from the trial at anytime and this&#xD;
      will not affect future treatment. If necessary on withdrawal participants will be informed&#xD;
      that they can request to be seen by a different physiotherapist if they so wish. If an&#xD;
      individual does not fulfil the selection criteria they will be informed why immediately and&#xD;
      then managed as per normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling technique It is anticipated the sample size required will be obtained. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      due to uncertain incidence rates and the limited time convenience sampling will be used to&#xD;
      maximise recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant randomisation Once recruited, participants will be randomised to the control&#xD;
      group (&quot;standard&quot; volume) or experimental group (patient determined volume). Randomisation&#xD;
      will be achieved by participating physiotherapists telephoning a recruited Stirling Royal&#xD;
      Infirmary physiotherapy department secretary at the end of the initial consultation. The&#xD;
      secretary will randomly draw sealed opaque envelopes detailing the number of repetitions to&#xD;
      do per day and inform the participant directly. As well as written documentation provided at&#xD;
      the initial consultation the participant will be reminded not to discuss the volume of&#xD;
      repetitions with anyone potentially participating in the trial or with the participating&#xD;
      therapist for the duration of testing. In this way the participants, participating therapists&#xD;
      and researcher will be blinded to group allocation. Any questions participants may have will&#xD;
      be directed to the independent supervisor of the project (Frank Gilroy, Physiotherapy&#xD;
      Manager, Forth Valley NHS Trust).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The VISA-A has been suggested to be valid and reliable and is&#xD;
      therefore strongly recommended for use when researching and treating Achilles tendon pain&#xD;
      (Robinson 2001; Brukner &amp; Khan 2007). Thus it will be used as the principle outcome measure&#xD;
      of this investigation. Previous research suggests a delta of 10 points with a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 12 when comparing eccentric exercise to a wait and see approach (Rompe et al&#xD;
      2008) giving a large effect size of 0.83. With a power of 0.80, an alpha level of 0.05, and&#xD;
      using methods outlined by Fleiss (1986) it is calculated that 23 participants are required&#xD;
      for each group of this trial. All studies in this area assign an additional 10% to the&#xD;
      calculated sample size to account for loss to follow-up (Rompe et al 2007). This appears to&#xD;
      be adequate for the proposed population and setting as no studies have failed to recruit the&#xD;
      required number to ensure adequate power. Therefore a total of 26 patients will be required&#xD;
      for each arm of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Participants will be assessed, recruited and randomised as detailed previously. All&#xD;
      participants will be instructed in the same eccentric exercise technique as per previous&#xD;
      literature (Alfredson et al 1998). Advice concerning progression, and exercising to pain will&#xD;
      be consistent across groups with that recommended by Alfredson et al (1998). All participants&#xD;
      will also receive the same written instructions on how to perform and progress exercise as&#xD;
      well as a simple exercise diary to record the number of repetitions actually completed per&#xD;
      day. During the initial consultation the data collection sheet will be completed where&#xD;
      appropriate. At the end of the initial consultation participating therapists will phone&#xD;
      Stirling Royal Infirmary physiotherapy department where the recruited secretary will inform&#xD;
      the patient directly the number of exercises to do a day (as part of the randomisation&#xD;
      process). A follow-up appointment will be arranged in three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week three exercises will be reviewed to ensure good technique. All outcome measures will&#xD;
      be re-assessed and documented on the data collection sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week six all outcome measures will be re-assessed. Patient satisfaction with treatment&#xD;
      will be assessed. All completed data collection sheets and exercise activity logs will be&#xD;
      mailed to the principle investigator for analysis. At this point participants will be&#xD;
      informed the trial is over and management will continue as per normal practice. If symptoms&#xD;
      have resolved participants may be discharged; if they are improving they may be given an open&#xD;
      appointment with advice to contact if any further problems; if there is little change&#xD;
      therapists will be allowed to continue management as they see fit as per normal practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the trial the principle researcher will attempt to contact participants lost to&#xD;
      follow-up to determine any reasons for this as long as they have agreed to this during the&#xD;
      consenting process.&#xD;

    <description>Participants stand with the balls of their feet on a step. They rise up onto tip toes using both legs then transfer onto the affected leg, then slowly lower their heel below the level of the step keeping their weight-bearing limb fully straight (eccentric phase). This constitutes 1 repetition and is repeated for 3 x 15 reps.&#xD;
The previous procedure is then carried out with the knee bent during the eccentric phase of loading for 3 x 15 reps.&#xD;
All of the above is carried out twice a day as per Alfredsons protocol. Participants are encouraged as per Alfredsons procedure to continue into discomfort not severe pain.</description>
