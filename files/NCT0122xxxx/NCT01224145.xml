      This study will assess pain intensity for the first 72 hrs after aggravated movement (cough)&#xD;
      following Laparoscopic Inguinal or Umbilical Herniorrhaphy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal herniorrhaphy is a common surgery; approximately 2,800 per million people in the&#xD;
      United States (US) undergo the procedure annually.Common surgical methods of herniorrhaphy&#xD;
      include open and laparoscopic placement of synthetic mesh. Studies have shown that the use of&#xD;
      synthetic mesh greatly reduces the risk of hernia recurrence regardless of the method used&#xD;
      for its placement. Furthermore, utilizing the laparoscopic approach for umbilical hernia&#xD;
      repair, specifically with the use of mesh, may also reduce the risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic (pain medicine) that has an established safety profile.&#xD;
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant is a thin&#xD;
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and contains bupivacaine. When&#xD;
      inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and bupivacaine is released at the&#xD;
      site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of bupivacaine at the&#xD;
      surgical site may result in less pain for several days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label study will assess pain intensity after surgery in patients who receive the&#xD;
      CollaRx Bupivacaine implant as well as determine the feasibility of the use of the&#xD;
      laparoscope for sponge placement in laparoscopic hernia repair.&#xD;

The dose for patients who weighed 75kg or more was 1-2 tablets (15-30 mg) every 3-4 hours for pain control. Morphine was the preferred rescue medication.</description>
