      In renal transplant recipients, residual renal insufficiency combined to the effects of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy with steroids or calcineurin inhibitors may reduce insulin activity&#xD;
      and may contribute to several of the abnormalities associated with the metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      such as hypertension, glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia. In turn, insulin resistance,&#xD;
      hypertension, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia may importantly contribute to the excess&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk of renal transplant patients (an excess comparable to that of diabetes&#xD;
      subjects with over diabetic nephropathy)and may also accelerate progressive renal function&#xD;
      deterioration and promote graft loss. Thus, amelioration of the insulin activity and of the&#xD;
      related metabolic syndrome is a key component of treatments aimed to improve patient and&#xD;
      graft survival in renal transplant recipients. Recently, drugs such as peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferators-activated receptor-gamma activators, that ameliorate insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, have become available.These agents, however, can provoke fluid retention,&#xD;
      weight gain, edema and, in some cases, heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies showed that telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, in&#xD;
      addition to block the angiotensin II type 1 - a key surface receptor involved in the&#xD;
      regulation of blood pressure - may also activate peroxisome proliferators-activated&#xD;
      receptor-gamma activators, thus improving some of the features of the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
      Thus telmisartan may substantially reduce the overall cardiovascular and renal risk of renal&#xD;
      transplant recipients by ameliorating some of the modifiable components of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. On the other hand, telmisartan is devoid of the adverse effects of peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferators-activated receptor-gamma activators such as fluid retention, and has therefore&#xD;
      a remarkably better risk/benefit profile. Thus, whether telmisartan in addition to the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of a reference angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (such as&#xD;
      losartan) may offer adjunctive advantages related to improved insulin sensitivity in renal&#xD;
      transplant patients on chronic therapy with steroids and/or calcineurin inhibitors, is worth&#xD;
      investigating.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND In renal transplant recipients, residual renal insufficiency combined to the&#xD;
      effects of immunosuppressive therapy with steroids or calcineurin inhibitors may reduce&#xD;
      insulin activity and may contribute to several of the abnormalities associated with the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, such as hypertension, glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia. In turn,&#xD;
      insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia may importantly contribute&#xD;
      to the excess cardiovascular risk of renal transplant patients (an excess comparable to that&#xD;
      of diabetes subjects with over diabetic nephropathy)and may also accelerate progressive renal&#xD;
      function deterioration and promote graft loss. Thus, amelioration of the insulin activity and&#xD;
      of the related metabolic syndrome is a key component of treatments aimed to improve patient&#xD;
      and graft survival in renal transplant recipients. Recently, drugs such as peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferators-activated receptor-gamma activators, that ameliorate insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, have become available. These agents, however, can provoke fluid&#xD;
      retention, weight gain, edema and, in some cases, heart failure. Thus, the risk/benefit&#xD;
      profile of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma activators is still uncertain,&#xD;
      in particular in renal transplant patients where the risks of therapy may overwhelm the&#xD;
      potential benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies showed that telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, in&#xD;
      addition to block the angiotensin II type 1 - a key surface receptor involved in the&#xD;
      regulation of blood pressure - may also activate PPAR-gamma, thus improving some of the&#xD;
      features of the metabolic syndrome, such as hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in people with&#xD;
      hypertension and/or diabetes. Thus, in addition to control high blood pressure and to limit&#xD;
      some of the adverse effects of angiotensin II, including target organ damage, graft fibrosis&#xD;
      and cyclosporine (CsA) nephrotoxicity, telmisartan may also substantially reduce the overall&#xD;
      cardiovascular and renal risk of renal transplant recipients by ameliorating some of the&#xD;
      modifiable components of the metabolic syndrome, such as hypertension, glucose intolerance&#xD;
      and hyperlipidemia. On the other hand, telmisartan is devoid of the adverse effects of&#xD;
      peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma activators such as fluid retention, and has&#xD;
      therefore a remarkably better risk/benefit profile. Thus, whether telmisartan in addition to&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of a reference AII receptor antagonist (such as losartan) may offer&#xD;
      adjunctive advantages related to improved insulin sensitivity in renal transplant patients on&#xD;
      chronic therapy with steroids and/or calcineurin inhibitors, is worth investigating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS The primary aim is to compare the short-term effects of telmisartan and losartan on&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity in kidney transplant recipients with stable renal function and&#xD;
      concomitant treatment with steroids and/or calcineurin inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN This will be a pilot, explorative study. On the basis of previous experimental&#xD;
      evidence, a crossover study on 20 patients should have the power to detect a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference in the effect on insulin activity between each treatment period as&#xD;
      compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to the sequence Telmisartan-Losartan or to&#xD;
      sequence losartan-telmisartan.&#xD;
