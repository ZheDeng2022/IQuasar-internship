  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a pervasive and frequent disorder. Early psychological treatment - but not&#xD;
      pharmacology - effectively prevent PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current pharmacological studies did not include treatment given immediately after trauma&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a recent study of opiates suggests that their early administration may reduce the&#xD;
      likelihood of developing PTSD - possibly by mitigating early post-traumatic distress (UCR) -&#xD;
      within an adequate window of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benzodiazepines are often used to reduce anxiety and agitation during stressful situations -&#xD;
      including traumatic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These compounds may increase the likelihood of developing PTSD when administered few days&#xD;
      after the traumatic event - but their effect as an immediate intervention has not been&#xD;
      studied - despite their frequent and uninformed use at this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will evaluate the effect of diazepam - a BZ compound - on PTSD symptom trajectory&#xD;
      following traumatic event in a randomized controlled design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the studies of opiates it is hoped that diazepam, administered within hours of the&#xD;
      traumatic event, and before the first night sleep (a memory consolidating condition) will&#xD;
      reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD. However, an adverse effect cannot be excluded, and&#xD;
      thus the investigators posit a bidirectional hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of this work is that it will provide the necessary evidence to sanction a&#xD;
      frequently practiced use of benzodiazepines.&#xD;
