  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in Europe,&#xD;
      with an estimated 250000 new cases diagnosed in 2005. The continued poor outcome of patients&#xD;
      indicates that the current recommended regimens are falling short. In addition, many of the&#xD;
      commonly used chemotherapy agents are associated with severe nonhematologic toxicities that&#xD;
      are often cumulative and nonreversible and impair quality of life in this essentially&#xD;
      palliative setting. Therefore, agents with novel mechanisms of action and superior safety&#xD;
      profiles need to be investigated. More than 50% of lung cancer shows carcinoembryonic antigen&#xD;
      (CEA) expression and anti-CEA radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) could be used. The investigators&#xD;
      group showed that pretargeted RAIT (PRAIT) using bispecific antibody (bsMAb) can deliver a&#xD;
      higher radiation dose to a tumor than a directly radiolabeled anti-CEA antibody, and shows&#xD;
      improved anti-tumor efficacy. This clinical trial is designed to assess PRAIT using an&#xD;
      entirely new recombinant anti-CEA bsMAb and a 177Lu-labeled peptide for the treatment of&#xD;
      CEA-expressing small cell lung cancers (SCLC) or CEA-expressing Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma&#xD;
      (NSCLC)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label prospective optimization and phase I/II clinical trial is to&#xD;
      examine the safety, optimal dose, targeting, dosimetry and efficacy of PRAIT using the&#xD;
      humanized anti-CEA x anti-HSG bsMAb TF2 and the 177Lu-IMP-288 peptide pretargeted in patients&#xD;
      with CEA-positive SCLC or CEA-expressing Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 parts: Study plan I (Optimization study) and Study plan II (Escalating&#xD;
      activity phase I/II study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study plan I is designed to optimize the pretargeting procedure using blood&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (Pk) and dosimetry in 9 patients receiving escalating doses of TF2 followed&#xD;
      2 to 4 days later by 1.1 GBq/m2 of 177Lu-IMP-288.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plan II is designed to determined MTD of 177Lu-IMP-288 using dosimetry and toxicity&#xD;
      data in a phase I/II study performed in patients receiving optimal dose of TF2 bsMAb&#xD;
      (determined in study plan I) followed 2 to 4 days by escalating activity of 177Lu-IMP-288.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-therapy imaging study (using TF2 followed 2 to 4 days later by 185 MBq of&#xD;
      111In-IMP-288) is performed in the two study plans to qualify a patient for treatment with&#xD;
      the subsequent therapy dose.&#xD;
