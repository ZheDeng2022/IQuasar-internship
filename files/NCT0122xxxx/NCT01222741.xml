      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are interested in studying disorders that make individuals more susceptible to&#xD;
      fungal infections, specifically infections with the Candida yeast. These disorders are often&#xD;
      related to problems with the immune system and may have genetic factors, which suggests that&#xD;
      researchers should study not only the individual with the disorder, but also his or her&#xD;
      first- and second-degree relatives (such as parents, siblings, children, and first cousins).&#xD;
      To provide material for future research, individuals with immune disorders and their first-&#xD;
      and second-degree relatives will be asked to provide blood and other samples for testing and&#xD;
      comparison with samples taken from healthy volunteers with no history of immune disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect blood and other biological samples to study immune disorders that make&#xD;
      individuals more susceptible to fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals of any age who have abnormal immune function characterized by recurrent or&#xD;
           unusual fungal infections, recurrent or chronic inflammation, or other types of immune&#xD;
           dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First- or second-degree genetically related family members (limited to mother, father,&#xD;
           siblings, grandparents, children, aunts, uncles, and first cousins).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age (for comparison purposes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide blood samples and buccal (cells from the inside of the mouth&#xD;
           near the cheek) samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with immune disorders will also be asked to provide urine samples, saliva&#xD;
           or mucosal samples, or skin tissue biopsies, and may also have imaging studies (such as&#xD;
           x-rays) to collect information for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples may be collected at the National Institutes of Health or at other clinical&#xD;
           locations for the samples to the sent to the National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed for the evaluation, diagnosis, and long-term follow up of selected&#xD;
      patients with primary immune deficiencies and other conditions associated with fungal, and&#xD;
      more specifically with Candida spp. infections. The primary immune deficiencies to be studied&#xD;
      include, but are not limited to, autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal&#xD;
      dystrophy (APECED), chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), myeloperoxidase deficiency&#xD;
      (MPO), immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked (IPEX), Job s syndrome,&#xD;
      chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and biotinidase deficiency. Diabetic patients and&#xD;
      infants also show increased susceptibility to such infections and might be studied. Patient&#xD;
      participants (who we will refer to as patients in this study) will undergo evaluations that&#xD;
      include history/physical, blood sampling, genetic testing, and possible tissue sampling. We&#xD;
      may use some of the blood cells to investigate the utility of induced pluripotent stem cells&#xD;
      (iPS) for immune cell derivation and targeted gene correction. First or second degree&#xD;
      genetically related family members (limited to mother, father, siblings, grandparents,&#xD;
      children, aunts, uncles, and first cousins of an affected patient and who we will refer to as&#xD;
      relatives in this study) might also be screened for clinical, in vitro, and genetic&#xD;
      correlates of immune abnormalities. Healthy volunteers will be enrolled as a source of&#xD;
      control samples for research testing. Among the aims of this protocol are to better&#xD;
      understand the genetic and pathophysiologic factors that lead to defects in host defense, and&#xD;
      to use modern and evolving methods in molecular and cellular biology to elucidate the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of this particular susceptibility. A better understanding of primary&#xD;
      immunodeficiency could allow for the rational development of novel therapies for such&#xD;
      diseases and to benefit future patients, but it might not benefit current patient&#xD;
      participants directly. Routine follow-up may occur every 6 months -with evaluation and blood&#xD;
      sampling. Under some circumstances, we may provide treatment that relates to the immune&#xD;
      deficiency. These treatments will follow standard medical practice.&#xD;
