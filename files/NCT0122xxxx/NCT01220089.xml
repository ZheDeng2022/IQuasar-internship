    <textblock>
      The study has two primary aims. The first aim is to assess the efficacy of adding in-person&#xD;
      visits to the use of portion-controlled foods for long-term weight loss. The second aim is to&#xD;
      assess the use of trained lay counselors for the maintenance of weight loss. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint of the study will be changes in weight. Secondary endpoints will include changes in&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI), cardiovascular risk factors, health-related quality of life, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. The addition of in-person visits with the weight loss counselor is&#xD;
      predicted to lead to greater long-term weight loss than the use of portion-controlled foods&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

      This study will be a randomized trial of a weight control intervention, with participants&#xD;
      recruited primarily from primary care practices at the University of Colorado. Study&#xD;
      treatment will be delivered at the Center for Human Nutrition, an inter-disciplinary research&#xD;
      clinic which is part of the University of Colorado School of Medicine. If needed,&#xD;
      administrative study visits, such as for informed consent and for completion of&#xD;
      questionnaires, may take place at offices in the Division of General Internal Medicine. Up to&#xD;
      200 patients will be enrolled, of which up to 125 will be provided with 6 months of&#xD;
      high-intensity weight loss counseling. During the first 6 months, each participant will be&#xD;
      seen for 12 counseling visits. These visits will take place at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10,&#xD;
      12, 15, 18, 21, and 24. We estimate that between 10% and 20% of these patients will drop out&#xD;
      prior to 6 months. After the first 6 months, the remaining participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to a treatment condition: Standard Maintenance or Intensified Maintenance. During&#xD;
      months 7 to 18, individuals in the Standard Maintenance condition will receive informational&#xD;
      handouts by mail (or e-mail) regarding weight maintenance, while those in the Intensified&#xD;
      Maintenance condition will continue to have monthly in-person visits with the weight loss&#xD;
      counselor (&quot;Weight Coach&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will use portion-controlled foods to replace 2 meals per day during the&#xD;
      first 6 months of treatment and to replace 1 meal per day during months 7 to 18. Participants&#xD;
      will purchase their own portion-controlled foods, although in-kind contributions from private&#xD;
      industry will be sought to offset participants' food costs. The study consent form will&#xD;
      explicitly describe estimated food costs for study participants. The cost of the meal plan, a&#xD;
      &quot;partial meal replacement&quot; diet (replacement of 2 out of 3 meals per day) is not expected to&#xD;
      increase food costs. Many participants should observe a decrease in food costs while&#xD;
      following the meal plan.&#xD;
