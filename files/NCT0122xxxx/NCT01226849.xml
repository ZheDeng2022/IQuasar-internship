  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incorporation of rituximab to conventional chemotherapy (R-CHOP) has revolutionalized the&#xD;
      frontline treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), one of the commonest subtype of&#xD;
      lymphoma. Although the majority of patients are cured, there still remains a substantial&#xD;
      number patients (20-30%) who will relapse despite upfront R-CHOP therapy. Recent studies have&#xD;
      informed that in the rituximab era, the ability to salvage patients with relapsed DLBCL with&#xD;
      the conventional salvage regimens like R-ICE or R-DHAP is significantly poorer than expected.&#xD;
      For a patients who has been exposed to rituximab in the frontline, the response rate of&#xD;
      conventional salvage chemotherapy is now a mere 51% (Coral Study). This suggests that&#xD;
      relapses after rituximab exposure are more severe, strongly implying the presence of&#xD;
      rituximab-resistant disease in additional to the selection of more aggressive subtypes of&#xD;
      DLBCL which R-CHOP may not have a significant impact on. As R-CHOP is currently the frontline&#xD;
      standard of care, more has to be done to augment the current available salvage regimens as a&#xD;
      response rate of 51% is unacceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incorporation of agents targeting rituximab-resistance and also the more aggressive subtype&#xD;
      of DLBCL ( ABC subtype) is prudent in the salvage regimen. Bortezomib, a targeted novel agent&#xD;
      has potent anti-tumor effects on its own. It has also been show clinically to be able to&#xD;
      overcome the adverse risk conferred by the ABC subtype of DLBCL. In addition, preclinical&#xD;
      studies have also demonstrated that bortezomib may enhance the biologic activity of rituximab&#xD;
      through upregulation of CD20, the target of rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that adding bortezomib to salvage regimen of DLBCL will be more&#xD;
      efficacious. Increasing the response rate will then allow more eligible patients to go on to&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation. The investigators intend to test the tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination of bortezomib with the R-ICE regimen, and attempt to correlate&#xD;
      responses with histopathological and gene expression studies of tumor specimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most commonly used regimen for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)&#xD;
      is the R-ICE regime (rituximab, ifosphamide, cisplatin and etoposide). It was previously&#xD;
      reported to give an overall response rate (RR) of close to 70%, and a complete response rate&#xD;
      of 53%. As most DLBCL patients are now treated in the frontline with R-CHOP regimen, the&#xD;
      validity of RRs with R-ICE needs to be reevaluated. Results of the CORAL study, a prospective&#xD;
      randomized phase III trial comparing R-DHAP vs R-ICE in relapsed DLBCL were recently&#xD;
      presented. It was shown that there was no difference in RR between R-ICE and R-DHAP. However,&#xD;
      the RR of patients who had received prior rituximab in the frontline setting was&#xD;
      significantly lower at 51%, compared with rituximab-naïve patients at 83%. This suggests that&#xD;
      relapses after rituximab exposure are more severe. In addition to the risk of more aggressive&#xD;
      subtype of DLBCL (activated B-cell [ABC]) that may not be abrogated by rituximab, the&#xD;
      presence of rituximab-resistant disease is also strongly implicated. As R-CHOP is currently&#xD;
      the frontline standard of care, more has to be done to augment the current available salvage&#xD;
      regimens. Incorporation of agents targeting the activated B-cell (ABC)subtype and&#xD;
      rituximab-resistance is prudent in the salvage regimen. Bortezomib, a proteosome inhibitor&#xD;
      impacts on many cellular processes relevant to the pathogenesis of DLBCL, including&#xD;
      inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that&#xD;
      bortezomib displayed significant antitumor activity against various lymphomas, and in&#xD;
      particular the ABC subtype of DLBCL. It is also capable of enhancing the biologic activity of&#xD;
      rituximab through upregulation of CD20 in preclinical studies. Demonstration of synergism in&#xD;
      these 2 agents, in part due to their dependence on overlapping pathways, suggests that they&#xD;
      should be explored as a combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this basis, the investigators aim to conduct a pilot study of adding intravenous&#xD;
      bortezomib to R-ICE as a salvage regime for adult patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL.&#xD;
