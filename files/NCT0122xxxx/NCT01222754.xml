  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children who are diagnosed with brain tumors known as high grade gliomas or diffuse&#xD;
      intrinsic pontine gliomas are generally treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.&#xD;
      However, these tumors are very difficult to cure, and the tumor frequently begins to grow&#xD;
      again even after treatment or surgery. Researchers are interested in determining whether the&#xD;
      anticancer drug lenalidomide, which has been used to treat other aggressive types of cancer,&#xD;
      is a safe and effective additional treatment for children who are scheduled to receive&#xD;
      radiation therapy to treat high grade gliomas or diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of lenalidomide, in conjunction with radiation&#xD;
      therapy, as a treatment for children who have been diagnosed with high grade gliomas or&#xD;
      diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children and adolescents up to 21 years of age who have been diagnosed with high grade&#xD;
      gliomas or diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and have not had radiotherapy or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and&#xD;
           urine tests, and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two phases of treatment: a lenalidomide plus radiation phase and&#xD;
           a lenalidomide-only phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the radiation phase, participants will take lenalidomide daily and have 6 weeks&#xD;
           of radiation therapy (five treatments per week). After the radiation therapy,&#xD;
           participants will stop taking lenalidomide for 2 weeks before continuing to the next&#xD;
           phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the lenalidomide-only phase, participants will take lenalidomide daily for 21&#xD;
           days, followed by 7 days without lenalidomide (28-day cycle of treatment). Participants&#xD;
           will have up to 24 cycles of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have frequent blood tests during the first cycle of treatment, and&#xD;
           will have imaging studies or other tests as required by the study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will continue until the disease progresses, the participant chooses to leave&#xD;
           the study, or the researchers end the study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain tumors are the most common solid neoplasm in childhood and the second most common group&#xD;
      of pediatric cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard therapeutic options for brain tumors consist of surgical resection, radiation&#xD;
      therapy and chemotherapy; yet overall survival rates for malignant brain tumors remain low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy plays a key role in the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas&#xD;
      (DIPG) and high-grade gliomas (HGG), and thalidomide has been shown in an animal model to be&#xD;
      a radiosensitizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analog with antiangiogenic, cytotoxic and immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effects, is being evaluated for the treatment of CNS tumors, and has shown tolerability and&#xD;
      activity in pediatric studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the tolerability and toxicity profile of oral lenalidomide when administered to&#xD;
      children with newly diagnosed HGG and DIPG with concurrent radiation at doses up to 116&#xD;
      mg/m(2)/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate long-term tolerability of lenalidomide in children with newly-diagnosed HGG and&#xD;
      DIPG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences for noninvasive monitoring of&#xD;
      metabolic and biologic changes in malignant brain tumors with therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate 6 month and 12 month progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if angiogenic and/or immunomodulatory biomarkers in the blood and urine&#xD;
      correlate with toxicity and disease response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the rate of CNS metastatic disease in patients treated with antiangiogenic&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine any correlation of steady state pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide with time to&#xD;
      progression, number and type of toxicities, and dose limiting toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with newly diagnosed HGG or DIPG, less than 22 years of age, no prior chemotherapy&#xD;
      or radiation therapy, and performance score greater than or equal to 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with HGG must have an inoperable or incompletely resected tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical laboratory tests must be within stated limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two phases to therapy on this study, the Radiation Phase and the Maintenance&#xD;
      Phase. The MTD will be determined by tolerability during the Radiation Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive radiation therapy five days per week to a prescription dose of&#xD;
      54-59.4 Gy, with concurrent administration of lenalidomide daily in a standard Phase I dose&#xD;
      escalation design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of radiation therapy, there will be a two week break followed by&#xD;
      maintenance dosing of lenalidomide for 21 days of a 28 day course, until unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, disease progression or completion of 24 courses of lenalidomide beyond radiotherapy&#xD;
      (unless otherwise approved by PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a multi-center, standard phase I dose escalation design, the total sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      and the study duration are expected to be 18 - 30 patients and 5-6 years, respectively.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histological diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological confirmation of a high-grade malignant glioma is required. Histologic&#xD;
             diagnoses include, but are not limited to, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma&#xD;
             multiforme. Patients with DIPG are exempt from histologic verification if they have&#xD;
             typical MRI findings of DIPG (i.e. hypo- or isointense on T1-weighted imaging,&#xD;
             hyperintense on FLAIR or T2-weighted imaging, epicenter in the pons, greater than 50%&#xD;
             of pons involved) in the face of a typical clinical presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inoperable tumor or residual disease after resection&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -No prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for HGG or DIPG is permitted. Prior&#xD;
        chemotherapy or radiation therapy for treatment of other malignancies is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Patients must be less than 22 years of age at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Able to swallow capsules whole&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance Score:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Patients should have a Karnofsky/Lansky score of greater than or equal to 60. Patients who&#xD;
        require special assistance due to tumor-related paralysis, but who are out of bed during&#xD;
        the day will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of calculating the performance score.&#xD;
        Patients must be able to communicate any symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Laboratory Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following laboratory values must be assessed within seven (7) days prior to the&#xD;
             start of therapy. Laboratory tests should be repeated within 48 hours of beginning&#xD;
             therapy if there has been a significant clinical change.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,000/mcL&#xD;

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine below age-adjusted maximum limits below&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age (Years) Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dl):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Less than or equal to 5 years; 0.8&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Less than 15 years of age; 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  urine or serum pregnancy test negative&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No overt renal, hepatic, cardiac or pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Steroids:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Newly diagnosed patients may need to be on steroids due to surgery or control of&#xD;
        neurologic symptoms. Patients on steroids postoperatively or for control of tumor-related&#xD;
        edema are eligible, but attempts to keep patients on the lowest dose necessary to control&#xD;
        symptoms should be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients of childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Female Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Definition of female of childbearing potential (FCBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who: 1)&#xD;
        has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally&#xD;
        postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing&#xD;
        potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the&#xD;
        preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        --Criteria for female children of childbearing potential (FCCBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        This protocol defines FCCBP as females who have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Achieved menarche and/or breast development in Tanner stage 2 or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
             ----Onset of fertility typically occurs within 3-12 months after menarche. Menarche&#xD;
             varies considerably from person to person, and thus no age cut off can be attributed.&#xD;
             One of the primary tools used to follow a girl s progress through puberty is the&#xD;
             Tanner staging system, which describes the pattern of development of the secondary sex&#xD;
             characteristics. Tanner stage 2 corresponds to the beginning of breast development,&#xD;
             which is the first visible sign of puberty in girls. Breast development is estrogen&#xD;
             stimulated, and since ovulation cannot occur without estrogen, Tanner stage 2 will be&#xD;
             a reliable marker for the definition of fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
        --Criteria for female children not of childbearing potential (FCNCBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        This protocol defines FCNCBP as females:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Who have not yet experienced menarche or breast development in Tanner stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Who have undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
        with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 14 days and again within 24 hours prior&#xD;
        to starting Course 1 of lenalidomide. Further, they must either commit to continued&#xD;
        abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control:&#xD;
        one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least&#xD;
        28 days before starting lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing.&#xD;
        Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP, even if they have&#xD;
        had a successful vasectomy. A FCBP is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a&#xD;
        hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at&#xD;
        least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24&#xD;
        consecutive months). All patients must be counseled by a trained counselor every 28 days&#xD;
        about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Male Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Appropriate male subjects (i.e. those who have reached puberty and are sexually&#xD;
             active) will be counseled regarding birth control methods. They must agree to use a&#xD;
             latex condom during sexual contact with females of childbearing potential while&#xD;
             participating in the study and for at least 28 days following discontinuation from the&#xD;
             study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Appropriate male patients will be given a reproductive risks handout and counseled by&#xD;
             a provider. For sexually active patients, the counseling session, consent and&#xD;
             counseling checklist will be documented monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than18 years old) or durable&#xD;
        power of attorney (DPA) must sign a document of informed consent indicating their&#xD;
        understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study. When appropriate,&#xD;
        pediatric patients will be included in all discussions in order to obtain verbal assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the event that the patient and/or the patient s parents are unable to travel to NIH&#xD;
        should re-consenting be necessary, a telephone consent may be performed by the principal&#xD;
        investigator according to Clinical Center Policy M77-2. The telephone consent will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        witnessed by a member of the research team who is on the telephone with the patient and PI&#xD;
        and who can confirm the patient s consent to participate. A copy of the signed consent will&#xD;
        be mailed to the participant. The consenting process will be documented in the&#xD;
&#xD;
        patient s record which is signed by the PI and co-signed by the witness to the consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Durable Power of Attorney:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Assignment of DPA to a family member or guardian should be offered to all patients 18 years&#xD;
        of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Signed informed consent according to institutional guidelines must be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have had prior chemotherapy for this tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with an HGG that was completed resected with good margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a body surface area (BSA) less than or equal to 0.4 m(2) are excluded because&#xD;
        the lowest dose of the medication is 5 mg in capsule form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a known coagulation disorder are excluded. Patients with a first-degree&#xD;
        relative with a history of venous thrombosis before age 50 yrs or an arterial thrombosis&#xD;
        before age 40 yrs must have the following testing performed prior to enrollment to exclude&#xD;
        a heritable disorder. Patients with a suspected disorder will be excluded due to the&#xD;
        potential increased risk of thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have had a thromboembolic event that is not line-related are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any significant medical illnesses that, in the investigator s opinion, cannot&#xD;
        be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy, would compromise a patient s ability to&#xD;
        tolerate this therapy or result in inability to assess toxicity. This includes, but is not&#xD;
        limited to uncontrolled intercurrent illness including ongoing or active infection, cardiac&#xD;
        disease, renal impairment or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
        compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome are&#xD;
        excluded as this has occurred in patients receiving lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
        composition to lenalidomide (i.e. thalidomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known hypersensitivity to anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose,&#xD;
        croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant or breast feeding females:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide is in a class with the&#xD;
        potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
        potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother&#xD;
        with lenalidomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
        lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
        the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with lenalidomide. In addition, these&#xD;
        patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive&#xD;
        therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients identified as needing spinal radiation at diagnosis (e.g. spinal metastasis or&#xD;
        malignant cells identified on CSF cytology) are excluded due to the increased risk of&#xD;
        myelosuppression.&#xD;
