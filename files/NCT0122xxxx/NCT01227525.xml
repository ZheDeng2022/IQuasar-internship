  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral and physiologic observations suggest that the injection of local anesthetic is&#xD;
      among the most feared or anxiety producing procedures during dental intervention. Discomfort&#xD;
      during the injection is currently reduced by pharmacologic or mechanical methods. No&#xD;
      technique has proven to be effective for every patient. The VibraJect LLC (USA) was first&#xD;
      introduced in 1995 and was developed under the hypothesis that a vibrating needle would&#xD;
      stimulate large diameter nerve fibers and thereby close the gate to smaller nerves carrying&#xD;
      the pain signal from the injection site. Studies on adult patients have been promising. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the VibraJect dental syringe&#xD;
      attachment in reducing injection discomfort and procedural anxiety in the pediatric dental&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      One hundred children will be recruited from the UNMC Pediatric Dentistry clinic. Eligible&#xD;
      children will be selected from the 4-6 year group who are scheduled for routine dental&#xD;
      restorative treatment and who have or have never received a dental injection. Each patient&#xD;
      will randomly participate in either a control or experimental condition. The device will be&#xD;
      attached for both conditions. During the control injection, the dentist will perform the&#xD;
      dental injection as usual. During the experimental injection, the dentist will activate the&#xD;
      attached device and perform the injection. Immediately following each injection, the patient&#xD;
      will rate the pain on a visual analog scale and a trained observer will rate the child's&#xD;
      behavior on a Frankl behavior scale. A videotape of the procedure will be reviewed by an&#xD;
      independent dentist who will evaluate the child's response and any perceived disruptive&#xD;
      behavior. This observer will be blind to whether the instrument is functioning.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Attending the UNMC pediatric dentistry clinic for dental restorations requiring&#xD;
             injection of local anesthetic for restorative procedures with or without use of&#xD;
             inhalation anesthesia but without physical restraint&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. age 4 to 8&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. No parent or legal guardian is present&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Parent does not give consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Non-English speaking participants will be excluded because PI is English speaking and&#xD;
             this study needs behavior guidance of children that only the dentist can deliver and&#xD;
             not an interpreter.&#xD;
