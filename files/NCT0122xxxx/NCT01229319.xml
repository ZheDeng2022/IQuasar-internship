  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Actinic keratoses (AK) are common cutaneous lesions associate with chronic ultraviolet&#xD;
      radiation exposure. While most authorities consider AK as a pre-malignant lesion, some&#xD;
      consider it as an incipient squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In addition, the skin around&#xD;
      clinically obvious AK lesions has been subject to the same chronic ultraviolet exposure,&#xD;
      resulting in genetic damage and mutations, resulting in &quot;field cancerization.&quot; Subclinical&#xD;
      AKs may progress to clinical AKs, or even de novo invasive SCCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the current therapies for the treatment of AK are excisional surgery, cryosurgery,&#xD;
      electrodessication and curettage, topical chemotherapy and light therapies. With cryotherapy,&#xD;
      treated lesion clearance rates at 3 months post-treatment after double-freeze thaw&#xD;
      cryotherapy has been reported to be around 76-88%; Overall lesion clearance rate at&#xD;
      approximately 5 months post-cryosurgery has been reported to be 35-51%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imiquimod is a topical immune response modifier and a 5% formulation has been approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of AKs in the US as a 2x/week for 16 week regimen and in Europe as a 3x/week&#xD;
      for 4 week regimen for 1 or 2 courses of therapy. Topical imiquimod treatment may also reduce&#xD;
      subclinical lesions in the treatment area, resulting in fewer &quot;new&quot; AK lesions developing&#xD;
      over the same period of time when compared to focal treatment. In a comparison of cryosurgery&#xD;
      versus imiquimod for the treatment of AKs, Krawtchenko et al reported initial complete&#xD;
      clearance rates of 68 and 85% by clinical assessment, respectively. However, the treatment&#xD;
      field sustained clearance rate was 4% versus 73%, respectively. Tan et al reported that while&#xD;
      application of imiquimod or vehicle following cryosurgery resulted in comparable target AK&#xD;
      clearance rates at 12 weeks of 79% versus 76%, respectively, the imiquimod group had fewer&#xD;
      total AKs and fewer subclinical AKs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imiquimod cream at a concentration of 3.75% has been found in Phase 3 studies to be superior&#xD;
      to placebo cream with respect to clearance of AKs using a regimen of up to 2 packets (250 mg&#xD;
      of cream per packet, 500 mg total) applied daily to the entire face (approximately 200 cm2)&#xD;
      for two 2-week treatment cycles separated by a 2-week no-treatment period. This study aims to&#xD;
      examine the benefit of cryotherapy in combination with imiquimod 3.75% compared to&#xD;
      cryotherapy alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Actinic keratoses (AK) are common cutaneous lesions associate with chronic ultraviolet&#xD;
      radiation exposure. Ultraviolet radiation produces local and systemic immunosuppression,&#xD;
      mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, and deoxyribonucleic acid pyrimidine covalent&#xD;
      dimmers, each of which is believed to contribute to the dysplasia seen in AK. While most&#xD;
      authorities consider AK as a pre-malignant lesion, some consider it as an incipient squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (SCC). The risk for progression to SCC for an individual AK is reportedly low&#xD;
      but highly variable; however, as patients often have multplie AKs, the overall risk for&#xD;
      progression over a lifetime can be significant; thus treatment of AKs is warranted. In&#xD;
      addition, the skin around clinically obvious AK lesions has been subject to the same chronic&#xD;
      ultraviolet exposure, resulting in genetic damage and mutations, resulting in &quot;field&#xD;
      cancerization.&quot; Subclinical AKs may progress to clinical AKs, or even de novo invasive SCCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the current therapies for the treatment of AK are excisional surgery, cryosurgery,&#xD;
      electrodessication and curettage, topical chemotherapy and light therapies. With&#xD;
      provider-administered devices, temperature utilized, times of contact, and other variations&#xD;
      in administration, influence efficacy of treatment. Efficacy can be improved by increasing&#xD;
      the freeze time, but this is often associated with greater discomfort, more severe skin&#xD;
      necrosis, and increased risk of post-treatment hypopigmentation. In addition, as with other&#xD;
      lesion-directed therapies, cryosurgery does not treat subclinical lesions in the surrounding&#xD;
      skin. Treated lesion clearance rates at 3 months post-treatment after double-freeze thaw&#xD;
      cryotherapy has been reported to be around 76-88%; however, new lesions in the treatment&#xD;
      field were not included. Overall lesion clearance rate, including new subclinical lesions, at&#xD;
      approximately 5 months post-cryosurgery has been reported to be 35-51%. There is limited&#xD;
      information on long-term AK clearance rates after cryosurgery and those reports differ in&#xD;
      their methods of calculation. In a study comparing cyrotherapy, imiquimod and 5-fluorouracil,&#xD;
      at 12 months post cryotherapy 28% (7/25) had complete clearance of baseline lesions that had&#xD;
      undergone cryotherapy, but only 4% (1/25) had complete clearance of the treatment field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imiquimod is a topical immune response modifier that activates the innate immune system via&#xD;
      Toll-like receptor 7, as well as enhances the acquired immune system. A 5% topical&#xD;
      formulation has been approved for the treatment of AKs in the US as a 2x/week for 16 week&#xD;
      regimen and in Europe as a 3x/week for 4 week regimen for 1 or 2 courses of therapy. Topical&#xD;
      imiquimod treatment may also reduce subclinical lesions in the treatment area, resulting in&#xD;
      fewer &quot;new&quot; AK lesions developing over the same period of time when compared to focal&#xD;
      treatment. In a comparison of cryosurgery versus imiquimod for the treatment of AKs,&#xD;
      Krawtchenko et al reported initial complete clearance rates of 68 and 85% by clinical&#xD;
      assessment, respectively. However, the treatment field sustained clearance rate was 4% versus&#xD;
      73%, respectively. Tan et al reported that while application of imiquimod or vehicle&#xD;
      following cryosurgery resulted in comparable target AK clearance rates at 12 weeks of 79%&#xD;
      versus 76%, respectively, the imiquimod group had fewer total AKs and fewer subclinical AKs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imiquimod 5% formulation has limitations for the treatment of AKs. It is approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of a small area of skin (25 cm2), uses a less than intuitive 2 times per week&#xD;
      (2x/week) dosing schedule, and has a prolonged treatment period (16 weeks). Dosing more&#xD;
      frequently than 3x/week with imiquimod 5% cream was not well tolerated in subjects with AK.&#xD;
      Imiquimod cream at a concentration of 3.75% has been found in Phase 3 studies to be superior&#xD;
      to placebo cream with respect to clearance of AKs using a regimen of up to 2 packets (250 mg&#xD;
      of cream per packet, 500 mg total) applied daily to the entire face (approximately 200 cm2)&#xD;
      for two 2-week treatment cycles separated by a 2-week no-treatment period.&#xD;
