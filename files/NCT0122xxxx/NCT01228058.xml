  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of thrombelastography (TEG) to&#xD;
      predict and identify trauma patients at increased risk of receiving blood transfusion,&#xD;
      develop multiple organ failure and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEG has been proposed as a superior tool to rapidly diagnose and help guide resuscitation&#xD;
      with blood products and preclinical data suggest that TEG is both more sensitive and specific&#xD;
      than PT or PTT for coagulation abnormalities. Based on the preclinical work led by Dr.&#xD;
      Holcomb, our hypothesis is that the Rapid TEG will help to identify these coagulopathic&#xD;
      patients earlier, allow for rapid MT protocol activation, and assist in developing data&#xD;
      driven blood product transfusion guidelines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is based on the fact that approximately 30% of severely injured military and&#xD;
      civilian patients have disturbances of coagulation immediately upon arrival to the trauma&#xD;
      center by traditional coagulation testing. It is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the coagulopathy of these patients may be detected more rapidly with RapidTEG than with&#xD;
           traditional coagulation testing (prothrombin time, PT; international normalized ratio,&#xD;
           INR; activated partial thromboplastin time, aPTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the disturbances in the different RapidTEG parameters will correlate with early blood&#xD;
           product utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the RapidTEG parameters will correlate closely with patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the Rapid TEG will be able to describe the changes that occur with coagulation over time&#xD;
           and do so for patients with different injury mechanisms and severities&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group has recently completed enrollment on the PRospective, Observational, Multi-center&#xD;
      Massive Transfusion sTudy (PROMMTT) to evaluate the process, the decision-making, and&#xD;
      outcomes associated with MT. This trial is supported by a ten million dollar grant from the&#xD;
      U.S. Department of Defense for the Center for Translational Injury Research (CeTIR) and it&#xD;
      investigators to conduct a multi-site observational study of severely injured trauma patients&#xD;
      who require blood transfusions. Through our efforts, we hope to determine the best method of&#xD;
      identifying patients who will benefit from receiving different ratios of red blood cells to&#xD;
      plasma to platelets. This study was also designed to evaluate existing MT protocols at ten&#xD;
      leading trauma centers and to identify which protocols are associated with better survival.&#xD;
      Results of this study will be used to develop a future randomized clinical trial that will&#xD;
      test these protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on the authors proven experience with (1) predictive scoring methods to predict&#xD;
      massive transfusion, (2) creation and maturation of a massive transfusion protocol, and (3)&#xD;
      design of large, multi-institutional studies, the PROMMTT investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study of severely injured patients (major trauma activations) arriving to&#xD;
      three ACS-verified academic Level 1 Trauma Centers, in which the following 3 aims will be&#xD;
      addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the prevalence and severity of immediate disturbances in coagulation by&#xD;
           both RapidTEG and conventional coagulation parameters among major trauma activations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if there are specific abnormalities of RapidTEG that correlate with&#xD;
           specific early blood product utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if RapidTEG abnormalities, when compared to kaolin-activated TEG, PT, INR&#xD;
           and aPTT, correlate with patient outcomes in severely injured patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the temporal relationship between RapidTEG parameters and anatomic injury,&#xD;
           mechanism of injury, and severity of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEG has been proposed as a superior tool to rapidly diagnose and help guide resuscitation&#xD;
      with blood products and preclinical data suggest that TEG is both more sensitive and specific&#xD;
      than PT or PTT for coagulation abnormalities. Based on the preclinical work led by Dr&#xD;
      Holcomb, we feel that the Rapid TEG will help to identify these coagulopathic patients&#xD;
      earlier, allow for rapid MT protocol activation, and assist in developing data driven blood&#xD;
      product transfusion guidelines. While the TEG machine is not new, widespread and thoughtful&#xD;
      implementation in the trauma arena has not occurred. There are no transfusion algorithms&#xD;
      constructed on large numbers of patients, admission TEG and PT/PTT values, transfusion&#xD;
      amounts and patient outcomes. We feel that a logical step-by-step program that first&#xD;
      constructs a data driven algorithm, and then validates the algorithm is the safest pathway to&#xD;
      follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to perform RapidTEG upon admission, at 3-hours post-admission, 6-hours&#xD;
      post-admission, 12-hours post-admission, 24-hours post-admission, and then daily for 4&#xD;
      additional days. Blood samples (2 mL non-citrated fresh whole blood) will be obtained in&#xD;
      addition to standard blood samples for major trauma patients. RapidTEG will be performed&#xD;
      using the Thrombelastograph 5000 (Hemoscope Corporation, Niles, IL). Coagulation will be&#xD;
      activated by tissue factor. Standard parameters will be obtained using Hemoscope software:&#xD;
      TEG-ACT, r-time, K-time, alpha angle, maximum amplitude (mA), and LY30. In addition to&#xD;
      RapidTEG, we plan to perform conventional kaolin-activated TEG, prothrombin time (PT),&#xD;
      international normalized ratio (INR), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), and platelet&#xD;
      count using standard methods. The time from obtaining the blood sample until the time that&#xD;
      the results are made available will also be recorded for all parameters tested. For the&#xD;
      RapidTEG, this will include the final results for the test as well as the times that the&#xD;
      TEG-ACT, alpha angle, and MA become available by graphical display.&#xD;
