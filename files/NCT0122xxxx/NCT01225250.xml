      The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy, safety, and ease of cartilaginous&#xD;
      grafting using polydioxanone (PDS) plates in comparison to non-plated cartilaginous grafts as&#xD;
      performed through an endonasal rhinoplasty approach in patients requiring a caudal septal&#xD;

    <measure>Live Assessment of Satisfaction With the Grafts</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post operative</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be determined by a live assessment of satisfaction with the grafts at 12 months using a four-point categorical satisfaction scale ((4) unsatisfied, (3) satisfied, (2) very satisfied, (1) highly satisfied).&#xD;
Scores closer to 1 indicate a more favorable outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Tip Projection</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months Post opeartive</time_frame>
    <description>Tip projection will be measured using standardized photography preoperatively and at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively using Goode's Ratio.&#xD;
The ratio of the line from the alar crease to the nasal tip to the nasion to the nasal tip should be 0.55. If it is more than that the nose is over projected, if it is under that ratio the nose is under projected.</description>

    <measure>Non-treating Blinded Evaluator Satisfaction Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months; Month 12 reported</time_frame>
    <description>A non-treating blinded evaluator will assess satisfaction with a four-point categorical satisfaction scale ((4) - unsatisfied, (3) - satisfied, (2) - very satisfied, (1) - highly satisfied) of subject's grafts using photographs from baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months and will consist of a blinded evaluation in which the physician is aware of the type of graft, but unaware of plating status or the specific grafting site.&#xD;
Scores closer to 1 indicate a more favorable outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ease of Use</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Ease of use will be determined by the treating investigator using a 10 cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to demonstrate technical ease with a score of 0 mm being easy and a scale of 100 mm being extremely difficult.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Infection, Rejection, and Extrusion of the Graft at 1 Week, 1 Month, 3 Months, 6 Months, and 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be determined by rate of infection, rejection, and extrusion of the graft at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraoperative Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>During surgery (up to 3 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The intraoperative duration of the grafting procedure will be measured by an assistant using a stopwatch to record the time it takes to harvest, shape, and satisfactorily secure the graft.</description>

Caudal septal extension graft performed through endonasal rhinoplasty: The caudal septal extension (CSE) graft is a common method used to alter tip projection, alar-columellar relationship, and nasolabial angle.5 However, it can be difficult to stabilize and straighten the CSE graft, especially when performed through an endonasal approach.

Caudal septal extension graft performed through endonasal rhinoplasty: The caudal septal extension (CSE) graft is a common method used to alter tip projection, alar-columellar relationship, and nasolabial angle.5 However, it can be difficult to stabilize and straighten the CSE graft, especially when performed through an endonasal approach. Use of a polydioxanone plate would provide a scaffolding for the CSE graft and could allow for a technically easier and more predictable surgical procedure.</description>
