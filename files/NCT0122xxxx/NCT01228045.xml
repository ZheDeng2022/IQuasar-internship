  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that the combination of TS-ONE with cisplatin and trastuzumab&#xD;
      is safe and as effective as combination treatment for HER2 positive gastric cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric carcinoma is the second most common cause of cancer death world-wide. Approximately&#xD;
      875,000 patients are diagnosed world-wide with gastric cancer each year. Gastric cancer is&#xD;
      often diagnosed at an advanced stage1. At diagnosis, while some patients have gastric&#xD;
      carcinoma that extends within loco-regional confines and can undergo a curative resection,&#xD;
      many patients cannot undergo curative resection. Gastric cancer continues to pose a major&#xD;
      medical challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While advanced gastric carcinoma is incurable, chemotherapy can have a palliative effect in&#xD;
      symptomatic patients. Chemotherapy improves outcome compared to best supportive care in&#xD;
      gastric cancer. Various chemotherapeutic agents including 5-FU, mitomycin, etoposide,&#xD;
      cisplatin, irinotecan and the taxanes, have demonstrated activity as monotherapy. Combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy has been shown to have better survival outcomes than single agent chemotherapy&#xD;
      Standard chemotherapy for advanced gastric carcinoma includes a fluoropyrimidine and platinum&#xD;
      -based combination chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>The initial dose of cisplatin is fixed to be 60 mg/m2 and intravenously administered over 1 hour on day 1 of the cycle. TS-ONE is orally administered consecutive 14-day followed by 7-day rest. The initial standard dose of TS-ONE is determined based on the body surface area tabled below. Trastuzumab is intravenously administered with the loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by maintenance dose of 6mg/kg in day 1 of each cycle. The study treatments are repeated every 3 weeks. Study treatment can continue until PD, but cisplatin can be skipped or discontinued if patients experienced unbearable toxicity which comes from cisplatin.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive treatment that combined TS-ONE, cisplatin and trastuzumab every 3 weeks in this study. This 3 weeks period of time is called a cycle. The cycle will be repeated until subject experience disease progression or unbearable toxicities or they choose to withdraw from the study. Each cycle is numbered in order.</description>
