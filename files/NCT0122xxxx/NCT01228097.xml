      This study will compare brain and hormone responses to food images (and food) in women who&#xD;
      undergo: (1) gastric bypass surgery; (2) principally restrictive surgery (laparoscopic&#xD;
      adjustable gastric banding or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy); or (3) no weight loss&#xD;
      surgery, with the intent of remaining relatively weight stable (within 10-15 lb of your&#xD;
      present weight). The investigators will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to see how the&#xD;
      brain responds to pictures of food and to consuming a liquid meal replacement. The&#xD;
      investigators wish to determine whether the two surgeries have different effects on appetite,&#xD;
      as observable in the brain, and whether the possible effects on appetite differ from those in&#xD;
      participants who have a similar body weight but remain relatively weight stable. The&#xD;
      investigators also will draw blood to determine how &quot;hunger&quot; and &quot;fullness&quot; hormones change&#xD;
      after eating and to see if there are any differences among the three groups. The study is&#xD;
      being sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that RYGB-treated patients will exhibit greater reductions (from baseline) in&#xD;
      BOLD response in areas associated with homeostatic and hedonic eating than will both LAGB/LSG&#xD;
      and control patients. We also expect that LAGB/LSG patients (as a result of hormonal changes&#xD;
      occurring with weight loss) will display greater increases in BOLD response to images of&#xD;
      highly palatable foods than will extremely obese controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that RYGB-treated patients will show larger increases (relative to baseline) in&#xD;
      postprandial GLP-1 and PYY3-36 than the LAGB/LSG and obese control groups. We will also&#xD;
      compare changes in ghrelin in the three groups. We predict that patients who undergo RYGB&#xD;
      will have greater reductions in ghrelin than will control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that RYGB-treated patients will demonstrate greater postprandial changes (relative&#xD;
      to baseline) in brain activity in the homeostatic and hedonic feeding areas (suggesting&#xD;
      normalization of satiety and of neural processing of food reward) than will patients who&#xD;
      undergo LAGB/LSG or who do not seek weight loss.&#xD;
