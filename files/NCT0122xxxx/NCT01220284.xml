  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vinorelbine (NVB) and platinum compounds are anticancer agents with broad spectrum of&#xD;
      efficacy, clinically and preclinically proven synergism and only partially overlapping&#xD;
      toxicities. Combinations with vinorelbine and platinum compounds with limited neurotoxicity&#xD;
      are among the most used palliative regimens in a variety of solid tumors, including NSCLC,&#xD;
      breast and cervical cancer. The oral platinum analogue satraplatin (SATRA) has been brought&#xD;
      into clinical development because of the antitumor activity and toxicity comparable to those&#xD;
      of carboplatin, together with a good acceptability of the oral administration.The recent&#xD;
      availability of oral formulation of anticancer agents of proven efficacy in some indications&#xD;
      is likely to become a valid option which could affect clinical daily management. The oral&#xD;
      administration of vinorelbine and satraplatin might represent a reasonable option of&#xD;
      palliative treatment in patients with advanced breast cancer, NSCL, GU or GY tumors for which&#xD;
      a curative treatment can not be provided.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically/ cytologically confirmed solid tumor that is metastatic or unresectable&#xD;
             and for which standard curative or palliative chemotherapy measures do not exist or&#xD;
             are no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histological/cytological diagnosis of solid tumors in which treatment with oral&#xD;
             vinorelbine and oral platinum compounds(preferentially breast, NSCL, GU or GY tumors)&#xD;
             is medically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Progressive disease (also in terms of tumor markers only, like CA 125 for ovary and&#xD;
             PSA for prostate). No measurable disease is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age 18-75 years&#xD;
