      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Treatment outcomes for substance abuse are improved by regular attendance at counseling&#xD;
      sessions, and attending at counseling sessions can be futher improved by prize-based&#xD;
      incentives. However, a system of prize-based incentives can be difficult to administer&#xD;
      without computerization for accurate recordkeeping and rapid calculation of earnings. NIDA&#xD;
      researchers have developed the eXtensible Platform for Motivational Incentives (XPMI), a&#xD;
      computer program that for reinforcement of weekly counseling attendance. Users are eligible&#xD;
      to win prizes through automated draws. The researchers are interested in testing the&#xD;
      effectiveness and ease of use of the XPMI software so it can ultimately be run by staff in&#xD;
      community treatment programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the XPMI program in a clinic setting, with emphasis on its functionality,&#xD;
           usability, and acceptability for counselors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test and validate XPMI s accuracy in calculating incentives to reinforce drug&#xD;
           abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are participating in clinical trials for treatment&#xD;
      of heroin dependence in an outpatient treatment-research program, and have at least 14 weeks&#xD;
      remaining in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will meet with their counselors as regularly scheduled. Twelve of the&#xD;
           visits will count toward this study, with 2 extra weeks in case of counselor absence or&#xD;
           clinic closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive an incentive in the form of a prize draw for arriving to&#xD;
           counseling appointments on time, on the scheduled day. (Participants may reschedule one&#xD;
           appointment per week without losing the chance for a prize draw.) For each consecutive&#xD;
           appointment attended on time, participants will receive extra prize draws; attending&#xD;
           three counseling appointments in a row can earn four bonus prize draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To draw for prizes, participants will push a button on a computer. Each prize draw could&#xD;
           result in a small prize worth $1 to $2, a large prize worth $20, a jumbo prize worth&#xD;
           $100, or no prize at all. The average prize total per person is expected to be about&#xD;
           $378.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also be asked to fill out questionnaires about the computer program.&#xD;

      Background. Community implementation is a barrier to technology transfer of contingency&#xD;
      management (CM), an effective behavioral treatment for substance dependence. The Biomedical&#xD;
      Informatics Section (BIS), the Treatment Section, and the NIDA Blending team are developing&#xD;
      and validating software for automated contingency management (ACM) for free distribution and&#xD;
      use in community treatment programs. This is part of a collaborative effort between NIDA and&#xD;
      SAMHSA to facilitate use of CM in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific goals. To validate the usability and robustness of our ACM program, eXtensible&#xD;
      Platform for Motivational Incentives (XPMI), implemented under conditions simulating those of&#xD;
      a community treatment program with minimal technology support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant population. Up to 30 outpatients (20 completers) participating in treatment&#xD;
      studies at Archway clinic. Target enrollment for the outpatients will include 30% women and&#xD;
      60% minorities (mostly African-American).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods. In this field test, Archway counseling staff will use XPMI&#xD;
      to reinforce participants attendance at up to 12 counseling sessions for up to 14 weeks.&#xD;
      (Participants who are still enrolled in the clinic at the end of this period will be&#xD;
      considered completers.) Participants will earn opportunities to draw for prizes each time&#xD;
      they attend their weekly counseling session on time and as scheduled. A record of any&#xD;
      problems in using the program and the possible recommended solutions will be maintained.&#xD;
      Feedback on problems, accuracy, and simplicity will be given to the software-development team&#xD;
      at BIS on an ongoing basis. BIS will fix any problems as they arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to participants and/or society. There are no direct benefits to the participants.&#xD;
      Availability of XPMI may improve technology transfer of a proven effective treatment to the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to participants. Risks of participation are minimal. This is a secondary study;&#xD;
      participants decisions about enrollment and compliance will not affect their status in their&#xD;
      primary studies.&#xD;
