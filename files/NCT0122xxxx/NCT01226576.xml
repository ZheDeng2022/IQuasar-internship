    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this feasibility study is that focal treatment with ExAblate MRgFUS has the&#xD;
      potential to be a safe and effective non-invasive treatment for low to intermediate risk,&#xD;
      organ-confined prostate cancer involving low incidence of morbidity. The study hypothesis&#xD;
      will be tested by measuring treatment-related safety and initial effectiveness parameters in&#xD;
      the ExAblate MRgFUS treated patients, as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the result of this study, InSightec will initiate a larger study in an effort to&#xD;
      approve low risk, organ-confined prostate cancer as an indication for its ExAblate MRgFUS&#xD;
      device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective of this feasibility trial is to assess safety and initial effectiveness of ExAblate&#xD;
      MRgFUS in the treatment of low to intermediate risk, localized (organ confined) prostate&#xD;
      cancer tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ExAblate treatment will be implemented as a focal tumor-selective therapy, directed at&#xD;
      pre-defined volume(s)/sector(s) in the prostate, (identified as cancerous by mapping biopsy&#xD;
      with or without multi-parametric MRI), rather than a whole gland or hemi-ablation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: evaluate incidence and severity of adverse events associated with ExAblate's MRgFUS&#xD;
      focal treatment of low risk organ confined prostate cancer. The risk of ExAblate&#xD;
      treatment-related incontinence and impotence will also be assessed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness: determine the tumor control effect of ExAblate's MRgFUS focal treatment of low&#xD;
      risk organ-confined prostate cancer (confirmed by TRUS-guided Transperineal Mapping Biopsy&#xD;
      results).&#xD;
