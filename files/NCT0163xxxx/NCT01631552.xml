  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective in Phase I is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sacituzumab&#xD;
      govitecan-hziy (SG) as a single agent administered in 21-day treatment cycles in previously&#xD;
      treated participants with advanced epithelial cancer. In Phase II, the primary objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy administered in 21-day&#xD;
      treatment cycles at a dose selected in Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor types in the study will include: cervical, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian,&#xD;
      esophageal, gastric adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck cancers- squamous&#xD;
      cell, hepatocellular, prostate, non-small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic, renal cell,&#xD;
      small-cell lung cancer, non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC), triple-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer (TNBC) and metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC).&#xD;

      The outcome measures are planned to be assessed up to the data cutoff date. Following the&#xD;
      data cutoff date, the participants will either stay on the study and will be followed for&#xD;
      safety data collection or rolled into another Gilead-sponsored study. Therefore, only safety&#xD;
      data will be collected after the data cutoff date.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any adverse events (AEs) that begin or worsen on or after the start of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The severity was graded based on the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03. An AE that met one or more of the following outcomes was classified as serious:&#xD;
Fatal&#xD;
Life-threatening&#xD;
Disabling/incapacitating&#xD;
Results in hospitalization or prolongs a hospital stay&#xD;
A congenital abnormality&#xD;
Other important medical events may also be considered serious AEs if they may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled at study sites in the United States. The first participant was screened on 17 December 2012. The last study visit occurred on 13 August 2020.&#xD;
Outcome Measures were assessed up to the data cutoff date of 01 March 2019. Following the data cutoff date, the participants either stayed on the study and were followed for safety data collection or rolled into another Gilead-sponsored study. Therefore, only safety data was collected after the data cutoff date.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Tumor types included in the study were as follows: cervical, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, esophageal, gastric adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck cancers- squamous cell, hepatocellular, prostate, non-small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic, renal cell, small-cell lung cancer, non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Any Treatment Emergent Adverse Events and Serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Events</title>
        <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any adverse events (AEs) that begin or worsen on or after the start of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The severity was graded based on the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03. An AE that met one or more of the following outcomes was classified as serious:&#xD;
Fatal&#xD;
Life-threatening&#xD;
Disabling/incapacitating&#xD;
Results in hospitalization or prolongs a hospital stay&#xD;
A congenital abnormality&#xD;
Other important medical events may also be considered serious AEs if they may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above&#xD;
Per planned analysis, populations to be used for evaluation of this outcome measure were as follows: Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Target Population, HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer (mBC) Population, Metastatic Urothelial Cancer (mUC) Population, and Overall Safety Population.</description>

        <description>T1/2 was determined for 5 analytes: total antibody, SN-38 glucuronide, total SN-38, free SN-38, and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, a derived antibody drug conjugate (ADC) concentration. SN-38 is one of the components of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. T1/2 is defined as apparent terminal elimination half-life (h); calculated as 0.693/λz.

          <description>T1/2 was determined for 5 analytes: total antibody, SN-38 glucuronide, total SN-38, free SN-38, and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, a derived antibody drug conjugate (ADC) concentration. SN-38 is one of the components of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. T1/2 is defined as apparent terminal elimination half-life (h); calculated as 0.693/λz.

        <description>AUC0-inf was determined for 5 analytes: total antibody, SN-38 glucuronide, total SN-38, free SN-38, and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, a derived antibody drug conjugate (ADC) concentration. SN-38 is one of the components of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. AUC0-inf is defined as area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity. The dose level evaluated for PK analysis was 10 mg/kg.</description>
