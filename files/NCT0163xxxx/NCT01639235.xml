  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study on a population of flight attendants who were exposed to occupational&#xD;
      secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS). This research will examine associations between flight&#xD;
      attendant SHS exposure and development of respiratory illnesses, reproductive problems, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of this study is that exposure to the secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) in&#xD;
      the confined workspace of commercial aircraft prior to the ban of cigarette smoking is&#xD;
      responsible for long-term damage on the health of nonsmoking flight attendants. We will&#xD;
      compare the data collected from our pre-ban flight attendant participants to age-matched,&#xD;
      nonsmoking controls from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)&#xD;
      database. The results of our study should permit us to determine if SHS exposure is the cause&#xD;
      of long-term increased cardiovascular morbidity and risk, as well as increased susceptibility&#xD;
      to respiratory illnesses.&#xD;

    <measure>Characterize the long term effects of prolonged flight time and SHS on reproductive health</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Flight attendants fill out the electronic Exposure Questionnaire prior to their appointments. Part of the Questionnaire is a section on reproductive health. The answers to these survey questions in addition to information gathered and saved in the local medical record system (APeX) during the clinic visit are used for analysis on reproductive health of flight attendants.</description>

    <description>A 45 mL blood specimen is drawn from interested patients to be stored in the research lab as well as analyzed in a University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) laboratory. Results of the blood analysis performed in the research labs, such as secondhand smoke biomarkers and advanced lipid biomarkers, will not be shared with the subject.</description>

      There is an optional blood draw blood portion to the research study. A sample is collected&#xD;
      from the interested flight attendant. The majority of the sample is processed and stored in&#xD;
      the FAMRI biorepository for future research purposes to identify biomarkers of cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk and secondhand smoke. The remainder of the sample is analyzed for the flight attendant.&#xD;
      A lipid profile is sent to the flight attendant participant.&#xD;

             tobacco use of less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. SHS exposure for at least 1 year while working with the airlines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Less than 1 year of occupational exposure to SHS&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Smoking more than 100 cigarettes over a lifetime&#xD;
