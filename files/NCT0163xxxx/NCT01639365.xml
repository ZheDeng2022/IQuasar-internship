  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pressure exerted by the ablation catheter on the tissue has been shown to play an&#xD;
      important role on determining the size and the potential efficacy of the ablation lesions. A&#xD;
      direct information on the force exerted by the catheter tip obtained from the SmartTouch&#xD;
      technology might improve the assessment of the scar areas during electroanatomical mapping in&#xD;
      patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) due to ischemic disease or cardiomyopathy. The&#xD;
      objectives of the study are to compare the areas of scar (defined as a low-voltage threshold)&#xD;
      obtained from the conventional voltage map with those obtained after the contact map&#xD;
      information is available to the operator and to determine if the availability of the contact&#xD;
      information allows an improvement of the electroanatomic map by correcting the points taken&#xD;
      in no-contact areas. Twenty to 30 consecutive patients with ventricular arrhythmias due to&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy undergoing VT ablation will be included in a&#xD;
      prospective, one-center, non-randomized study. A voltage map of the left ventricle will be&#xD;
      obtained using the CARTO-3 navigation system and the scar areas as well as the areas of&#xD;
      potential interest for ablation will be delineated in the standard way and saved as the&#xD;
      control map. The force information will be recorded by the system but will not be available&#xD;
      to the operator until the control map is saved. Following this step the contact map will be&#xD;
      available to the operator to be compared with the control map and further mapping and point&#xD;
      acquisition will be allowed to correct the areas previously acquired with poor or no contact.&#xD;
      The final map after corrections have been made will be saved as the corrected map. The&#xD;
      ablation procedure will then be performed as usual. Both maps will be compared in a deferred&#xD;
      way to know how are classified the areas without contact when no pressure information is&#xD;
      available, and how many non-contact points are falsely assumed to be low-voltage or dense&#xD;
      scar points. These comparisons will give information on how much the standard electroanatomic&#xD;
      map can be improved when the force information is added.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The usual ablation catheters do not provide direct information on the pressure applied at the&#xD;
      contact area of the cardiac structures. However, pressure has been shown to play an important&#xD;
      role on determining the size and the potential efficacy of the ablation lesions. The physical&#xD;
      contact of the tip of the catheter with the tissue and the force exerted on this tissue are&#xD;
      indirectly estimated from other parameters such as the signal voltage, the transmitted force&#xD;
      to the other end of the catheter felt by the operator and, in a lesser extent, the circuit&#xD;
      impedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A widespread technique for ablation of ventricular tachycardias (VT) in patients with&#xD;
      cardiomyopathies or ischemic disease consists on the creation of an electroanatomic map to&#xD;
      delineate scar areas without electric activity and to look for areas of surviving myocardium&#xD;
      inside, at the borders or between the scars, operating as a slow conduction channel in a&#xD;
      reentry circuit and playing an essential role in the genesis of VTs. The distinction between&#xD;
      scar and normal tissue is predominantly based on the voltage of the unipolar or bipolar&#xD;
      electrograms (EGM) recorded at the tip of the ablation catheter. However, the amplitude of&#xD;
      the electrogram depends critically on the distance between the electrode and the source of&#xD;
      the electric field, in this case the myocardial tissue. The lack of contact between the&#xD;
      catheter and the endocardium will reduce the EGM voltage and may induce to interpret a normal&#xD;
      EGM point as a low-voltage point, leading to an erroneous delineation of the real scar areas&#xD;
      and eventually missing electrically active myocardial paths. Thus a good physical contact&#xD;
      between the catheter and the tissue is a prerequisite to obtain a reliable voltage map and to&#xD;
      correctly identify scars and areas potentially involved in the VT maintenance. A direct&#xD;
      information on the force applied at the tip of the catheter may avoid the interpretation of&#xD;
      areas with no-contact induced low-voltage as scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that the information on the force exerted by the catheter tip&#xD;
      obtained from the SmartTouch technology may improve the assessment of the scar areas during&#xD;
      electroanatomical mapping in patients with VT due to ischemic disease or cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives and endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two are the main objectives of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the areas of scar (defined as a low-voltage threshold) obtained from the&#xD;
           conventional voltage map with those obtained after the contact map information is&#xD;
           available to the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if the availability of the contact information to the operator allows an&#xD;
           improvement of the electroanatomic map by correcting the points taken in no-contact&#xD;
           areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consecutive patients with ventricular arrhythmias due to ischemic heart disease or&#xD;
           dilated cardiomyopathy undergoing VT ablation will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria will be age &lt;18 years, absence of signed informed consent or critical&#xD;
           clinical status that precludes a detailed mapping procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is planned as a prospective, one-center, non-randomized study. As the&#xD;
           objectives are purely descriptive no formal calculation of the sample size has been&#xD;
           performed. Considering the inclusion criteria and the frequency of this type of studies&#xD;
           in our unit a number of 20 to 30 patients is estimated to be included in 12 months. We&#xD;
           believe that this number of patients is reasonable to estimate the value of the contact&#xD;
           map to delineate scars from a clinical point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Protocol and procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our standard approach to ischemic VT ablation begins with the acquisition of a voltage&#xD;
           map of the left ventricle during sinus rhythm of fixed pacing from the right ventricular&#xD;
           apex using the CARTO-3 navigation system and a Navistar irrigated catheter. During the&#xD;
           acquisition, points with fragmented or delayed potentials are tagged as areas of&#xD;
           potential interest for ablation. Once the map is completed we adjust the color code of&#xD;
           the voltage map trying to decide the areas of dense scar and to look for potential&#xD;
           narrow paths inside or between the areas of scar. After adjusting the map in this way we&#xD;
           proceed to the ablation, which is performed during induced VT or guided by the&#xD;
           anatomical and electrical information in case of non-inducible or non-tolerated VTs.&#xD;
           Pace-mapping is eventually used if a 12-lead ECG of the clinical VT is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the patients included in the study the voltage map will be acquired in the same way&#xD;
           using the Thermo-Cool Smart Touch catheter. The force information will be recorded by&#xD;
           the system but will not be available to the operator during the map acquisition. The&#xD;
           completed voltage map with the areas defined as dense scar by the operator, the&#xD;
           isthmuses found inside or between scars and the areas with fragmented or delayed&#xD;
           potentials will be saved as the control map. Following this step the contact map will be&#xD;
           available to the operator to be compared with the control map and further mapping and&#xD;
           point acquisition will be allowed to correct the areas previously acquired with poor or&#xD;
           no contact. The final map after corrections have been made will be saved as the&#xD;
           corrected map. The ablation procedure will then be performed as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Map analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The comparison of the maps will be done in a deferred way. First, the control map and&#xD;
           the contact map will be compared. The area without contact in the pressure map will be&#xD;
           estimated. Each point inside this area will be classified as dense scar, low-voltage&#xD;
           point or normal voltage point according to the properties of the point in the control&#xD;
           map. We will determine in this way how are classified the areas without contact when no&#xD;
           pressure information is available, and how many non-contact points are falsely assumed&#xD;
           to be dense scar. The areas of &quot;real&quot; dense scar and &quot;assumed, non-contact&quot; dense scar&#xD;
           will be estimated as well. This step of the analysis will give information on how many&#xD;
           low-voltage areas of the standard electroanatomic map may not be reliable due to lack of&#xD;
           an appropriate contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The control and the corrected map will then be compared. The areas and the number of&#xD;
           points defined as dense scar by the operator in both maps will be compared and the&#xD;
           points changing their status as scar, low or normal voltage from the control to the&#xD;
           corrected map will be annotated as well. Finally, the differences in the potential&#xD;
           isthmuses depicted in both maps will be analyzed. These comparisons will give&#xD;
           information on how much the standard electroanatomic map can be improved when the force&#xD;
           information is added.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be presented to the ethics committee of our centre for approval. A&#xD;
           written, informed consent will be required to be signed by the patient before entering&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Time schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
           The recruitment of patients will start as soon as the project is approved by Biosense&#xD;
           Webster and by the local ethics committee. The inclusion period would be 12 months. Data&#xD;
           analysis will be performed during the study period, making the final results available&#xD;
           shortly after the end of the study. An additional 6 month period is expected to report&#xD;
           and publish the results in international cardiology journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Privacy policy&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patient's data will remain in the hospital files and will not be transmitted to any&#xD;
      external subject. A code will be assigned to each patient in order to allow the analysis of&#xD;
      the data in an anonymous way .&#xD;
