  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of Vemurafenib in combination with&#xD;
      Metformin in melanoma patients. The phase II part of the study will also evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical activity of the combined regiment. Based on pre-clinical studies and a phase I&#xD;
      trial, the investigators hypothesize that the combination of an FDA-approved non-toxic dose&#xD;
      of oral Metformin with Vemurafenib will yield little toxicity and improve clinical outcomes&#xD;
      in terms of objective response rates and survival in metastatic melanoma patients.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I/II study. Phase I will be evaluating the safety of the FDA-approved&#xD;
      Vemurafenib (960 mg orally, daily) in combination with Metformin (500 mg orally, twice daily&#xD;
      for 2 weeks, then 850 mg orally,twice daily) in patients with unresectable Stage IIIC and&#xD;
      Stage IV melanoma. Phase II will evaluate the clinical activity of the combined&#xD;
      Vemurafenib/Metformin regimen. The safety profile of this combined Vemurafenib/Metformin&#xD;
      regimen will be monitored during both phases. The treatment period consists of 28-day cycles&#xD;
      until progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.&#xD;
