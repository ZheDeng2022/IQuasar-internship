      The study will compare Padd, a non-invasive automated optical device which uses a functional&#xD;
      test to assess peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and Ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) in&#xD;
      the detection of PAD using as a gold standard, colour duplex ultrasound, in participants&#xD;
      drawn from general practice, a hospital diabetic clinic and a tertiary vascular disease&#xD;
      referral centre. The study hypothesis is that Padd performs at least as well as ABPI in&#xD;
      detecting PAD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      400 participants, with a minimum of 200 participants per site, will be recruited from two&#xD;
      centres. At the Royal Free Hospital, London, the inclusion criterion is simply attendance at&#xD;
      the vascular clinic; in Leicester patients &gt;70 years or 50-69 years with a history of&#xD;
      diabetes, smoking, known PAD or at least 2 risk factors (previous ischaemic event,&#xD;
      hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, family history of cardiovascular disease) will be recruited&#xD;
      from both primary care and the hospital diabetes clinic. The anticipated peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease detection rates are approximately 75% in London and 25% in Leicester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to standard questionnaires, participants will undergo bilateral Padd and resting&#xD;
      ABPI. CDU will be performed by an accredited vascular technologist who will employ a scoring&#xD;
      method consistent between both sites. The vascular technologist will be blind to the Padd and&#xD;
      ABPI results. The results obtained with Padd and ABPI will be compared with CDU as the gold&#xD;
      standard for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Performance: to compare Padd and ABPI for detecting PAD against a gold standard, CDU,&#xD;
           performed by an experienced vascular technologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety: to compare adverse events using Padd, ABPI and expert CDU&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to compare time taken to perform Padd and ABPI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to calculate specificities for Padd and ABPI&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to investigate the impact of subject posture on the Padd results&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to determine if skin colour has any impact on Padd performance&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no treatments or interventions determined exclusively from the Padd readings.&#xD;

        Patients of 50 or over attending a vascular clinic at a major London hospital; patients of&#xD;
        70 years or over or 50-69 years with a history of diabetes, smoking, known peripheral&#xD;
        arterial disease or at least 2 risk factors (previous ischaemic event, hyperlipidaemia,&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Royal Free Hospital - patients &gt;50 years old referred to the vascular clinic for&#xD;
             suspected peripheral arterial disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Leicester&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  age 70 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  age 50-69 years with a history of smoking, diabetes or peripheral arterial&#xD;
                  disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  50-69 years with at least two peripheral arterial disease risk factors&#xD;
                  (hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, family history of cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
                  previous ischaemic event: myocardial infarction, stroke and TIA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. bilateral amputation that precludes placement of the Padd sensors on the feet&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. acute deep venous thrombosis, within the previous six months (application of ABPI&#xD;
             pressure cuff on legs is not advisable for these patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. skin damage or infection that precludes placement of sensors&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. active psychotic illness or severe cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. inability to lie supine&#xD;
