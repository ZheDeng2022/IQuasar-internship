    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether recanalization and stenting for symptomatic subacute and chronic&#xD;
      veterbrobasilar artery occlusion is technically feasible, can prevent from recurrent ischemic&#xD;
      events and promotes functional recovery of disability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke accounts for 87% of cerebrovascular accidents. Of these, a part is the result&#xD;
      of intracranial veterbrobasilar occlusion. Acute veterbrobasilar artery occlusion is a&#xD;
      devastating disease with high mortality without successful treatment. A subset of patients&#xD;
      can survive the acute phase and develop subacute or chronic veterbrobasilar artery occlusion.&#xD;
      Due to the adequacy of collaterals, some patients can live without any or just very mild&#xD;
      symptoms. On the contrast, lack of enough collaterals, another patients still presented with&#xD;
      recurrent ischemic events and progressive disability despite intensive medical therapy.&#xD;
      Prognosis is extremely poor. It is in this cohort that subacute or chronic revascularization&#xD;
      is often considered. The optimal treatment in this cohort with non-acute veterbrobasilar&#xD;
      artery occlusion is unknown, and there is little literature to guide therapy.&#xD;
      Extracranial-intracranial bypass may revascularize the intracranial artery occlusion.&#xD;
      However, bypass procedures are technically challenging and are associated with significant&#xD;
      risk of morbidity and mortality. Recurrent ischemic symptoms despite best medical treatment&#xD;
      be indication for endovascular revascularization and stent remodeling. This study was to&#xD;
      evaluate the technical feasibility, safety and treatment effects of recanalization and&#xD;
      stenting for veterbrobasilar subacute-chronic intracranial artery occlusion。&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack) due to the intracranial veterbrobasilar&#xD;
             artery occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Occlusions may be diagnosed by TCD (transcranial cerebral doppler), MRA (magnetic&#xD;
             resonance angiography), or CTA (computed tomographic angiography) to qualify for&#xD;
             angiogram performed as part of the study protocol but must be confirmed by catheter&#xD;
             angiography for enrollment in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;

             hours. The reasons for delayed intervention were due to delayed diagnosis,&#xD;
