      The aim of this project is to create fear conditioning paradigm within which the relative&#xD;
      strengths of various novel pharmacological and behavioral interventions can be tested. These&#xD;
      interventions are intended to reduce the fearfulness associated with fear conditioning by&#xD;
      blocking a memory process known as reconsolidation. In fear conditioning, a &quot;conditioned&quot;&#xD;
      stimulus (CS) is paired with an aversive &quot;unconditioned&quot; stimulus (US) such as an electric&#xD;
      shock, until presentation of the CS alone comes to elicit a fear conditioned response (CR).&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that by using a more highly prepared CS (i.e. video of&#xD;
      spiders); more sensitive subjects (individuals with stronger acquired CRs); and additional&#xD;
      experimental probes for the presence of the latent CR, the investigators may develop a normal&#xD;
      human paradigm that is not plagued by previously observed floor effects (i.e. intervention is&#xD;
      100% effective), within which both the established techniques of propranolol and delayed&#xD;
      extinction will produce significant, but only partial, CR reduction. This would leave room to&#xD;
      test and compare potentially more powerful candidate reconsolidation-blocking or&#xD;
      memory-updating interventions. To achieve these aims, subjects will undergo a four-day fear&#xD;
      conditioning and delayed extinction protocol. Skin conductance response data will be gathered&#xD;
      across the different phases of the experiment.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 1.1. Reconsolidation and its modification. Recent animal&#xD;
           research suggests that reactivation (retrieval) of a consolidated memory can return it&#xD;
           to a labile state from which it must be restabilized in order to persist. This&#xD;
           stabilization process has been termed &quot;reconsolidation,&quot; and various behavioral and&#xD;
           pharmacologic interventions have been found to modify or block it. Although extinction&#xD;
           can reduce or even apparently eliminate conditioned fear, it typically does so by&#xD;
           inhibiting the expression of the fear memory, not by erasing it. In contrast, blockade&#xD;
           of reconsolidation is believed to erase, or at least diminish, the fear memory trace. It&#xD;
           is not uncommon for reconsolidation articles to conclude with a statement that this&#xD;
           offers novel therapeutic possibilities for PTSD, which may in part be characterized as a&#xD;
           disorder of over-consolidated, persistently disturbing memories that do not go away.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SPECIFIC AIM The aim of this project is to create an experimental assay in the form of&#xD;
           an optimal Pavlovian differential fear conditioning paradigm, within which the relative&#xD;
           strengths of various novel pharmacological and behavioral, reconsolidation-blocking&#xD;
           interventions can be tested. As impressive as the Kindt8 and Schiller10 studies are for&#xD;
           demonstrating pharmacological and behavioral fear reconsolidation-blocking interventions&#xD;
           in normal humans, the results produced by these interventions make them nearly useless&#xD;
           as potential assays for reconsolidation blockade. Specifically, both interventions&#xD;
           produced an apparent total abolition of the fear memory, i.e., they both contain a floor&#xD;
           effect. The aim in this work is to develop a normal human paradigm within which both&#xD;
           propranolol and delayed extinction produce significant, but only partial reduction of&#xD;
           the CR, which might then be improved upon by more powerful reconsolidation-blocking&#xD;
           interventions. This study will not be used to support a label, advertising, or&#xD;
           indication change of propanolol, and will not be prescribed in a patient population,&#xD;
           route of administration, or dosage that significantly increases risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Elements of a new design to eliminate the floor effect 2.1.1. A stronger US. One&#xD;
           way to produce a CR that is more resistant to reconsolidation blockade, i.e., to reduce&#xD;
           the floor effect, would be to use a stronger US. However, because in our ongoing human&#xD;
           conditioning studies, we are already using an electric shock selected in advance by&#xD;
           subjects to be &quot;highly annoying but not painful,&quot; we believe that to use a level of&#xD;
           shock above this would be ethically impermissible, and hence we will not pursue this&#xD;
           possibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.2. A more highly &quot;prepared&quot; CS. It has long been shown that certain classes of CSs,&#xD;
           when paired with a US, produce a stronger fear CR, i.e., they are more &quot;prepared&quot; to&#xD;
           enter into an association with the US.13 The Schiller design10 did not use a prepared&#xD;
           CS, but the Kindt study8 did, viz., still pictures of spiders. In our design, we will&#xD;
           enhance the preparedness of the CS by using 12-sec.14 high-definition video clips of&#xD;
           three different crawling tarantulas, each conspicuously different in appearance.&#xD;
           Importantly, however, the present project will not be a study of spider fear or phobia;&#xD;
           we will only use high-definition videoto enhance CS preparedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.3. More sensitive subjects. We will limit recruitment to subject candidates who fall&#xD;
           within the upper half of the distribution of normal humans on the Spider Phobia&#xD;
           Questionnaire-1515 (SPQ-15) and for whom the CSs are likely to be especially salient.&#xD;
           However in order to avoid potential adverse clinical consequences of participation, we&#xD;
           will exclude subjects with features of diagnosable spider phobia (or the presence of any&#xD;
           other Axis I mental disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.4. Selecting subjects with stronger CRs. In order for a subject who has completed&#xD;
           the Day 1 Acquisition phase of the experiment to proceed to the remaining phases, we&#xD;
           will require that they show strong evidence of conditioning, as manifest in CRs greater&#xD;
           than 0.25 µSiemens to at least two CS+s. The Schiller study10 employed a differential&#xD;
           conditioning cut-off of 0.10 µSiemens, but based upon our own experience, we favor the&#xD;
           raw score cut-off. The Kindt study8 employed no such cut-off.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.5. Employing additional probes for the presence of the latent CR. The Kindt8 and&#xD;
           Schiller10 studies employed two of the four available techniques for revealing the&#xD;
           presence of the latent CR: spontaneous recovery and reinstatement. In the present&#xD;
           experiments, we will also examine renewal and savings. These will require that the CSs&#xD;
           be presented in different contexts, which will be achieved in the following manner. Each&#xD;
           of the three different tarantulas will appear within three different backgrounds, or&#xD;
           contexts, resulting in a 3 x 3 design, and a total of nine different video clips. The&#xD;
           use of high-definition video on a large-screen television will help to reduce the&#xD;
           context-with-a-context problem. The sequence of presentation of the nine clips will be&#xD;
           pseudorandomly varied across subjects within a group, and identical across groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SUBJECT SELECTION 3.1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 3.1.1. Inclusion criteria. 1) Age&#xD;
           18-35 2) Top half of the normal human distribution of the Spider Phobia&#xD;
           Questionnaire-15.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Exclusion criteria 3.2.1. Exclusion criteria prior to undergoing first experimental&#xD;
           session. 1) Any of the following criteria for diagnosable spider phobia: a) marked or&#xD;
           persistent fear of spiders that is excessive or unreasonable; b) intense anxiety or&#xD;
           panic upon exposure to a spider; c) avoidance of spiders, anxious anticipation of&#xD;
           exposure to spiders, or distress in the presence of spiders, any of which interferes&#xD;
           significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or&#xD;
           social activities or relationships; or d) marked distress about having fear of spiders;&#xD;
           2) Any current Axis I mental disorder on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV&#xD;
           (SCID); or 3) presence of drugs of abuse, e.g., opiates, marijuana, cocaine, or&#xD;
           amphetamines, as determined by urine testing. Additionally (4) non-English-speaking&#xD;
           subject candidates will be excluded because validated versions of some of the&#xD;
           instruments and questionnaires to be administered are not available in other languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3. Recruitment methods. Healthy subject candidates will be drawn from advertisements&#xD;
           in the media. Most subject volunteers are expected to be drawn from the pool of 250,000&#xD;
           students in the Boston area. No employees or students supervised by the Investigators&#xD;
           will be enrolled in this study, nor will Harvard Medical School students. Candidates who&#xD;
           express an interest in participating will be scheduled to make a visit to our laboratory&#xD;
           for an evaluation as to whether they satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT Prior to the initiation of the study procedures, an investigator will&#xD;
           obtain the written informed consent using the form approved by the Partners Human&#xD;
           Research Committee. If drugs are potentially involved, this will be a licensed physician&#xD;
           investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. STUDY PROCEDURES 5.1. Design. We will use SCR as the measure of the CR. We have chosen&#xD;
           SCR because we have 25 years' experience with this dependent measure in human&#xD;
           conditioning studies.20 Intertrial intervals will vary within 15 and 25 sec. with a mean&#xD;
           of 20 sec. Two active reconsolidation-blocking interventions will be employed: 1)&#xD;
           Propranolol reactivation as in Kindt,8 and 2) Reactivation-delayed extinction as in&#xD;
           Schiller.10 Subjects will be randomized to one of three conditions: propranolol (40mg;&#xD;
           single dose); placebo (single dose); behavioral (no pill). The research pharmacy will&#xD;
           create and manage the randomization list. The study will be single blind. The&#xD;
           experimental phases will comprise three consecutive days and a fourth day one month&#xD;
           later. Prior to beginning the experiment, the subject will set their own level of&#xD;
           electric stimulation (shock). They will be instructed to choose a level that is highly&#xD;
           annoying but not painful. The experimenter will start the stimulation at a very low,&#xD;
           nearly imperceptible level and gradually increase the level until the subject says&#xD;
           &quot;stop.&quot; That level will then be used throughout the experimental sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.1 Day 1 5.1.1.1 Interview and Questionnaire. Candidates for this project will&#xD;
           undergo a comprehensive evaluation to assess psychiatric and medical history and a&#xD;
           structured clinical interview to confirm lack of psychiatric diagnoses (SCID). Subjects&#xD;
           will also complete the SPQ-15.15 Eligible candidates will proceed to Habituation and&#xD;
           Acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.1.2 Habituation and Acquisition. Subjects will view video of three rooms (contexts),&#xD;
           different in color and content, presented on a 42&quot; high definition television. The&#xD;
           conditioned stimuli (CSs) will be three different videos of tarantulas, one presented in&#xD;
           each room. Two of the three tarantulas will serve as the two CS+s and the third as the&#xD;
           CS-. Each CS+ presentation will sometimes be followed by shock (i.e., reinforced); the&#xD;
           CS- will never be followed by shock. Day 1 will consist of two sequential components: a)&#xD;
           2 unreinforced presentations of each CS (habituation), followed by b) 8 presentations of&#xD;
           each CS, with 5 of each CS+ presentations followed by shock (i.e., 63% reinforcement,&#xD;
           acquisition). All Day 1 CS presentations will occur within Context A.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.2. Day 2 (Intervention) will consist of either 1) propranolol (40 mg oral) or&#xD;
           placebo (oral) followed 90 min. later by a single, unreinforced presentation of one of&#xD;
           the two CS+s, designated the reactivated CS+ (CS+R) (after Kindt8); or 2) a single,&#xD;
           unreinforced presentation of the CS+R without receiving a pill, followed 10 min. later&#xD;
           by a) 10 further unreinforced CS+R presentations; b) 11 unreinforced presentations of&#xD;
           the remaining CS+, designated the CS+ with no intervention (CS+N); and c) 11 CS-&#xD;
           presentations (after Schiller10). Subjects will be randomized to one of these three&#xD;
           interventions (propranolol, placebo, or behavioral) following Day 1. All Day 2 CS&#xD;
           presentations will take place within Context B.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.3. Day 3 (Renewal, Reinstatement) will consist of three sequential components: a) 2&#xD;
           unreinforced presentations each of the CS+R, CS+N, and CS- (renewal test trials); b) 3&#xD;
           presentations of the US alone, and c) 8 further unreinforced presentations each the&#xD;
           CS+R, CS+N, and CS- (reinstatement test trials, also re-extinction). All Day 3 CS&#xD;
           presentations will occur within Context A.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.4. Day 30 (Spontaneous Recovery/Renewal, Savings) will consist of two sequential&#xD;
           components: a) 8 unreinforced presentations each of the CS+R, CS+N, and CS- (spontaneous&#xD;
           recovery test trials, also re-extinction); and b) 8 presentations each of the two CS+s&#xD;
           with 63% reinforcement, and the CS- (savings test trials during re-acquisition). All Day&#xD;
           30 CS presentations will occur within Context C.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following numbers of shocks will be delivered to each subject: Day 1: 10 shocks, Day&#xD;
           2: 0 shocks, Day 3: 3 shocks, Day 30: 10 shocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS 6.1. Statistical approach. Data from the above experiments will&#xD;
           be subjected to analysis of variance techniques similar to those fully described in the&#xD;
           Kindt article8 and supplement, Schiller article10 and supplement, as well as in our&#xD;
           published human differential conditioning studies.14,16-19&#xD;

    <description>Skin conductance response (SCR) is the change in skin conductance level in response to a stimulus. We compared the SCR to a non-treated conditioned stimulus (CS+N) with the SCR to a treated conditioned stimulus (CS+R) by creating a difference score (CS+R - CS+N) for the day 3 data. Day 3 is 48 hours after the fear-conditioning procedure and serves as the primary measure of whether the treatment had an effect. SCR was measured in microSiemens; the SCR difference score reflects a change in microSiemens.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Skin Conductance Response</title>
        <description>Skin conductance response (SCR) is the change in skin conductance level in response to a stimulus. We compared the SCR to a non-treated conditioned stimulus (CS+N) with the SCR to a treated conditioned stimulus (CS+R) by creating a difference score (CS+R - CS+N) for the day 3 data. Day 3 is 48 hours after the fear-conditioning procedure and serves as the primary measure of whether the treatment had an effect. SCR was measured in microSiemens; the SCR difference score reflects a change in microSiemens.</description>
