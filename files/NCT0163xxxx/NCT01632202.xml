  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seprafilm is an FDA-approved temporary bioresorbable barrier that physically separates&#xD;
      opposing tissue surfaces. The physical presence of the membrane separates adhesiogenic tissue&#xD;
      while the normal tissue repair process takes place. When used in the abdominopelvic cavity,&#xD;
      it has been shown to reduce the incidence of adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intrauterine cavity is a potential space where the walls of the uterus are collapsed upon&#xD;
      itself in the normal state. It has been demonstrated that the trauma of removing a submucosal&#xD;
      fibroid with electrocautery exposes the uterus to great potential for intrauterine adhesions&#xD;
      since the raw charred surface is directly opposed to the opposite endometrial surface.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that the placement of hyaluronic acid in the intrauterine cavity&#xD;
      after a myomectomy is not only safe, but also decreases the incidence of intrauterine&#xD;
      adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that by placing a slurry of Seprafilm in the intrauterine&#xD;
      cavity and creating a temporary physical barrier between the walls of the uterus, that they&#xD;
      will be able to prevent iatrogenic intrauterine adhesions. Given that approximately 24 to 48&#xD;
      hours after placement, the membrane becomes a hydrated gel that is slowly resorbed within one&#xD;
      week, the investigators anticipate that the patient will have minimal to no discomfort; since&#xD;
      no physical device is being left in the endometrial cavity, the uterus will not be&#xD;
      contracting more than it does in its normal postoperative state.&#xD;

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving patients at&#xD;
      NewYork Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center and Weill Medical College of&#xD;
      Cornell University. The investigators will enroll 328 pre- menopausal patients (&gt;18years)&#xD;
      with documented submucosal myomas undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy with monopolar&#xD;
      resection in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that approximately 30% of the patients undergoing myomectomy&#xD;
      will form intrauterine adhesions and that administration of the Seprafilm slurry will reduce&#xD;
      the incidence to approximately 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be queried on post-operative days 1, 7, and 30 for pain/discomfort and the&#xD;
      degree of intrauterine adhesions will be assessed after the patient's second menses (75-90&#xD;
      days post procedure).&#xD;

    <description>Number of Subjects with iatrogenic intrauterine adhesions. Evidence of uterine scarring will be evaluated by a 3D sonohysterogram.&#xD;
A 3D sonohysterogram will be performed in the standard fashion in our ultrasound department by a blinded practitioner. The degree of adhesive disease will be scored by standard convention as:&#xD;
Absent Adhesive Disease: no presence of intrauterine adhesions&#xD;
Mild Adhesive Disease: cavities that are less than or equal to 30% affected&#xD;
Moderate Adhesive Disease: cavities that are greater than 30% but less than or equal to 60% affected&#xD;
Severe Adhesive Disease: cavities that are greater than 60% affected</description>

    <description>Number of pregnancies within 12 months of treatment. In order to determine if Seprafilm helps improve pregnancy rates we will be conducting an additional follow-up phone call up to 12 months from the day of sonohysterogram. In women who have wished to get pregnant we will ask if they have been trying to get pregnant and if they have gotten pregnant. Participation in this follow up call is optional.</description>

        <title>Presence of Iatrogenic Intrauterine Adhesions</title>
        <description>Number of Subjects with iatrogenic intrauterine adhesions. Evidence of uterine scarring will be evaluated by a 3D sonohysterogram.&#xD;
A 3D sonohysterogram will be performed in the standard fashion in our ultrasound department by a blinded practitioner. The degree of adhesive disease will be scored by standard convention as:&#xD;
Absent Adhesive Disease: no presence of intrauterine adhesions&#xD;
Mild Adhesive Disease: cavities that are less than or equal to 30% affected&#xD;
Moderate Adhesive Disease: cavities that are greater than 30% but less than or equal to 60% affected&#xD;
Severe Adhesive Disease: cavities that are greater than 60% affected</description>

            <description>The investigators hypothesize that by placing a slurry of Seprafilm in the intrauterine cavity and creating a temporary physical barrier between the walls of the uterus, that we will be able to prevent iatrogenic intrauterine adhesions. Given that approximately 24 to 48 hours after placement, the membrane becomes a hydrated gel that is slowly resorbed within one week, we anticipate that the patient will have minimal to no discomfort; since no physical device is being left in the endometrial cavity, the uterus will not be contracting more than it does in its normal postoperative state.&#xD;
Seprafilm: Seprafilm Adhesion Barrier (membrane) is a sterile, bioresorbable, translucent adhesion barrier composed of two anionic polysaccharides, sodium hyaluronate (HA) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). Together, these biopolymers have been chemically modified with the activating agent 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) -3- ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC).</description>

In order to determine if Seprafilm helps improve pregnancy rates we will be conducting an additional follow-up phone call up to 12 months from the day of sonohysterogram.
