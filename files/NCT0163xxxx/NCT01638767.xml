  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presently, a long protocol in an In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) cycle, patients need to take&#xD;
      Marvelon, a drug that inhibits the follicular development at the beginning of the cycle in&#xD;
      order to better control and also plan the onset of the ovary stimulation with gonadotropin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Marvelon is taken daily as soon as menstruation starts for a period of 14 to 21 days.&#xD;
      Ideally, it has to be taken at the same time everyday and not be forgotten. This may cause&#xD;
      higher stress level for some users. Presently on the market, there is a ring-shaped&#xD;
      contraceptive device inserted in the vagina at day 1 of the cycle called NuvaRing. The&#xD;
      purpose of this device is similar to an oral contraceptive. However, the benefit of NuvaRing&#xD;
      is that it can be left in place for a period of up to 35 days without any other manipulation&#xD;
      and keep an adequate rate of hormone for contraception. Moreover, NuvaRing shows better&#xD;
      hormone stability in the blood. Although the side effects and the benefits are comparable for&#xD;
      the two treatments, some studies have shown that more patients would respect the treatment&#xD;
      with NuvaRing and that the level of satisfaction would be higher in women using NuvaRing when&#xD;
      contraception is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to compare the rate of satisfaction as well as the level of&#xD;
      stress in women using Marvelon daily or NuvaRing with single insertion in a long protocol.&#xD;
      Moreover, this study allow us to verify if using NuvaRing, a vaginal contraceptive releasing&#xD;
      constant daily doses for up to 35 days will allow us to facilitate the planning of In Vitro&#xD;
      Fertilization cycles in long protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the purpose of this randomized, controlled, open-label study, women will be selected from&#xD;
      those undergoing in vitro fertilization treatments with a long protocol prescription. This&#xD;
      study will compare two treatment groups, one using Marvelon, the other using the NuvaRing.&#xD;
      Patients on Marvelon will be taking the medication for a period ranging from 14 to 21 days.&#xD;
      This period will be determined by the administrative nurse. In contrast, patients in the&#xD;
      NuvaRing group will be inserting the vaginal ring for a period specified by the&#xD;
      administrative nurse, ranging from 14 to 35 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the medical consultation, the couple will be assessed and a primary or secondary&#xD;
      infertility diagnosis will be established. Before treatment starts, the couple will have to&#xD;
      undergo a series of tests as per the standard of care in order to allow a diagnosis to be&#xD;
      made and to determine whether In Vitro Fertilization is the right treatment. The couple will&#xD;
      receive all the information they need on an In Vitro Fertilization cycle. If the patient is&#xD;
      eligible for In Vitro Fertilization cycle according to initial assessment of the physician,&#xD;
      the patient will be informed by the physician about the research project. After a period of&#xD;
      consideration and once their questions have been answered, the couple will sign a consent&#xD;
      form to start In Vitro Fertilization treatment under the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the consent form, if the subject is eligible for the research project, the&#xD;
      research nurse will meet with the patient. The study will be explained in detail and all&#xD;
      questions will be answered. In addition, the nurse will record any information on the&#xD;
      patient's medical history including medical history, medication and any previous surgery. The&#xD;
      subject will be screened for eligibility prior to randomization. Once the subject is deemed&#xD;
      eligible and is interested in participating in the study, the research nurse will meet with&#xD;
      the subject in order to sign the informed consent form and to determine the randomization&#xD;
      group she will be participating in. In order to determine which group will be allocated for a&#xD;
      subject, a randomized envelope will be given to the patient containing the patient number&#xD;
      will be opened to assign her to one of the two groups - either the Marvelon or the NuvaRing&#xD;
      group. She will open it on site The randomization will be carried out using an envelope&#xD;
      system to be identified initially by its randomization number. The envelopes will be prepared&#xD;
      in advance in such a way that nobody can know their content.&#xD;
