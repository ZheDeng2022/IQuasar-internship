    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential pharmacokinetic (what the body does&#xD;
      to the drug) interactions between multiple doses of phenytoin 200 mg every 12 hours or&#xD;
      carbamazepine 200 mg every 12 hours and telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours at steady-state&#xD;
      (constant concentration of medication in the blood) in healthy participants.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized&#xD;
      (the study medication is assigned by chance), 2-panel, sequential treatment study. In this&#xD;
      study 24 healthy participants will be randomly assigned equally to 2 panels. In Panel 1 the&#xD;
      participants will receive telaprevir in Part 1 (telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 1 to&#xD;
      Day 9 followed by a single 750 mg dose in the morning on Day 10) and phenytoin/telaprevir in&#xD;
      Part 2 (phenytoin 200 mg every 12 hours from Day 1 to Day 16 followed by a single 200-mg dose&#xD;
      in the morning on Day 17; and telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 8 to Day 16 followed&#xD;
      by a single 750 mg dose in the morning on Day 17). In Panel 2 the participants will receive&#xD;
      telaprevir (telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 1 to Day 9 followed by a single 750 mg&#xD;
      dose in the morning on Day 10) and carbamazepine/ telaprevir (carbamazepine 200 mg every 12&#xD;
      hours from Day 1 to Day 16 followed by a single 200-mg dose in the morning on Day 17; and&#xD;
      telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 8 to Day 16 followed by a single 200-mg dose in the&#xD;
      morning on Day 17). In both panels, Part 1 and Part 2 are separated by a washout period of at&#xD;
      least 2 weeks and maximum 4 weeks. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by evaluating&#xD;
      adverse events, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory examinations, vital signs and physical&#xD;
      examination throughout the study period.&#xD;
