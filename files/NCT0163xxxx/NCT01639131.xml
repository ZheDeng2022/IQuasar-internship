  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or&#xD;
             unresectable adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See&#xD;
             Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be either intolerant or refractory to one or more standard line(s) of&#xD;
             chemotherapy treatment prior to enrollment. Toxicity from prior regimens must be&#xD;
             resolved to less than or equal to grade 1 prior to enrollment. Patients with grade 2&#xD;
             neurotoxicity may be enrolled on a case by case basis at the discretion of the&#xD;
             principle investigator. Patients should be off all treatment for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to trial enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel in patients &lt;18 years of age with&#xD;
             colorectal adenocarcinoma, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible&#xD;
             for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (Karnofsky &gt;70%, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Microsatellite instability phenotype of archival tissue biopsy determined by treating&#xD;
             institution by PCR and IHC assay&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Methylation CHFR gene promoter in archival tissue biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As gemcitabine and docetaxel are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4&#xD;
             months after completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to gemcitabine or docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of&#xD;
             CYP 3A4 are ineligible. Lists including medications and substances known or with the&#xD;
             potential to interact with the cytochrome 450 3A4 isoenzyme are provided in appendix&#xD;
             C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects of study medications. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with gemcitabine and docetaxel breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this&#xD;
             study including supportive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with gemcitabine and docetaxel. In&#xD;
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
