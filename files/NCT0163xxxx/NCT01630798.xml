  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are invited to participate in a research study to develop new ways to look for abnormal&#xD;
      areas/tissues of the esophagus. The current endoscopes used to look at the esophagus are very&#xD;
      good, but if the area doesn't look different to the naked eye, then the endoscope can't&#xD;
      improve on that. The investigators are looking at using special fluorescent stains in&#xD;
      addition to special endoscopes designed to see abnormal areas that are not obvious to the&#xD;
      naked eye. Currently specialized microscopes and fluorescent stains are used in clinical&#xD;
      laboratories but it takes several days of processing to get results. It may be very helpful&#xD;
      to look for areas to sample for abnormal tissue during the endoscopy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are being asked to let us use &quot;fluorescent peptides&quot; with a special endoscope that allow&#xD;
      us to &quot;see&quot; your esophagus with both fluorescent and white light during your upper GI&#xD;
      endoscopy procedure to help target your biopsies. Peptides are small chains of amino acids&#xD;
      (the building blocks that make up proteins) linked together. Our peptide is a chain of 7&#xD;
      amino acids attached to a fluorescent dye called FITC (like the one used by your eye doctor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have prepared special &quot;fluorescent peptides&quot;, that will &quot;glow&quot; when a&#xD;
      special light is used that should help us separate normal tissue from abnormal tissue. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators will apply the special fluorescent peptides by a spray catheter&#xD;
      to your esophagus to help us target you biopsies. Both routine and targeted biopsies will be&#xD;
      taken as your endoscopist feels is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1b study. This means that although the investigators have applied the peptide&#xD;
      to 25 people in our first research study, the investigators still need to learn more about&#xD;
      &quot;fluorescent peptide&quot; in people. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved this&#xD;
      agent, but is allowing us to test it in this study. The main goal of this study is to see if&#xD;
      the peptide &quot;glows&quot; well and if the investigators can take pictures of the areas that do&#xD;
      glow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a research study of the peptide and our ability to see it &quot;light up or fluoresce&quot;.&#xD;
      Being in this study and applying this peptide won't change how your biopsies are taken nor&#xD;
      how your endoscopy is done.&#xD;

    <description>The overall aim of this research project is to develop the use of fluorescent-labeled peptides that affinity bind to pre-cancerous mucosa in the digestive tract for use as an imaging agent to guide endoscopic biopsy or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). This particular study is a phase Ib, vaidation of efficacy of the topically applied peptide and continuing assessment of safety.&#xD;
To validate binding of the fluorescent-labeled peptide to esophageal neoplasia using an Olympus FITC Endoscopic Molecular Imaging System.</description>
