  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, Phase Ib study that has six treatment arms is designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacology and preliminary efficacy of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A; an engineered&#xD;
      anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PDL1] antibody) administered with bevacizumab (Arm A) and&#xD;
      with bevacizumab plus oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (FOLFOX) (Arm B),&#xD;
      with carboplatin and paclitaxel (Arm C), with carboplatin and pemetrexed (Arm D), with&#xD;
      carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel (Arm E), and with nab-paclitaxel (Arm F) in participants with&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study includes dose escalation cohort for&#xD;
      establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and then&#xD;
      expansion cohort will be initiated based on a selected dose level at or below the MTD or MAD.&#xD;
