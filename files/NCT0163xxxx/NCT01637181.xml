  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical randomized controlled trial, comparing 2 endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)&#xD;
      techniques in patients with insufficiency of the great saphenous vein (GSV). There are&#xD;
      multiple EVLA devices available, with different wavelengths. In the Netherlands, 940 nm Diode&#xD;
      and 1470 nm Nd:Yag laser are the most frequently used devices. Both devices also proven to be&#xD;
      equally effective in occluding the GSV. However, little is known about differences in&#xD;
      patient-related outcomes. Therefore, the primary outcomes of this comparative clinical trial&#xD;
      of 940 nm and 1470 nm EVLA, are pain scores, patient satisfaction and scores of health&#xD;
      related and varicose-specific questionnaires. The secondary outcomes are complications and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the treatment. It is thought that possibly the 1470 nm ELVA will give lower&#xD;
      pain scores and higher patient satisfaction than 940 nm EVLA. No differences are expected in&#xD;
      complication rate and effectiveness between the two treatments.&#xD;

      * Study type: Interventional. Randomized comparative clinical trial..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary study outcomes: Patient reported outcomes: 1. Pain score and use of&#xD;
                painkillers, assessed with a numeric rating scale (NRS) of pain. 2. Treatment&#xD;
                satisfaction, assessed with a NRS of satisfaction. 3. Health related quality of&#xD;
                life, assessed with Dutch translated Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ)&#xD;
                and EQ-5D questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary study outcomes: 1. Number of patients with adverse events. Major&#xD;
                complications: deep and superficial venous thrombosis (embolic events), nerve&#xD;
                injury, skin burns, and (sub)cutaneous infections. Minor complications: ecchymosis&#xD;
                and hyperpigmentation. 2. Obliteration of varicose vein and/or absence of reflux (&gt;&#xD;
                0.5 sec. of retrograde flow) along the treated segment of the GSV. This is measured&#xD;
                using US examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome measures time frame:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of one year, with outcome measures at baseline, 1 week, 3 months and 1 year post&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Focus of the study: Varicose great saphenous veins (GSV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention information:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention name: endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention type: 1. EVLA with 940 nm Diode laser 2. EVLA with 1470 nm Nd:Yag&#xD;
                laser&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm information: both interventions are active comparators.&#xD;
