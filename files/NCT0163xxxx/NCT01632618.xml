  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is the most frequently reported musculoskeletal problem and third most&#xD;
      frequently reported symptom of any kind in people over the age of 75. In fact, 17.3% of all&#xD;
      visits to physicians for LBP involve individuals over 65. In older adults, LBP has been&#xD;
      associated with a host of negative consequences, including decreased physical function,&#xD;
      increased fall risk, increased mood disturbance and increased health care utilization.&#xD;
      Surprisingly, little research has focused on LBP in people over 65. But, recent evidence&#xD;
      demonstrates that LBP is associated with increased intramuscular fat infiltration in the&#xD;
      abdominal and paraspinal muscles and that this altered muscle composition increases the risk&#xD;
      of mobility-related functional decline in older adults. While trunk muscle training (TMT) has&#xD;
      been used in younger LBP groups, it is unproven in elders and, alone may not be sufficient to&#xD;
      substantially improve function and symptoms, given the compromised state of ages muscle. TMT&#xD;
      augmented with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) known to improve strength and&#xD;
      function beyond the capacity of volitional exercise alone, may provide greater improvements.&#xD;
      Treatment of chronic LBP in older adults using an exercise intervention has been hypothesized&#xD;
      as a way to prevent functional decline and frailty progression; however this hypothesis has&#xD;
      yet to be experimentally confirmed. In this exploratory study, the investigators will test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that TMT plus NMES will result in reduced disability and pain severity&#xD;
      compared to usual care in elders with chronic LBP.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: 64 participants &gt; age 65 will be recruited to participate. Participants&#xD;
        will be included if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Low Back Pain for at least 3 months with pain of at least moderate intensity every day or&#xD;
        almost every day that requires activity modification. This criterion is necessary to&#xD;
        guarantee a subject population that has chronic pain that is not controlled with&#xD;
        conventional therapy. At least moderate pain intensity (&gt; 3 on a scale of 0-10) will be&#xD;
        required to ensure our ability to detect treatment effects, and because pain of moderate&#xD;
        intensity has been shown to be significant in the pain literature.11 The Pain thermometer&#xD;
        has been shown to be reliable in older adults12, 13, will be used to screen pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion Criteria: Subjects will be excluded from the study if any of the following&#xD;
             exist:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prominent component of radicular pain: CLBP with distal radiation below the knee&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known spinal pathology other than osteoarthritis: (e.g., a history of back&#xD;
                  surgery or recent trauma, spinal stenosis, vertebral compression fractures,&#xD;
                  ankylosing spondylitis, carcinoma metastatic to the spine) In these other cases,&#xD;
                  LBP may be of non-mechanical origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-ambulatory, or severely impaired mobility (i.e., require the use of a&#xD;
                  walker): Since measurement of physical performance in the proposed study includes&#xD;
                  gait velocity and standing balance, conditions other than LBP that could&#xD;
                  negatively impact these measures may confound our study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination score of &lt; 24 will exclude subjects&#xD;
                  because of the uncertain reliability of their answers to the self-reported&#xD;
                  outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severe visual or hearing impairment: Since this study will involve questionnaires&#xD;
                  and telephone evaluations, severe visual and/or hearing impairments may interfere&#xD;
                  with data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Red flags indicative of a serious disorder underlying the LBP: Red flags that&#xD;
                  would require specialized medical attention include fever, significant&#xD;
                  unintentional weight loss, a sudden recent change in the character or intensity&#xD;
                  of pain, trauma that preceded the onset of pain, or signs and symptoms of caudae&#xD;
                  equinae. These subjects will be promptly referred to their primary practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Significant pain in parts of the body other than the back or acute LBP: Since we&#xD;
                  will be specifically evaluating chronic LBP, we do not want to confound the&#xD;
                  outcome data with pain from other areas or with acute pain. Thus only subjects&#xD;
                  with LBP severity that is greater than pain severity elsewhere in the body will&#xD;
                  be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute or terminal illness: To insure weekly participation and a six month&#xD;
                  follow-up, subjects with an acute or terminal illness will be excluded from the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of a pacemaker: Since electrical stimulation will be used in this study&#xD;
                  and the effects of that stimulation on pacemakers is unknown, we will be cautious&#xD;
                  and exclude subjects with this device.&#xD;
