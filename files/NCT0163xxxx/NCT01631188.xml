  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to determine if the Endovent pulmonary catheter kit, used for port&#xD;
      access surgery, can be used as a passageway for a pacing wire. The study hypothesis is that&#xD;
      the Endovent kit can be used effectively as a passageway for a pacing wire system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many times cardiac surgery requires the use of epicardial pacing in order to wean the patient&#xD;
      from bypass. During minimally invasive port access valve surgery, it may not be possible to&#xD;
      place the leads on the surface of the heart because of the limited surgical exposure. In this&#xD;
      case, transvenous pacing is used. Minimally invasive port access surgery uses specially&#xD;
      designed, FDA approved catheters for the procedure. We wish to review the effectiveness of&#xD;
      being able to place the wires through the catheters and pace the patient.&#xD;

          <description>During surgery your doctor will utilize a new technique using surgical equipment that have already been FDA Approved for other indication. The combination of the equipment and technique will be experimental and will be closely evaluated during and after each case.&#xD;
Minimally Invasive Aortic Valve: Patients having minimally invasive aortic valve surgery will have a pacing wire placed through the endovent catheter. The anesthesiologist will attempt to pace the ventricle with this wire if needed to wean from bypass.&#xD;
Minimally Invasive Aortic Valve Surgery: The Anesthesiologist will advance a pacing wire through the Endovent Catheter under TEE in order to pace the heart when the subject is coming off the Cardiopulmonary bypass machine&#xD;
Manipulation in OR surgical technique: Endovent and pacing wire when coming off cardiopulmonary bypass</description>
