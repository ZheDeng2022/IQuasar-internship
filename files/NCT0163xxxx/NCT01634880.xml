  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard therapy for high-risk or locally advanced salivary gland malignancies is surgery&#xD;
      followed by postoperative radiation therapy. Studies have shown the superiority of combined&#xD;
      modality therapy compared to surgery alone. Despite the addition of postoperative radiation&#xD;
      therapy, the five-year survival for locally advanced salivary gland malignancies is poor&#xD;
      (less than 60%). In salivary gland malignancies, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#xD;
      is expressed in 25-85%; in certain histological types, like salivary duct carcinomas, the&#xD;
      expression is higher. EGFR is a promising target of anticancer therapy. In squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck, a phase III trial utilizing cetuximab added to radiation&#xD;
      therapy improved both locoregional control and overall survival compared to radiation alone.&#xD;
      Panitumumab is a novel, human, IgG2 EGFR monoclonal antibody that may be better tolerated and&#xD;
      more efficacious than cetuximab. Here, the investigators hypothesize that the addition of&#xD;
      panitumumab to standard radiotherapy in locally advanced salivary gland malignancies will&#xD;
      improve recurrence-free survival (RFS).&#xD;

      Specific Aims To determine the recurrence-free survival (primary endpoint), overall survival,&#xD;
      local and distant recurrence-free survival, and treatment-related toxicities. Also, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to study EGFR-related and immune biomarkers in baseline tumor tissue as&#xD;
      well as blood samples obtained prior and after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population We will enroll patients with completely resected, locally advanced&#xD;
      salivary gland cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan Standard radiation 64-70Gy with 2.0 Gy daily fractions in 6-7 weeks.&#xD;
      Panitumumab 2.5 mg/Kg IV, weekly during radiation (total of 6-7 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Design and Sample Size Phase II, one-stage, study with the 3-year recurrence-free&#xD;
      survival (RFS) as the primary endpoint. The sample size is 30 patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically determined salivary gland cancer of the major or minor salivary glands&#xD;
             of the head and neck (any histology) status post potentially curative surgical&#xD;
             resection with no macroscopic residual disease. Patients should have AJCC 6th edition&#xD;
             stage III with 1) extracapsular extension, 2) perineural invasion, 3) positive&#xD;
             surgical margins or 4) high grade histology or stage IVA or IVB.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy, biological-targeted therapy (including any prior therapy which&#xD;
             specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway), or radiotherapy for head and neck&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than 10 weeks (minimum of 3 weeks) should elapse between surgery and treatment&#xD;
             on study.&#xD;

             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;

             with a 3-year disease-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because chemotherapy and radiation therapy&#xD;
