  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion (up to 60%) of myeloma patients treated with Bortezomib or&#xD;
      thalidomide or both develop significant peripheral neuropathy (PN). Standard of care for this&#xD;
      complication include drugs like gabapentin or pregabalin, which relieve symptoms only&#xD;
      partially. PN of grade II or above mandates reduction in dose or frequency of Bortezomib or&#xD;
      thalidomide, which may compromise treatment outcome. This clinical study explores whether, by&#xD;
      intervening early in its course using acupuncture, progression of PN can be reversed,&#xD;
      stabilized or retarded thereby allowing continuation of treatment on schedule.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. The acupuncture treatment will start after patients have received at least 3 weeks of&#xD;
           Gabapentin or Pregabalin at adequate dose without improvement in PN&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two sessions of acupuncture per week, each of 30minutes duration, will be administered&#xD;
           for a total of 10 sessions over 5 weeks. The needling will be done by the designated&#xD;
           acupuncturist for all patients, delivered with electrical stimulation at a defined&#xD;
           frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A fixed set of acupoints will be applied which include both local and distant points,&#xD;
           based on both symptoms of PN and classification of TCM syndrome. Some degree of&#xD;
           flexibility with addition or reduction of acupoints is allowed based on clinical&#xD;
           indication. The acupoints needled each session will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of efficacy 4.1 Objective response : A complete neurological examination will&#xD;
           be done at commencement of acupuncture and at end of acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a full nerve conduction test will be done at beginning of acupuncture and at the&#xD;
      end of 10 sessions of acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Subjective assessment A quality of life questionnaire (FACT/GOG-NTX v4) will be filled in&#xD;
      by patients at enrolment, commencement, at the 6th session and at the end of 10 sessions of&#xD;
      acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Scoring With both objective and subjective assessment, a Total Neuropathy Score can be&#xD;
      calculated at each time point as a quantitative measurement of the severity of PN&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Statistical considerations The statistical analysis specifies that a lower limit of the&#xD;
      two-sided 90 percent confidence interval for the overall positive response that exceeded 10&#xD;
      percent would be considered to be evidence of significant efficacy of acupuncture in&#xD;
      retarding Bortezomib or thalidomide induced PN. Allowing a confidence interval width of 30%,&#xD;
      the sample size needed will be 34 patients. To allow for a 10% drop-out, we plan to recruit a&#xD;
      total of 40 patients&#xD;
