  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of a high fat meal on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 30 mg apremilast in healthy adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to receive a single dose of 30 mg apremilast during each of&#xD;
      the 2 periods; once under fasting conditions and once after a high fat meal. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive apremilast either fasted first, then fed, or fed first&#xD;
      then fasted. Participants will check into the study center on Day -1 of each period, will be&#xD;
      dosed on Day 1, and discharged from the study center on Day 3 after all scheduled&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic blood draws and safety evaluations. After a washout of 5 to 10 days,&#xD;
      participants will return for period 2 during which they will receive apremilast according to&#xD;
      their assigned sequence.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at one clinical research site in the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of 2 periods. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences; Fasted then Fed or Fed then Fasted. Each participant was to receive 1 dose of apremilast under fasted conditions and 1 dose of apremilast under fed conditions in each period, respectively, depending on their sequence assignment.&#xD;
There was a 5 to 10 day washout period between each dose.</pre_assignment_details>

The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension).
