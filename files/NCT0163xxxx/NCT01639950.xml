  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Assessing pain levels is important to improve treatments for different illnesses. Most pain&#xD;
      rating scales are used to determine pain levels in adults. Pain is also a common symptom&#xD;
      among children who have cancer. Those who have genetic conditions that may lead to cancer may&#xD;
      also have pain symptoms. However, the pain scales used for adults have not been fully tested&#xD;
      in children and young adults. As a result, they may not be as accurate. Researchers want to&#xD;
      test pain rating scales in children and young adults who have cancer and genetic conditions&#xD;
      that can lead to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the effectiveness of pain rating scales given to children and adults with Sickle&#xD;
      Cell Disease (SCD),cancer, and related genetic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 and 34 years of age and older who have SCD, cancer, or other genetic conditions&#xD;
      that can lead to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with SCD, cancer or related genetic conditions will fill out four&#xD;
           questionnaires. These questionnaires will ask about pain levels and how much pain&#xD;
           interferes with daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain treatments will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is a common symptom among children with a variety of medical illnesses. Currently, a&#xD;
      number of rating scales are used to assess pain interference and pain severity in adults.&#xD;
      However, relatively few measures assessing these variables have been validated for use with&#xD;
      children and adolescents, and existing tools have limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to validate the self-report and parent versions of the Pain&#xD;
      Interference Index (PII) and the Pain Rating Scale (PRS) by comparison with previously&#xD;
      validated measures of pain interference (Modified Brief Pain Inventory) and pain severity&#xD;
      (Faces Pain Scale - Revised) in the following populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Children, adolescents, and young adults ages 8 to 25 years with chronic pain related to&#xD;
      cancer, Neurofibromas type 1 (NF1), genetic tumor predisposition syndromes (GTPS), a solid&#xD;
      tumor (including but not limited to sarcoma, neuroblastoma, or melanoma), or&#xD;
&#xD;
      leukemia and their parent(s) or guardians. (COMPLETED)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults &gt; =18 years of age with cancer, NF1, Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt;= 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of cancer, NF1, SCD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrolled on a clinical trial or natural history study at the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be asked to respond one time to the PII and the PRS, as well&#xD;
           as the Modified Brief Pain Inventory and Faces Pain Scale - reviewed during a scheduled&#xD;
           clinic visit for their primary protocol, or while inpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic (gender and age, parent gender (if applicable) and medical (diagnosis, date&#xD;
           of diagnosis, pain medication) data will be collected from review of the participants&#xD;
           medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A subset of evaluable participants with SCD will be asked to repeat the PII after&#xD;
&#xD;
      approximately 1 month to assess test-retest reliability in this tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents of pediatric participants were asked to complete the Parent version of the PII&#xD;
           and the Parent PRS. Correlations between patient participant and parent participant&#xD;
           questionnaire results for participants with solid tumor, NF1, GTPS, and leukemia will be&#xD;
           correlated to establish validity and reliability of the PII and PRS. (COMPLETE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Also, results from mother and father reports will be correlated to assess inter-rater&#xD;
&#xD;
      reliability. (COMPLETE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Data from 12 participants ages 6 and 7 years was collected to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      the forms in this younger age group. (COMPLETE)&#xD;
