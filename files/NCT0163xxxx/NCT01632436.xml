  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in patients with metastatic cancer and either moderate, severe,&#xD;
      or no hepatic impairment who have failed other antineoplastic therapies or for whom there is&#xD;
      no standard therapy. The study will be conducted in two stages. Using an existing pixantrone&#xD;
      population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model, a model-based strategy will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      findings from the first stage of the study conducted in patients with moderate hepatic&#xD;
      impairment and matched controls. The PPK evaluation will be completed prior to enrolling&#xD;
      patients with severe hepatic impairment and additional matched controls during the second&#xD;
      stage of the study. Patients with hepatic impairment will be paired with matched control&#xD;
      patients with normal hepatic function, matched on gender, age, and body surface area (BSA).&#xD;

      This study will be conducted in patients with metastatic cancer and either moderate, severe&#xD;
      or no hepatic impairment who have failed other antineoplastic therapies or for whom there is&#xD;
      no standard therapy. The study will be conducted in two stages. Stage I will include patients&#xD;
      with moderate hepatic impairment and Stage II will include patients with severe hepatic&#xD;
      impairment. An analysis of data from the Stage I portion of the study will be performed to&#xD;
      decide whether to enroll patients in the Stage II portion of the study. Patients with hepatic&#xD;
      impairment (either moderate or severe) will be paired with matched control patients with&#xD;
      normal hepatic function, matched on gender, age, and body surface are (BSA). Patients will&#xD;
      receive a single dose of pixantrone on day 1 of a 21 day cycle. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained at various time points during the first week of the first cycle for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) analysis. If any patient with hepatic impairment develops a dose limiting toxicity,&#xD;
      subsequent patients will be administered a lower dose of pixantrone. If any patient with&#xD;
      hepatic impairment who is receiving the reduced dose of pixantrone experiences a dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity, the study will be terminated. Patients who demonstrate any clinical,&#xD;
      radiologic, or other evidence of response or stabilization after the initial dose of&#xD;
      pixantrone and who wish to continue treatment may do so at the discretion of the&#xD;
      Investigator. Patients receiving additional cycles will be treated with pixantrone every 21&#xD;
      days for up to 5 additional cycles and will be followed for safety only, until 30 days after&#xD;
      the last dose.&#xD;
