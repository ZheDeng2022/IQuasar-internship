    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover, 12-week trial to&#xD;
      be conducted in 50 subjects with painful diabetic neuropathy. The objective of this trial is&#xD;
      to assess the safety and efficacy of NO gel, a NO donor, as compared with a placebo gel, in&#xD;
      symptom relief of subjects with painful diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is a common symptom of diabetic neuropathy, and predominantly involves the&#xD;
      lower limbs. Current strategies for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy include&#xD;
      improved glycemic control, use of analgesics and addition of tricyclic antidepressants and&#xD;
      anticonvulsants. However, many patients experience unsatisfactory responses and some&#xD;
      undesired side effects. Considerable evidence implicates impaired nitric oxide synthesis&#xD;
      plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathic pain. Several small&#xD;
      studies have shown that topical nitroglycerin ointment has local vasodilating properties, and&#xD;
      a previous study has demonstrated that isosorbide dinitrate in spray form as a nitric oxide&#xD;
      donor relieved some neuropathic symptoms in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. Based&#xD;
      on the findings, the investigators hypothesize that nitric oxide gel could be used as an&#xD;
      alternative pain-relieving agent for patients with resistant diabetic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
