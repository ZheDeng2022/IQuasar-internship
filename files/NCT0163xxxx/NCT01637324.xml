      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the impact of MSM-targeted multidisciplinary services on uptake of HIV&#xD;
           voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the impact of MSM-targeted multidisciplinary services on the enrollment&#xD;
           into care and retention of HIV-positive MSM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population: HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM clients, age â‰¥18 years old, of the Thai&#xD;
      Red Cross Anonymous Clinic (TRC-AC) in Bangkok Thailand, the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in&#xD;
      Jakarta, and the Sanglah Hospital in Bali, Indonesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants: 200 HIV-negative and 150 HIV-positive MSM participants&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study which will recruit 350 MSM clients within 3 months, and&#xD;
      follow them for 12 months. MSM to be recruited will be first-time clients who come to the&#xD;
      clinics for services other than VCT. These services may include but would not be limited to&#xD;
      sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis and treatment, anal dysplasia screening,&#xD;
      nutritional counseling and non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 250 MSM clients with unknown or previously negative HIV status will be offered&#xD;
      HIV testing every 3 months (HIV-negative MSM cohort). MSM from the HIV-negative cohort who&#xD;
      tested HIV-positive during the study (estimated 20%, 50 MSM) will be referred to the&#xD;
      HIV-positive MSM cohort and will be followed up every 6 months. Additional clients who visit&#xD;
      the clinic during the 3-month recruitment period with previously known HIV-positive status&#xD;
      but have not been linked to HIV care (up to 100) will also be enrolled into HIV-positive MSM&#xD;
      cohort. Therefore, there will be up to 150 HIV-positive subjects enrolled in this study. Each&#xD;
      enrolled participant will have 12 months in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow us to assess VCT and linkage into care, as well as HIV risk behavior&#xD;
      and need for nPEP, and the incidence or prevalence of important morbidities in MSM such as&#xD;
      STIs, anal dysplasia/cancer, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.&#xD;
