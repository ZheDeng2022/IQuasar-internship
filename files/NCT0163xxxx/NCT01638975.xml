    <textblock>
      This study tests a computerized cognitive training program designed for young individuals&#xD;
      with compulsive hair pulling (also known as trichotillomania;TTM). Research suggests that&#xD;
      individuals with TTM are characterized by poor cognitive abilities to suppress irrelevant&#xD;
      response. This ability is called response inhibition. The current study tests a cognitive&#xD;
      training program designed to improve individuals' cognitive abilities of response inhibition&#xD;
      through a 8-session computerized training program. The investigators hypothesize that those&#xD;
      who complete the response inhibition training program will show a greater reduction in hair&#xD;
      pulling symptoms, compared to those assigned to a waitlist group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite ongoing research into causes and treatments for trichotillomania, it remains poorly&#xD;
      understood, underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. Further, treatment of TTM in children&#xD;
      has received little attention, and only recently have the investigators begun to see research&#xD;
      in pediatric trich. One possible way of progressing treatment development for pediatric trich&#xD;
      is to clarify the nature of inhibitory control processes implicated in TTM and to develop a&#xD;
      treatment that specifically targets these implicated cognitive processes. Examples of this&#xD;
      strategy are found in the increasing availability of translational research that has&#xD;
      demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of computerized cognitive training programs (CTPs) in&#xD;
      modifying problematic cognitive processes in numerous psychiatric conditions. The objective&#xD;
      of this study is to examine the feasibility of CTP for enhancing response inhibition&#xD;
      capabilities among individuals with trich, thereby reducing TTM symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, young individuals aged between 12 and 18 with TTM will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the CTP condition vs. a wait-list condition. Participants in the CTP condition will receive&#xD;
      eight 30-min training sessions over a 4-week period and will be assessed at three time&#xD;
      points. Participants in the wait-list will be evaluated at baseline and post-training&#xD;
      assessments, and will be allowed to receive the CTP after completing the post-training&#xD;
      assessment. Wait-list controls who choose to cross over to the CTP condition will also&#xD;
      provide a small replication sample to test the effect of our response inhibition training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three primary implications from this work. First, demonstrating successful&#xD;
      enhancement in response inhibition by our proposed CTP is expected to create ample&#xD;
      opportunities for clinical research not only on TTM, but also for numerous other psychiatric&#xD;
      problems in which poor response inhibition is implicated (e.g., Chronic Skin Picking,&#xD;
      Tourette Syndrome, OCD, and ADHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has the potential to produce a highly cost-efficient self-administered&#xD;
      intervention for TTM. Upon establishing efficacy, CTPs may be easily integrated into various&#xD;
      contexts, examples include CTPs as an adjunctive intervention to existing behavioral and/or&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments, an instrument to identify and help at-risk individuals for&#xD;
      preventative training, a stand-alone short-term intervention, and a remote web-based&#xD;
      self-help intervention for individuals who have no easy access to treatment resources or are&#xD;
      reluctant to seek treatment.&#xD;
