      1. Purpose of the Study - This protocol aims to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      autologous ALD-451 cells administered intravenously in World Health Organization (WHO) grade&#xD;
      IV malignant glioma patients following surgery, radiation therapy and temozolomide; as well&#xD;
      as to obtain an initial description of the effects of ALD-451 cells on neuro-cognition&#xD;
      allowing the design of a subsequent phase 2 trial of this intervention in patients with&#xD;
      malignant glioma. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety of&#xD;
      intravenously administered autologous bone marrow derived ALD-451 cells in the brain&#xD;
      following surgery, radiation therapy and temozolomide in patients with WHO grade IV malignant&#xD;
      glioma. The secondary objective of this study is to determine the recovery of ALD-451 from&#xD;
      bone marrow of patients following radiation therapy and temozolomide. The exploratory&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine if intravenous administration of autologous ALD-451&#xD;
      cells following surgery, radiation therapy and temozolomide in WHO grade IV malignant glioma&#xD;
      patients may have an effect on subsequent deterioration of neurocognition and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, open label study in which eligible subjects will undergo surgery, radiation&#xD;
      therapy, Temozolomide, bone marrow harvest, MRIs, and intravenous infusion of ALD-451. The&#xD;
      subjects will be followed via the safety and efficacy procedures completed during visits over&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two to 8 weeks following gross total resection (GTR), patients with WHO grade IV malignant&#xD;
      glioma that have agreed to participate in the study by signing the informed consent will&#xD;
      undergo screening procedures to determine eligibility. Once enrolled on the study, baseline&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing will be performed. Two to 8 weeks after enrolled subjects have&#xD;
      completed the 6 -6 ½ weeks of radiation therapy and daily temozolomide, subjects will have&#xD;
      their bone marrow harvested by undergoing a bone marrow aspiration with 160 (+/-20) mL of&#xD;
      bone marrow collected from the iliac crest (one to 2 days after the patient has been&#xD;
      re-assessed for continued eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be transported to the Robertson CT2 GMP Facility where ALD-451 will be&#xD;
      manufactured and the ALD-451 product returned to the Investigational Chemotherapy Services&#xD;
      for infusion. A small aliquot of ALD-451 will be taken from the starting bone marrow,&#xD;
      de-identified, labeled with the manufacturing lot number, and stored at Duke University for&#xD;
      the duration of the trial to support ongoing studies determining potency of the product. For&#xD;
      all ALD-451 products, a retained aliquot that is the equivalent of 10 mls of the starting&#xD;
      bone marrow will be cryopreserved and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. Harvest&#xD;
      of 160 mL of subject bone marrow will allow for retains without excessive reduction in the&#xD;
      anticipated ALDHbr dose. These frozen retains will be used for product characterization and&#xD;
      development of a potency assay. These aliquots will not be used for any other purposes and&#xD;
      any remaining aliquots will be destroyed at the time of Biologics License Application (BLA)&#xD;
      approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two - four days after having bone marrow harvested for ALDHbr cells, ALD-451 will be&#xD;
      administered through a peripheral IV, up to 1 hour. This will be followed by 4 hours of IV&#xD;
      fluids and observation. Normal Saline will be used as the IV fluids and will be initiated a&#xD;
      few minutes before the administration of ALD-451. The bag within which ALD-451 will be&#xD;
      received will be flushed once with 10 ml of Normal Saline and the fluid obtained after&#xD;
      flushing the bag will be administered to the patient, to assure that the investigators have&#xD;
      reinfused in the patient the vast majority of the ALD-451 present in the bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide will be reinitiated four weeks after completion of radiation therapy and daily&#xD;
      Temozolomide (at least two weeks after ALD-451 infusion). Temozolomide will be dosed at 150&#xD;
      mg/m2 orally on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle for the first cycle and 200 mg/m2 orally for the&#xD;
      following 11 cycles. Patients will receive a total of 12 cycles of Temozolomide following&#xD;
      completion of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive testing and patient-reported outcomes will be obtained at study enrollment,&#xD;
      two weeks after completion of radiation therapy and temozolomide and after six and twelve&#xD;
      cycles of temozolomide.&#xD;
