      To visualize the localization and to measure the volume of water in the small intestine by&#xD;
      T2-weighted MRI imaging after oral administration of 240 ml water (non-caloric water) and&#xD;
      after administration of 240 ml water containing 25.5 g sucrose (105 kcal, caloric water).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure pharmacokinetics of the probe-drugs paracetamol, talinolol and amoxicillin after&#xD;
      oral administration dissolved in 240 ml non-caloric and in 240 ml caloric water.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After swallowing, a drug first is deposited in the stomach together with the co-swallowed&#xD;
      water. However, the stomach is not the major place of drug absorption. Therefore, the&#xD;
      kinetics of gastric emptying plays a crucial role for the absorption process. In case of&#xD;
      dissolved or finely suspended drug particles, gastric emptying of the drugs occurs together&#xD;
      with gastric contents. The emptied liquid enters the small intestine where it is absorbed.&#xD;
      Under fasting conditions, the emptied phase consists of the water that was co-swallowed with&#xD;
      the drug (in clinical studies typically 240 ml) together with a small volume of gastric&#xD;
      juice. Under fed conditions, the emptied liquid phase is a caloric suspension. It is known&#xD;
      that both the gastric emptying and the intestinal absorption of pure water are rapid leading&#xD;
      usually to rapid absorption of water soluble drugs that are taken under fasting conditions.&#xD;
      In the contrary, delayed absorption under postprandial conditions is typically related to&#xD;
      delayed gastric emptying. However, velocity and extent of intestinal filling and the&#xD;
      absorption rate of the liquid phase from gut lumen are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is the primary objective of the study to determine the gastric emptying&#xD;
      kinetics of 240 ml water (non-caloric water) and of 240 ml water containing 25.5 g sucrose&#xD;
      (105 kcal, caloric water), the respective intestinal filling and the absorption rate of the&#xD;
      intestinal liquid using water sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the functional meaning of gastric emptying, intestinal filling and water uptake&#xD;
      for oral drug absorption which are swallowed with non-caloric and caloric water,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of paracetamol, talinolol and amoxicillin will be studied after&#xD;
      administration with 240 ml non-caloric and 240 ml caloric water, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol (acetaminophen) was chosen, because it is rapidly and completely absorbed from&#xD;
      all parts of the gut. The time of its appearance in blood is expected to be a surrogate for&#xD;
      the rate of gastric emptying. It is hypothesized that caloric content of the water for&#xD;
      administration does not influence the extent of paracetamol absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talinolol represents a well established probe drug for the intestinal efflux transport&#xD;
      protein ABCB1. Because expression of ABCB1 increases along the small intestine&#xD;
      (duodenum&lt;jejunum&lt;ileum), we hypothesize, that administration of talinolol with caloric water&#xD;
      leads to lower bioavailability and increase of the fecal excretion of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amoxicillin acts as a probe drug for intestinal drug uptake via the dipeptide transporter&#xD;
      PEPT1 which is predominately expressed in proximal parts of the small intestine&#xD;
      ((duodenum&gt;jejunum&gt;ileum). Because of this region-specific expression, we hypothesize, that&#xD;
      administration of amoxicillin with caloric water is associated with lower bioavailability.&#xD;
