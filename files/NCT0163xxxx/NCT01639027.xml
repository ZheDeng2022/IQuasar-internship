  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reducing the length of labor is a highly desirable goal of intrapartum care, both from a&#xD;
      perspective of maternal and fetal well-being, and for the providers of the birth services.&#xD;
      Avoiding along, protracted labor entails shorter exposure to pain, anxiety and stress and&#xD;
      would thus translate into a major improvement in maternal satisfaction with the childbirth&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the premise that shortening the length of labor is beneficial, interventions aimed&#xD;
      at accelerating the progression of labor have been introduced routinely as part of standard&#xD;
      labor management and care throughout the 20th century. Certain labor accelerative procedures,&#xD;
      such as amniotomy, became common practice and have been put to the acid test of randomized&#xD;
      control trials to evaluate their efficacy. Use of anticholinergics/antispasmodics as a method&#xD;
      of augmenting labor was ﬁrst described in 1937 by Hirsch, who reported a decrease in labor&#xD;
      length by two to four hours following Intrapartum administration of an atropine-like drug&#xD;
      (Syntropan®)mainly among older nulliparas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drotaverine, an isoquinolone derivative is a superior smooth muscle relaxant which acts&#xD;
      specifically on spastic sites and corrects the cAMP and calcium balance relieving smooth&#xD;
      muscle spasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This inhibitory action is detected only in lower uterine segment during labor since muscle&#xD;
      fibers in upper uterine segment are strongly affected by contractile effect of oxytocin. Use&#xD;
      of drotaverine during pregnancy is free of any teratogenic and embryotoxic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research question is: Does the use of antispasmodic Drotaverine shorten the duration of&#xD;
      active first stage of labor in nulliparous women as compared to placebo?&#xD;

      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the use of antispasmodic Drotaverine shorten the duration of active first stage of labor&#xD;
      in nulliparous women as compared to placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis: the population means of the Drotaverine and placebo groups are equal&#xD;
      regarding the duration of the first stage of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of Drotaverine for reducing the&#xD;
      duration of labor for the context of contemporary practice, among nulliparous women managed&#xD;
      according to a standard intrapartum protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from women admitted in labor at the delivery unit of Ain Shams&#xD;
      Maternity Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase II to III, intervention study- Randomized Controlled double blind&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete history to exclude allergy to Drotaverine Hydrochloride and any&#xD;
           contraindication for normal vaginal delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General examination of the patients including (pulse, blood pressure, temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obstetric Abdominal examination including lie, presentation,station; fetal heart rate,&#xD;
           uterine contraction, amount of liquor and to exclude multiple pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vaginal examination under aseptic conditions to assess cervical dilation, effacement,&#xD;
           state of fetal membranes, presenting part,position of fetal head, color of liquor and&#xD;
           pelvic adequacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment of the frequency, duration of uterine contractions and monitoring of fetal&#xD;
           wellbeing will be applied through CTG application on admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - CTG will be applied half an hour to all participants before starting any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If the contractions are not adequate:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Patients with intact membranes → AROM will be done, reassessment after one&#xD;
                     hour. If still no adequate contraction, Oxytocin infusion will start (five&#xD;
                     I.U. Oxytocin in 500 cc ringer I.V. drip) by titration method until complete&#xD;
                     regulation of uterine contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Those with ruptured of membranes, the amniotic fluid color will be checked for&#xD;
                     any abnormalities and Oxytocin infusion will start (five I.U. Oxytocin in 500&#xD;
                     cc ringer I.V. drip) by titration method until complete regulation of uterine&#xD;
                     contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If the contractions are adequate: No interference will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Each participant will randomly take a prefilled syringe with two milliliters of the&#xD;
           study medication solution (either Drotaverine Hydrochloride or saline). Each participant&#xD;
           will take the selected syringe slowly intravenously over two minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Partographic representation of labor and duration of first stage to determine the&#xD;
           primary end point of the study &quot;duration of 1st stage&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Cervical effacement and dilatation in addition to station and position of fetal head&#xD;
           will be recorded every two hours by vaginal examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Reassessment after four hours of the first dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) If poor progress: Initially, exclude C.P.D. &amp; uterine inertia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there is an obvious cause:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  C.P.D.: Urgent C-section will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Uterine inertia: adjust the dose of Oxytocin I.V drip via titration method until&#xD;
                complete regulation of uterine contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there is no obvious cause:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Another dose of the colorless solution will be given then reassessment after four&#xD;
                hours, If no progress → re evaluation for final decision of mode of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) If good progress: No interference will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The duration of the active first stage of labor(Partographic representation for&#xD;
                cervical effacement and dilatation will be plotted for each participant).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Rate of cervical dilation (cm/h).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Effect on pain by using visual analogue scale once before and one hour after&#xD;
                injection of solution. VAS will be done at 30, 60 and 120 minutes of the drug&#xD;
                administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Mode of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. APGAR score less than 7 at 1 and 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Maternal drug side effect will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Randomization and Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Randomization will be achieved using a computer-generated randomization sequence.&#xD;
                Allocation will be in a 1:1 ratio. Records of group allocation will be maintained&#xD;
                by a resident physician &quot;other than the researcher&quot; whose responsibility will be&#xD;
                randomization and drawing up the injection after dark sealing of the syringes with&#xD;
                black opaque stickers to make the yellowish colored Drotaverine Hydrochloride&#xD;
                (Do-Spa®) in-differentiable from the translucent saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
                This house officer has no direct involvement in the intrapartum decision making.&#xD;
                Drotaverine Hydrochloride and saline injections will have an identical appearance.&#xD;
                The midwives, the clinicians staffing labor and delivery and the patients could not&#xD;
                distinguish the placebo from the active drug. The randomization list will be held&#xD;
                in a secure box on the labor ward to ensure concealment of the allocation of&#xD;
                intervention from those recruiting participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Maternal characteristics and labor information will be prospectively collected in a&#xD;
                computerized database that will be maintained with daily chart review by the&#xD;
                researcher to ensure accuracy and to minimize missing data The primary end-point of&#xD;
                this study will be the duration of the first stage of labor.The first stage&#xD;
                encompasses the onset of active labor to complete cervical dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                However, as women will be randomized at different dilatation levels, to allow&#xD;
                meaningful comparison the dilatation rates (from administration of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
                o full dilatation) will be calculated and will be used as the primary outcome&#xD;
                measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Data analysis and reporting will strictly follow the recommendation of CONSORT 2010&#xD;
                For each primary and secondary outcome, results for each group, and the estimated&#xD;
                effect size and its precision (95% confidence interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
                For binary outcomes, presentation of both absolute risk difference and relative&#xD;
                (Risk Ratio) effect sizes will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
