  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major problem worldwide and current dietary interventions are not proving to be&#xD;
      enough to cease the increase in levels of obesity and its detrimental side effects, such as&#xD;
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing data suggests that adjustments in the macronutrient composition of the diet, more&#xD;
      specifically the protein content, may have beneficial effects on body composition and an&#xD;
      antiobesegenic effect on appetite. This may be important in terms of controlling body weight&#xD;
      and reducing the amount of fatty tissue within our bodies and organs, and therefore&#xD;
      preventing obesity and its health related side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a study to investigate whether a high protein low energy diet&#xD;
      compared to a normal protein low energy diet, in overweight adults can modify appetite and&#xD;
      aid loss of weight and fat mass. Subjects will receive either a high protein low energy diet&#xD;
      (1.34g protein/kg body weight) or a normal protein low energy diet (0.8g protein/kg body&#xD;
      weight) in the form of 2 meal replacements and one conventional meal per day with 2 snacks&#xD;
      for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS In overweight subjects with the metabolic syndrome, a 12 week dietary intervention&#xD;
      with a high protein low energy diet will lead to a reduced appetite, body weight and fat&#xD;
      mass, more specifically to a greater fall in levels of fat in the liver and pancreas than a&#xD;
      low energy normal protein diet.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Lipid Content of the Liver (Intrahepatocellular Lipid)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in body weight and body composition, more specifically visceral, muscle, liver and pancreas fat content will be measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Individual's data will be compared at baseline and at 12 weeks of following the diet and also to that of the participants given normal protein low energy diets. This data may therefore support our hypothesis that high protein intakes may help to aid weight loss and reduce fat mass and would therefore be a viable option in the treatment of obesity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Appetite Regulation, Measured by VAS and Food Intake.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It has also been suggested that highprotein diets are more beneficial in the regulation of appetite. We therefore aim to measure any changes in appetite whilst on a highprotein lowenergy diet compared to a normalprotein lowenergy diet. Changes in appetite will be measured using validated questionnaires assessing subjects feeling of hunger, pleasantness and volume able to eat as well as fullness. This data may support our hypothesis that highprotein intakes may alter appetite regulation and therefore be a useful in the treatment of obesity.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Appetite Score AUC (Area Under Curve)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A composite appetite score was calculated combing all four appetite measures to give a summary measure of appetite. Each appetite measure was assessed using validated 10 cm visual analogue scales (VAS) for hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and prospective food consumption (PFC) with the most positive and most negative sensations anchoring opposite ends of the line, from 'Not at all' or 'Nothing' to 'Extremely' or 'A large amount'. Participants were asked to mark the line at the point corresponding to their perceived appetite at that time. There is no score which is better or worse.&#xD;
Composite Appetite score (mm min) = [desire to eat + hunger + (100 - fullness) + prospective consumption]/4, as described by (Anderson et al, 2002). This reflects the four appetite related VAS (visual analogue scale) questions and was used as a summary measure of appetite. Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for composite appetites score using the trapezoidal rule. AUC scores range from 0-9000cm*min</description>

        <description>Changes in body weight and body composition, more specifically visceral, muscle, liver and pancreas fat content will be measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Individual's data will be compared at baseline and at 12 weeks of following the diet and also to that of the participants given normal protein low energy diets. This data may therefore support our hypothesis that high protein intakes may help to aid weight loss and reduce fat mass and would therefore be a viable option in the treatment of obesity.</description>

        <title>Change in Appetite Regulation, Measured by VAS and Food Intake.</title>
        <description>It has also been suggested that highprotein diets are more beneficial in the regulation of appetite. We therefore aim to measure any changes in appetite whilst on a highprotein lowenergy diet compared to a normalprotein lowenergy diet. Changes in appetite will be measured using validated questionnaires assessing subjects feeling of hunger, pleasantness and volume able to eat as well as fullness. This data may support our hypothesis that highprotein intakes may alter appetite regulation and therefore be a useful in the treatment of obesity.</description>

        <title>Composite Appetite Score AUC (Area Under Curve)</title>
        <description>A composite appetite score was calculated combing all four appetite measures to give a summary measure of appetite. Each appetite measure was assessed using validated 10 cm visual analogue scales (VAS) for hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and prospective food consumption (PFC) with the most positive and most negative sensations anchoring opposite ends of the line, from 'Not at all' or 'Nothing' to 'Extremely' or 'A large amount'. Participants were asked to mark the line at the point corresponding to their perceived appetite at that time. There is no score which is better or worse.&#xD;
Composite Appetite score (mm min) = [desire to eat + hunger + (100 - fullness) + prospective consumption]/4, as described by (Anderson et al, 2002). This reflects the four appetite related VAS (visual analogue scale) questions and was used as a summary measure of appetite. Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for composite appetites score using the trapezoidal rule. AUC scores range from 0-9000cm*min</description>
