      This research is being done to compare the physical and quality of life benefits of two&#xD;
      different types of exercise- tai chi versus strength training- for female cancer survivors&#xD;
      who have had chemotherapy. Each exercise- tai chi and strength training- will be compared to&#xD;
      participants in a group that performs flexibility and relaxation exercises, which is expected&#xD;
      to have different benefits than either tai chi or strength training.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the relative efficacy of tai chi and strength training to prevent falls in female&#xD;
      cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the mechanism by which tai chi and strength training each reduces the risk of&#xD;
      falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine how well the benefits of each intervention persist after structured training&#xD;
      stops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the effect of the intervention on physical functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients attend strength training classes for 1 hour 2 days per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients attend tai chi classes for 1 hour 2 days per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients attend supervised stretching and relaxation classes for 1 hour 2 days per&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all arms, treatment continues for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Prospective assessment of falls will be done by collecting monthly and quarterly reports returned by postal and/or electronic mail. A fall is defined as unintentionally coming to rest on the ground or at some other lower level, not as a result of a major intrinsic event (e.g., stroke or syncope) or overwhelming hazard.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months during study treatment and 6 months after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) for leg press. The maximum amount of weight that can be lifted one time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postural stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months during study treatment and 6 months after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Computerized dynamic posturography using the sensory organization test (SOT) and limits of stability (LOS). The SOT generates an equilibrium scores and sensory ratios that range from 0-100, where 100 = perfect stability and 0 = an inability to maintain balance and a fall. The LOS measures the average % of targeted distances reached (end point excursion) and average % of movement in the targeted direction (directional control).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months during study treatment and 6 months after completion of study</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the standardized chair sit-and-reach test for lower body flexibility. Designed for older adults with demonstrated validity and reliability in older adults (test-retest 0.95-0.96).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months during study treatment and 6 months after completion of study</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Physical Performance Battery (PPB). The PPB consists of 3 timed tests: 5 repeated chair stands, standing balance, and gait speed over 4 meters. Each test is scored 0 (unable) to 4 (completes without difficulty), based on quartiles of performance, then scores are summed. The possible range of scores is 0-12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Injurious falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Collected during prospective monthly and quarterly reports of falls. A fall is considered ''injurious'' if it results in fractures, head injuries, sprains, bruises, scrapes, or serious joint injuries, or if the participant seeks medical care.</description>
