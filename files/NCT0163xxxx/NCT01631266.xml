  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be the most important bacterial infection worldwide and&#xD;
      therefore new improved diagnostic tests are needed to help doctors in diagnosing TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are investigating a new skin test named C-Tb. Like the current tuberculin skin test (PPD),&#xD;
      the C-Tb test is injected just under the skin and will, when positive, show redness and/or&#xD;
      swelling at the injection site while a negative test will leave no reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to test the C-Tb skin test in volunteers. The volunteers are divided&#xD;
      into four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative control group: Must have no history of exposure to a person with tuberculosis&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occasional contact: Must be in contact with a person with tuberculosis disease between 6&#xD;
           hours/week and 6 hours/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Close contact: Must be in close contact with a person with tuberculosis disease for more&#xD;
           than 6 hours/day for at least five days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive control group: Must have a confirmed tuberculosis disease within the last 3&#xD;
           years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this clinical trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the C-Tb test to a blood test, the QuantiFERON test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the C-Tb test to the PPD test that is currently being used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of the C-Tb test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TESEC-06 trial is an open comparison of the diagnostics performance of C-Tb compared to&#xD;
      QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube, in combination with a double-blind randomized split-body safety&#xD;
      assessment of C-Tb versus Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed to address the fundamental issue that in the diagnosis of latent&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) infection, no gold standard exists. Thus, no existing test for latent TB is&#xD;
      100 % sensitive and specific - including the Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI and QuantiFERON®-TB Gold&#xD;
      In-Tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be addressed by evaluating C-Tb positive response rates in 4 groups defined by&#xD;
      their estimated risk of infection with MTb. The groups will consist of paediatric and adult&#xD;
      participants selected as being either occasional or close contacts to an active pulmonary TB&#xD;
      case. In addition a group of confirmed TB cases and a group of participants with no history&#xD;
      of exposure to MTb will be included as control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 participants in the negative control group will be tested with C-Tb alone in order to&#xD;
      evaluate whether concomitant administration of C-Tb and Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI could&#xD;
      conceivably result in larger or smaller areas of induration to one or both tests as a result&#xD;
      of expanding the clone of sensitised T-cells i.e. since Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI includes&#xD;
      among several other antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10 and C-Tb also contains both these antigens.&#xD;
