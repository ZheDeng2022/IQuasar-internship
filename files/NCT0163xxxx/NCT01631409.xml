      This study is dedicated to determination of the long term effectiveness of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) treatments - cardiac shock wave therapy (CSWT) in comparison with other kinds&#xD;
      of medical and surgical treatment. For that purpose the investigators will observe the&#xD;
      patients with CHD who enrolled in this study in their routine course of treatment. But the&#xD;
      investigators will not interfere with the patient treatment. Each participant will be&#xD;
      followed-up for five years. The collected data will allow to determine if the particular&#xD;
      method, CSWT, could really make any additional contribution to the more traditional methods&#xD;
      of CHD treatment and if the CSWT is only temporarily effective or could exert the long term&#xD;
      effect as well.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study has been designed and is conducted in accordance with the requirements of Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration, 6th edition, STROBE Statement, CONSORT 2010 Statement, and the State Standard of&#xD;
      the Russian Federation &quot;Guidelines for Clinical Investigations of Medical Devices&quot; (ГОСТ Р&#xD;
      ИСО 14155 - 2008), which is authentic to International Standards Organization standard 141555&#xD;
      - 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American Heart Association (AHA) 2011 report Russia leaves behind all other&#xD;
      countries in the coronary heart disease mortality rate. This particularly means that the&#xD;
      current methods of CHD treatment, namely: (1) optimal medical treatment (OMT), which includes&#xD;
      intensive lifestyle and pharmacological management, (2) maximal antianginal medical therapy&#xD;
      (MAAMT), which includes the employment of at least two classes of anti-ischemic therapies,&#xD;
      (3) percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCA), and (4) coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)&#xD;
      are not satisfactory enough in the concrete conditions of Russia. This indicate the urgent&#xD;
      necessity of search for the alternative methods of CHD treatment. One of those methods is&#xD;
      cardiac shock wave therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of CSWT is not that new. The first publication is dated back to 1999. Since then a&#xD;
      score of various in vivo as well clinical investigations has been conducted up to phase III.&#xD;
      As a result, it has been demonstrated that (1)the method is practically safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated, and (2)it effectively alleviates angina and improves ECG, ECHO, and cardiac&#xD;
      nuclear tests. Meanwhile, it is still not clear: (1) how long the remission lasts, (2)if CSWT&#xD;
      exerts any influence on such basic health indicators as life span and reduction of major&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) events like myocardial infarction (MI), (3)the place of CSWT in the&#xD;
      overall system of conservative and surgical treatment of CHD, and (4)the long term effect of&#xD;
      combined employment of CSWT with invasive and surgical modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the causes of the such a state of things is the form in which CSWT research so far has&#xD;
      been conducted, namely, the clinical trial. The high cost of that type of investigations&#xD;
      precludes long-term follow-up. Besides, the desire to make the experimental and control group&#xD;
      more homogeneous in the parallel design using multiple inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      dramatically decreases sample representativeness. The observational design is mostly free of&#xD;
      the above-mentioned shortcomings and in some instances allows to obtain important results&#xD;
      which even theoretically are not accessible for investigations with strict control and&#xD;
      randomization because of ethical and pragmatic considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to estimate the long term effectiveness of routine use of cardiac&#xD;
      shock wave therapy in the general system of noninvasive, invasive, and surgical treatment of&#xD;
      ischemic heart diseases in the conditions of a large general city hospital. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in the City Hospital No 40, Saint Petersburg, Russia (about the hospital see the&#xD;
      link at the bottom of the protocol). It is a more than thousand bed general hospital. There&#xD;
      are 55 thousand adults live within its zone of responsibility. From those there are&#xD;
      approximately two thousand patients with CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The algorithm of treatment selection in the hospital. The treatment of all patients begins&#xD;
      from OMT. When OMT is not effective MAAMT is administered. The medical therapy is conducted&#xD;
      strictly individually. When MAAMT fails the patient is offered PCA or CABG. That is, the&#xD;
      general ideology of CHD therapy in the hospital follows the conventional international&#xD;
      guidelines. CSWT is offered mostly in two cases: (1)when the patient refuses to undergo PCA&#xD;
      or CABG, (2)when PCA or CABG are contraindicated for the patient. That is CSWT is factually&#xD;
      used as the second line, reserve method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the hospital, CSWT is routinely employed for three years in correspondence with the&#xD;
      prevailed international scheme: 3 sessions a week every first week for three consecutive&#xD;
      months, 9 sessions altogether according to the guidelines approved by the First deputy of&#xD;
      Saint Petersburg health care committee chairman. The CSWT is implemented by device Cardiospec&#xD;
      manufactured by Medispec Ltd., headquarters in Germantown, MD, USA. The zone of reversed&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia for CSWT application is determined by ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the current study there will be formed seven observational cohorts (0-VI) by both&#xD;
      diagnoses and interventions. The algorithm of the cohort formation in the current study is&#xD;
      graphically demonstrated in the Diagram (see the link at the bottom of the protocol). The&#xD;
      enrollment in the study will continue for 3 year. Taking into consideration the current CHD&#xD;
      morbidity rate in the region 6,5‰, that allows to expect an additional one thousand patients&#xD;
      for the investigation. Each participant will follow-up for five years. So the total length of&#xD;
      the study is eight years.&#xD;
