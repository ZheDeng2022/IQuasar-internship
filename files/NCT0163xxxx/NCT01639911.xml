             diabetes, malabsorption, resection of the pancreas or upper small bowel, requirement&#xD;

             medications, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with&#xD;
             study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with&#xD;
             the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would&#xD;
             make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             antiepileptic drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital, or rifampin, rifabutin,&#xD;
             rifapentine or St. John's wort within 14 days prior to the first dose of alisertib and&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Recent (within 6 months) arterial thromboembolic events, including transient ischemic&#xD;
             attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), unstable angina, or myocardial&#xD;
             infarction (MI). Patients with clinically significant peripheral artery disease are&#xD;
             ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. History of thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorders, not receiving chronic daily treatment&#xD;
             with aspirin (&gt;325 mg/day) or non-steriodal anti-inflammatory agents know to inhibit&#xD;

             clopidogrel (Plavix) and/or cilostazol (Pletal).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Use of simvastatin is not recommended but not prohibited. The concomitant use of&#xD;
             pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations. Discontinue&#xD;
             simvastatin if possible to decrease risk of transaminases elevation from pazopanib.&#xD;
             There are insufficient data available to assess the risk of alternative statins. If it&#xD;
             must be continued, monitor liver function closely and follow dosing guidelines.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  &gt; grade 1 diarrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malabsorption syndrome&#xD;

&#xD;
         22. Abnormalities on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) considered by the investigator to be&#xD;
             clinical significant or baseline prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval (e.g.,&#xD;
             repeated demonstration of QTc interval &gt; 450 milliseconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Poorly controlled hypertension [defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥140 mmHg&#xD;
             or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 90mmHg]. Note: Initiation or adjustment of&#xD;
             antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted prior to study entry. The mean SBP / DBP&#xD;
             values from each blood pressure assessment must be &lt; 140/90mmHg in order for a subject&#xD;
             to be eligible for the study.&#xD;

             eligible. Patients receiving Coumadin must be transition to low molecular weight&#xD;
             heparin and treated for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;

&#xD;
         27. Known endobronchial lesions or involvement of large pulmonary vessels by tumor or&#xD;
