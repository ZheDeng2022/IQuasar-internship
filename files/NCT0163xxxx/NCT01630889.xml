    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label extension study is to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of roxadustat in maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) in participants with dialysis and non-dialysis&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) who have completed the Treatment Period of a roxadustat&#xD;
      FibroGen-sponsored anemia study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, long-term maintenance study of roxadustat anemia therapy in&#xD;
      participants with dialysis and non-dialysis CKD who have completed the Treatment Period of a&#xD;
      roxadustat FibroGen-sponsored anemia study. Participants assigned to roxadustat in the&#xD;
      previous study will continue to receive the same roxadustat dose and dosing frequency, unless&#xD;
      a dose adjustment is required.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hb Over Time</measure>

    <description>Hb baseline was defined as the mean of the central laboratory Hb value from the baseline visit at Day 1 (prior to receiving the first dose of study drug in this study), plus any other central lab Hb values within 15 days prior to Day 1 regardless of fasting. The specific duration over which the participants were assessed was identified as &quot;over time&quot; for the endpoint in the study protocol. Therefore, to be consistent with the endpoint in the study protocol, an individual timepoint was not identified for this primary outcome measure.</description>

    <description>Weekly dose amount was the actual total dose amounts within a week, windowed by 7-day period from Day 1. The mean weekly dose is presented for selected time periods based on timepoints reported in Outcome Measures 1 and 2.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 385</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical event in a participant who received study drug whether or not the event is considered drug related. TEAEs were defined as any event that either began or worsened after the first administration of study drug and within 28 days of the last dose. Serious AE criteria included death, life-threatening, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed here. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

    <description>Participants previously randomized to roxadustat will receive roxadustat at the same dose and frequency assigned at the last dose in the previous FibroGen study. Dose adjustments will be implemented (up to a maximum roxadustat dose of 3.0 mg/kg or 400 mg, whichever is lower) every 4 weeks to maintain Hb levels at 10.0-12 grams (g)/deciliter (dL). However, if a participant, at any dose, experiences an event of excessive hematopoiesis then the participant's dose will be immediately reduced, or an event of rapidly declining Hb then the participant's dose will be immediately increased. Participants will be permitted to receive roxadustat for up to 8 years.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hb Over Time</title>
        <description>Hb baseline was defined as the mean of the central laboratory Hb value from the baseline visit at Day 1 (prior to receiving the first dose of study drug in this study), plus any other central lab Hb values within 15 days prior to Day 1 regardless of fasting. The specific duration over which the participants were assessed was identified as &quot;over time&quot; for the endpoint in the study protocol. Therefore, to be consistent with the endpoint in the study protocol, an individual timepoint was not identified for this primary outcome measure.</description>

            <description>Participants previously randomized to roxadustat received roxadustat at the same dose and frequency assigned at the last dose in the previous FibroGen study. Dose adjustments were implemented (up to a maximum roxadustat dose of 3.0 mg/kg or 400 mg, whichever is lower) every 4 weeks to maintain Hb levels at 10.0-12 g/dL. However, if a participant, at any dose, experienced an event of excessive hematopoiesis then the participant's dose was immediately reduced, or an event of rapidly declining Hb then the participant's dose was immediately increased. Participants were permitted to receive roxadustat for up to 8 years.</description>

However, if a participant, at any dose, experienced an event of excessive hematopoiesis then the participant's dose was immediately reduced, or an event of rapidly declining Hb then the participant's dose was immediately increased.

            <description>Participants previously randomized to roxadustat received roxadustat at the same dose and frequency assigned at the last dose in the previous FibroGen study. Dose adjustments were implemented (up to a maximum roxadustat dose of 3.0 mg/kg or 400 mg, whichever is lower) every 4 weeks to maintain Hb levels at 10.0-12 g/dL. However, if a participant, at any dose, experienced an event of excessive hematopoiesis then the participant's dose was immediately reduced, or an event of rapidly declining Hb then the participant's dose was immediately increased. Participants were permitted to receive roxadustat for up to 8 years.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical event in a participant who received study drug whether or not the event is considered drug related. TEAEs were defined as any event that either began or worsened after the first administration of study drug and within 28 days of the last dose. Serious AE criteria included death, life-threatening, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed here. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>
