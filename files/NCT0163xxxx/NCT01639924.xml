      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Gastrointestinal diseases and disorders affect the throat, stomach, and intestines. There&#xD;
      are many different kinds of these diseases. Clinical trials are being developed to study new&#xD;
      ways to treat them. People who are interested in clinical trials need to be screened before&#xD;
      they can take part in the studies. Researchers want to evaluate people with different stomach&#xD;
      and intestine disorders to see if they are eligible for clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study people who have gastrointestinal disorders and see if they are eligible for&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have or may have a gastrointestinal disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood, urine,&#xD;
           and stool samples will be collected. Imaging studies such as x-rays and ultrasound will&#xD;
           check to see if the disorder has affected other organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have tests as needed depending on their disorder. These tests include&#xD;
           the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colonoscopy and endoscopy of the large intestine, esophagus, and stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stomach acid analysis to look at stomach pH levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wireless capsule endoscopy to take pictures of the small intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hydrogen breath testing to study issues like bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sitz Marker Study to see how fast stool moves through the colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may donate extra blood, urine, or stool samples for study. They may also&#xD;
           donate stomach contents or tissue from the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study. However, participants may be&#xD;
           admitted to other clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Patients with suspected or established acute or chronic gastrointestinal diseases are&#xD;
      evaluated and treated in this protocol and will be screened for entry into other research&#xD;
      protocols. This protocol serves several purposes: 1) allows for detailed inquiry into the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders of these patients and the status of other organ systems that would&#xD;
      determine their ability to safely enroll in active Digestive Diseases Branch (DDB) research&#xD;
      protocols; 2) allows investigators to offer clinical diagnostic testing, procedures, and&#xD;
      treatment to patients if clinically indicated to facilitate their participation in clinical&#xD;
      trials; 3) allows outpatient evaluation and treatment of patients with a variety of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal diseases for the purposes of physician education in our accredited&#xD;
      gastroenterology training program; and 4) After completion of the initial evaluation process,&#xD;
      patients will either be offered a chance to participate in an active research protocol or, if&#xD;
      no appropriate protocol is identified, patients may be seen long-term to follow the disease&#xD;
      progression for potential future participation in DDB gastrointestinal studies.&#xD;
      Recommendations for other treatment options outside of the NIH will be discussed with study&#xD;
      patients and/or to their primary or referring physicians.&#xD;
