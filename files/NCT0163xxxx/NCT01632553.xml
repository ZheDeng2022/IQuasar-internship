      This study looks at the biological effect of domestic violence and abuse (DVA) on women's&#xD;
      mental health. The mechanisms through which DVA causes mental disorders are very poorly&#xD;
      understood. Similar to other demands, DVA activates the biological stress system, of which&#xD;
      the chief component is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which produces chemical&#xD;
      cortisol. Cortisol levels increase in response to short-term demand and help organisms deal&#xD;
      with it by changing the processes of getting energy from food and also mental function.&#xD;
      However constant activation of the HPA axis can cause damage and accelerate disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study tests the hypothesis that compared to non-abused women all abuse victims have&#xD;
      altered diurnal rhythm in cortisol secretion and that the pattern of this alteration is&#xD;
      predicted by abuse characteristics, such as its type, severity, duration, and cessation. To&#xD;
      examine the hypothesis the following research questions will be addressed: 1) whether&#xD;
      cortisol levels are related to mental health state; 2) whether cortisol levels are related to&#xD;
      type, severity, duration and cessation of DVA; 3) whether there is any difference in cortisol&#xD;
      concentrations between those women exposed to both childhood abuse and DVA and those who have&#xD;
      experienced only the latter; 4) whether cortisol levels vary between women, living in refuge&#xD;
      and those not living in refuge?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these research questions 214 women will be recruited in a domestic violence agency.&#xD;
      Baseline and 3-monthly follow-up measures will be taken over 6 months after recruitment.&#xD;
      Women will be asked to fill in a questionnaire to evaluate their demographics, health,&#xD;
      experience of childhood abuse and DVA. Women's weight and height will be taken. In addition&#xD;
      participants will be asked to take three saliva samples: 1st in the evening in bed, 2nd -&#xD;
      next morning immediately upon awakening, and the 3rd - in thirty minutes after awakening.&#xD;
      Saliva will be collected by chewing (for 2 minutes) the cotton pledget provided with plastic&#xD;
      tube and returned by post or via collection by the researcher. Then the saliva samples will&#xD;
      be tested for cortisol and cortisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the study will increase our understanding of the biological mechanisms of DVA&#xD;
      impact on a woman's health and tell researchers and practitioners about the possibility of&#xD;
      using cortisol as an indicator to diagnose abuse-related health problems and assess&#xD;
      effectiveness of medical care for abuse survivors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is threatening behavior, violence or abuse (psychological,&#xD;
      physical, sexual, financial or emotional) used by one person to control the other. Life time&#xD;
      prevalence of DVA is 28% for women and 18% for men, although severity and consequences of&#xD;
      abuse are less for men (1). Over and above damage to physical and reproductive health DVA has&#xD;
      long-term detrimental effects on mental health for women consulting in primary care (2, 3). A&#xD;
      meta-analysis of studies measuring the relationship between DVA and mental disorders reported&#xD;
      increased risk for depression, anxiety, psychosomatic disorders, posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD), alcohol abuse, and suicidal behavior (4). Kernic et al (5) have established&#xD;
      that cessation of DVA among survivors is associated with decreased prevalence of depression;&#xD;
      whereas Anderson and Sounders (6) have found that some women out of the abusive relationship&#xD;
      may have greater psychological difficulties than those who are still in it. However the&#xD;
      mechanisms through which DVA causes mental disease are very poorly understood. Similar to&#xD;
      other stressors, DVA activates the biological stress system, of which the principal component&#xD;
      is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which produces cortisol. Chronic activation&#xD;
      of this system can result in dendritic retraction and hippocampal loss of function (7, 8).&#xD;
      The results of existing cross-sectional studies testing the impact of DVA on women's HPA axis&#xD;
      functioning are contradictory. Pico-Alfonso et al (9) have reported an increase in cortisol&#xD;
      levels, whilst Seedat et al (10) have established reduction in cortisol levels in DVA&#xD;
      subjects compared to controls. This disparity may relate to differential development of PTSD&#xD;
      and/or depression within DVA-exposed samples (11). Currently, there is a hypothesis that DVA&#xD;
      survivors may be characterized by alterations in the HPA axis (12) and that further&#xD;
      longitudinal studies are needed to identify specific stress system disturbances in this group&#xD;
      (1, 13). The aim of the study is to increase understanding of the role of&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity in DVA impact on women's mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the profiles of the awakening response of cortisol, the diurnal variation&#xD;
           and the mean salivary cortisol concentration in women with experience of DVA and in&#xD;
           non-abused controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate whether cortisol secretion is associated with type, severity, duration and&#xD;
           cessation of DVA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate whether cortisol acts as mediator between DVA and mental health state&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether there is any distinction in cortisol levels between those women&#xD;
           exposed to both childhood abuse and DVA and those experienced only the latter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore whether cortisol secretion differs between women, living in a domestic&#xD;
           violence refuge/safe house and those still living in the community (after adjustment for&#xD;
           confounding effects of abuse severity and continuing contact with abuser).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 6-month study will consist of 3 measurements every 3 months. Each assessment will last&#xD;
      approximately 30-45 minutes and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Numerous standardized self-administered psychological questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weight and height measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-completion of 3 saliva samples using Salivette tubes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. evening sample - at bedtime&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. awakening sample - in the morning immediately upon wakening&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. post-awakening sample - 30 mins after awakening sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tubes with saliva will be returned by post or by researcher to an accredited laboratory for&#xD;
      cortisol assay. The analysis also simultaneously measures cortisone a breakdown product of&#xD;
      cortisol. This measurement is used to confirm the integrity of the sample.&#xD;
