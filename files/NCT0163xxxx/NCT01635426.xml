      The study will compare the effect of Aspirin versus clopidogrel effect on uterine perfusion&#xD;
      in women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss with decreased uterine artery pulsatility&#xD;
      index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Women with recurrent miscarriage have the same blood flow after aspirin or&#xD;
      clopidogrel treatment compared to their uterine artery pulsatility index before treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent miscarriage has been associated with genetic, anatomic, endocrine, immunologic,&#xD;
      behavioral, environmental factors and prothrombotic states; however, almost 50% of cases of&#xD;
      recurrent miscarriage are unexplained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenesis and uterine blood supply are essential for both endometrial growth and embryo&#xD;
      development. As a result, endometrial vascularity has been considered to play a critical role&#xD;
      in endometrial receptivity formation and pregnancy maintenance. The development of&#xD;
      three-dimensional (3D) ultra-sonography with power Doppler angiography provides an objective&#xD;
      and reproducible way to determine endometrial-subendometrial vascularity , which may evaluate&#xD;
      quantitatively the uterine vascularity microenvironment for the developing embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have shown the application of 3D-power Doppler angiography in assessment of&#xD;
      pregnancy loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale behind the use of aspirin is that this substance, at low doses, produces a&#xD;
      vasodilatatory effect by shifting the TXA2/PGI2 ratio toward the dominance of PGI2 activity&#xD;
      through the inhibition of TXA2 production. TXA2 is synthesized mainly by platelets and&#xD;
      induces platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, whereas PGI2, produced at the level of&#xD;
      vascular endothelial cells, inhibits platelet aggregation and promotes vasodilatation.&#xD;
      Aspirin, at low doses, has been proven to produce the selective inhibition of TXA2&#xD;
      production. In fact, TXA2 is primarily produced by the activity of cyclooxygenase&#xD;
      prostaglandin synthase-1 (COX-1) at the platelet level, which is highly sensitive to aspirin&#xD;
      inhibition. In contrast, PGI2 is mainly synthesized in the endothelial cells through the&#xD;
      activity of both COX-1 and COX-2, which is insensitive to aspirin administration at low&#xD;
      doses. Therefore, the administration of aspirin at low doses reduces TXA2 production without&#xD;
      affecting PGI2 secretion. It is reasonable that the increased PGI2 vasodilatation activity&#xD;
      can enhance uterine perfusion, thereby improving reproductive outcome. In addition, it has&#xD;
      been hypothesized that aspirin administration can reduce TXA2 endometrial cell excretion. It&#xD;
      is known that TXA2 levels at the site of embryo implantation are crucial for the success of&#xD;
      pregnancy. The presence of lower endometrial cell TXA2 production has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      patients who became pregnant with respect to those who did not achieve pregnancy. For these&#xD;
      reasons, low dose Aspirin supplementation is currently considered as an effective and safe&#xD;
      treatment option in the prevention of several pregnancy complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, aspirin even when administered at low doses can cause gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding, as reported in studies using 30-50 mg daily. In addition, it has not been proved&#xD;
      that enteric-coated or buffered aspirin is less likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding&#xD;
      than normal aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The search for active anti-platelet drugs within the original chemical class of the&#xD;
      thienopyridines, led to the discovery of clopidogrel, a novel ADP-selective agent whose&#xD;
      anti-aggregating properties are several times higher than those of ticlopidine. The&#xD;
      anti-aggregating properties of this compound are well known and, very recently, new results&#xD;
      have clarified its mechanism of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clopidogrel is active only after intravenous or oral administration, and no circulating&#xD;
      activity has been found in the plasma of treated animals or human volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiments in rats have demonstrated that the anti-aggregating activity was caused by a&#xD;
      short lasting metabolite generated in the liver by a cytochrome P450-dependent pathway. The&#xD;
      anti-aggregating property of clopidogrel is caused by an inhibition of the binding of ADP to&#xD;
      its platelet receptors, and more specifically to the low affinity receptors, the high&#xD;
      affinity binding sites being unaffected by clopidogrel. Several events in the ADP activation&#xD;
      process, including adenylyl cyclase down-regulation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation,&#xD;
      activation of the GPIIb-IIIa complex, fibrinogen binding, aggregation and release, were&#xD;
      inhibited by clopidogrel and indicate their close relationship with the activation of a low&#xD;
      affinity receptor by ADP. Thus, clopidogrel is not only a potent antithrombotic drug in&#xD;
      humans but also a good tool to study the effect of ADP on platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of Aspirin versus clopidogrel effect on&#xD;
      uterine perfusion in women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss with decreased uterine&#xD;
      artery pulsatility index.&#xD;
