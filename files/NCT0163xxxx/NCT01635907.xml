      This investigator-initiated study is being conducted to evaluate whether the investigational&#xD;
      drug, Dovitinib, can shrink or slow the growth of cancer in patients with certain types of&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors (advanced malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma). The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be response rate (Complete + Partial Response) determined by RECIST v 1.1. 25&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled on this study at the University of Pennsylvania.&#xD;

             diagnosis must be available at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have measurable disease by RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater or equal to 18 years old&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known untreated brain metastases are excluded. Patients having a history&#xD;
             of brain metastasis that have been previously irradiated or resected greater than 3&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment and are clinically and radiographically stable will be&#xD;
             considered for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with another primary malignancy within 3 years prior to starting study drug,&#xD;
             with the exception of adequately treated in-situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix, or&#xD;
             skin cancer (such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or&#xD;
             non-melanomatous skin cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received the last administration of an anticancer therapy including&#xD;
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy and monoclonal antibodies (but excluding&#xD;
             nitrosurea, mitomycin-C, targeted therapy and radiation) less than or equal to 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from the side effects of such&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received the last administration of nitrosurea or mitomycin-C less&#xD;
             than or equal to 6 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from&#xD;
             the side effects of such therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, or pazopanib less than&#xD;
             or equal to 2 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered (grade 1)&#xD;
             from the side effects of these therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had radiotherapy less than or equal to 4 weeks prior to starting&#xD;
             study drug, or less than or equal to 2 weeks prior to starting study drug in the case&#xD;
             of localized radiotherapy (e.g. for analgesic purpose or for lytic lesions at risk of&#xD;
             fracture), or who have not recovered from radiotherapy toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had therapeutic radiolabeled MIBG or other systemic radiolabeled&#xD;
             therapy less than or equal to 4 weeks prior to starting study drug,&#xD;

             intra-pelvic), open biopsy or significant traumatic injury less than or equal to 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to starting study drug, or patients who have had minor procedures,&#xD;
             percutaneous biopsies or placement of vascular access device 1 week prior to starting&#xD;
             study drug, or who have not recovered from side effects of such procedure or injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any of the following concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical&#xD;
             conditions which could compromise participation in the study (i.e. impaired cardiac&#xD;
             function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women or any subjects who refuse to use protocol required&#xD;
