  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New approaches are needed to achieve more rapid elimination of dormant mycobacteria and&#xD;
      thereby shorten treatment for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Dormant&#xD;
      mycobacteria are relatively resistant to antibacterial drugs and approaches that enhance&#xD;
      immune clearance have the potential to be more effective. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a key&#xD;
      cytokine in the immune response to TB that may impair the clearance of mycobacteria. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that pascolizumab, an anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody, might be of value as an&#xD;
      adjunct to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this trial are to determine whether administration of pascolizumab as an adjunct&#xD;
      to standard combination treatment for drug-sensitive TB produces changes in one or more&#xD;
      parameters of bacterial or host response (including bacterial clearance, host clinical&#xD;
      status, immune response, bacterial and host transcriptomics, lung imaging) that may indicate&#xD;
      potential for enhanced sterilization and to confirm the safety of blocking IL-4 (previously&#xD;
      demonstrated in healthy volunteers and patients with asthma) in patients with TB.&#xD;
