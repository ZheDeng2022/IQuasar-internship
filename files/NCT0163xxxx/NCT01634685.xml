  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study incorporating bavituximab into the care of patients with rectal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma simultaneously treated with capecitabine and radiation therapy. There is no&#xD;
      reference therapy as we are trying to identify the MTD of bavituximab in this combination.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational drug in this protocol is bavituximab, which will be delivered&#xD;
      concurrently with the radiation therapy for 6 weeks (one time each week), followed by 2 weeks&#xD;
      of bavituximab administration by itself. If the other therapies are terminated after week 4&#xD;
      the bavituximab treatment may be continued per protocol. A chemotherapy agent, capecitabine,&#xD;
      will be delivered twice daily p.o. on the days of radiation treatment, at a dose of 825&#xD;
      mg/m2. Radiation therapy will be administered daily, Monday-Friday, for a total of 28&#xD;
      treatments, delivered at 1.8 Gy/fraction. Surgery will follow the last bavituximab&#xD;
      administration by 4-8 weeks (6-10 weeks following completion of radiation therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biopsy-proven invasive adenocarcinoma of the rectum, stage T3-4 and/or node-positive&#xD;
             (AJCC stage II or III). For the purpose of this study, a tumor is located in the&#xD;
             &quot;rectum&quot; when its distal edge is located within 12cm of the anal verge. The distal&#xD;
             edge of the tumor can be delineated by digital examination or endoscopic examination,&#xD;
             including colonoscopy, although rigid proctoscopy is preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;

             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,&#xD;
