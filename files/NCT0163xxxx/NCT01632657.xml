  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative migrainous headache following craniotomy is distressing and may cause&#xD;
      significant morbidity and often delay discharge from the hospital. The mechanism of this post&#xD;
      craniotomy migraine is multifactorial. Possible causes include the intraoperative loss of&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid leading to stretching of the dura, traction on intracranial vessels and&#xD;
      meningeal irritation. There are two groups of patients who undergo elective minimally&#xD;
      invasive craniotomies and yet have considerable postoperative migraine headache&#xD;
      postoperatively. These are patients who have a craniotomy for clipping of an unruptured&#xD;
      cerebral aneurysm and patients who require a microvascular decompressive craniotomy for&#xD;
      cranial nerve pain such as trigeminal neuralgia. Their postoperative migrainous headache&#xD;
      often impairs the quality of their recovery and may even delay discharge from hospital.&#xD;
      Opioid analgesics are not always effective and may also worsen the postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting and in turn postoperative quality of their recovery. Sumatriptan is a drug that has&#xD;
      been used for decades for the treatment of migraine headaches. It acts on 5hydroxytryptophan&#xD;
      receptors, which are located in the dura mater (lining of the brain) and are also located&#xD;
      around the cranial trigeminal nerve ganglion. Thus sumatriptan may be an effective to improve&#xD;
      postoperative migraine , nausea and vomiting and overall quality of recovery. We plan to do a&#xD;
      randomized double blind placebo controlled trial on the effect of Sumatriptan for&#xD;
      postoperative migraine on the postoperative quality of recovery after elective minimally&#xD;
      invasive craniotomies. A total of 92 patients scheduled to undergo minimally invasive&#xD;
      craniotomy for either clipping of an unruptured aneurysm or microvascular decompression for&#xD;
      cranial nerve neuralgias will be included in this study. Patients within the 2 surgical&#xD;
      groups with postoperative migraine will then be block randomized to receive either 6mg of&#xD;
      sumatriptan subcutaneously or placebo following assessment in the post operative care unit&#xD;
      (PACU). The primary outcome measure will be quality of recovery at 24 hours using Quality of&#xD;
      recovery 40 Questionnaire (QoR-40). Our secondary outcome will be postoperative pain,&#xD;
      analgesic consumption, side effects and hospital discharge times.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently there have been changes in the surgical management of many patients who have an&#xD;
      unruptured cerebral aneurysm and or cranial nerve neuralgia pain. The surgical technique now&#xD;
      consists of a minimally invasive craniotomy that is less invasive with a smaller incision,&#xD;
      shorter duration of procedure and in some patients the possibility of going home the same&#xD;
      day, Postoperative surgical pain from the incision itself is usually minimal and they are&#xD;
      usually managed very well with combination of both opioid and non-opioid analgesics such as&#xD;
      fentanyl, morphine, hydromorphone, codeine, oxycocet, oxycontin and acetaminophen. In&#xD;
      addition, up to 65% patients undergoing craniotomy may suffer from post craniotomy headache&#xD;
      and the incidence may be higher after posterior fossa craniotomy. (1) Patients often complain&#xD;
      of severe migraine headache associated with photophobia, nausea and vomiting and general&#xD;
      feeling of unwell. These discomforts often delay discharge from the hospital and affect the&#xD;
      quality of recovery. (2,3) Post craniotomy surgical pain usually decreases significantly&#xD;
      after 24 hours whereas post craniotomy migraine headache, which may be a separate entity,&#xD;
      continues for a longer period of time. (4) This migraine headache is in different location&#xD;
      from the surgical incision and the conventional treatments of post surgical pain are&#xD;
      ineffective against migraine headache.(5) Hence these patients usually suffer a lot after&#xD;
      minimally invasive craniotomy. The mechanisms of postoperative migraine are also poorly&#xD;
      understood and may be multifactorial including raised intracranial pressure, traction on&#xD;
      intracranial blood vessels or meningeal irritation. (6) These factors activate the trigeminal&#xD;
      afferent C fibres that reside on pial and dural blood vessels. This causes transmission of&#xD;
      pain and release of neurogenic peptides activating an inflammatory cascade causing&#xD;
      vasodilation and perivascular inflammation. The loss of cerebrospinal fluid is another&#xD;
      factor.(7) With a minimally invasive craniotomy, loss of cerebrospinal fluid is unavoidable&#xD;
      as it is needed for better surgical access. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptophan) is a&#xD;
      neurotransmitter that is thought to contribute to the feeling of wellbeing. There are&#xD;
      receptors for 5hydroxytryptophan (5-HT) located in the central nervous system especially in&#xD;
      the trigeminal nerve both near the dura as well as in brainstem (near the trigeminal nuclei)&#xD;
      and also located on vascular endothelium and smooth muscle in meningeal blood vessels as well&#xD;
      as in neuronal tissue.&#xD;
