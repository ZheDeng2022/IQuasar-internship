  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the importance of arterial stiffness and wave reflections as&#xD;
      determinants of persistent left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and fibrosis (assessed using&#xD;
      cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) after correction of severe stenosis of the aortic&#xD;
      valve. The hypothesis will test whether stiff arteries and increased wave reflections impede&#xD;
      pumping of blood by the LV after aortic valve replacement (AVR)and precent adequate&#xD;
      regression (improvement) of hypertrophy and fibrosis of the myocardium despite correction of&#xD;
      aortic valve stenosis.&#xD;

      A total of 80 participants will be enrolled into the study from site with the&#xD;
      protocol-required technology. The Pennsylvania Department of Health funding for this trial is&#xD;
      limited to sites in Pennsylvania. Participants will undergo pre- and post-operative cardiac&#xD;
      MRI, blood draws, a 6-minute walk test, arterial tonometry, medical history assessment, and&#xD;
      quality-of-life questionnaires to characterize the pathophysiologic factors causing&#xD;
      variability in regression after AVR. Researchers will evaluate the role of specific&#xD;
      hemodynamic abnormalities as determinants of post-AVR LV remodeling (LV hypertrophy and LV&#xD;
      myocardial fibrosis) as seen on contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI. The trial also will evaluate a&#xD;
      non-contrast-enhanced MRI approach (T1rho) potentially effective in assessing LV myocardial&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;

        Patients who are 18 years of age or older with no contraindications to gadolinium&#xD;
        contrast-enhanced MRI of the heart who are able to have a cardiac MRI in the 21 days before&#xD;
        the AVR operation, have been diagnosed with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (estimated&#xD;
        aortic valve area &lt;1 cm2),1,2 and are scheduled for AVR between 0 and 28 days after&#xD;
        enrollment. Potential participants will have undergone a clinically indicated pre-operative&#xD;
        evaluation showing the absence of hemodynamically-significant CAD that would require&#xD;
        revascularization during the AVR operation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (estimated aortic valve area &lt;1 cm2) 1,2 as&#xD;
             documented on a transthoracic echocardiogram (ECG) performed within 4 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned for AVR within 8 weeks after enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to have a cardiac MRI within 3 weeks prior to the AVR surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A preoperative coronary angiography demonstrating the absence of&#xD;
             hemodynamically-significant CAD in need of revascularization during AVR surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to tolerate cardiac MRI with gadolinium contrast as required by protocol, to be&#xD;
             performed at an ACRIN-qualified facility using an ACRIN-qualified MR scanner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide a written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not suitable to undergo cardiac MRI or use the contrast agent gadolinium because of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of metallic objects or implanted medical devices in body (i.e.,&#xD;
                  implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator, central nervous system aneurysm&#xD;
                  clips, implanted neural stimulators, cochlear implant, ocular foreign body [e.g.,&#xD;
                  metal shavings], other implanted medical devices [e.g., drug infusion port],&#xD;
                  insulin pump, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial hearts, valves with steel&#xD;
                  parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, tattoos near the eye, or steel implants)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Weight greater than that allowable by the MRI table&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known LV ejection fraction &lt;50%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous aortic valve surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned additional valve repair/replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infective endocarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate or severe aortic valve regurgitation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rhythm other than sinus rhythm (i.e., atrial fibrillation) that results in an&#xD;
             irregular heartbeat, compromising the quality of MRI and tonometry data acquisition,&#xD;
             as documented on an ECG performed within 8 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of hemodynamically-significant CAD that would require revascularization&#xD;
             during the AVR surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the previous month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2 of body surface area&#xD;
             documented within 4 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: This threshold has been deemed appropriate for this study, rather than &lt;30&#xD;
        mL/min/1.73m2, since eGFR is likely to decrease for participants between the baseline and&#xD;
        6-month examinations. The protocol calls for gadolinium administration in the 6-month&#xD;
        evaluation, and gadolinium administration is contraindicated in the presence of an eGFR &lt;30&#xD;
        mL/min/1.73m2. Therefore, initially excluding patients who have an eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2&#xD;
        will minimize the presence of an eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2 at the time of the 6-month&#xD;
        evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        An eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 of body surface area or acute kidney injury will be a&#xD;
        contraindication to gadolinium contrast administration, and participants with insufficient&#xD;
        kidney function immediately before the 6-month cardiac MRI will undergo an MRI without&#xD;
        contrast-enhancement and will continue on-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a bicuspid aortic valve, which is associated with an intrinsic aortopathy&#xD;
             that may affect arterial load in its own right;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resting heart rate &gt;120 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mm Hg, or&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conditions that would make the study measurements less accurate or unreliable (i.e.,&#xD;
             frequent premature beats that may affecting cardiac gating, anatomic neck&#xD;
             characteristics impeding arterial tonometry, inability to perform an adequate breath&#xD;
             hold for cardiac MRI acquisitions) or the reliable post-operative follow-up of&#xD;
             patients (for at least 6 months post-AVR) unlikely&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known peripheral vascular disease, which may limit the ability to exercise&#xD;
             independently of cardiac status due to claudication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness of the patient to undergo a cardiac MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness of the patient to sign the consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition limiting life expectancy to &lt;1 year&#xD;
