    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety of islet transplantation for Type 1&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, which may provide more normal control of blood sugar without the need for&#xD;
      insulin shots. Islets are special clusters of cells within the pancreas that produce insulin.&#xD;
      These cells will be obtained from cadaver (non-living) donors and given to subjects by vein.&#xD;

             weight to a maximum of 360 mL; another product with equivalent caloric and nutrient&#xD;
             content may be substituted for Boost) measured at 60 and 90 min after the start of&#xD;
             consumption and at least one episode of severe hypoglycemia in the 12 months prior to&#xD;
             study enrollment; OR a clinical history of &quot;problematic hypoglycemia&quot; defined as&#xD;
             defined as two or more episodes per year of severe hypoglycemia or as one episode&#xD;
             associated with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, extreme glycemic lability, or&#xD;
             major fear and maladaptive behavior according to recent clinical recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Involvement in intensive diabetes management defined as self monitoring of glucose&#xD;
             values no less than a mean of three times each day averaged over each week and by the&#xD;
             administration of three or more insulin injections each day or insulin pump therapy.&#xD;
             Such management must be under the direction of an endocrinologist, diabetologist, or&#xD;
             diabetes specialist with at least 3 clinical evaluations during the 12 months prior to&#xD;
             study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia as defined by a Clarke score of 4 or more OR a HYPO&#xD;
             score greater than or equal to the 90th percentile (1047) during the screening period&#xD;
             and within the last 6 months; OR marked glycemic lability characterized by wide swings&#xD;
             in blood glucose despite optimal diabetes therapy and defined by an LI score greater&#xD;
             than or equal to the 90th percentile (433 mmol/L2/h -wk1) during the screening period&#xD;
             and within the last 6 months prior to randomization; OR a composite of a Clarke score&#xD;
             of 4 or more and a HYPO score greater than or equal to the 75th percentile (423) and a&#xD;
