    <textblock>
      Conditioned pain modulation is the ability of the spine to describe changes in pain&#xD;
      perception, if two different painful stimulations take place. The reliability of the&#xD;
      conditioned pain modulation has not been studied, the instruments used to measure the&#xD;
      conditioned pain modulation are sparse and have proven difficult to use in a well&#xD;
      reproductible way. This study is using an existing pain test, relying on the reflex in a&#xD;
      muscle after a painful electrical stimulation. We will test 34 healthy volunteers in order to&#xD;
      test the reliability of the conditioned pain modulation with the nociceptive withdrawal&#xD;
      reflex combined to a ice water test.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain is characterized by changes in the central processing of sensory inputs.&#xD;
      Quantitative sensory tests (QST) explore central excitability in humans and have the&#xD;
      potential to detect altered central pain processing in individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QST were developed to assess the responses to sensory stimuli for research purposes,&#xD;
      providing psychophysical and electrophysiological methods for the assessment of the&#xD;
      nociceptive system. Reliability is an essential condition for using QST in research and&#xD;
      clinical practice. It can be defined as the consistency of measurements across time, patients&#xD;
      or observers, and the extent to which it is error-free. Three categories have been assessed&#xD;
      for reliability in QST measures: intra-rater, inter-rater and test-retest reliability.&#xD;
      Reliability of QST measures in healthy volunteers are encouraging in regard to good&#xD;
      repeatability of QST measures over the time in the same subjects. Inter-rater reliability, a&#xD;
      prerequisite to compare different measures in between different studies, are also highly&#xD;
      encouraging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under normal conditions, pain after application of a test nociceptive stimulus is attenuated&#xD;
      by the application of an additional &quot;conditioning&quot; noxious stimulus to a remote body region,&#xD;
      reflecting diffuse endogenous inhibition. This is defined as conditioned pain modulation&#xD;
      (CPM), also known as the &quot;pain inhibits pain&quot; paradigm. CPM has been object of much work in&#xD;
      the last years. It goes back to the exploration of endogenous analgesia via descending&#xD;
      pain-modulatory systems, which started about three decades ago in animal models. Descending&#xD;
      inhibitory pathways are under cerebral control, mediating modulation of pain perception by&#xD;
      emotional, motivational and cognitive factors. Alterations of CPM are a known risk factor&#xD;
      concerning acute and chronic pain syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few reliability studies on CPM have been conducted to date. To our knowledge, only S.&#xD;
      Cathcart et al used occlusion cuff algometry and pressure pain detection to assess the&#xD;
      test-retest reliability in healthy volunteers. A study in chronic pain patients from our&#xD;
      group has shown great variability in CPM. It is unclear whether this phenomenon is related to&#xD;
      high interindividual variability of the CPM measure itself, or to poor reliability. In an&#xD;
      analysis of own data extracted from a pharmacological study, CPM measured at three different&#xD;
      sessions in patients with low back pain displayed very poor reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nociceptive withdrawal reflex is an electrophysiological measure. Compared to&#xD;
      psychophysical measures which rely on the subject's pain perception, the reflex could be a&#xD;
      more reproducible and stable measure over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present study is to assess the reliability of CPM using the&#xD;
      nociceptive withdrawal reflex as test stimulus and the ice water test as conditioning&#xD;
      stimulus in 34 consecutive patients, with a 7 days interval between two sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim is to compare the reliability of CPM with the nociceptive withdrawal reflex to&#xD;
      the reliability of CPM assessed with subjective pain assessments, i.e. pain threshold and&#xD;
      pain intensity after electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated assessments of CPM using the nociceptive withdrawal reflex threshold, electrical&#xD;
      pain detection threshold and suprathreshold electrical stimulation of the skin, with&#xD;
      ice-water as conditioning stimuli in all three models. There will be a 7 days interval&#xD;
      between two measurements.&#xD;
