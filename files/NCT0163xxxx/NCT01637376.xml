  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of I-PDT with Temoporfin for patients&#xD;
      with Non-Resectable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NR-NSCLC). Several clinical studies suggested&#xD;
      that photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be an effective treatment for patients with NR-NSCLC. PDT&#xD;
      is a therapy where an external light source, such as laser, is used to activate a&#xD;
      light-sensitive medicine to produce byproducts that can destroy cancer cells. In this study&#xD;
      the investigators will use an experimental light sensitive medicine, Temoporfin, to perform&#xD;
      interstitial PDT (I-PDT). In I-PDT, laser fibers are inserted into the tumor to activate the&#xD;
      light-sensitive medicine.&#xD;

    <description>The specific aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety of CT-guided I-PDT with Temoporfin on patients with NR-NSCLC. Patient safety will be the primary endpoint. The safety of the intervention will be assessed at 14 and 30 days post-therapy. The primary outcome will be occurrence of Serious Adverse Events (SAE).</description>

&#xD;
          -  The tumor is observable in CT with contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The tumor is accessible for unrestricted illumination of interstitial photodynamic&#xD;
             therapy (I-PDT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deemed likely to survive for at least 3 months.&#xD;

             pregnancy test and practice strict birth control (estrogen-containing oral&#xD;
             contraceptives or an intrauterine device) throughout the study and for 3 months after&#xD;
             Temoporfin administration. Women who have had a hysterectomy are exempt from these&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;

             period of at least 15 days.&#xD;
