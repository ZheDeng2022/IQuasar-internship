      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) from bone marrow biopsies can be used to treat&#xD;
           disorders that cause inflammation and immune system diseases. BMSC have been used to&#xD;
           treat graft versus host disease (GVHD), a complication that can develop after stem cell&#xD;
           transplants. BMSC have also been used to treat other post-transplant complications, like&#xD;
           marrow failure or tissue injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a procedure for collecting and&#xD;
           preserving BMSC from volunteer donors. These donors have passed tests to ensure that&#xD;
           their cells are healthy enough to be used for treatment. Researchers want to use the&#xD;
           collected cells to treat people with GVHD, marrow failure, or tissue injury following&#xD;
           stem cell transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of NIH-collected BMSC to treat complications from stem&#xD;
      cell transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 75 years of age who have complications from stem cell&#xD;
           transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications are acute GVHD, poor bone marrow function, or tissue or organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have imaging studies and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide blood, skin, and bone marrow samples before the BMSC&#xD;
           treatment. Additional samples, including tissue samples, will be collected after the&#xD;
           start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have up to three BMSC infusions. There will be a week between each&#xD;
           infusion. Participants will be monitored closely during each infusion. Any side effects&#xD;
           will be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and physical exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the end of the infusions, participants will have regular followup visits for up to&#xD;
           2 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) derived from bone marrow aspiration/biopsy have important&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties that make them suitable candidates for&#xD;
      cellular therapy of inflammatory and degenerative disorders. BMSC suppress lymphocyte immune&#xD;
      responsiveness and can hone in to sites of inflammation and promote healing. BMSC were first&#xD;
      used in man to successfully treat refractory acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). A&#xD;
      recent multicenter study treating refractory aGVHD reported a 66% response rate and a&#xD;
      sustained survival in responding patients. BMSC are currently being evaluated in acute GVHD&#xD;
      in several ongoing studies worldwide. BMSC have also been used to treat post-transplant&#xD;
      conditions not directly due to GVHD. Responses have been reported in hemorrhagic cystitis,&#xD;
      and pneumoperitoneum. BMSC are also under evaluation in the treatment of inflammatory and&#xD;
      autoimmune disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Clinical Center&#xD;
      NIH has developed a procedure for collecting, expanding and cryopreserving clinical grade&#xD;
      BMSC under an FDA Drug Master File (DMF). Marrow will be aspirated from volunteer donors&#xD;
      participating on protocol 10-CC-0053 who have passed the standard screening for blood and&#xD;
      marrow donors and BMSC will be expanded in vitro. Since it is not necessary to HLA-match BMSC&#xD;
      donors with their recipient for this study, a BMSC repository will be used as the source of&#xD;
      BMSC for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first trial of the safety of the NIH BMSC cellular product in stem cell&#xD;
      transplant recipients. In this phase I study, open to adult NIH allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (SCT) recipients, we will evaluate the safety of a fixed dose of BMSC&#xD;
      infusions (target dose of 2 x 106 BMSCs /kg (+/- 10%)) in patients with acute GVHD, marrow&#xD;
      failure or tissue injury following allogeneic SCT. Up to three BMSC infusions will be given&#xD;
      every 7 3 days apart. Safety will be monitored continuously with a stopping rule for toxicity&#xD;
      based on the treatment-related serious adverse event rate. Organ-specific clinical responses&#xD;
      will be measured. Where possible we will also attempt to identify transfused BMSC in sites of&#xD;
      damage in biopsy material. It is planned to accrue up to 10 subjects over a 6-month period.&#xD;
