  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will test an HIV prevention intervention for Latino parent-adolescents&#xD;
      dyads. This randomized controlled trial will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruit and randomize 320 parent-adolescent dyads into a Latino family-based HIV&#xD;
           prevention intervention or a family-based General Health Promotion condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the efficacy of the Latino Family-based HIV prevention intervention from&#xD;
           assessment of changes in HIV-related sexual behavior and attitudes over 18 months among&#xD;
           a sample of 320 Latino parent-adolescent dyads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the efficacy of the Latino Family-based HIV prevention intervention from&#xD;
           assessment of changes in family relationships and parental monitoring/supervision over&#xD;
           18 months among a sample of 320 Latino parent-adolescent dyads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine the association of other important constructs, such as religiosity,&#xD;
           acculturation, cultural values, and sexual socialization with the primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a thorough review of the literature and preliminary data from a recent, small pilot&#xD;
      study, the investigators hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compared to the General Health Promotion Control condition, the Family-Based HIV&#xD;
           Prevention intervention will result in greater change with regard to primary outcome&#xD;
           measures of safer sexual behavior (recent sexual activity, the number of unprotected sex&#xD;
           acts, and intentions to use condoms) and safer HIV-related attitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compared to the General Health Promotion Control condition, the Family-Based HIV&#xD;
           Prevention intervention will result in greater change with regard to family&#xD;
           relationships and parental monitoring/supervision through improved parent-child&#xD;
           communication skills and they will mediate the intervention impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Religiosity, acculturation, cultural values, and sexual socialization will have&#xD;
           meaningful associations with the primary outcomes and will act as moderators of&#xD;
           intervention impact.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latinos are disproportionately represented among those diagnosed with HIV and Latino&#xD;
      adolescents are at risk for engaging in sexual behaviors that can lead to HIV. To date, data&#xD;
      regarding HIV prevention interventions for Latino adolescents, as distinct from other ethnic&#xD;
      groups, have been rare. Thus, an efficacious HIV prevention intervention is urgently needed&#xD;
      for Latino adolescents. The current proposal is aimed at filling that gap by evaluating a&#xD;
      newly developed family-based intervention that incorporates cultural constructs into the&#xD;
      Social-Personal Framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This R01 builds on the Principal Investigator's NIMH-funded K Award, which piloted a&#xD;
      culturally-specific family-based intervention with 80 Latino parent-adolescent dyads and&#xD;
      demonstrates promising results. Extending this work, 320 Latino parent-adolescent dyads with&#xD;
      an adolescent between the ages of 14 and 17 will be randomized into either the family based&#xD;
      HIV prevention intervention or a family-based general health promotion control condition. In&#xD;
      both conditions, the interventions will use a multi-family group format consisting of 6 to 8&#xD;
      parent and youth dyads in a one-day, 7-hour workshop. Both interventions employ activities&#xD;
      for youth and parents separately (e.g., focus on adolescent vulnerability) and parents and&#xD;
      adolescents together (e.g., address parent/adolescent communication). The project will&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of the Latino Family-based HIV prevention intervention from assessment&#xD;
      of changes in the adolescents' HIV-related sexual behavior and attitudes, gender and sexual&#xD;
      socialization, parent-child communication, and parental monitoring. Measures will be&#xD;
      completed at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS is a significant problem in the Latino community. Developing culturally sensitive&#xD;
      HIV prevention interventions for Latino youth, in particular, is a public health priority.&#xD;
      Family-based interventions are likely to be well received by the Latino population.&#xD;
      Therefore, this project will examine the efficacy of a family-based HIV prevention&#xD;
      intervention for Latino youth and parents to decrease the incidence of HIV among Latinos. Its&#xD;
      innovation is in being one of the first to work with Latinos specifically in a family-based&#xD;
      intervention where parents and adolescents come together to discuss important&#xD;
      sexuality-related topics.&#xD;
