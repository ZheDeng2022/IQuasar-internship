    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical studies will evaluate the acute effects of nicotine on the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in women to test the hypothesis that nicotine alters&#xD;
      gonadal steroid hormones, and/or disrupts feedback regulation of ovarian hormones by anterior&#xD;
      pituitary hormones.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies are proposed to measure the covariance between smoked nicotine-induced&#xD;
      changes in endocrine, subjective and cardiovascular effects and the temporal concordance with&#xD;
      increases in serum nicotine and cotinine levels. Possible gender and menstrual cycle phase&#xD;
      influences on the effects of nicotine on anterior pituitary (ACTH, FSH, LH) and adrenal (DHEA&#xD;
      and cortisol) hormones have not been clearly delineated. Accordingly, these clinical studies&#xD;
      will compare the acute effects of nicotine in men (studied previously) and women, and to&#xD;
      study women at the follicular and the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be given two doses of nicotine: a commercially available, high-yield nicotine cigarette (Marlboro Red; Phillip Morris brand) and a denicotinized cigarette (Murty Pharmaceuticals Inc., Lexington, KY). The high dose cigarettes contain 15.48 mg of nicotine and 16 mg of tar based on analysis by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH, 1998). According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health classification, cigarettes with a nicotine yield of 1.2 mg or higher are high nicotine cigarettes. The low nicotine cigarettes contain 1.1 mg of nicotine and deliver 0.1 mg of nicotine and 2.8 mg of tar based on analyses provided by the manufacturer.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women between the ages of 18 and 40 who currently smoke at least 15 cigarettes every&#xD;
             day, and who fulfill DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for nicotine dependence (305.10) will&#xD;
             be eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of clinically significant disease based upon complete medical history and&#xD;
             physical examination by a qualified physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of DSM-IV Axis I Disorders other than nicotine dependence (305.10) as measured&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Routine laboratory blood tests including complete blood count, electrolytes, BUN and&#xD;

             Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C, but who do not have clinical and biochemical&#xD;
             evidence of acute infection, will be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematocrit levels â‰¥ 35%.&#xD;
