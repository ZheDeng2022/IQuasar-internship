    <textblock>
      This research is being carried out in order to compare two alternative versions of the&#xD;
      Neurotech Vital Devices which have been set up to provide two different types of stimulation.&#xD;
      Both these devices will be fully functioning devices and the investigators want to collect&#xD;
      information on your perception of the two alternative modes. The patient will be asked to&#xD;
      provide feedback on both devices which will look identical. The patient will not be told in&#xD;
      which order the units were given to them until the completion of your visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Neurotech Vital Device is connected to a series of conductive hydrogel electrodes&#xD;
      strategically positioned in and around the pelvic area of the user. The electrode positions&#xD;
      and current pathways deliver therapeutic stimulation to the pelvic floor muscles resulting in&#xD;
      repeated contraction of the intended muscle group. Pilot study data has shown this novel&#xD;
      approach to produce extremely favorable adaptation and improvement in patient's symptoms&#xD;
      following intervention. In order to capture the intended electrode position a stand-alone&#xD;
      garment that will allow the end user to re-position electrodes on multiple re-applications is&#xD;
      required. The Neurotech Vital Device garment is CE Marked as a Class IIa medical device and&#xD;
      it is CE Marked, as part of the Neurotech Vital Device, in line with Medical Device Directive&#xD;
      93/42/EC as amended by 2007/47/EC. The Neurotech Vital Device garment is not cleared by the&#xD;
      FDA through the 510 (k) pre-market notification process in the USA but would be considered a&#xD;
      Class II device as part of the Neurotech Vital Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this validation study is to establish the suitability of the Neurotech Vital&#xD;
      device in which the treatment stimulation parameters have been markedly attenuated (defined&#xD;
      as 'modified Neurotech Vital device') prior to its use as one of the treatments in a&#xD;
      randomised, controlled, double-blind study to be conducted in patients with stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence in Germany (Study No: BMR-11-1002).&#xD;

    <measure>The primary objective of this validation study is to verify that the Modified Neurotech Vital Device does not elicit a pelvic floor contraction compared to the Neurotech Vital Device.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day1</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is to demonstrate that no volunteers elicit a contraction of the pelvic floor muscle with the Modified Neurotech Vital Device and that all the volunteers elicit a contraction of the pelvic floor muscle with the Neurotech Vital Device. Contraction of the pelvic floor muscles will be assessed by using sonographic/real time ultrasound imaging/recording (mean of three measurements of pelvic floor displacement achieved during maximum threshold intensity electrical stimulation).</description>

    <description>Subjects will also be asked to complete a feedback questionnaire on the use of the Modified Neurotech Vital Device to verify that it is perceived as a valid treatment option.</description>
