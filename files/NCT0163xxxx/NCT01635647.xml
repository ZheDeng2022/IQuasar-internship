  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prime boost vaccination with ChAd63 ME-TRAP followed eight weeks later with MVA ME-TRAP shows&#xD;
      efficacy against malaria infection when tested in UK volunteers using sporozoite challenge&#xD;
      experiments. It is a leading candidate vaccination strategy against malaria. In the field,&#xD;
      Phase I studies have been conducted in adults in Kenya and The Gambia and children and&#xD;
      infants in The Gambia. The vaccination strategy appears safe and well tolerated in these&#xD;
      populations, and also shows impressive immunogenicity, not significantly different to that&#xD;
      seen in the UK trials where efficacy was shown. In particular, recent data from The Gambia&#xD;
      shows excellent safety and immunogenicity in infants in malaria endemic areas, who would be&#xD;
      the ones to benefit most from such a vaccine against malaria. With this clinical development&#xD;
      as background, the investigators now propose to evaluate efficacy against natural malaria&#xD;
      infection in this important target group for an effective malaria vaccine, that is, 5-17&#xD;
      month infants and children living in malaria endemic areas. The proposed study area, Banfora,&#xD;
      Burkina Faso, is highly endemic for Plasmodium falciparum malaria.&#xD;
