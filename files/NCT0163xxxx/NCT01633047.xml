  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is frequently injured, and it is the structure of the&#xD;
      athlete´s knee which has the highest prevalence of reconstruction. Given this postoperative&#xD;
      ACL reconstruction scenario the investigator find in literature the effectiveness of&#xD;
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) as an adjuvant treatment for strengthening the&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle. The intensity of NMES and the training duration are important factors for&#xD;
      a successful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare two rehabilitation protocols in patients during the&#xD;
      post operative of the ACL reconstruction over the strength of knee extension and control of&#xD;
      edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a randomized controlled study with the CONSORT bases with 40 participants that&#xD;
      will be divided into two groups: Control group that will be submitted only to physical&#xD;
      therapy exercises, and the Intervention group that will be submitted to physical therapy&#xD;
      exercises plus electrical stimulation (low frequency device with a current of 47 Hz with&#xD;
      symmetrical, biphasic and pyramidal waveforms, with pulse duration of 1.5 s and interval of&#xD;
      1.8 s). The procedure will last six weeks. It will be evaluated the pre intervention&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle extension force by means of a manual dynamometer, and the joint swelling&#xD;
      through the perimeter. This procedure will be repeated after six weeks of intervention.&#xD;

      Participants Twenty-two patients that submitted to ACL surgical reconstruction with flexor&#xD;
      grafts less than 15 days previously will be included in the study, both genders, between&#xD;
      18-45 years old. Individuals with previous knee lesions, other ligament injuries,&#xD;
      osteochondritis or associated menisci repair and complications during surgery will not be&#xD;
      included in the study. Patients that carried out complimentary therapies to the proposed&#xD;
      treatment will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomized into two groups: control and electrical stimulation group&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Intervention All the subjects will be submitted to physiotherapy sessions three times a&#xD;
      week, following a 12 weeks criterion based reahabilitation, carried out in line with the&#xD;
      objectives proposed for each rehabilitation phase (immediate post-operative, early&#xD;
      post-operativeand late post-operative). A group of trained physiotherapists will design the&#xD;
      exercises and determinate their evolution, including range of motion improvement, muscular&#xD;
      control and strength, gait training with progression in weight bearing and sensory-motor&#xD;
      control training, according to the established guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients from the electrical stimulation group will receive, in addition, NMES&#xD;
      application in the first six weeks of treatment, using an electrical stimulator with a&#xD;
      carrier frequency of 47 Hz with symmetrical, biphasic and pyramidal waves, with pulse&#xD;
      duration of 150 µs and duty cycle of 1,5 sec on and 1,8 sec off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation It will be evaluated the pre intervention quadriceps muscle extension force by&#xD;
      means of a manual dynamometer, and the joint swelling through the perimeter. This procedure&#xD;
      will be repeated after six weeks of intervention.&#xD;
