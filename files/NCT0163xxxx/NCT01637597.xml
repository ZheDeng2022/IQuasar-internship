      This is an exploratory non-randomized study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      NSCLC. Patients who are eligible to apply for Extended Access Program of crizotinib must have&#xD;
      ALK translocation detected by RT-PCR, IHC or FISH analyses methods. Patients who failed and&#xD;
      progressed through at least one line of platinum containing chemotherapy and who are older&#xD;
      than 70 years old with failure of chemotherapy will be eligible for this study. We will&#xD;
      screen EML4-ALK fusion gene by RT-PCR (HotSart Taq Master Mix Kits, Qiaqen) from patients'&#xD;
      malignant pleural effusions and the detail was described in previous study[1]. We will also&#xD;
      use IHC analyses (5A4 monoclonal antibody, Novocastra) to screen ALK protein expression in&#xD;
      patients' FFPE tumor sections. We will further do FISH analysis by using commercial Vysis LSI&#xD;
      ALK Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (2p23) (Abott Molecular Inc., Des Plaines,&#xD;
      IL) to detect ALK rearrangement in positive screening tumors. Samples are deemed to be&#xD;
      FISH-positive if more than 15% of 50 scored tumor cells had split ALK 5' and 3' probe signals&#xD;
      or had isolated 3' signals[5]. Patients who have ALK rearrangement determined in any of 3&#xD;
      molecular analyses methods and apply for crizotinib will receive 250mg of crizotinib twice&#xD;
      daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities or the withdrawal of consent is&#xD;
      noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored carefully for the development of adverse experiences. Adverse&#xD;
      experiences will be evaluated according to criteria outlined in the National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Patients will also&#xD;
      be monitored for clinical and/or radiographic evidence of disease progression according to&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is overall response rate in patients with positive ALK&#xD;
      determined from different molecular analysis methods. The secondary endpoint included overall&#xD;
      response in specific subsets of patients, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) at 1 year. PFS is defined as the time from day 1 of crizotinib to disease&#xD;
      progression or patient's death. OS was defined as the time from day 1 of crizotinib treatment&#xD;
      to patient's death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment, patients will have safety measurements performed at specified time&#xD;
      points. Disease response will be assessed during the study by radiographic (e.g., CT or MRI),&#xD;
      and clinical (e.g., physical examination) evaluations, if applicable. Overall tumor response&#xD;
      will be assessed at the designated time points (every 12 weeks, using Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, Version 1.1). The crizotinib treatment could be continued&#xD;
      after RECIST-defined disease progression if clinical benefit is still noted by primary&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;

      Blood and tumor tissue are being collected during the course of this study, to assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability and spectrum of side effects of the study drug. However, it is&#xD;
      possible that after completion of all study-related analyses, some volume of samples may&#xD;
      remain. These left-over samples could be a valuable resource for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before any left-over samples can be used for any research other than that specified in the&#xD;
      protocol, patient must sign an additional future use consent from indicating they give their&#xD;
      permission for these samples to be used in future research. By signing the main consent form,&#xD;
      patients are only giving their permission to use their samples for the study related&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
