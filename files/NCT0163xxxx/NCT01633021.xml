      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Knowing one s family medical history is a part of staying healthy. Some health risks run in&#xD;
      families, and knowing these risks can promote more healthy behavior. Different social and&#xD;
      cultural factors may affect how family members share this information. Genetic risk&#xD;
      information that is shared in one family may not be shared in the same way in another. This&#xD;
      information may also be shared differently between spouses, siblings, or parents and&#xD;
      children. It may even be shared with more distant relatives. Knowing the information that&#xD;
      family members share and how they share it may help researchers improve genetic disease&#xD;
      treatment and support plans. Family surveys of people who have genetic health risks may help&#xD;
      provide this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how family members affected by genetic-related diseases share health information&#xD;
      with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who can read English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants affected by a genetic disease or be related or married to someone who has&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with an initial questionnaire. They will identify their&#xD;
           genetic disease and provide a basic health history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have the disease will complete an online survey or participate in a&#xD;
           personal interview. The questions will take about 45 minutes to 1 hour to answer. The&#xD;
           survey will ask about family health history and family support. Participants will also&#xD;
           provide referrals to a spouse or relatives who will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The spouse or relative will answer a similar survey. The survey will ask about health&#xD;
           history and support for the spouse/relative with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A gift card will be given as thanks for participating in the study.&#xD;

      Facilitating the dissemination of disease risk information and promoting engagement in&#xD;
      healthful behaviors within families may be enhanced by using network-based interventions.&#xD;
      Network-based interventions are innovative in that they are tailored to the structure of the&#xD;
      social system within which individuals are embedded. Understanding the social and relational&#xD;
      factors associated with processes of family risk dissemination, family encouragement, and&#xD;
      support is essential to developing network-based intervention tools targeting the family. The&#xD;
      first objective of the current project is to ascertain those key social pathways that can be&#xD;
      used in a family-centered network-based intervention that promotes disease prevention and&#xD;
      health promotion in at-risk families. To this end, efforts will be focused on assessing&#xD;
      whether there is a consistent, small set of relational characteristics associated with the&#xD;
      dissemination of family risk information and processes of both behavioral and emotional&#xD;
      adaptation to disease risk across various disease and cultural contexts. The second objective&#xD;
      is to examine the feasibility of using cognitive network approaches to assess social&#xD;
      interactions among family members as a means to enhance the implementation of a network-based&#xD;
      intervention. A cognitive network is an individual's perception of the relationships among&#xD;
      their family (or network) members. Thus, cognitive network approaches can potentially be used&#xD;
      to capture an accurate representation of family social structure based on the information&#xD;
      provided by a small subset of optimally situated family members. Those key social pathways&#xD;
      identified within the first objective of this research will be used to address the second&#xD;
      objective. Families affected by diseases and disorders that span the spectrum of genetic&#xD;
      penetrance, ranging from highly penetrant, monogenetic disease to less penetrant, common&#xD;
      complex conditions, will be recruited for the study. Further, the current effort will seek to&#xD;
      engage samples from diverse cultural backgrounds to address our limited knowledge regarding&#xD;
      risk communication and adaptation in such families and to facilitate generalization of&#xD;
      results. Study participants will be recruited from established cohorts, outreach events, or&#xD;
      ongoing studies, both at the NIH and at extramural institutions. Family members will be&#xD;
      recruited using a snowball sampling approach and will be asked to complete an in-person,&#xD;
      web-based and/or telephone survey/interview. Interviews will have a semi-structured format to&#xD;
      allow for slight deviations in prompts and probes to address participant questions. The&#xD;
      research addressed in this protocol will lead to the development of an innovative methodology&#xD;
      with the potential to improve the design and implementation of family-based interventions&#xD;
      that promote disease prevention.&#xD;
