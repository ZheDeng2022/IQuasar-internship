    <textblock>
      Most colorectal cancers arise from polyps. Most polyps removed at colonoscopy are small. New&#xD;
      technologies such as narrowband imaging (NBI) offer the possibility of in differentiation&#xD;
      between precancerous and unimportant small polyps. Use of these technologies could decrease&#xD;
      the costs and potentially the risks of screening and surveillance colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have demonstrated the ability of experienced endoscopists to achieve high&#xD;
      accuracy in differentiating polyp types using NBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that community-based endoscopists can learn to identify polyp&#xD;
      type at colonoscopy with the aid of NBI through the use of an introductory didactic program,&#xD;
      followed by practice based-learning, and that their experience can serve as guidelines for&#xD;
      wider dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test an educational program combining a didactic program&#xD;
      followed by practice-based learning that is designed to allow community-based endoscopists to&#xD;
      become proficient at the use of NBI in the colon. This study will not affect the care of&#xD;
      patients in any way. The research subjects will be the endoscopists, who will perform&#xD;
      colonoscopy and polyp removal in the usual clinical fashion, with the addition of attempting&#xD;
      to predict polyp type before resection.&#xD;

      A) Study Purpose and Rationale Most polyps removed at colonoscopy are small. The natural&#xD;
      history of these polyps is not understood completely, but the risk of subsequent cancer in&#xD;
      persons with small rectosigmoid adenomas may not be higher than in persons without&#xD;
      rectosigmoid adenomas [1]. With improvements in colonoscopic imaging, experienced&#xD;
      endoscopists can detect polyps in a large fraction of patients. Removal of all small polyps&#xD;
      followed by formal histopathological examination increases the costs associated with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer screening, and may increase the risk of complications, depending on the&#xD;
      technique that is used for polypectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New technologies such as narrowband imaging (NBI) offer the possibility of in vivo&#xD;
      differentiation between adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. Policies to leave in place small&#xD;
      polyps that appear to be hyperplastic, or to remove and discard small polyps after in vivo&#xD;
      histologic categorization without formal histopathology review could significantly decrease&#xD;
      the costs and potentially the risks of screening and surveillance colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have demonstrated the ability of experienced endoscopists to achieve high&#xD;
      accuracy in differentiating adenomatous from hyperplastic polyps using NBI [2, 3, 4, 5]. The&#xD;
      level of confidence associated with in vivo histologic categorization of a particular polyp&#xD;
      is a valuable adjunct measure in determining subsequent clinical management. Dissemination to&#xD;
      the community setting of policies that promote in vivo histologic categorization is likely to&#xD;
      require practice-based learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Hypotheses The investigators hypothesize that community-based endoscopists can learn to&#xD;
      identify polyp histology at colonoscopy with the aid of NBI through the use of an&#xD;
      introductory didactic program, followed by practice based-learning, and that representative&#xD;
      learning curves can be generated that can serve as guidelines for wider dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Purpose The purpose of this study is to test an educational program combining a didactic&#xD;
      program followed by practice-based learning that is designed to allow community-based&#xD;
      endoscopists to become proficient at in vivo histologic characterization of small polyps with&#xD;
      the aid of NBI. This study will not require any changes in endoscopists' decisions regarding&#xD;
      the indications and methods for polypectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not address directly whether polyps predicted to be hyperplastic or even&#xD;
      diminutive adenomas should be left in place, or discarded and not submitted for formal&#xD;
      histopathological review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Specific Aims This study has two primary and two secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One primary aim is to assess the proficiency of community-based endoscopists at ex vivo&#xD;
           histologic characterization of polyps using NBI based on photographs before and after a&#xD;
           didactic program designed to familiarize them with in vivo histologic characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The central primary aim is to assess whether the currently designed program is effective&#xD;
           at training endoscopists to classify adenomatous vs. hyperplastic polyps in practice&#xD;
           with at least 90% accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A secondary aim is to characterize endoscopists' individual and group average learning&#xD;
           curves for in vivo histologic characterization using NBI during practice-based learning,&#xD;
           with attention to level of confidence, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive&#xD;
           and negative predictive values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Another secondary aim is to determine whether surveillance recommendations that would be&#xD;
           made based on in vivo histologic characterization using NBI are comparable to those&#xD;
           based on formal histopathological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) Timeline for assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopists' accuracy will be determined at three pre-specified points: after assessment of&#xD;
      50, 70 and 90 independent diminutive polyps (defined as &lt;=5mm polyps, one per study&#xD;
      colonoscopy, with random selection in cases of &gt;1 diminutive polyp per study colonoscopy). We&#xD;
      estimate that in order to assess 90 independent diminutive polyps, endoscopists will need to&#xD;
      participate for 6-12 months.&#xD;
