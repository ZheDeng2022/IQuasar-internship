  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive Care Units (ICUs) across Scotland are working with the Scottish Patient Safety&#xD;
      Programme (SPSP) to reduce healthcare associated infections (HAls). This is being done&#xD;
      through implementation of &quot;care bundles&quot;. Ensuring that ICU patients get the correct amount&#xD;
      of sedation (medicine that makes patients sleepy) is part of this bundle, but is proving the&#xD;
      most difficult to get right. It's important healthcare staff (nurses and doctors) get&#xD;
      sedation levels correct because too much sedation is linked with increased hospital acquired&#xD;
      infections (HAIs), longer intensive care (ICU) and hospital stays, and possibly higher death&#xD;
      rates. This quality improvement project will develop and introduce three interventions that&#xD;
      may improve sedation practice: first, an ICU sedation education package; second, feedback of&#xD;
      sedation-related performance data (graphs and charts); and third, introduction of a CE&#xD;
      (Conformité Européenne - With the CE marking on a product, the manufacturer ensures that the&#xD;
      product conforms with the essential requirements of European regulations) marked new&#xD;
      technology designed to improve sedation management. The investigators will study the effect&#xD;
      these interventions, in different combinations, have on sedation management and quality in&#xD;
      the participating ICUs. Eight ICUs in Scotland will take part in the project, pairs (2 ICUs)&#xD;
      will be assigned randomly to different combinations as follows: 1.Enhanced education alone,&#xD;
      2. Education plus process/outcome measure feedback (graphs and charts), 3. Education plus&#xD;
      introduction of a new sedation monitoring technology, or 4. Education,process/outcome measure&#xD;
      feedback, and sedation monitoring technology. The investigators will evaluate which&#xD;
      combinations of education, feedback, and technology provide the most patient benefit in the&#xD;
      NHS. In addition both nursing &amp; medical staff will be observed in clinical practice &amp;&#xD;
      interviewed about their clinical practice to increase understanding about sedation management&#xD;
      from different view points and inform the education package content. These data will also&#xD;
      help implement the findings after the research is completed if a benefit is found.&#xD;

Group 1 -Education package only (bespoke sedation education) Group 2 -Education package and real time (site specific) process feedback about sedation practices Group 3 - Education and responsiveness (sedation) technology Group 4 - Education package, real time (site specific) process feedback about sedation practices and responsiveness (sedation) technology</description>
