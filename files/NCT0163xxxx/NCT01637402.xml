  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad,an increased dose of&#xD;
      Abiraterone Acetate in combination with prednisone has on patients and their prostate cancer.&#xD;
      This study will investigate whether an increased-dose (2,000mg daily) is safe and potentially&#xD;
      effective when given to patients whose cancer has grown while taking the standard dose.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multicenter trial of Abiraterone Acetate (AA) in patients with progressive&#xD;
      prostate cancer despite androgen deprivation with a particular focus on the pharmacokinetic,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic, and pharmacogenomic events occurring at the time of apparent drug&#xD;
      resistance. All eligible patients will have baseline (prior to taking the first dose of&#xD;
      Abiraterone Acetate 1000mg/daily) measures of routine clinical variables along with&#xD;
      measurements of baseline and treatment related changes in testosterone, androgen, and&#xD;
      endocrine levels, genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the selected enzymes&#xD;
      known to be directly inhibited by Abiraterone Acetate, and collection of circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells. All patients will be requested to consent for biopsies which will be performed prior&#xD;
      to treatment and at the time of disease progression on standard dose Abiraterone Acetate&#xD;
      therapy. These biopsies will be analyzed for expression of an androgen receptor&#xD;
      (AR)-signature as well as for microarray analysis to explore changes in methylation, and&#xD;
      expression of CYP17A1 and other androgen synthesis genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then begin daily oral therapy with Abiraterone Acetate 1000mg po daily with&#xD;
      physiologic prednisone 5mg BID replacement. No food should be consumed for at least 2 hours&#xD;
      before the dose of Abiraterone Acetate and for at least 1 hour after the dose of Abiraterone&#xD;
      Acetate is taken. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) will be followed monthly. Abiraterone&#xD;
      Acetate will be supplied by Janssen Services. At the end of the first month, the third month,&#xD;
      and then every three months thereafter, Abiraterone Acetate, testosterone, and androgen&#xD;
      levels will be followed. Subjects not achieving a greater than or equal to 30% PSA decline at&#xD;
      12 weeks will be taken off study. At the time of progression (defined by RECIST criteria OR&#xD;
      by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG) criteria as a 25% increase in PSA above the&#xD;
      nadir and an increase in the absolute value PSA of at least 2ng/dl or back to baseline&#xD;
      confirmed at least 2 weeks afterward) for subjects who achieved an initial greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 30% PSA decline (referred to as Progressive Disease (PD) #1), subjects will begin&#xD;
      taking Abiraterone Acetate 1000 mg po BID. Patients will continue to take prednisone 5mg&#xD;
      twice a day (BID) and will continue this therapy until a second progression at which point&#xD;
      they will be withdrawn from the study. While 1000 mg po BID is not the FDA recommended dose,&#xD;
      it is the dose to be investigated in this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have ongoing gonadal androgen deprivation therapy with Luteinizing hormone-releasing&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Progressive disease after androgen deprivation: PSA evidence for progressive prostate&#xD;
             cancer consists of a PSA level of at least 2 ng/ml which has risen on at least 2&#xD;
             successive occasions, at least 2 weeks apart. If the confirmatory PSA value is less&#xD;
             than the screening PSA value, then an additional test for rising PSA will be required&#xD;
             to document progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antiandrogen Withdrawal (AAWD): Patients who are receiving an antiandrogen as part of&#xD;
             primary androgen ablation must demonstrate disease progression following&#xD;
             discontinuation of antiandrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease progression after antiandrogen withdrawal is defined as 2 consecutive rising&#xD;
             PSA values, obtained at least 2 weeks apart, or documented osseous or soft tissue&#xD;
             progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients receiving flutamide, at least one of the PSA values must be obtained 4&#xD;
             weeks or more after flutamide discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients receiving bicalutamide or nilutamide, at least one of the PSA values must&#xD;
             be obtained 6 weeks or more after antiandrogen discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No antiandrogen withdrawal response is expected in patients in whom antiandrogen&#xD;
             therapy did NOT result in a decline in PSA or in those patients in whom the response&#xD;
             to antiandrogens was &lt; 3 months. Therefore, it is not necessary to wait for AAWD in&#xD;
             patients without PSA decline on an anti-androgen or in those in whom a PSA response&#xD;
             lasted &lt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-1&#xD;

      <pre_assignment_details>All participants were prescribed the standard dose(STD). Participants who did not exhibit prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline at 12 weeks were deemed 'primary-resistant' and taken off study. Participants continued STD until progression, at which time, they were assigned to the escalated dose was for a minimum of 12 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Pearson's correlation coefficients (&quot;r&quot;) will be calculated to summarize the relationship between testosterone values at baseline and at 12 weeks. Testosterone labs will be obtained at an earlier time point if the patient comes off study for disease progression before week 12. Coefficients are on a continuous scale ranging from -1 to +1 with a value of -1 indicating a perfect negative linear association of testosterone levels between the 2 time points, a value of 0 indicating no association between testosterone levels between the two time points, and a value of +1 indicating a positive linear association of testosterone levels between the two time points.</description>

        <population>Testosterone levels were maximally suppressed below the laboratory limit of detection (LOD) at week 12 for patients on standard-dose therapy so no correlation could be performed.

          <title>Correlation of Circulating Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) Levels From Baseline to Week 12</title>
          <description>Pearson's correlation coefficients (&quot;r&quot;) will be calculated to summarize the relationship between DHEA values at baseline and at 12 weeks. DHEA labs will be obtained at an earlier time point if the patient comes off study for disease progression before week 12. Coefficients are on a continuous scale ranging from -1 to +1 with a value of -1 indicating a perfect negative linear association of DHEA levels between the 2 time points, a value of 0 indicating no association between DHEA levels between the two time points, and a value of +1 indicating a positive linear association of DHEA levels between the two time points.</description>
          <population>No DHEA values were collected for week 12 in dose escalation group so correlation of for dose escalation could not be performed.</population>
