  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of postoperative PJI is ranging from 0.5-2.5% for primary interventions and are&#xD;
      reported up to 20% for revision procedure. In addition, hematogenous PJI can occur at any&#xD;
      time after implantation and the risk of infection remains during the entire prosthesis&#xD;
      indwelling time. Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) are associated with significant morbidity&#xD;
      and costs to the healthcare system. Evidence for optimal management of PJI with best outcome&#xD;
      and lowest expenses is limited and recommendations between countries vary significantly.&#xD;
      There is unmet need to standardized diagnostic procedures and definition of infection as well&#xD;
      as achieve a consensus for uniform treatment guidelines.The European Implant Cohort Study&#xD;
      (EICS) is a multicenter European research project, including patients with PJI in a cohort&#xD;
      representative for Europe. The EICS is established jointly by the Orthopedic and Traumatology&#xD;
      surgeons, Infectious Diseases specialists and microbiologists of selected university and&#xD;
      non-university institutions across Europe. The principal aim of the EICS is to improve the&#xD;
      management of PJI and develop consensus guidelines across Europe. By systematic analysis of&#xD;
      consecutively included patients with PJI, factors associated with best outcome regarding&#xD;
      infection (assessed by the infection-free interval) and joint function (assessed by the&#xD;
      degree of pain, mobility, range of motion) will be determined in a longitudinal prospective&#xD;
      study with long-term follow-up. This is an investigator-initiated, open, prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter observational study. Participating study centers will be university or&#xD;
      non-university hospitals across Europe, which fulfill the following study conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Close collaboration between infectious diseases specialists, microbiologists and&#xD;
           orthopedic/trauma surgeons,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Availability of appropriate microbiological methods (following standard recommendations&#xD;
           including sonication of removed prosthesis),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Availability a dedicated study team (study nurse and/or research fellow) for regular&#xD;
           eligibility screenings, patient inclusion procedure, real-time data collection and&#xD;
           patient follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project may generate important scientific evidence for future guidelines regarding&#xD;
      management of PJI, has the potential to initiate new multicenter substudies in an establish&#xD;
      network, and may open further collaboration and exchange of skills between institutions&#xD;
      across Europe.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The principal aim of the EICS is to improve the management of PJI and develop consensus&#xD;
           guidelines across Europe. By systematic analysis of consecutively included patients with&#xD;
           PJI, factors associated with best outcome regarding infection (assessed by the&#xD;
           infection-free interval) and joint function (assessed by the degree of pain, mobility,&#xD;
           range of motion) will be determined in a longitudinal prospective study with long-term&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the EICS evaluable patient groups will be generated enabling the comparison between&#xD;
           different surgical and antimicrobial treatment concepts. This study aim will be achieved&#xD;
           by:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Recruitment of patients with PJI of joint prostheses (e.g. hip, knee, shoulder and&#xD;
           ankle joints) in participating study centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Systematic collection of clinical, radiological, pharmacological, laboratory,&#xD;
                microbiological, treatment and outcome data using a standardized electronic CRF&#xD;
                (eCRF)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ensuring long-term follow-up of patient with evaluation regarding infection,&#xD;
                functional result and health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Orthopedic devices are increasingly used for treatment of the degenerative joint disease&#xD;
           and for fixation of bone fractures in the growing population of the elderly. In the&#xD;
           United States, about 800,000 primary hip and knee arthroplasties were performed in 2006;&#xD;
           by the year 2030, the demand for primary total hip arthroplasties is estimated to&#xD;
           increase to 572,000 and for primary total knee arthroplasties to 3.48 million&#xD;
           procedures. Similar increase of primary and revision arthroplasty surgeries are observed&#xD;
           in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to high cost of implantable devices and considerably morbidity associated with&#xD;
           surgical procedure, a non-invasive approach is the preferred treatment modality, if&#xD;
           possible (i.e. retention of the implant with antibiotic therapy active against&#xD;
           biofilms).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Purpose of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EICS is a multicenter European research project, including patients with prosthetic joint&#xD;
      infections (PJI) in a cohort representative for Europe. The European Implant Cohort Study is&#xD;
      established jointly by the Orthopedic and Traumatology surgeons, Infectious Diseases&#xD;
      specialists and microbiologists of selected university and non-university institutions across&#xD;
      Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is an investigator-initiated, open, prospective, multicenter observational study.&#xD;
           Participating study centers will be university or non-university hospitals across&#xD;
           Europe, which fulfill the following study conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Close collaboration between infectious diseases specialists, microbiologists and&#xD;
                orthopedic/trauma surgeons,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Availability of appropriate microbiological methods (following standard&#xD;
                recommendations including sonication of removed prosthesis),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Availability a dedicated study team (study nurse and/or research fellow) for&#xD;
                regular eligibility screenings, patient inclusion procedure, real-time data&#xD;
                collection and patient follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Material and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patient recruitment, ethics and study procedure All patients with a suspected PJI&#xD;
                will be screened for eligibility by the responsible research fellow in each&#xD;
                participating study center. Potential study participants will be identified during&#xD;
                the outpatient visit (before hospitalization) or after admission. The data will be&#xD;
                collected using an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) in real-time (within 5 days&#xD;
                of patient inclusion). The approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be&#xD;
                obtained before start of the study. Patients will give informed consent before&#xD;
                study inclusion. The study protocol will be submitted for evaluation to the&#xD;
                European Medicines Agency (EMA). For all local study coordinators a training&#xD;
                workshop will be organized before start of recruitment. In addition, a hotline is&#xD;
                available for questions regarding the inclusion/exclusion procedure, data&#xD;
                collection, treatment algorithm or adverse event reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Data collection The following data will be collected at study inclusion, during&#xD;
                hospitalization and during follow-up visits (3, 6, 12 months and thereafter as the&#xD;
                usual clinical practice): demographic data, date of primary implantation, type of&#xD;
                implant, previous joint surgeries, presence of potential risk factors for PJI,&#xD;
                clinical characteristics, microbiological, laboratory and radiological data. At&#xD;
                each follow-up visit, functional outcome, adherence to antimicrobial treatment&#xD;
                protocol, potential drug-drug interactions and possible side effects of&#xD;
                antimicrobials will be recorded. Patients who will not appear at their scheduled&#xD;
                visits will be actively contacted by phone (or their treating practitioners).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Outcome evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
                The following outcome endpoints will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Primary outcome: Infection outcome. This will be determined as the infection-free&#xD;
                interval after end of treatment. Infection-free status is defined as absence of&#xD;
                clinical (e.g. no fistula), laboratory (e.g. normal C-reactive protein) and&#xD;
                radiological signs of infection (e.g. no septic loosening). The expected &quot;cure&#xD;
                rate&quot;, defined as the infection-free interval at 2 years, is &gt; 80%. The treatment&#xD;
                outcome of the combined (antimicrobial and surgical) treatment approach will be&#xD;
                assessed in a time-dependent manner using the Kaplan-Meier survival method.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Secondary outcome: Functional outcome and pharmacokinetic studies. The&#xD;
                     functional assessment will be performed using joint-specific scores involving&#xD;
                     the range of motion (ROM), patient mobility / independency in daily life and&#xD;
                     subjective evaluation of pain using a pain scale (1-10 points). The expected&#xD;
                     functional outcome is that &gt;60% patients return to previous life activities, &gt;&#xD;
                     75% reduction of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Definitions of variables&#xD;
&#xD;
                • If clinical, laboratory or radiographic signs are suggesting infection,&#xD;
                preoperative (e.g. arthrocentesis) and/or intraoperative procedures (e.g.&#xD;
                arthroscopy or arthrotomy) will be performed to proactively confirm or exclude an&#xD;
                infection. In case of uncertainty, diagnostic procedure will be repeated in several&#xD;
                days to weeks (depending on the severity of symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
                • PJI is defined if at least one of the following criteria are present: (i)&#xD;
                presence of sinus tract (fistula), (ii) increased leukocyte count or neutrophils&#xD;
                percentage in preoperative synovial fluid aspirate, (iii) acute inflammation in&#xD;
                histopathology of periprosthetic tissue, (iv) visible pus around the prosthesis,&#xD;
                (v) growth in synovial fluid, sonication or periprosthetic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Further classification is performed according to the route of infection&#xD;
                     (intraoperative or hematogenous) and clinical presentation (acute versus&#xD;
                     chronic = low-grade).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Device outcome is evaluated regarding infection (i.e. primary outcome = new&#xD;
                     infection with a different pathogen versus persistent infection with same&#xD;
                     organism) or functionality (i.e. secondary outcome = concerning non-infectious&#xD;
                     characteristics, such as aseptic device failure, periprosthetic or implant&#xD;
                     fracture, pain, mobility).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The number of variables, which will be evaluated with regard to treatment&#xD;
                     outcome are reduce to the following 3 parameters: (i) type of joint&#xD;
                     prosthesis, (ii) type of surgical procedure, (iii) type of antimicrobial&#xD;
                     treatment. If the patient is not treated according to the predetermined&#xD;
                     treatment protocol (i.e. study protocol deviation), these patients will be&#xD;
                     evaluated separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     d. Microbiology diagnostic Microbiology analyses will be performed at the&#xD;
                     local microbiology laboratories of each participating study center. The&#xD;
                     antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated microorganisms will be tested by as&#xD;
                     routine practice. Synovial fluid will be aspirated preoperatively (when&#xD;
                     appropriate) and multiple (at least 3 specimens) periprosthetic tissue samples&#xD;
                     will be collected during initial surgery. All isolated strains will be&#xD;
                     re-identified and their antimicrobial susceptibility will be re-tested at the&#xD;
                     central microbiology laboratory. In addition, the explanted prosthesis (or&#xD;
                     part of it) will be investigated by sonication to increase the diagnostic&#xD;
                     yield of biofilms by detachment of adherent microorganism.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     e. Pharmacokinetic studies In selected study centers (optional), population&#xD;
                     pharmacokinetic profile of the administered antimicrobials (e.g. daptomycin,&#xD;
                     rifampicin, vancomycin) in plasma and in drainage fluid will be determined, to&#xD;
                     quantify inter- and intra-patient variability and to identify sources of&#xD;
                     variability in drug concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     f. Safety Adverse events and Serious Adverse events (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign,&#xD;
                     symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting study medication even&#xD;
                     if the event is not considered to be related to study medication. Medical&#xD;
                     conditions/diseases present before starting study medication are only&#xD;
                     considered adverse events if they worsen after starting the study medication.&#xD;
                     Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if&#xD;
                     they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant,&#xD;
                     or require therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  An SAE is defined as an event which:&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Is fatal or life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing&#xD;
                          hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: routine treatment or&#xD;
                          monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any&#xD;
                          deterioration in condition ; elective or pre-planned treatment for a&#xD;
                          pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study&#xD;
                          and has not worsened since the start of daptomycin ; treatment on an&#xD;
                          emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the&#xD;
                          definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission&#xD;
                          ; social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in&#xD;
                          the patient's general condition&#xD;
&#xD;
                          g. Data analysis Depending on the type of data, the results are expressed&#xD;
                          as mean ± SD or number of subjects (percentage). For each method, the&#xD;
                          factors that influence the functional status of participants will be&#xD;
                          identified first by a bivariate survival analysis (Kaplan-Meyer). This&#xD;
                          first analysis will identify a number of potential risk factors, which&#xD;
                          will be later confirmed by a multivariate survival analysis (Cox&#xD;
                          regression model). The results are expressed as relative risk and 95%&#xD;
                          confidence interval. The success rate at two years of each method is then&#xD;
                          compared with literature values by a chi-square test.&#xD;
