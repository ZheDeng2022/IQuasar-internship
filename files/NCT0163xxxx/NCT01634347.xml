  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment involves administering propranolol, a medication indicated for treating high&#xD;
      blood pressure. Propranolol is hypothesized to reduce the strength of drug or alcohol&#xD;
      cravings (an integral factor involved in relapse), specifically when memories of substance&#xD;
      use are recalled. In this study, propranolol or a placebo will be administered to patients&#xD;
      participating in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation facility once a week over three or six&#xD;
      weeks. After receiving propranolol or placebo, strong memories associated with substance&#xD;
      craving are recalled by asking participants to read aloud a summary of a substance use&#xD;
      experience. The investigators hypothesize that participants who receive propranolol will&#xD;
      report fewer and less intense drug or alcohol cravings than participants who receive the&#xD;
      placebo or treatment-as-usual.&#xD;

      Trial Objectives: To test the feasibility of reconsolidation blockade as an adjunct treatment&#xD;
      for reducing drug or alcohol cravings in individuals diagnosed with a substance dependence or&#xD;
      substance abuse disorder and participating in a drug rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Duration: This study will be a 3 to 6 week, randomized, double-blind trial&#xD;
      involving participants with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of substance dependence or abuse. Consented&#xD;
      participants meeting enrolment criteria will receive a dose of propranolol (1mg/kg) or&#xD;
      placebo ninety minutes before undergoing a brief memory reactivation procedure twice a week&#xD;
      for a three-week period (or once a week for a six week period, depending on the participants&#xD;
      availability) as an adjunct to their usual drug rehabilitation treatment. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of two treatment arms (i.e. placebo group + treatment as usual, or&#xD;
      propranolol group + treatment as usual) and remain in that arm for the duration of the study.&#xD;
      Participants from the placebo arm will be offered the opportunity to continue receive&#xD;
      open-label propranolol treatment for another 3-6 weeks following the double-blind phase of&#xD;
      the study. A four-month follow-up assessment will also be conducted.&#xD;

    <description>The craving scales ask about current craving for substances. Items for the questionnaires represent distinct conceptualizations of substance craving: (1) desire to use; (2) anticipation of positive outcomes from use; (3) anticipation of relief from withdrawal symptoms or relief from negative mood; (4) intention and planning to use; (5) lack of control over use.</description>
