      Objective: In this study we will develop and apply imaging techniques to perform the first&#xD;
      three-dimensional (3-D) measurements of brain biomechanics during mild head movement in&#xD;
      healthy human subjects. Biomechanics is the application of mechanics, or the physical&#xD;
      principles in action when force is applied to an object, to the anatomical structure and/or&#xD;
      function of organisms. Such techniques will be invaluable for building computational models&#xD;
      of brain biomechanics, understanding variability of brain biomechanics across individual&#xD;
      characteristics, such as age and sex, and determining brain sub-structures at risk for damage&#xD;
      when movement of the head is accelerated, such as during a traumatic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Measurements will be performed on 90 healthy men and women aged 18-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: We will build upon the model pioneered by our collaborator, Dr. Philip Bayly. The&#xD;
      model places a human subject in a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner with one of two head&#xD;
      support units that allows a specific range of motion. Each head support is latched such that&#xD;
      it can be released by the subject, and results in either a rotation of the head of&#xD;
      approximately 30 degrees or a flexion-extension of the head of approximately 4 degrees.&#xD;
      Although both supports are weighted so that the motion is repeatable if the subject is&#xD;
      relaxed, the subject can easily counteract the weight. The resulting&#xD;
      acceleration/deceleration is small (in the range of normal activities, such as turning one's&#xD;
      head during swimming) and has been validated and used in other human investigations of brain&#xD;
      biomechanics. The subject repeats the motion multiple times during the MR scan under their&#xD;
      own volition and desired pace to measure motion of the head and brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: This project is a pilot study evaluating the potential of extracting&#xD;
      three-dimensional estimates of brain deformation, such as strain measurements, using MR&#xD;
      imaging. A primary outcome of this project will be a fast MR acquisition sequence for&#xD;
      measuring 3-D brain deformation. The sequence will be evaluated by applying the protocol to&#xD;
      human subjects, followed by preliminary quantification of the reproducibility and stability&#xD;
      of deformation measurements.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will develop and apply imaging techniques to perform the first&#xD;
      three-dimensional (3-D) measurements of brain biomechanics during mild head movement in&#xD;
      healthy human subjects. Biomechanics is the application of mechanics, or the physical&#xD;

      characteristics, such as age and sex, and determining brain sub-structures at risk for damage&#xD;
      when movement of the head is accelerated, such as during a traumatic event. Using the&#xD;
      developed imaging techniques above, we will acquire a sufficient number of data sets to&#xD;
      create templates of the average brain response and stiffness based on age and sex. Anonymized&#xD;
      raw and processed data will be made publicly available to improve computational models of&#xD;
      brain biomechanics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be performed on 194 healthy men and women aged 18-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will build upon the model pioneered by our collaborator, Dr. Philip Bayly. The model&#xD;
      places a human subject in a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner with one of two head support&#xD;
      units that allows a specific range of motion. Each head support is latched such that it can&#xD;
      be released by the subject, and results in either a rotation of the head of approximately 30&#xD;
      degrees or a flexion-extension of the head of approximately 4 degrees. Although both supports&#xD;
      are weighted so that the motion is repeatable if the subject is relaxed, the subject can&#xD;
      easily counteract the weight. The resulting acceleration/deceleration is small (in the range&#xD;
      of normal activities, such as turning one's head during swimming) and has been validated and&#xD;
      used in other human investigations of brain biomechanics. The subject repeats the motion&#xD;
      multiple times during the MR scan under their own volition and desired pace to measure motion&#xD;
      of the head and brain. Additionally, we will use a type of MRI called magnetic resonance&#xD;
      elastography (MRE), which measures brain motion in response to mild head vibration, to&#xD;
      investigate brain stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a study evaluating the potential of extracting three-dimensional estimates of&#xD;
      brain deformation, such as strain measurements and stiffness, using MR imaging. A primary&#xD;
      outcome of this project will be MRI techniques for characterizing 3-D brain biomechanics. The&#xD;
      techniques will be evaluated by applying the protocol to human subjects, followed by&#xD;
      preliminary quantification of the reproducibility and stability of deformation and stiffness&#xD;
      measurements. Acquired data will be made publicly available for use by the research&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
