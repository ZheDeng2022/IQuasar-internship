  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by an eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus.&#xD;
      It presents clinically with a variety of symptoms including dysphagia, emesis, and food&#xD;
      impaction. Although the underlying mechanism is different, gastroesophageal reflux can&#xD;
      present with similar clinical findings but can be distinguished from eosinophilic esophagitis&#xD;
      by the number of eosinophils present on esophageal biopsy. In children, food allergies play a&#xD;
      role in exacerbating eosinophilic esophagitis, but the role of food allergies in adults is&#xD;
      uncertain. In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of food allergies in a cohort of&#xD;
      adults with eosinophilic esophagitis.&#xD;

      Study Population Male and female subjects, ages 18 years and older with findings of &gt; 15&#xD;
      eosinophils per high powered field by endoscopic esophageal biopsy. Patients should also have&#xD;
      symptoms consistent with eosinophilic esophagitis including dysphagia, heartburn, epigastric&#xD;
      pain, recurrent vomiting, or food impaction. The comparative group will include male and&#xD;
      female subjects, ages 18 years and older with a previous diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux&#xD;
      with findings of &lt; 15 eosinophils per high power field by endoscopic esophageal biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male and female subjects 18 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis with clinical symptoms including&#xD;
           heartburn, dysphagia, vomiting, epigastric pain, recurrent vomiting, food impaction as&#xD;
           well &gt; 15 eosinophils per high powered field (400x magnification) by endoscopic&#xD;
           esophageal biopsy in both the proximal and distal esophagus&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Previous diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux with &lt; 15 eosinophils per high powered&#xD;
           field (400x magnification) by endoscopic biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male and female subjects less than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnant female subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects who are receiving systemic steroids and are unable to stop prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjects who are receiving systemic antihistamines and are unable to stop prior to&#xD;
           enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjects who are unable to cooperate/comply with study procedures or communicate with&#xD;
           investigator in order to successfully complete the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Subjects with severe skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis, dermatographism, or&#xD;
           psoriasis who would be unable to complete skin or patch testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Subjects with an infirmity, disability, or geographical location which seems likely to&#xD;
           prevent regular attendance for patient visit Risks Skin testing with prick methodology&#xD;
           has a risk of systemic reaction of less than 0.1% per 40 tests, however, no deaths have&#xD;
           been reported with this method of testing. Systemic reactions are readily treated using&#xD;
           Injectable epinephrine with oral antihistamines and oral corticosteroids (prednisone).&#xD;
           Patch testing has no known associated risk for development of systemic reactions.&#xD;
           Phlebotomy is associated with a minimal risk of bleeding, significant local discomfort,&#xD;
           and infection from the needle puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits Treatment options for adults with eosinophilic esophagitis are limited. Food&#xD;
      allergies are a known contributor to this disorder in children and a better understanding of&#xD;
      food allergies in adult subjects may provide additional treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events and Withdrawal Criteria All subjects will be assessed for adverse events at&#xD;
      each study visit. If any adverse events are experienced by the subject, the investigator will&#xD;
      document the event within the subject's file and promptly report the event to the IRB. The&#xD;
      investigators involved with this study will determine if a participant needs to be withdrawn&#xD;
      from the study based upon the subject's health and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Sample size estimation is based on the assumption that up to 50% of adults with&#xD;
      eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) will have a positive skin test to food and 10% of adults&#xD;
      without EE will have a positive skin test to food. With this assumption, a total of 40&#xD;
      subjects are needed, 20 per group, in order to achieve at least 80% power with two sided test&#xD;
      at alpha level of 0.05 and beta 0.2.&#xD;
