      in patients with advanced autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common form of renal cystic&#xD;
      diseases, affecting all ethnic groups with an incidence of 1 in 400 to 1.000. In Austria an&#xD;
      estimated 8.000 to 21.000 people, and an estimated 670.000 to 1.675.000 people worldwide are&#xD;
      affected by ADPKD, although statements of up to 6.000.000 affected individuals have been&#xD;
      made. ADPKD is responsible for 5 to 10 percent of patients on chronic hemodialysis.&#xD;
      Individuals with ADPKD usually present in the 3rd to 4th decade of life, progressing to&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease within 5 to 10 years after the onset of renal insufficiency. Usually&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy, either by chronic dialysis or renal transplantation, becomes&#xD;
      necessary. Currently there is no treatment for ADPKD other than blood pressure control and&#xD;
      supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, novel therapies for ADPKD are of great importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formation of cysts in ADPKD follows a mutation located within either the polycystic&#xD;
      kidney disease 1 or -2 gene on chromosomes 16 and 4, which are coding for polycystin 1 (PC1)&#xD;
      and -2 (PC2), respectively. PC1 and PC2 are members of the polycystin family of integral&#xD;
      membrane proteins. PC1 acts as a G-protein coupled receptor and is suggested to mediate&#xD;
      cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. PC2 acts as a nonselective cation channel and is&#xD;
      supposed to act in ion exchange mechanisms. Among other pathways PC1 and 2 are functioning&#xD;
      via a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is essential in protein&#xD;
      translation, cell proliferation and -growth. Inhibition of the mTOR-pathway has reduced&#xD;
      kidney enlargement in rodent polycystic kidney disease models and has shown to reduce the&#xD;
      volume of cysts in human polycystic kidney- and polycystic liver disease. Thus, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus, an immunosuppressant drug with strong&#xD;
      anti-proliferative effects, will delay the progression of renal insufficiency in patients&#xD;
      with ADPKD in advanced stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before conducting a large multicenter randomized controlled trial in this population we will&#xD;
      demonstrate that therapy with mTOR-I does not accelerate the decline in renal function (as&#xD;
      natural course of the disease), as well as mTOR-I does not aggravate prevalent-, or cause new&#xD;
      onset of proteinuria, as expressed by the protein/creatinine ratio, in patients with ADPKD&#xD;
      and an eGFR between 20 and 40 mL/min per 1.73sqm, compared to a historic cohort of patients&#xD;
      with ADPKD and an eGFR between 20 and 40 mL/min per 1.73sqm, treated at the Department of&#xD;
      Medicine III, Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Medical University Vienna.&#xD;
