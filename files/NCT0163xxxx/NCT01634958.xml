  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific immunotherapy for IgE mediated sensitization to grass pollen&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 concentrations of a modified pollen extract of Phleum pratense are applied to find out the&#xD;
      optimum dose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose finding study and no therapeutic study. Patients will receive in 4-weekly&#xD;
      intervals 6x 0,5mL of one of 4 different concentrations of Depigoid Phleum. The study is&#xD;
      performed outside the pollen season. Thus the aim of the study is not the therapeutic effect&#xD;
      of the specific immunotherapy (effect on allergy specific symptoms during the pollen season)&#xD;
      but the effect on the Conjunctival provocation test (CPT). According to the EMA &quot;Guideline on&#xD;
      clinical development of products for specific immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic&#xD;
      diseases&quot; provocation tests are accepted as primary outcomes for dose-finding studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the CPT increasing doses of Phleum pollen solutions are applied to the eye and&#xD;
      characteristic symptoms (eye redness, weeping, itching or burning, and nose&#xD;
      dripping/blockage) are assessed at each concentration: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate,&#xD;
      3=severe. At a score value of &gt;=5/concentration the test is considered positive and finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that at the end of the study higher doses are necessary to provoke a positive&#xD;
      CPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore comparative evaluation of the safety data (AEs) in the different dosage groups is&#xD;
      a very important parameter for the evaluation of the outcome of the study.&#xD;
