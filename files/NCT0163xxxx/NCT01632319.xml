  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of 2 different therapy courses&#xD;
      for undergraduate college students who binge drink and experience depressive symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a screening visit (2 Â½ hrs) to confirm eligibility for the study, all participants will&#xD;
      receive 8 weekly, 1-hour, individual sessions therapy with a counselor. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned, by chance, like the flip of a coin, to the therapy course they will&#xD;
      attend. In one of the therapy courses, students are asked questions about their drinking and&#xD;
      receive personalized feedback about it, and are taught coping skills for their depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. In the second course, students are also taught coping skills for their depressive&#xD;
      symptoms but they may or may not talk about alcohol consumption depending on the students'&#xD;
      preference. So, both courses teach the same coping skills for depressive symptoms but include&#xD;
      different levels of focus on alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also complete 2 follow-up visits, at the end of the 8 sessions and then&#xD;
      again 4 weeks after completing treatment. These will involve filling out some questionnaires&#xD;
      and completing a few neuropsychological tests (these questionnaires and neuropsychological&#xD;
      tests will also be completed during the screening visit).&#xD;
