      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To prove that the use of GnHR agonist for final oocyte maturation results in a higher&#xD;
           percentage of mature oocytes than the use of hCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To show an advantage in women's satisfaction in the proposed protocol versus the&#xD;
           standard antagonist protocol In the study group women will receive GnRH agonist for&#xD;
           oocyte maturation, followed by ovum pick-up which will be performed 35 hours later.&#xD;
           Embryo transfer will be performed 48-72 hours after ovum pick-up. Luteal support will&#xD;
           include HCG 1500 IU. Blood samples for BHCG, progesterone and estradiol will be obtained&#xD;
           14 days after embryo transfer.&#xD;

      Final Oocyte Maturation via Administration of GnRH Agonists Followed By Luteal Support with&#xD;
      hCG&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonists in in vitro fertilization (IVF)&#xD;
      stimulation protocols holds many advantages over the long protocol with GnRH agonists. One of&#xD;
      the advantages includes the ability to use GnRH agnosits for final oocyte maturation, thus&#xD;
      minimizing the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To prove that the use of GnHR agonist for final oocyte maturation results in a higher&#xD;
           percentage of mature oocytes than the use of hCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To show an advantage in women's satisfaction in the proposed protocol versus the&#xD;
           standard antagonist protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria - patients who are eligible for in vitro fertilization using an antagonist&#xD;
      protocol Exclusion criteria - patients diagnosed with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism,&#xD;
      sensitivity to any of the drugs used in the study A patient enrolled in the study who, as a&#xD;
      result of ovarian stimulation, responds in a way that puts her in risk of developing ovarian&#xD;
      hyperstimulation, will be ultimately excluded from the study. For the purpose of this study,&#xD;
      this response includes estradiol levels higher than 2500 pg/ml, fifteen or more follicles&#xD;
      over 12 mm in diameter, or any other case in which the treating physician has reason to&#xD;
      suspect an eventual hyperstimulation reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained at the beginning of the treatment and up until the day of&#xD;
      final oocyte maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte stimulation in both groups will be achieved with recombinant FSH. Dose will be&#xD;
      determined according to our department's protocol and response to previous treatments. GnRH&#xD;
      antagonists will be added when leading follicle reaches 13-14 mm in diameter. Final oocyte&#xD;
      maturation will be initiated when at least 2 follicles reach a diameter of 17 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study group women will receive GnRH agonist (decapeptyl 0.2 mg) for oocyte maturation,&#xD;
      followed by ovum pick-up which will be performed 35 hours later. Embryo transfer will be&#xD;
      performed 48-72 hours after ovum pick-up. Luteal support will include HCG 1500 IU. Blood&#xD;
      samples for BHCG, progesterone and estradiol will be obtained 14 days after embryo transfer.&#xD;
      Prior to getting results from these tests, women will be asked to fill out a questionnaire&#xD;
      regarding their satisfaction from the protocol protocol amendment: to add a prospective&#xD;
      control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to add thromboelastography test. Our aim is to check whether triggering&#xD;
      ovulation with GNRHa alters the clotting dynamics and reduce the risk for thromboembolic&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVF patients who are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. treated with the GNRH antagonist protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. at low risk for OHSS&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVF patients who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. are treated with the GNRH agonist protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. infertile due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. are at high risk of OHSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable patients would be offered to participate in the study and to sign informed consent.&#xD;
      We will ask the participant to take 3 blood tests (5-8 ml blood each):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before starting the hormonal treatment for ovulation induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the hormonal treatment, 48-72 hours before ovum pickup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the day of the ovum pick up, about 36 hours after induction of final oocyte&#xD;
           maturation using hCG or Gnrh agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee. The thromboelastography test is&#xD;
      available in the local hematologic laboratory. The cost of a single test is 50 NIS. We plan&#xD;
      to recruit 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The change in the coagulation profile (the thromboelastogram) along the ovulation&#xD;
           induction treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The difference in the coagulation profile between the two different protocols, the GNRHa&#xD;
           Vs the hCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in the coagulation profile in relation with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. estradiol levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the number of oocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the number of embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the achievement of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the occurrence of OHSS.&#xD;
