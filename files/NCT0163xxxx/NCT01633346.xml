      The purpose of this study is to know the level of expression and activation state of&#xD;
      different transcription factors of the STAT family (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT6) in&#xD;
      the hematopoietic cells from tocilizumab treated patients.&#xD;

    <description>The levels of phosphorylation of STATs on different subsets of leukocytes will be assessed by flow cytometry at baseline (before Tocilizumab administration) and at the indicated time (6m) after initiation of treatment. Results will be expressed as Mean of Fluorescence Intensity. To perform the analysis the investigators will use conjugated monoclonal antibodies against STAT1, STAT3, STAT5 and STAT6</description>
