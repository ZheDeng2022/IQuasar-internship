    <textblock>
      Older women have an exaggerated increase in blood pressure during exercise. However, the&#xD;
      reasons for this are unclear. It is important to investigate this phenomenon because a&#xD;
      greater blood pressure response to exercise has been associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      stroke and mortality in otherwise healthy individuals. A unique aspect of aging in women is&#xD;
      the profound change in hormone levels (i.e. estrogen and progesterone) associated with&#xD;
      menopause. The influence of changes in estrogen and progesterone levels on the cardiovascular&#xD;
      responses to exercise is poorly understood. However, it has been suggested that these&#xD;
      hormones might change the responsiveness of the cardiovascular system. Possible mechanisms&#xD;
      that could account for these changes are the arterial baroreflex and feedback from the&#xD;
      exercising muscle (known as the exercise pressor reflex), both of which are known to&#xD;
      powerfully modulate blood pressure during exercise. However, to date, few human studies have&#xD;
      thoroughly examined the influence of changes in hormone levels on baroreflex function during&#xD;
      exercise or the exercise pressor reflex in older women. As such, the purpose of this research&#xD;
      project is to assess baroreflex function and the exercise pressor reflex in older women after&#xD;
      transdermal estrogen and placebo.&#xD;

      Study Design Older postmenopausal women will be randomized, in a double-blinded crossover&#xD;
      design, to receive (i) transdermal estradiol, delivery rate 100 µg day-1 plus oral placebo,&#xD;
      or (ii) placebo patch plus oral placebo. The experimental measurements and procedures below&#xD;
      will be performed before and 4 weeks after each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Pressure- A blood pressure cuff will be wrapped around the right arm to obtain blood&#xD;
      pressure via a standard automated auscultometric device (Welch-Allyn). In addition,&#xD;
      beat-by-beat blood pressure will be obtained via finger photoplethysmography (Finapress blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Rate- Standard limb lead electrodes will be used to obtain heart rate measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiration- An elastic band will be placed around the subject's abdomen to measure rate and&#xD;
      depth of breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples- A venous catheter will be placed in the subjects arm for blood samples. For&#xD;
      screening purposes measurements of glucose, electrolytes, cholesterol and triglycerides will&#xD;
      be made. In addition, progesterone, estrogen and testosterone, will be assessed to verify&#xD;
      hormonal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sympathetic Nerve Activity- A tiny microelectrode will be placed in the peroneal nerve of the&#xD;
      leg, located just below the knee on the outer part of the leg. Alternatively, the median&#xD;
      nerve located at the inside of the elbow will be used. At these points the nerves are closest&#xD;
      to the surface of the skin. The course of the nerve will be determined by electrically&#xD;
      stimulating through the skin with a pencil shaped electrode. When the nerve is stimulated,&#xD;
      involuntary twitching and/or tingling sensations of the foot or hand will occur. The&#xD;
      twitching or tingling will disappear when the stimulation is stopped. Once the nerve is&#xD;
      found, two tiny, sterile, microelectrodes will be inserted through the skin. One is a&#xD;
      reference electrode placed just above the nerve site (2 cm) and the other is the recording&#xD;
      electrode. The recording electrode is advanced into the nerve. When the tip of the electrode&#xD;
      enters the nerve, the subject may briefly notice either pressure or tingling sensations. At&#xD;
      this point, minor adjustments in the position of the electrode will be made until an optimal&#xD;
      nerve signal is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limb Blood Flow Measurements- Blood flow to the arm or leg may also be measured by using&#xD;
      duplex Doppler ultrasound to non-invasively measure mean arterial blood velocity and&#xD;
      diameter. Femoral or brachial blood velocity can be obtained by placing a Doppler flow probe&#xD;
      on the skin over the common femoral artery distal to the inguinal ligament or the brachial&#xD;
      artery, respectively. Ultrasound imaging of femoral artery or brachial artery diameter will&#xD;
      be performed at a site matching that at which velocity is measured. The following formula is&#xD;
      used to calculate blood flow: blood flow = π * radius2 * velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples will be collected to measure specific gravity and pH using test strips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck Pressure and Neck Suction- A padded neck collar will be fitted around the anterior&#xD;
      portion of the subject's neck for the application of brief 5-second periods of neck pressure&#xD;
      and neck suction. This allows the application of positive or negative pressure to the carotid&#xD;
      sinus baroreceptors which are located in this region. The positive pressure will transiently&#xD;
      cause these receptors to detect a decrease in blood pressure and thus cause an acute increase&#xD;
      in heart rate, and blood pressure. The negative pressure will transiently cause these&#xD;
      receptors to detect an increase in blood pressure and thus cause an acute decrease in heart&#xD;
      rate, and blood pressure. This procedure has been used extensively to non-invasively assess&#xD;
      baroreflex function in healthy subjects aged between 18-80 years. Nevertheless, in subjects&#xD;
      over 50 years of age Doppler imaging will be performed to screen for atherosclerotic plaques&#xD;
      within the carotid vessels to rule out carotid artery disease and determine the feasibility&#xD;
      of performing neck pressure and neck suction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handgrip Exercise and Post Exercise Ischemia- The subject will be asked to perform handgrip&#xD;
      exercise for either two minutes or until they feel like they cannot maintain the exercise&#xD;
      (i.e., fatigue). Five seconds before stopping the exercise, a cuff around the upper arm will&#xD;
      be inflated to impede blood flow for 2 minutes. This traps the metabolites that were produced&#xD;
      during the exercise in the area of the muscle, which maintains stimulation of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      metaboreceptor afferents. Since these metaboreceptor afferents contribute to the rise in&#xD;
      blood pressure during exercise, continued stimulation of these receptors maintains a blood&#xD;
      pressure response.&#xD;
