      Background VSL#3 has been reported as an effective adjuvant therapy both in inducing and&#xD;
      maintaining remission in pediatric patients affected by Ulcerative Colitis. In addition, it&#xD;
      has been shown that VSL#3 is able to modulates barrier function, intestinal permeability, and&#xD;
      innate host functions, which if altered, could have a profound impact on the state of&#xD;
      colitis. However it is still unclear how VSL#3-induced changes in microbial composition&#xD;
      affect the status of intestinal inflammation and no study have investigated the efficacy of&#xD;
      VSL#3 in the maintenance of remission in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the effect of a probiotic&#xD;
      formulation, VSL#3, versus placebo, on metabolic profile, intestinal permeability,&#xD;
      microbiota, cytokines and chemokines expression in pediatric patients with CD in remission of&#xD;
      disease. In addition, the efficacy of VSL#3 on the maintenance of remission will be assessed&#xD;
      and the safety and the tolerability of the probiotic formula will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This investigation will be a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. The study will include 50 children affected by CD in&#xD;
      remission of disease, as defined by a PCDAI &lt; 10, under treatment with Azathioprine&#xD;
      associated or not to 5-ASA and will be articulated in 6 months as follows. All children will&#xD;
      be randomised to a treatment group receiving for 2 months either 1-2 packet containing 900&#xD;
      billion bacteria/day of VSL#3 according to their weight, and a group receiving the placebo&#xD;
      drug. Assignment to therapy or placebo will be determined according to a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization scheme. At the completion of the 8 weeks, a &quot;wash-out&quot; period of 6 weeks will&#xD;
      be done, when no preparation will be administered. Then each patient will be switched to the&#xD;
      other group and followed likewise for further 8 weeks. All patients will continue regular&#xD;
      medications throughout the study period. A group of 10 volunteer healthy children, comparable&#xD;
      in age and sex, will be used as reference group for the analysis of metabolic profile.&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed clinically at baseline and every 8 weeks until the completion of&#xD;
      the study, at 24 weeks or at the time of relapse. At every visit data will be collected&#xD;
      including patient questionnaires regarding disease activity (stool frequency, stool&#xD;
      consistency, hematochezia, abdominal pain, extraintestinal manifestations of disease, and&#xD;
      overall patient functioning). Additional information collected at the first visit included&#xD;
      demographic data, family history, and symptom onset. Physical examination will be performed&#xD;
      at each visit by a paediatrician and included an abdominal examination and examination for&#xD;
      extraintestinal manifestations of CD. Routine blood tests for CD, cellobiose/mannitol small&#xD;
      intestinal permeability study, stool cultures, stool calprotectin, will be performed at every&#xD;
      visit and/or at the time of relapse. Urine will be collected for the analysis of metabolic&#xD;
      profile with mono and bi-dimensional high-resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy. PCDAI and a&#xD;
      physician's global assessment will be used to measure disease activity. At baseline and at 24&#xD;
      weeks the patients will undergo ileocolonoscopy to evaluate and endoscopic and histological&#xD;
      activity of disease. Evaluation of microbiota on biopsies and stool samples will be performed&#xD;
      at the time of ileocolonoscopies using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization. Colon biopsies&#xD;
      cultures will be performed in order to evaluate cytokines and chemokines patterns by&#xD;
      multiplex assay. Additional data will be collected during the study regarding the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of therapy with VSL #3. Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS&#xD;
      version 15 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Variables will be screened for their&#xD;
      distribution and appropriate parametric or non parametric tests will be adopted as required.&#xD;
      Cross-tabulations will be evaluated by using the Fisher test and χ2test. Statistical&#xD;
      significance will be predetermined as P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results The investigators expect to find profound alterations in metabolic profiles,&#xD;
      intestinal permeability, microbiota, cytokines and chemokine patterns of patients affected by&#xD;
      CD. The administration of VSL#3 is expected to ameliorate all these alterations eventually&#xD;
      identified. From a clinical point of view the effects of VSL#3 could be translated in&#xD;
      prolonged clinical remission maintenance, offering a new therapeutic tool in the treatment of&#xD;
      CD.&#xD;

      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) in childhood are chronic relapsing and remitting&#xD;
      inflammatory condition that have a significant impact on growth and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBD involves a shift from a regulated intestinal immune response to one that is driven by&#xD;
      unrestrained immune cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. (1) The cause&#xD;
      of this increase in immune stimulation is of great interest and several studies indicate a&#xD;
      role for commensal bacteria in the progression of disease. (2) A recent study compared the&#xD;
      microbiota of patients with IBD with that of non-IBD controls and revealed a significant&#xD;
      difference in their composition. The microbiota of IBD patients showed abnormal microbial&#xD;
      composition characterized by depletion of Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which are represented&#xD;
      in non-IBD controls. (3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced NF-κB activity is involved in the pathology of both forms of IBD. Crohn disease (CD)&#xD;
      and ulcerative colitis (UC). The mechanism of proteasome-mediated NF-κB activation in CD and&#xD;
      UC has been studied. Visekruna et al demonstrated that the subunit composition and the&#xD;
      proteolytic function of proteasomes differ between UC and CD. High expression of the&#xD;
      immunoproteasome subunits β1i and β2i is characteristic of the inflamed mucosa of CD (4). In&#xD;
      line with this, they found enhanced processing of NF-κB precursor p105 and degradation of&#xD;
      inhibitor of NF-κB, IκBα, by immunoproteasomes isolated from the mucosa of CD patients. In&#xD;
      comparison with healthy controls and CD patients, UC patients exhibited an intermediate&#xD;
      phenotype regarding the proteasome-mediated processing/degradation of NF-κB components (4)&#xD;
      .Finally, increased expression of the NF-κB family member c-Rel in the inflamed mucosa of CD&#xD;
      patients suggests that p50/c-Rel is important for IFN-γ-mediated induction of&#xD;
      immunoproteasomes via IL-12-driven Th1 responses. These findings suggest that distinct&#xD;
      proteasome subunits influence the intensity of NF-κB-mediated inflammation in IBD patients&#xD;
      (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study of Pagnini C et al., the authors report that the probiotic mixture VSL#3&#xD;
      prevents the onset of intestinal inflammation in the SAMP mouse model of CD-ileitis. These&#xD;
      effects were associated with a local effect on the intestinal epithelium (i.e., stimulation&#xD;
      of TNF-α production and NF-κB activation in epithelial cells, coupled with restitution of&#xD;
      normal intestinal epithelial barrier function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of bacterial DNA in the stool and ileal mucosa of treated mice demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant increase of probiotic strains, suggesting that effective bacterial colonization&#xD;
      is required for the beneficial effects of probiotic treatment. This study support the&#xD;
      hypothesis that probiotics promote gut health through a mechanism involving stimulation of&#xD;
      epithelial innate responses (i.e., stimulation of TNF-α expression), rather than suppression&#xD;
      of inflammation. (5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many individual or combinations of bacterial species have been shows to ameliorate the&#xD;
      symptoms of IBD and to reduce intestinal inflammation in animal studies. Treatment of mice&#xD;
      with colitis with the probiotic formulation VSL#3 increased the production of IL-10 and the&#xD;
      percentage of TGFβ-expressing T-cells. Transfer of lamina propria mononuclear cells from&#xD;
      VSL#3-treated mice prevented colitis in recipient mice, indicating that the VSL#3 can&#xD;
      initiate the generation of a protective population of cells. (6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent identification of symbiotic bacteria with potent anti-inflammatory properties, and&#xD;
      their correlative absence during disease, suggests that certain aspects of human health may&#xD;
      depend on the status of microbiota. (7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the bacterial outer&#xD;
      membrane that is largely responsible for mediating septic shock. Normally the body does not&#xD;
      react to the high concentration of LPS that is present in the intestinal lumen. Intestinal&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase (IAP) seems to detoxify LPS by hydrolyzing it and maintaining intestinal&#xD;
      homeostasis with the commensal flora. (8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. Global microarray and&#xD;
      bioinformatica analysis revealed augmentation of immune response, phagocytic, and&#xD;
      inflammatory pathways dominated by elevation of Th1 transcription factors in IL10-KO mice.&#xD;
      IL10-KO mice orally administered with the probiotic VSL#3 exhibited a site-specific&#xD;
      downregulation of these inflammatory pathways including TLR signalling and related effector&#xD;
      pathways such as T-cell, B-cell receptor signaling. More important, VSL#3 triggered an&#xD;
      up-regulation in PPAR signaling, lipid, nitrogen, amino acid, and xenobiotic metabolism (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually it is unclear how VSL#3-induced changes in microbial composition affect the status&#xD;
      of intestinal inflammation. It is possible that VSL#3 promotes the presence of protective&#xD;
      microorganisms, likely constituents of the probiotic itself that directly influence host&#xD;
      innate responses. It has been reported that VSL#3 modulates barrier function, intestinal&#xD;
      permeability, and innate host functions, which if altered, could have a profound impact on&#xD;
      the state of colitis. VSL#3 has been shown to enhance barrier function through decreased&#xD;
      epithelial permeability in IL10_/_ mice, correlating with a reduction in intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation. Another recent study demonstrated that VSL#3 prevents the development of&#xD;
      ileitis in SAMP1/YitFc mice by enhancing epithelial barrier function and activating innate&#xD;
      signaling leading to NF-jB activation. These effects appear to be mediated by VSL#3 secreted&#xD;
      products. This is consistent with reports showing that probiotic-derived factors are capable&#xD;
      of modulating host responses and experimental colitis. Additionally, structural components&#xD;
      present in probiotic bacteria could profoundly impact immune response and favor the&#xD;
      production of immunosuppressive molecules such as IL-10 (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a probiotic formulation, VSL#3, versus&#xD;
      placebo, on metabolic profile, intestinal permeability, microbiota, cytokines and chemokines&#xD;
      expression and other inflammatory markers in pediatric patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) in&#xD;
      remission (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect on Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (PCDAI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the time till flare of CD pediatric patients on VSL#3 compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess whether concurrent therapy with VSL#3 reduces the severity of a flare if it&#xD;
           occurs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the safety and tolerability of therapy with VSL #3 at high dosage in pediatric&#xD;
           patients with CD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial.&#xD;
      The study will include 30 children with CD and will be articulated in 6 months as follows. A&#xD;
      group of 10 volunteer healthy children, comparable in age and sex, will be used as reference&#xD;
      group for the analysis of metabolic profile..&#xD;
&#xD;
      These children will be randomised to a treatment group receiving for 2 months either 1-2&#xD;
      packet containing 900 billion bacteria/day of VSL#3 according to their weight, and a group&#xD;
      receiving the placebo drug. Assignment to therapy or placebo will be determined according to&#xD;
      a computer-generated randomization scheme. The medications will be dispensed by the&#xD;
      investigator at each visit; compliance will be assessed by counting returned bags and&#xD;
      questioning the patients. Excellent compliance will be defined as no violation of the&#xD;
      protocol with respect to the intake of the study medication. At the completion of the 8&#xD;
      weeks, a &quot;wash-out&quot; period of 6 weeks will be done, when no preparation will be administered.&#xD;
      Then each patient will be switched to the other group and followed likewise for further 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will continue regular medications throughout the study period (azathioprine&#xD;
      associated or not to 5-ASA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed clinically at baseline and every 8 weeks until the completion of&#xD;
      the study, at 24 weeks or at the time of relapse. At every visit data will be collected&#xD;
      including patient questionnaires regarding disease activity (stool frequency, stool&#xD;
      consistency, hematochezia, abdominal pain, extraintestinal manifestations of disease, and&#xD;
      overall patient functioning). Additional information collected at the first visit included&#xD;
      demographic data, family history, and symptom onset. Physical examination will be performed&#xD;
      at each visit by a paediatrician and included an abdominal examination and examination for&#xD;
      extraintestinal manifestations of CD. Routine blood tests for CD, cellobiose/mannitol small&#xD;
      intestinal permeability study, stool cultures, stool calprotectin, will be performed at every&#xD;
      visit and/or at the time of relapse. Urine will be collected for the analysis of metabolic&#xD;
      profile with mono and bi-dimensional high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy. In 10 healthy&#xD;
      volunteer children and patients, bile acid, isoleucine, leucine, valine,&#xD;
      2-oxo-3methyl-valeric acid, 2-oxo-isovaleric acid, 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid,&#xD;
      3-hydroxybutyrate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, threonine, lactate,&#xD;
      3-hydroximethylglutamic acid, alanine, N-acetyl asparagine + aspartyl glutamate + glutamil&#xD;
      acid, acetic acid, carnitine, acetone, acetoacetate, 2-hydroxyglutarate, pyruvate, glutaric&#xD;
      acid, N-Acetylglutamic acid, succinate, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglucaric acid, dimethylamine,&#xD;
      sarcosine, N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate, dimethylglycine, citric acid, creatine, creatinine,&#xD;
      choline, betaine, malonic acid, trimethylamineoxide, sarcosine, glycine, 1-methylhistidine,&#xD;
      3-methylhistidine, benzoilglycine (hippuric acid) , N-methyl betaine (trigonellina),&#xD;
      arabinosio, uracil, guanosine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, xanthine, hypoxanthine,&#xD;
      3-methylhistidine will be evaluated. In addition, in children with CD, many other metabolites&#xD;
      signals will be expected, resulting from drugs or other compounds taken as such or processed&#xD;
      by the body's metabolism or intestinal microbial flora. the metabolomic analysis will allow&#xD;
      the evaluation of the following organ specific and systemic processes based on low molecular&#xD;
      weight compounds providing a profile of the metabolic system of the subjects: intermediary&#xD;
      metabolism of sugar, mitochondrial citric acid cycle, amino acids metabolism, oxidative&#xD;
      metabolism of fatty acid, break down and turnover of proteins, metabolism of purine and&#xD;
      pyrimidine, pathway of trans-methylation and trans-sulphide, metabolism of intestinal&#xD;
      bacteria; etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCDAI and a physician's global assessment were used to measure disease activity. No disease&#xD;
      activity equals a score of 0-10, mild disease equals 11-30, moderate/severe disease equals 31&#xD;
      or more. (10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and at 24 weeks the patients will undergo ileocolonoscopy to evaluate and&#xD;
      endoscopic and histological activity of disease. Evaluation of microbiota on biopsies and&#xD;
      stool samples will be performed at the time of ileocolonoscopies using FISH (Fluorescence In&#xD;
      Situ Hybridization). A colon culture will be performed in order to evaluate all cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines by multiplex assay. In addition, the RNA analysis from biopsies will be performed&#xD;
      for the study of proteasome subunits or other inflammatory markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data will be collected during the study regarding the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      therapy with VSL #3.&#xD;
