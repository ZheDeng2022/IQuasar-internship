  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture is a popular complementary/alternative therapy that has been in use for thousands&#xD;
      of years for the treatment of various medical and psychiatric conditions, including Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder (MDD). In this study, the investigators applied the investigators&#xD;
      acupuncture-treatment-for-depression protocol, based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)&#xD;
      principles for treating MDD, to depressed patients not taking any antidepressant medications&#xD;
      (a protocol that the investigators previously piloted as a medication augmentation therapy&#xD;
      for partial responders with MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators specifically investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this&#xD;
      TCM-based protocol for such patients, as well as potential differences in outcomes between&#xD;
      weekly vs. twice-weekly treatment. The investigators hypothesized that acupuncture&#xD;
      monotherapy would be associated with a response rate of at least 50%, which the investigators&#xD;
      defined as a decrease in depressive symptoms from the beginning to the end of the study of&#xD;
      50% or more, and that the response would be greater among patients who received acupuncture 2&#xD;
      times per week (vs. 1 time per week). The investigators also hypothesized that acupuncture&#xD;
      would be associated with minimal side effects.&#xD;

    <description>The HAM-D-17 is a clinician-rated assessment (structured interview) of patients' depressive symptoms. Questions focus on depressive symptoms during the past 7 days, and higher cumulative scores (possible responses to each item range from 0-4 or 0-2) indicate more severe depression.</description>
