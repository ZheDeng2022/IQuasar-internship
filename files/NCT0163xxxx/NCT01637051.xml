    <textblock>
      In a prospective randomised study two uncemented tibial components with different&#xD;
      polyethylene modularities (Trabecular Metal Technology (TMT) Zimmer NexGen® monobloc and TMT&#xD;
      Zimmer NexGen® modular) used for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is evaluated. Both tibial&#xD;
      component coatings are designed to provide excellent condition for bone ingrowth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences between the two tibial components are evaluated by measurements of migration&#xD;
      of the tibial component assessed by Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) and measurements of the&#xD;
      adaptive bone remodeling of the proximal tibial assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DEXA).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction In general a primary TKA is a durable and well-functioning solution with a&#xD;
      10-year implant survival of more than 90 % (Robertsson et al. 2001). Both implants to be&#xD;
      tested in the present study have a trabecular metal coating of the tibial component. However,&#xD;
      a different manufacturing technique of the baseplate with one having a monoblock polyethylene&#xD;
      insert and the other a modular polyethylene insert have been used. Failure secondary to&#xD;
      polyethylene wear is ranked as a frequent cause for revision. Many issues have been&#xD;
      identified as contributory to polyethylene wear; the quality of the polyethylene,&#xD;
      manufacturing process, nature of the tibial-femoral or patellofemoral articulation, area of&#xD;
      contact, sterilization process, and issues pertaining to modularity (backside wear) (Lombardi&#xD;
      et al. 2004, Lombardi et al. 2008). Long-term clinical studies have documented the success of&#xD;
      direct compression-molded monoblock tibial components (Weber et al. 2002). However, the&#xD;
      benefits of modularity are widely recognized and include the ability to fine tune soft-tissue&#xD;
      balance after implantation of metallic devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New techniques are developed and the patients´ demands for increased durability of the&#xD;
      implants are increasing. Failure because of aseptic loosening of the tibia component remains&#xD;
      one of the leading courses of revision surgery in TKA (Sierra et al. 2004, Danish Knee&#xD;
      Arthroplasty Register, Annual Report 2010). It is believed that both the implants, planned to&#xD;
      be tested in the present study, with the trabecular surface coating will facilitate bone&#xD;
      ingrowth and secure a better fixation to the host bone, thus increasing the implant survival&#xD;
      and improving the function of the prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the implants NexGen® , monoblock(TMT) has been used for routine clinical use abroad,&#xD;
      but also in Denmark for some years, and so far the clinical results have been good (Bobyn et&#xD;
      al. 2004). There have been made two randomized controlled studies using RSA mesurement of the&#xD;
      implant showing promising results with good stable fixation at follow up between twelve and&#xD;
      twenty-four month (Dunbar et al. 2009, Henricson et al. 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other type of prosthesis is identical but has a modular polyethylene design of the tibia&#xD;
      component. Modular designs are used frequently in most TKA designs and have also shown good&#xD;
      long-term results. However, there are potential problems concerning back-side wear and&#xD;
      aseptic loosening because of polyethylene foreign body reaction (Lombardi et al. 2004,&#xD;
      Lombardi et al. 2008, Weber et al. 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been made previous randomized RSA studies evaluating uncemented modular TKA&#xD;
      designs with good results showing stable fixation at twelve and twenty-four month (Dunbar et&#xD;
      al. 2008, Hansson et al. 2005, Hansson 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TMT coating is a micro-casting of the normal trabecular bone performed using the element&#xD;
      Tantalum (Ta-73). From previous experience Tantalum is very biocompatible, very strong and&#xD;
      with a great resistance to corrosion (Black 1994). Trabecular metal has a porosious structure&#xD;
      close to that of normal trabecular bone, and the biomechanical characteristics such as e.g.&#xD;
      compressive strength and elastic modulus are very close to that of normal trabecular bone&#xD;
      (Krygier et al. 1999, Zardiackas et al. 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These characteristics are the reason why trabecular metal within the past decade have been&#xD;
      used for production of different orthopedic implants, and the early clinical results so far&#xD;
      have been very promising (Bobyn et al. 2004, Nasser &amp; Poggie 2004, Nehme et al. 2004, Nelson&#xD;
      et al. 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative measurements of the implant migration and adaptive bone remodeling of the bone&#xD;
      close to the implants are generally accepted as suitable methods for an objective evaluation&#xD;
      of the effect of joint replacement surgery and have been proposed as important examinations&#xD;
      that shall bee performed before new implants is distributed for wide-spread use (Bobyn et al.&#xD;
      2004, Petersen &amp; Schrøder 2004, Østgaard &amp; Nielsen 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very small movements between an implant and the bone can be measured by special RSA X-rays&#xD;
      after implantation of small (0.8-1.0 mm) Tantalum markers attached to the implant and in the&#xD;
      bone (Selvik 1989), while changes in bone mineral or bone mineral density (BMD) of the bone&#xD;
      in close relation to the implant can be measured by DEXA (Glüer et al. 1990, Mazess &amp; Barden&#xD;
      1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micromovements with migration of the tibial component are seen after both cemented and&#xD;
      uncemented TKA and with different polyethylene modalities during the first postoperative&#xD;
      year. Subsequently most implants stabilize, while a minority migrate continuously beyond the&#xD;
      first postoperative year (Ryd et al. 1995). The implants that continues to migrate are those&#xD;
      with a high risk of later aseptic loosening. Several studies have evaluated the influence of&#xD;
      different parameters such as mode of fixation (cemented/uncemented), surface coating e.g.&#xD;
      hydroxyapatite, metal alloys, and design of the prostheses on the migration of the tibial&#xD;
      component in primary TKA (Ryd 1986, Toksvig-Larsen 2000, Dunbar et al. 2008, Hansson et al.&#xD;
      2005, Hansson 2008 ), but whether the use of a modular design vs. a monoblock design on a&#xD;
      trabecular metal (Tantalum) surface coatning will result in significant differences have&#xD;
      still not been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In studies using different bone densitometric techniques for measurements of changes in bone&#xD;
      mineral of the proximal tibia after primary TKA a significant decrease in BMD is seen in most&#xD;
      studies (Hvid et al. 1988, Karbowski et al. 1999, Levitz et al. 1995, Petersen et al. 1995,&#xD;
      Regnér et al. 1999). In some of the studies the decrease in BMD reaches 20% - 36% (Hvid et&#xD;
      al. 1988, Levitz et al. 1995, Petersen et al. 1995, Regnér et al. 1999), however, in other&#xD;
      studies BMD remains unchanged (Bohr &amp; Lund 1987, Li &amp; Nilsson 2000, Spittlehouse et al. 1999)&#xD;
      or shows a minor increase (Petersen et al. 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Study design A prospective randomized study where the patients are&#xD;
      randomized too receive a monoblock tibial component with trabecular metal coating (TMT Zimmer&#xD;
      NexGen®) or a modular tibial component (TMT Zimmer NexGen®). Both prostheses are available&#xD;
      and approved by the FDA and CE. The only difference between the implants is that of the&#xD;
      polyethylene insert (monoblock vs. modular).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place The operations were originally planned to be performed at the Knee Unit, Department of&#xD;
      Orthopedic Surgery, Hørsholm Hospital. However, February 2011 this unit will be fused with&#xD;
      the Department of Planned Elective Surgery Z, Gentofte Hospital, where more than 400 primary&#xD;
      TKA will be performed each year. It is planned that the TKA operations shall be performed at&#xD;
      the Gentofte Hospital, but a final decision can not be made until the above mentioned fusion&#xD;
      have been fully implemented in the beginning of 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSA and DEXA facilities examinations will be performed at the Department of Orthopedic&#xD;
      Surgery and Department of Radiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients The participants of the study are patients that have been scheduled for a primary&#xD;
      TKA using the usual indications for TKA at the Department of Planned Elective Surgery Z,&#xD;
      Gentofte Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria of inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Severe osteoarthrosis of the knee with indication for a TKA. 4. Age between 40 and 70&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria of exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diseases affecting the bone metabolism (osteoporosis, Pagets disease,&#xD;
           hyperparathyreoidism etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients estimated not to be able to understand the &quot;Information to patients&quot; papers or&#xD;
           do not want to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operation The operations are performed at the Department of Planned Elective Surgery Z,&#xD;
      Gentofte Hospital by two experienced TKA surgeons that will be included in the research&#xD;
      group. During surgery a minimum of 4 Tantalum markers (0.8 mm) is inserted in the bone of the&#xD;
      proximal tibia and 6 markers are inserted in the polyethylene insert Intravenous antibiotics&#xD;
      (1.5g cefuroxim) is administered three times during the first day and night of surgery and&#xD;
      low molecular weight heparin is administered for prevention of deep venous thrombosis and&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism. Local analgesics (Naropin ®, Toradol ®) are injected in the knee joint&#xD;
      and in the soft tissue around the knee during surgery. Physiotherapy begins on the day of&#xD;
      surgery and the patients will be mobilised with full weigth-bearing using crutches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implants Trabecular Metal Technology (TMT) Zimmer NexGen®, Monoblock Trabecular Metal&#xD;
      Technology (TMT) Zimmer NexGen®, Modular Both implants are posterior cruciate ligament&#xD;
      retaining implants. Apart from the different insert used (modular/monoblock) the designs of&#xD;
      the two implants are identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patella will be left unresurfaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical examination performed preoperatively and with follow-up after ¼, 1 and 2 years&#xD;
           with evaluation of the knee function using the Knee Society's Knee Scoring System&#xD;
           (Insall et al. 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conventional X-rays (standing and weight bearing) are obtained preoperatively,&#xD;
           postoperatively before the patients are discharged and after 12 months with the aim of&#xD;
           evaluating knee alignment, and to obtain a starting point for a possible later change in&#xD;
           placement of the TKA components and development of osteolytic lesions (Ewald 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Classification of the degree of arthrosis from preoperative X-rays estimating the&#xD;
           Ahlbäck score (Ahlbäck 1968).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. DEXA-scanning is performed using a Norland XR-46 scanner. Scans are performed with the&#xD;
           aim of measuring BMD of the proximal part of the tibia in close relation to the tibial&#xD;
           component, in the distale femur and the distal tibia bilaterally. The first scans are&#xD;
           performed preoperatively (only proximal and distal tibia) not more than two weeks before&#xD;
           surgery and postoperatively within the two weeks after surgery and with follow-up after&#xD;
           3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The precision of the BMD measurements of the distal and&#xD;
           proximal tibia and distal femur will bee estimated from double measurements of patients&#xD;
           (n=12) included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Special X-rays suitable for RSA measurements of migration of the tibial component&#xD;
           (Selvik 1989) is performed within the first week after the operation and after 3, 6, 12,&#xD;
           and 24 months. The precision of the RSA measurements is estimated from double&#xD;
           examinations in 12 patients of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient-reported outcome measurements. It is planned also to ask the patients&#xD;
           preoperatively and after ¼, 1 and 2 years to do a patient-reported outcome measurement&#xD;
           using the Oxford knee score (Dawson et al. 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Long-term follow-up. If possible we intend to do also 5- and 10-year follow-up including&#xD;
           all above-mentioned parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculations of sample size DEXA (changes in BMD 0-2 years). The expected decrease in BMD in&#xD;
      the proximal tibia after insertion of an uncemented TKA is 20%. In the study we would like to&#xD;
      be able to measure a significant difference (minimal relevant difference = MIREDIF) in&#xD;
      changes in BMD between the two groups of 7.5%. From a previously published study (Petersen et&#xD;
      al. 2005) where BMD was measured in the proximal tibia in patients with primary uncemented&#xD;
      TKA, we estimated a standard deviation (SD) of the changes in BMD that could be used for&#xD;
      calculating sample size in our study. In the study a relatively large difference in SD&#xD;
      (5.59%-12.40%) in the different ROI was seen, and thus our calculations are based on the&#xD;
      average value form the different ROI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Type I error = 5% Type II error = 15% and MIREDIF 7.5% SD = 7,53% Calculation resulted&#xD;
      in a sample size of n = 18 in each group. RSA. There exist several published RSA studies, and&#xD;
      we have decided to use the SD values from a study by Toksvig-Larsen et al.(2000). In that&#xD;
      study 4 different uncemented tibial components (n=62) were examined and the specification of&#xD;
      the SD was very clear. The SD used for calculation of sample size at 1 year of follow-up was&#xD;
      very high because the SD in one of the 4 groups was much higher than in the other groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the calculation is performed using the parameter maximum total point motion (MTPM)&#xD;
      two years postoperatively, which has shown to be the best predictor for later aseptic&#xD;
      loosening of the a tibial component after primary TKA (Ryd et al. 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type I error = 5% Type II error = 15 % MIREDIF 0,6 mm SD = 0,7 mm Calculation resulted in a&#xD;
      sample size of n = 24 in each group. In the study we have planned to include and randomize&#xD;
      (block-randomization with 4 in each block) a total of 60 patients. This will secure a high&#xD;
      statistical power even if some of the participants should drop out during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations We do not expect that the patients participating in the study will&#xD;
      experience any special side effects or complications related directly to the use of the two&#xD;
      orthopedic implants. The difference between the patients of the 2 groups is expected only to&#xD;
      be measurable using very precise techniques such as DEXA and RSA. Radiation dose to the&#xD;
      patients from both RSA and DEXA scanning is low compared with many conventional X-ray&#xD;
      examinations. The total accumulated radiation dose to a patient participating in all&#xD;
      examinations during the study is estimated to be approximately 0,1 mSv. Tantalum has been&#xD;
      used for more than 50 years and is a very biocompatible material without any tendency to&#xD;
      corrosion (Black 1994). Tantalum beads for RSA have been used especially in Sweden in several&#xD;
      clinical studies for more than 20 years. More than 20.000 beads have been implanted in more&#xD;
      than 2.000 patients and no side effects from Tantalum beads have been observed (Kärrholm&#xD;
      1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research protocol will be submitted for approval by The Danish Data Protection Agency,&#xD;
      and The Scientific Ethical Committee of Københavns og Frederiksberg Kommuner. All patients&#xD;
      will receive both oral and written information before informed consent to participate is&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The migration and the changes in BMD over time will be analyzed using&#xD;
      repeated Student t test for paired data and for parameters (MTPM) that is per definition not&#xD;
      normally distributed a non-parametric test will be used. The difference between migration and&#xD;
      changes in BMD between the 2 groups will be evaluated by Student t test for upaired data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame Inclusion of the patients (n=60) is expected to take 1 year. We have planned to&#xD;
      start the study during the spring 2011. Two years after inclusion of the last patient we&#xD;
      would be able to analyze the data and start the process with the aim of publishing the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publications We expect that the results of this protocol (when 2 years of follow-up have been&#xD;
      completed) together with a clinical and radiological evaluation of the patients that have&#xD;
      been operated on with insertion of an uncemented TKA using Trabecular Metal Technology (TMT)&#xD;
      Zimmer NexGen®, Modular tibial component at the Department og Orthopaedic Surgery,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet will result in a phd-thesis and at least 2-3 articles in international&#xD;
      orthopaedic journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this protocol will be published in all circumstances.&#xD;
