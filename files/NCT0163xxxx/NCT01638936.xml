  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test safety and anti-tumor activity of BT062 in combination&#xD;
      with lenalidomide and dexamethasone to define the best doses for treating patients with&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BT062 is an antibody-drug conjugate designed to bind and destroy Myeloma cells. The study&#xD;
      drug is being given in multiple doses with standard Multiple Myeloma treatments, lenalidomide&#xD;
      and dexamethasone, to test how well the treatments are tolerated and work together. This&#xD;
      study is a dose escalation study with the purpose to find out the highest dose of BT062 that&#xD;
      a subject can tolerate in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.&#xD;

    <measure>Determination of optimal dose of BT062 (Phase I part)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Phase I part will follow a standard dose escalation design with at least 3 patients per dose level to define optimal dose of BT062 in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone. Optimal dose will be defined by dose limiting toxicities (DLT) observed during Cycle 1 (28 days).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of response (Phase IIa part)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response to treatment with optimal dose of BT062 (defined in Phase I part) in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone or pomalidomide/dexamethasone will be evaluated at baseline and at start of each Cycle (every 28 days). Response evaluation will be primarily based on assessment of M-protein and serum free light chains. If clinically required bone marrow analysis, plasmacytoma evaluation, and skeletal survey will be performed.</description>
