  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II study is to find out what effects cabozantinib (XL184) has, good&#xD;
      and/or bad, in patients whose tumors one of the following gene changes RET, ROS1, or NTRK&#xD;
      fusion, or increased MET or AXL activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase II study looks at how effective a medication is at treating a specific type of cancer&#xD;
      and collects information on the side effects of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RET, ROS1, or NTRK fusion or increased MET or AXL activity gene leads to lung cancer cell&#xD;
      growth. Cabozantinib is an oral medicine that inhibits of RET, ROS1, NTRK, MET, and AXL. In&#xD;
      addition, this drug interferes with other cell pathways that also cause cancer cells to grow,&#xD;
      form new blood vessels, and spread to other organs of the body. The goal of using&#xD;
      cabozantinib is to shrink the cancer and to prevent it from growing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cabozantinib has been studied and shown to cause cancer shrinkage in other cancers such as&#xD;
      medullary thyroid cancer and prostate cancer. We thus have a good idea of what side-effects&#xD;
      it causes and can anticipate them.&#xD;
