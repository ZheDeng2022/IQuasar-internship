      The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      unilateral subretinal transplantation of HuCNS-SC cells in subjects with geographic atrophy&#xD;
      secondary to age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;

      This study is an open-label dose-escalation investigation of the safety and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of unilateral subretinal transplantation of HuCNS-SC cells in subjects with&#xD;
      Geographic Atrophy secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and evaluated at regular post&#xD;
      transplant intervals. The investigation will be divided into two sequential cohorts. Subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled into each cohort based on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) visual acuity&#xD;
      as determined by the Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (E-ETDRS) acuity&#xD;
      test. BCVA of less than or equal to 20/400 in the Study Eye will be enrolled in Cohort I.&#xD;
      Subjects with BCVA of 20/320 to 20/100 in the Study Eye will be enrolled in Cohort II. Cohort&#xD;
      I will consist of four subjects who will undergo transplant with 200,000 cells followed by&#xD;
      four subjects who will undergo transplant with 1 million cells. Cohort II will consist of 7&#xD;
      subjects who will undergo transplant with 1 million cells. An independent Data Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee (DMC) will review accruing safety data for all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HuCNS-SC cells will be transplanted by a board-certified vitreoretinal surgeon. The&#xD;
      transplantation will be conducted in the eye with the inferior best-corrected visual acuity&#xD;
      (BCVA) (i.e., the Study Eye). Only the Study Eye will undergo transplantation. The HuCNS-SC&#xD;
      cells will be administered into the subretinal space through a standard surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppressive agents will be administered orally to all subjects for a period of three&#xD;
      months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored frequently for a total of one year after HuCNS-SC cell&#xD;
      transplantation. An additional four years of monitoring will be conducted in a separate&#xD;
      follow-up study that will commence with the termination visit of the Phase I/II&#xD;
      investigation. The follow-up study will be conducted as a separate investigation.&#xD;
