      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with congenital heart disease may develop heart failure earlier that those who do&#xD;
      not have the disease. One theory to explain this is that the heart s own blood supply may be&#xD;
      different in people with congenital heart disease. Problems with this blood supply can&#xD;
      severely damage the heart. This damage can be studied with a heart imaging test called a&#xD;
      cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Researchers want to use this type of scan to&#xD;
      look at the blood supply to the heart in people with congenital heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about the blood supply to the heart in people with congenital heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have heart defects caused by congenital heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a cardiac MRI scan to look at the blood flow to the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also have a heart stress test to measure heart function during&#xD;
           exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other imaging studies of the heart may be performed to collect more information on heart&#xD;
           function.&#xD;

      This is a study of the perfusion of the myocardium in adults with specific forms of repaired&#xD;
      congenital heart disease using established cardiac MRI techniques and correlating perfusion&#xD;
      with clinical outcomes. Our objectives are to examine myocardial perfusion both during stress&#xD;
      and at rest in adults with repaired or palliated congenital heart disease as well as quantify&#xD;
      ventricular function, regional myocardial strain and evidence of myocardial fibrosis with&#xD;
      quantitative measures of myocardial perfusion. The specific aim of this study is to&#xD;
      understand whether clinical subendocardial perfusion defects contribute to the late&#xD;
      decompensation of adult subjects that have single ventricle physiology and adult subjects&#xD;
      that have a systemic right ventricle.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for All Arms of the Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All defects that have a right ventricle that supports the systemic circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All defects with a functional single ventricle&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for All Arms of the Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a contraindication to MRI scanning will be excluded. These&#xD;
             contraindications include subjects with the following devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Central nervous system aneurysm clips&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Implanted neural stimulator&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cochlear implant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Implanted Insulin pump&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metal shrapnel or bullet&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe heart damage that makes it difficult to breathe while lying flat&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women (Women of childbearing potential who are uncertain as to whether they&#xD;
             are pregnant will be required to have a screening urine or blood pregnancy test)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active symptoms of myocardial ischemia occurring despite maximally&#xD;
             tolerated doses of oral antianginal therapy and intravenous nitroglycerin&#xD;
&#xD;
        Furthermore, the following subject groups will be excluded from studies involving the&#xD;
        administration of MRI contrast agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  lactating women unless they are willing to discard breast milk for 24 hours after&#xD;
             receiving gadolinium&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 body&#xD;
             surface area)&#xD;
&#xD;
        The eGFR will be used to estimate renal function if reported by the laboratory. Otherwise,&#xD;
        estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be based on the Modification of Diet in&#xD;
        Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation (see below) in subjects with stable renal function.&#xD;
        This formula is not applicable to subjects with acute renal insufficiency:&#xD;
&#xD;
        eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (serum creatinine)-1.154 x (age)-0.203 x 0.742 (if the&#xD;
        subject is female) x 1.212 (if the subject is black)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Vasodilator Stress MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction within 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled asthma or emphysema&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ventricular arrhythmia (sustained ventricular arrhythmia at the time of MR scan)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second degree heart block or higher&#xD;
