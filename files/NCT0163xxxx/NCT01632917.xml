      The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ATX-101&#xD;
      injections and to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of the two ATX-101 formulations&#xD;
      that are expected to be the final formulations. ATX-101 will be administered into the&#xD;
      submental fat as subcutaneous injections using the maximum proposed dosing regimen that is&#xD;
      intended for labeling.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of sufficient submental fat into which 50 subcutaneous injections of ATX-101&#xD;
             spaced on a 1.0-cm grid can be safely administered based on the investigator's&#xD;
             judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females who are aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive, on&#xD;
             the date of dosing with ATX-101. Females must have a negative serum human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (hCG) test result from a sample obtained during the screening period and&#xD;
             after admission to the research facility, but before the dose of study material.&#xD;
             Females of postmenopausal status must not have had menses for at least one year and if&#xD;
             younger than 55 years of age must have a serum FSH level â‰¥ 35 mIU/mL. Females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to practice adequate contraception, in the judgment&#xD;
             of the investigator, during the course of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum hemoglobin test result of 11.0 g/dL or greater and negative hepatitis B,&#xD;
             hepatitis C, and HIV test result within 28 days before the dose of study material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with and understand the visit schedule and all of the&#xD;
             protocol-specified tests and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically able to undergo the administration of study material as determined by&#xD;
             clinical and laboratory evaluations obtained within 28 days before dosing with study&#xD;
             material for which the investigator identifies no clinically significant abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent obtained before any study-specific procedure is conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any intervention to treat submental fat (e.g. liposuction, surgery, or&#xD;
             lipolytic agents).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of trauma associated with the chin or neck areas, which in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator may affect evaluation of safety of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Loose skin in the neck or chin area for which reduction in submental fat may, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, result in a cosmetically unacceptable outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prominent platysmal bands at rest that interfere with the evaluation of submental fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of any cause of enlargement in the submental area other than localized&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A result on coagulation tests (PT, PTT) obtained within 28 days before the dose of&#xD;
             study material that indicates the presence of any clinically significant bleeding&#xD;
             disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition that would interfere with the assessment of safety in this trial&#xD;
             or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study procedures or to give&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with fish oil, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS),&#xD;
             except acetaminophen, within 7 days before dosing, or any anticipated need for agents&#xD;
             with anticoagulative effects (e.g. warfarin, heparin) during the course of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) within 30 days before dosing with&#xD;
             study material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with radio frequency, laser procedures, chemical peels, or dermal fillers in&#xD;
             the neck or chin area within 12 months before dosing with the study material, or&#xD;
             botulinum toxin injections in the neck or chin area within 6 months before dosing with&#xD;
             the study material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any components of the study material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse, in the judgment of the investigator, within two&#xD;
             years before dosing with the study material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a positive urine drug or alcohol screening test result obtained from a&#xD;
             sample obtained during the screening period and/or after admission to the research&#xD;
             facility for the confinement period, but before dosing with the study material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous enrollment into a trial of ATX-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
