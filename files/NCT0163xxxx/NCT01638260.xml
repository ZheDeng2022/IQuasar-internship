      - Rationale: Treatment with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has been shown to reduce plasma&#xD;
      glucose levels to a further extent when added to standard therapy in type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. Given the well-known beneficial effects of GLP-1 analogues on glucose metabolism by&#xD;
      stimulating insulin release, suppressing elevated glucagon levels, delaying gastric emptying&#xD;
      and reducing food intake, it is anticipated that liraglutide developed by Novo Nordisk&#xD;
      (Victoza®) also has beneficial effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus as has been proven by&#xD;
      several trials. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with obesity and sedentary lifestyle.&#xD;
      Obesity occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure (EE) over a period of time. It&#xD;
      has been presumed that activity energy expenditure and daily energy expenditure are lower in&#xD;
      most people in Western societies. Increasing non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT),&#xD;
      defined as all energy expended due to everyday activity, exclusive of volitional exercise,&#xD;
      may be an effective way to maintain daily EE and combat overweight and obesity. One way to&#xD;
      promote NEAT is to decrease the amount of time spent on sedentary behaviors (e.g. watching&#xD;
      television).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This leads us to hypothesize that adding NEAT to GLP-1 analogues in type 2 diabetes has an&#xD;
      additive effect on glucose regulation, weight control and blood pressure. On the other hand,&#xD;
      we hypothesize that a decrease in HbA1c, weight and blood pressure could add to an improved&#xD;
      quality of life and less health care costs. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the synergistic effect of liraglutide and activating lifestyle by increasing&#xD;
      NEAT on glucose metabolism and weight. First line therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      currently consists of lifestyle changes with metformin. When failure of this regime occurs,&#xD;
      sulfonylurea derivates and/or thiazolidinediones can be added. One third of patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus fail with this regimen after 5 years of monotherapy, and nowadays&#xD;
      GLP-1 analogues can be added to prevent deterioration of glycaemic control. However,&#xD;
      comparison of this strategy with NEAT has not been performed and the synergistic effect of&#xD;
      combination of GLP-1 with increasing NEAT has not been investigated. Treatment with GLP-1&#xD;
      analogues in combination with NEAT could theoretically overcome all shortcomings of current&#xD;
      treatment strategies of type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the change in HbA1c from baseline and end of treatment (26 weeks) and&#xD;
                end of follow-up (52 weeks) after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide versus&#xD;
                liraglutide with NEAT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the change in weight from baseline and end of treatment (26 weeks) and&#xD;
                end of follow-up (52 weeks) after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide versus&#xD;
                liraglutide with NEAT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the change in blood pressure from baseline and end of treatment (26&#xD;
                weeks) and end of follow-up (52 weeks) after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide&#xD;
                versus liraglutide with NEAT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the change in quality of life from baseline and end of treatment (26&#xD;
                weeks) and end of follow-up (52 weeks) after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide&#xD;
                versus liraglutide with NEAT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the change in NEAT from baseline and end of treatment (26 weeks) and end&#xD;
                of follow-up (52 weeks) after 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide versus&#xD;
                liraglutide with NEAT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To asses the health-care related costs at baseline, after 26 weeks of treatment&#xD;
                with liraglutide versus liraglutide with NEAT, and after 52 weeks (end of&#xD;
                follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized controlled intervention study&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study population: Men and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, insufficiënt glycaemic&#xD;
      control during maximum (tolerable) dose monotherapy with metformin or a sulfonylurea derivate&#xD;
      or during combination therapy with metformin and a sulfonylurea derivate or a&#xD;
      thiazolinedione, HbA1c above 7,0%, age between 40 - 75 years old, BMI above 25 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: One group receives once daily subcutaneously liraglutide 1.8mg added to&#xD;
      standard anti-diabetic care and the other group receives once daily subcutaneously&#xD;
      liraglutide 1.8mg added to standard anti-diabetic care and an activating lifestyle by&#xD;
      increasing NEAT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the percent change in HbA1c and&#xD;
      weight. Secondary study parameters are change in blood pressure, quality of life as measured&#xD;
      using EQ-5D and SF-36 questionnaire, NEAT as measured using an activPAL™ accelerometer and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis.&#xD;
