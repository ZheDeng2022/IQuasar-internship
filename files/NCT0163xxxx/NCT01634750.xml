      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in a&#xD;
      gene called GNE. This gene is responsible for producing a sugar called sialic acid. Low&#xD;
      levels of sialic acid may cause muscle problems. Symptoms of HIBM include walking&#xD;
      difficulties and muscle weakness, which usually start in a person s 20s or 30s and become&#xD;
      worse over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are studying a drug called ManNAc. It may be useful for treating HIBM. However,&#xD;
      this drug is still being tested. Researchers want to see how ManNAc is absorbed into and&#xD;
      removed from the blood. They will not be looking specifically at whether ManNAc can stop or&#xD;
      slow the symptoms of HIBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;TAB&gt;To study how MaNAc is absorbed into and removed from the blood in people with HIBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;TAB&gt;To study of safety of ManNAc in people with HIBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who have HIBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a 3 to 4-day inpatient stay for the main part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into groups of six. In each group, four will take ManNAc&#xD;
           and two will take a placebo. Participants will not know which one they will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a single dose of either ManNAc or placebo. They will be monitored&#xD;
           for any possible side effects. Frequent blood samples will be collected during the 4-day&#xD;
           stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment for HIBM will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is an autosomal recessive, neuromuscular disorder&#xD;
      characterized by progressive muscle weakness with onset in early adulthood. The causative&#xD;
      gene, GNE, codes for the bifunctional enzyme uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine&#xD;
      (UDP-GlcNAc)-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) kinase (GNE/MNK), which catalyzes the&#xD;
      first 2 steps in the biosynthesis of sialic acid. The subsequent paucity of sialic acid&#xD;
      production is presumed to cause decreased sialylation of HIBM muscle glycoproteins, resulting&#xD;
      in muscle deterioration. In this Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,&#xD;
      escalating single-dose study, we propose to provide ManNAc (N-acetyl-D-mannosamine&#xD;
      monohydrate) orally as a liquid solution to 3 cohorts of 6 subjects (Cohorts A, B, C) at&#xD;
      doses of 3,000 mg, 6,000 mg, and 10,000 mg ManNAc, respectively, or up to the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD). The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of orally administered ManNAc to HIBM subjects, to&#xD;
      identify the MTD of a single dose of orally administered ManNAc to HIBM subjects, and to&#xD;
      explore the effect of a single dose of ManNAc on potential pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of&#xD;
      HIBM. All subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive ManNAc (n equals 4) or&#xD;
      placebo (n equals 2) and the decision to dose-escalate will be the responsibility of the&#xD;
      Safety Review Committee (SRC). Safety will be assessed by adverse events (AEs), clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). PK will&#xD;
      be assessed for both ManNAc and sialic acid.&#xD;
