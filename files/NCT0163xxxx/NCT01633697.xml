  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that education will improve exercise capacity, symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators are interested in determining how education might alter various chemicals&#xD;
      in the blood and exhaled breath that reflect inflammation in the lungs and the body as a&#xD;
      whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll 42 patients into this study, with half of them participating&#xD;
      at each of the two sites, Vermont Lung Center at the University of Vermont in Burlington,&#xD;
      Vermont, and at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Participants will undergo a&#xD;
      series of measurements and tests at the beginning of the study, receive formal education&#xD;
      about COPD over the next 2 weeks, return at 6 weeks for a brief refresher session, and&#xD;
      finally return after 12 weeks for repeat measurement and testing as was done at the&#xD;
      beginning. Participants will be asked to keep a diary of symptoms, medication, and exercise&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health problem worldwide, and is&#xD;
      currently the third leading cause of death in the United Sates. Patients with COPD mainly&#xD;
      complain of shortness of breath with daily activities and exercise. A key mechanism of&#xD;
      dyspnea is dynamic hyperinflation, or air trapping, which results from the severe airflow&#xD;
      limitation that characterizes the disease. Inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids may&#xD;
      help, but these therapies are expensive and may have side effects. Pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      is very effective at reducing dyspnea and improving exercise tolerance, but it is not widely&#xD;
      available to patients. The investigators propose studying the effect of a simple breathing&#xD;
      exercise known as pranayama, or yogic breathing. The central hypothesis is that the practice&#xD;
      of pranayama will improve exercise tolerance in patients with COPD. The investigators believe&#xD;
      that the mechanisms involved will include reduced dynamic hyperinflation as well as&#xD;
      beneficial effects on lung mechanics, inflammation and oxidative stress. This hypothesis will&#xD;
      be tested in a randomized, double blind, controlled trial of pranayama vs. usual care&#xD;
      (education) in COPD patients. In Specific Aim 1, the investigators will determine the effect&#xD;
      of pranayama on exercise tolerance as measured by 6 min walk distance; in Specific Aim 2, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine the effect of pranayama on dynamic hyperinflation as measured by&#xD;
      changes in inspiratory capacity before and after exercise; and in Specific Aim 3, The&#xD;
      investigators will determine the effect of pranayama on oxidative stress systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, shortness of breath, and quality of life. The study is designed to be&#xD;
      applicable to a wide variety of clinical settings, since it will involve two diverse clinical&#xD;
      sites (Burlington, VT and Houston, TX), require minimal direct intervention, and engage&#xD;
      participants in self-learning and practice. The data from this study will provide fundamental&#xD;
      new insights into the mechanisms of action of pranayama, and will be critical in designing a&#xD;
      large, multicenter trial to test the effectiveness of pranayama in patients with COPD.&#xD;
