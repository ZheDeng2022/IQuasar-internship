    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the immediate and long-term (up to 12&#xD;
      month) safety and effectiveness of a Nitinol Self-Expanding Paclitaxel-Eluting stent for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with critical limb ischemia (i.e. rest pain or non-healing foot ulcers)&#xD;
      due to the presence of arterial lesions in the below-the-knee arteries of maximally 50mm&#xD;
      long.&#xD;
