  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effects of a single dose of&#xD;
      sirukumab on the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to a drug) of study agents that are&#xD;
      specific for cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2) in patients&#xD;
      with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study will also assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of a single subcutaneous (SC, under the skin) dose of sirukumab in patients with&#xD;
      active RA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all patients and study personnel will know the identity of the&#xD;
      administered study agents), multi-center, drug-drug interaction study. Approximately 18&#xD;
      patients may be enrolled in this study, and there will be one treatment group. All patients&#xD;
      will receive a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of sirukumab. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)&#xD;
      enzyme-specific study agents (5-probe cocktail) will consist of oral doses of midazolam,&#xD;
      warfarin/vitamin K, omeprazole, and caffeine administered on 4 separate occasions throughout&#xD;
      the study. A blood sample for CYP genetic analysis (genotyping) will be collected during&#xD;
      screening from all prospective patients to determine eligibility for the study. Participation&#xD;
      in CYP genotyping prescreening is mandatory for all patients. The CYP genotyping blood sample&#xD;
      will not be used for any additional genetic research and will be destroyed after completion&#xD;
      of this study. The total duration of study participation will be approximately 12 weeks for&#xD;
      all patients included in the study, including a screening visit up to 4 weeks prior to first&#xD;
      study agent administration. Patients will have five in-patient periods, four consisting of 3&#xD;
      days and 2 nights each and one consisting of 2 days and 1 night. Patients safety will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study, and there will be approximately 7 weeks of safety follow-up&#xD;
      after sirukumab administration.&#xD;
