      The studies described in this protocol are all performed within the framework of PROTECT&#xD;
      (Pharmacoepidemiological Research on Outcomes of Therapeutics by a European ConsorTium) Work&#xD;
      Package 2 and Workgroup 1. Primary aim of these studies is to develop, test and disseminate&#xD;
      methodological standards for the design, conduct and analysis of Pharmacoepidemiological (PE)&#xD;
      studies applicable to different safety issues and using different data sources. To achieve&#xD;
      this, results from PE studies on five key adverse events (AEs) performed in different&#xD;
      databases will be evaluated. Therefore, emphasis will be on the methodological aspects of the&#xD;
      studies in this protocol and not on the clinical consequences of the association under&#xD;
      investigation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the most common chronic airway&#xD;
      diseases in the western world. For both, a stepwise treatment to reduce symptoms, improve&#xD;
      lung function, and prevent risk of exacerbation is recommended using several drug classes&#xD;
      according to guidelines published by e.g. the Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA guideline]&#xD;
      and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD guideline],&#xD;
      respectively. Beta-2-adrenoceptor agonists (B2A) are therapeutic mainstays in treating asthma&#xD;
      and COPD due to their bronchodilative effects mediated by B2A. This drug class consists of&#xD;
      two types of drugs: short acting B2A (SABA) which are used as a reliever medication and long&#xD;
      acting B2A (LABA) which are used as maintenance / controller medication. Formoterol and&#xD;
      salmeterol are the most frequently used LABA compounds with a half-life between 5-15 hrs and&#xD;
      therefore, these compounds most commonly have labelled indications for use twice a day. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focussing on cardiac side effects of B2A one must consider that drugs with an opposite&#xD;
      mechanism of action (beta-adrenoceptor-antagonists) have well-known cardio protective effects&#xD;
      and are widely used in patients suffering from e.g. ischemic heart disease, hypertension and&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI)). Conversely, stimulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors as&#xD;
      done by B2A may have deleterious cardiovascular effects particularly in patients with cardiac&#xD;
      risk factors. And in fact, tachycardia and arrhythmias are well-known side effects of B2A&#xD;
      confirming a cardiac influence of these drugs particularly after oral therapy (due to a high&#xD;
      systemic exposure) as stated in the respective summary of product characteristics (SPCs),&#xD;
      e.g. clenbuterol (Spiropent(R)). Obviously, inhaled drugs cause much smaller systemic&#xD;
      exposure but cardiac side effects (e.g. arrhythmias, tachycardia) are also described in the&#xD;
      respective SPCs (e.g. formoterol [Foradil(R)). Furthermore, cardiac side were also reported&#xD;
      after exposure with inhaled MA (e.g. ipratropium [Atrovent(R)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several observational studies have been performed on the association between the usage of&#xD;
      inhaled B2A and the occurrence of AMI. However, these studies have produced conflicting&#xD;
      results. Reasons for this variation are numerous, e.g. small number of events (AMI) leading&#xD;
      to poor precision of risk estimate, potential misclassification of potential cardiac events&#xD;
      versus airway-related events due to similar clinical complaints, differences in populations&#xD;
      of drug users, measurement of drug exposure, and background risk of AMI. Additionally, a&#xD;
      consensus document was released in 2000, redefining AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make comparing results possible, this protocol gives guidelines for conducting studies in&#xD;
      the same way in five databases and across 3 designs (cohort, nested case-control,&#xD;
      case-cross-over) on the association between inhaled LABA use and AMI. The main focus is to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of study design, population and database characteristics on the&#xD;
      association between inhaled LABA and AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from the following databases: The Health Improvement Network (THIN),&#xD;
      the General Practice Research Database (GPRD), the Dutch Mondriaan project, Base de Datos&#xD;
      para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atencion Primaria (BIFAP), the National&#xD;
      Databases of Denmark, and the Bavarian statutory health insurance physicians' association&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
