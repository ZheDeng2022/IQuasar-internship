      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the use of oral dissolving metoclopramide during standard video&#xD;
      capsule endoscopy. Metoclopramide is a pro -motility agent, that is, this medication helps&#xD;
      with movement through the stomach and small bowel. This study will help us determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of oral dissolving metoclopramide on transit time through the stomach and small&#xD;
      bowel of the video capsule that is ingested. This study may help with better diagnoses of&#xD;
      pathology in the small bowel. Each patient enrolled in the study will either be assigned to a&#xD;
      group that only ingests the capsule or the group that receives the oral dissolving&#xD;
      metoclopramide plus capsule. Each patient will undergo the same standard procedures and&#xD;
      precaution used during standard video capsule endoscopy. The patients that will qualify for&#xD;
      the study are patients that are in need of video capsule endoscopy for further imaging of the&#xD;
      small bowel. The patients must meet the inclusion criteria provided in the protocol and must&#xD;
      not meet any of the exclusion criteria in the protocol. The hypothesis is that the patients&#xD;
      that ingest the metoclopramide will have better capsule images and transit time and will&#xD;
      allow for enhanced diagnosis of small bowel pathology.&#xD;
