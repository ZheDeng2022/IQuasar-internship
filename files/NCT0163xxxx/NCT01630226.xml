      This is a single center, non-randomized, open label phase II trial to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      and pathologic response of neoadjuvant cisplatin-monotherapy in BRCA1 positive patients. The&#xD;
      study will enroll patients with diagnosed breast cancer with a BRCA1 mutation. Patients will&#xD;
      be eligible if they have primary breast cancer (measured on mammogram and ultrasound or MRI)&#xD;
      and confirmed histological diagnosis of invasive breast cancer by core biopsy. If axilla&#xD;
      lymph nodes will be suspected then fine needle aspiration biopsy will be performed. Patients&#xD;
      will be drawn from one of three oncology centers: Szczecin, Bielsko-Biała and Kraków.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will obtain staging investigations and will be monitored. Once entry criteria is met&#xD;
      and consent obtained, all patients will obtain baseline staging investigation within 3 weeks&#xD;
      of trial registration. Routine investigations will include staging scans: mammography,&#xD;
      ultrasound of the breast and axilla (assessment of breast tumor and axilla lymph nodes),&#xD;
      assessment of chest/abdomen/pelvis (plain film, Computed Tomography [CT] and/or ultrasound as&#xD;
      per local standards) and baseline blood work (Complete Blood Count [CBC], electrolytes,&#xD;
      creatinine, Liver Function Tests [LFTs], calcium, albumin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once staging investigations are complete, all patients will be treated with cisplatin&#xD;
      chemotherapy at a dose of 75mg/m2 every three weeks for a total of four cycles (4 cycles of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Clinical response will be evaluated every three weeks by the&#xD;
      treating physician while on chemotherapy (tumour of the breast and axilla lymph nodes). After&#xD;
      four cycles of chemotherapy the patient will then undergo definitive surgery (mastectomy or&#xD;
      breast-conserving surgery). Sentinel lymph nodes procedure will be performed. In case of&#xD;
      positive lymph nodes standard lymph nodes surgery will be performed. Pathological complete&#xD;
      response will defined as no evidence of residual tumor in the breast and the axilla. There&#xD;
      may be evidence of ductal carcinoma in situ. The pathology will reviewed by two independent&#xD;
      pathologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery patients will receive standard adjuvant chemotherapy at the discretion of&#xD;
      the treating physician and if indicated, the patient will also receive radiotherapy and/or&#xD;
      hormonal therapy and/or adjuvant trastuzumab at the description of the treating physician.&#xD;
