  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In about 10% of preoperative anaphylactic reactions to Neuro-Muscular Blocking Agents (NMBA)&#xD;
      (114 patients analyzed at the BICHAT Hospital), a classical mechanism (mast cell- and&#xD;
      IgE-dependent) is not identified. The mechanisms underlying these atypical anaphylactic&#xD;
      reactions are unknown. The investigators have developed at the Pasteur Institute a murine&#xD;
      model of anaphylaxis in which neutrophils, IgG and Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) play&#xD;
      predominant roles. In addition, preliminary results obtained at the BICHAT Hospital suggest&#xD;
      the presence of specific IgG anti-quaternary ammonium in the sera of patients that had&#xD;
      developed a shock to NMBA anesthesia, but not in controls exposed to NMBA anesthesia or in&#xD;
      normal blood donors. Finally, the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs),&#xD;
      extracellular filaments made of DNA and histones, may contribute to respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: Neutrophils are implicated in NMBA -induced anaphylactic reactions in humans.&#xD;
      Activated by IgG-NMBA complexes, which aggregate IgG receptors, neutrophils release PAF and&#xD;
      NETs that are implicated in the cardiac and respiratory distress during anaphylaxis. It is&#xD;
      possible that the activation of neutrophils: 1) explains the clinical features of atypical&#xD;
      anaphylactic reactions (non-IgE mediated), 2) participates also in part to classical&#xD;
      anaphylactic reactions GENERAL OBJECTIVE: Compare the percentage of circulating activated&#xD;
      neutrophils in a group of patients immediately following a NMBA -induced shock (case) to that&#xD;
      of a group of patients exposed to NMBA during anesthesia without developing a shock&#xD;
      (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) the day of the shock, quantify and compare between case and controls, 1) the level of&#xD;
      circulating anti-quaternary ammonium IgG by immuno fluorometry, 2) the expression of IgG&#xD;
      receptors (FcR) on the surface of neutrophils by cytometry, 3) the levels of circulating PAF&#xD;
      by mass spectrometry, 4) the amount of NETs by immunofluorescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) 6 to 10 weeks after the shock perform, 1) cutaneous tests to NMBA, 2) a study of the&#xD;
      capacity of stimulation of ex vivo neutrophils by IgG- NMBA complexes&#xD;

      Case control study, with a 6,10 week follow-up on cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of cases :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Any patient of age 18 and over:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presenting with clinical signs compatible with a perioperative anaphylactic reaction to&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocking drugs, whatever the grade of the anaphylactic reaction That was&#xD;
      treated following the French Patient Management 2011 guidelines (cf. annex 5) Non inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: patient dying during the anaphylactic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of controls: One control for each case will be included. Controls will be recruited&#xD;
      solely at the Hospital BICHAT. Controls should correspond to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Any patient of age 18 and over Hospitalized for a surgical intervention&#xD;
      necessitating a neuromuscular blocking drug injection, without developing an anaphylactic&#xD;
      reaction That had been informed of the particulars of the study and that had consented to&#xD;
      participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non inclusion criteria: pregnant women NB: If a patient recruited as a control suffers from&#xD;
      an anaphylactic reaction following neuromuscular blocking drug-injection, this patient will&#xD;
      be considered a case, and other controls paired, one to this novel case and one to the&#xD;
      original case patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pairing : Controls will be paired to cases based on the following criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      - age :+/- 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sexe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  infectious status : infected/ non infected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  type of surgery: the different sub-classes are classified as follows: orthopedic,&#xD;
           neurosurgery/visceral, urologic, gynecologic/vascular, cardiac, thoraco/maxillo-facial,&#xD;
           ophthalmology, ENT/Other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacological class of the neuromuscular blocking drug used for surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study:Total duration: 26 months Inclusion period: 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of participation for a patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases: 6 to 10 weeks Controls: the day of the surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection Cases: at the time of the shock (blood and plasma sample, and, when&#xD;
      necessary for the patient, bronchial aspiration liquid) and during the Allergology Anesthesia&#xD;
      consult 6 to 10 weeks post anaphylactic reaction Controls: blood and plasma sample following&#xD;
      the injection of neuromuscular blocking drug injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood sampling (and eventually aspiration of bronchial fluids) required for this study&#xD;
      are performed during the normal clinical management of case and of control patients, without&#xD;
      any additional or non-conventional procedure of intervention, diagnosis or patient monitoring&#xD;
      (non-interventional study). Supernumerary blood tubes are collected in addition to those&#xD;
      collected during the normal clinical practice (10 ml on dry tube for serum/plasma and 10 ml&#xD;
      on EDTA tube) at the same time (case and controls) and the bronchial aspiration fluid is kept&#xD;
      for analysis instead of being discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An anaphylactic shock to neuromuscular blocking drug during anesthesia arises in minutes&#xD;
      following injection/perfusion. Samples from case patients will therefore be collected in the&#xD;
      30 to 60 minutes following injection/perfusion of the neuromuscular blocking drug, as it is&#xD;
      already currently performed during surgery, and when the patient's condition has been&#xD;
      stabilized. The investigators expect that surgical incisions will not be performed in most,&#xD;
      if not all, case patients as the anaphylactic reactions occur before incisions are possible,&#xD;
      i.e. just after injection/perfusion of the neuromuscular blocking drug. Samples from control&#xD;
      patients will therefore be collected shortly after exposure to neuromuscular blocking drug&#xD;
      and before surgical incisions are performed, to avoid the perturbations induced by this&#xD;
      surgical act, especially regarding neutrophil activation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood volume collected specifically for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  case patient: 10 ml after the anaphylactic reaction, and during the&#xD;
           Allergology-Anesthesia consult 6 to 10 weeks after the shock le choc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control patients: 20 ml following neuromuscular blocking drug injection Samples&#xD;
           collected in Lithium heparinate for the cell-based study will be sent the day of the&#xD;
           anaphylactic reaction and the day of the Allergology-Anesthesia consult by an authorized&#xD;
           delivery service to the Unity Allergologic molecular et Cellularise at Institute&#xD;
           Pasteur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples collected on dry tubes (serum sample) will be housed in the sero-tec of Hospital&#xD;
      BICHAT, and series of aliquots sent to Institute Pasteur upon request. Identical aliquots&#xD;
      will be used to dose anti quaternary ammonium specific IgG, and specific IgE as currently&#xD;
      performed at the Unity d'Immunologic Autoimmunity et Hypersensibility at Hospital BICHAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When performed, bronchial aspiration fluids will be kept in part for the study of NETs in the&#xD;
      Unity d'Immunologic Autoimmunity et Hypersensibility at Hospital BICHAT, and in part for&#xD;
      analysis of cellular content and PAF levels at the Institute Pasteur, and accordingly&#xD;
      delivered the same day in the respective laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cutaneous prick tests will be performed during the Allergology-Anesthesia consult 6 to 10&#xD;
      weeks post-anaphylactic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following each inclusion, each hospital will send, as it is current medical practice,&#xD;
      information on the patient: age, sex, type of surgery that was planned, nature of anesthetics&#xD;
      used, history of atopic events including asthma, allergy to food or drugs, comorbidity&#xD;
      factors. Control patients will be included at Hospital BICHAT only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main judgment criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percentage of circulating activated neutrophils in the group of patients immediately&#xD;
           after a neuromuscular blocking drug-induced shock (case) compared to that of the group&#xD;
           of patients exposed to neuromuscular blocking drug during anesthesia without developing&#xD;
           a shock (control). This measure will be based on the intensity of expression of the&#xD;
           activation marker CD62L (L-selectin) by blood neutrophils using flow cytometry. Our&#xD;
           preliminary data indicate that the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of CD62L is &gt;450&#xD;
           when considering &quot; non-activated &quot; neutrophils, and CD62L(MFI)&lt;300 when considering &quot;&#xD;
           activated &quot; neutrophils.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Levels of PAF in the plasma of &quot;cases&quot; than in the plasma of &quot;controls&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary judgment criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Levels of anti-quaternary ammonium specific IgG in the plasma of &quot;cases&quot; than in the&#xD;
           plasma of &quot;controls&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ex vivo activation capacity of blood neutrophils in the presence of neuromuscular&#xD;
           blocking drug-IgG immune complexes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presence of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in the bronchial aspiration fluid of &quot;cases&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Description of the patient population: A complete description of the entire population&#xD;
           studied and of the groups will be performed. Variables will be described according to&#xD;
           their distribution as appropriate (mean and standard deviation for variables with a&#xD;
           normal distribution; median and interquartile range for variables with abnormal&#xD;
           distributions; frequency and percentage for category criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis - The distribution of variables representing the percentage of activated&#xD;
           neutrophils between cases and controls, as well as each secondary judgment criteria will&#xD;
           be compared using a conditional logical regression, adjusting on the matching criteria -&#xD;
           To evaluate the correlation between percentage of activated neutrophils and the severity&#xD;
           of the shock, or between the level of specific IgG and the severity of the shock, a&#xD;
           linear tendency test in a general linear model will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An analysis results obtained in sub-groups of patients defined based on the&#xD;
                severity of the shock they suffered from, will also be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Statistical tests will be bilateral and the risk of first degree will be fixed at&#xD;
                5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Description of the functional parameters of blood neutrophils at basal stage or&#xD;
                following stimulation with neuromuscular blocking drug-IgG complexes (expression of&#xD;
                FcRs and of activation markers, release of mediators, induction of NETs), and&#xD;
                description of the &quot;classical&quot; immunological parameters of the anaphylactic shock&#xD;
                to neuromuscular blocking drugs (prick test results, ex vivo activation potential&#xD;
                of basophils).&#xD;
&#xD;
                5 complementary studies will be performed on samples from patients included in the&#xD;
                NASA study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IPAAQ (Identification and Pathologic effects of Anti-Quaternary ammonium&#xD;
                antibodies), As it will require an additional 10ml sample of sera, a specific&#xD;
                signed consent will be obtained from every patient included in the IPAAQ study.&#xD;
                This serum sample will be taken during the allergology visit scheduled 6 to 10&#xD;
                weeks post-anaphylactic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of this study is to quantify, identify and purify the different IgG subclasses&#xD;
           of anti-quaternary ammonium antibodies in the sera of patients that have undergone an&#xD;
           anaphylactic shock during anaesthesia. The ability of immune complexes, composed of&#xD;
           anti-quaternary ammonium antibodies and a neuromuscular blocking agent, to bind human&#xD;
           IgG receptors and/or to activate human neutrophils and basophils in vitro will be&#xD;
           evaluated. This analysis will enable determining if anti-quaternary ammonium&#xD;
           IgG-neuromuscular blocking agent complexes may be pathogenic, and validating the&#xD;
           anti-quaternary ammonium IgG diagnostic test, in addition to the anti-quaternary&#xD;
           ammonium IgE test performed during normal clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NASAmAbs: Different populations of memory B lymphocytes (particularly IgG or IgE +)&#xD;
                directed against a quaternary ammonium will be isolated from PBMCs of two &quot;cases&quot;&#xD;
                who have agreed to participate in the study NASAmAbs, by flow cytometry using a&#xD;
                Quaternary Ammonium (QA) coupled to a fluorescent protein (eg KLH). Genes encoding&#xD;
                the variable domains of the heavy and light chains immunoglobulins (IgH and IgL)&#xD;
                expressed by each cell B will first be amplified by RT-PCR, then cloned into&#xD;
                vectors encoding the constant domains of immunoglobulins. These vectors will be&#xD;
                transfected into cell lines and resulting recombinant monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
                (chimeric human-mouse) will be produced and characterized in terms of specific&#xD;
                reactivity against QA neuromuscular blocking agents (for ELISA), affinity for the&#xD;
                ligand (by method of magnetic resonance surface), and poly and self-reactivity (by&#xD;
                ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence). The recombinant antibody will be evaluated&#xD;
                for their ability to activate cells in vitro in the presence of antigen (QA or&#xD;
                NMBA) and as to their ability to induce anaphylactic shock in vivo, in transgenic&#xD;
                mouse models expressing human receptor for the antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of this project is to generate human recombinant anti- quaternary ammonium&#xD;
           antibodies to assess their pathological potential (anaphylactogenic).&#xD;
&#xD;
           As part of the study NASAmAbs, 1 additional 250ml pocket of blood EDTA will be collected&#xD;
           either during a consulting with the allergologist either during a visit for this&#xD;
           purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - NASA LYMPHAQ: The presence of T cells specific for drug allergens is documented in&#xD;
           allergy to penicillin, but their presence and characteristics in the immediate allergy&#xD;
           to muscle relaxants has not been described. The purpose of our ancillary study is to&#xD;
           highlight these T cell by specific activation tests, to characterize phenotypically,&#xD;
           quantify, and compare their frequency to that of healthy donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of this ancillary study is to identify T cell specific populations for&#xD;
           quaternary ammonium in patients sensitive to NMBA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research will be performed on mononuclear cells already isolated during the&#xD;
           post-shock visit as part of the NASA study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NASA Quin: In a recent study, the team of Dr. ROUZAIRE revealed a high prevalence&#xD;
                of sensitization to neuromuscular blocking drug in 17 patients allergic to&#xD;
                quinolones: 53% versus 3.4% in a control population. As with pholcodine, quinolones&#xD;
                could thus be a way of sensitization of neuromuscular blocking agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of this ancillary project is to confirm on a larger cohort, the association of&#xD;
           sensitization between these two drug classes, neuromuscular blocking agents and&#xD;
           quinolones.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As part of the study NASAQuin, no additional blood sample will be collected. The&#xD;
           research will be performed on aliquots of serum and / or plasma conserved as part of the&#xD;
           study NASA. An aliquot of 300 µl will be used for the assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NASA-CAT: Anaphylaxis can cause alone or during the administration of adrenaline,&#xD;
                heart disease. The amplitude, frequency and pathophysiology of myocardial&#xD;
                involvements are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the ancillary study &quot;NASA-CAT&quot; is to define, using established plasma&#xD;
           myocardial biomarkers , the prevalence of myocardial injury during anaphylaxis related&#xD;
           to anesthetic agents and the role of adrenaline in this injury. Adrenaline is a&#xD;
           catecholamine which is recommended to administrate intravenously in severe anaphylaxis.&#xD;
           Adrenaline allows to restore immediately blood pressure due to its vasoconstrictor&#xD;
           properties. Deleterious effects of adrenaline on coronaries and myocardium have been&#xD;
           described in acute heart failure. The existence of similar effects in anaphylaxis is not&#xD;
           known.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the study &quot;NASA-CAT&quot; is to assess myocardial involvement in anaphylaxis and&#xD;
           determine the role of adrenaline in this injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As part of the ancillary study &quot;NASA-CAT&quot;, no additional blood sample will be collected.&#xD;
           The dosing of myocardial biomarkers (troponin hypersensitive, natriuretic peptides,&#xD;
           adrenomedullin, copeptin) will be performed on samples of 500μl from serum and / or&#xD;
           plasma stored in as part of the NASA study.&#xD;
