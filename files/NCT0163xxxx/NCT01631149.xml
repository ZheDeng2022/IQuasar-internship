      Rationale: A deep neuromuscular block is often associated with improved surgical conditions&#xD;
      especially in laparoscopic surgery. However, a deep block comes at the expense of a variety&#xD;
      of items that may conflict with the use of a deep surgical muscle blockade including a long&#xD;
      recovery phase, the need for muscle reversal, postoperative ventilation, impaired&#xD;
      postoperative breathing. With the introduction of Sugammadex there is now the possibility to&#xD;
      reverse an even deep surgical block. This may overcome most if not all of the issues&#xD;
      mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess whether a deep neuromuscular block provides better surgical conditions&#xD;
      than a moderately deep block as derived from a surgical rating score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single center, double-blind randomized controlled trial. Study population: 24&#xD;
      ASA I-III patients scheduled for laparoscopic renal (n=12, GROUP 1) or prostatic surgery&#xD;
      (n=12, GROUP 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: In both GROUP 1 and GROUP 2, 6 six patients will receive neuromuscular blockade&#xD;
      according to current practice (atracurium (bolus) plus mivacurium (cont. infusion)) aimed at&#xD;
      a moderately deep neuromuscular block (1-2 twitches in the Train of Four (TOF) monitor). The&#xD;
      other six will receive a bolus plus continuous infusion with rocuronium aimed at a deep&#xD;
      neuromuscular block (1-2 twitches post tetanic count (PTC)). All surgical procedures will be&#xD;
      performed by one surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: To study the surgical conditions in patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic renal or prostate surgery during deep versus less deep neuromuscular block as&#xD;
      assessed by the surgical rating score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Compared to current practice there will be no additional risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical conditions in laparoscopic surgery are largely determined by the degree of&#xD;
      neuromuscular relaxation during surgery. Especially in procedures which are confined to a&#xD;
      narrow working field such as renal and prostatic laparoscopic surgery, deep neuromuscular&#xD;
      relaxation may be beneficial. Until recently however, deep neuromuscular block (1-2 twitches&#xD;
      post tetanic count) came at the expense of a variety of items that conflicted with its use.&#xD;
      Occurrence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade after deep neuromuscular block&#xD;
      was a common adverse event. Residual neuromuscular block is a risk factor for developing&#xD;
      airway obstruction and pulmonary complications such pneumonia and atelectasis. The use of&#xD;
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, like neostigmine, as a traditional neuromuscular blocking&#xD;
      reversal agent, have a slow onset of action. Side effects due to muscarine receptor&#xD;
      stimulation are bradycardia, hypersalivation, nausea and vomiting. Coadministration of a&#xD;
      muscarine agonist like atropine is often necessary to address the heart rate-related side&#xD;
      effects of neostigmine. Atropine, however, in itself may induce other side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid, safe and complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade was not possible until the&#xD;
      discovery of Sugammadex. Sugammadex is a modified y-cyclodextrin. It was developed to&#xD;
      selectively bind free plasma rocuronium, a non-depolarizing steroidal neuromuscular blocking&#xD;
      agent. By binding free rocuronium, less rocuronium becomes available at the neuromuscular&#xD;
      junction to bind to the muscarine receptor. Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents&#xD;
      (NMBA's) block the muscarine receptor at the neuromuscular junction, making them unavailable&#xD;
      to acetylcholine based signal transmission. Sugammadex has proven to rapidly and safely&#xD;
      reverse rocuronium and vecuronium. Even high dose rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg and continuous&#xD;
      rocuronium infusion used to achieve deep neuromuscular blockade can safely be reversed by&#xD;
      Sugammadex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretically, the availability of Sugammadex makes it possible to use deep neuromuscular&#xD;
      block (DNB) during surgery to improve surgical conditions without the occurrence of the&#xD;
      above-mentioned adverse events. The use of DNB to improve surgical conditions, however, has&#xD;
      not yet been evaluated. The investigators therefore aim to investigate the use of rocuronium&#xD;
      induced-DNB in renal and prostatic laparoscopic surgery. Current anesthesiologic practice&#xD;
      during these procedures in the LUMC consists of an intravenous (propofol) or volatile&#xD;
      (sevoflurane) anesthetic combined with mivacurium and atracurium to achieve a moderately deep&#xD;
      neuromuscular block (0-2 twitches TOF). Reversal of NMB is by the neostigmine atropine&#xD;
      combination. In the current study the investigators will assess the effect of a DNB (1-2&#xD;
      twitches post tetanic count) using a continuous rocuronium infusion on surgical conditions.&#xD;
      After surgery Sugammadex 4 mg/kg will be used to safely and rapidly reverse the neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade within 5-min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main end-point of the study is the effect of the deep block on the surgical conditions.&#xD;
      The investigators will study these conditions using two methods. (1) Assessment of the&#xD;
      surgical condition by the operating surgeon (all surgeries will be performed by one surgeon),&#xD;
      using a 5-point rating surgical rating scale from 1 (= extremely poor surgical condition) to&#xD;
      5 = optimal surgical condition. (2) Video images, used by the surgeon to perform the surgery,&#xD;
      will be rated by a team of surgical and non-surgical experts. Apart from the additional&#xD;
      scoring data, this approach allows for the validation of the surgical rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor end-points of the study are (1) measurement of hemodynamics during surgery using a&#xD;
      non-invasive cardiac output and blood pressure device. Assuming that intra-abdominal pressure&#xD;
      will affect the venous return and hence cardiac output during surgery, a deep neuromuscular&#xD;
      block might affect the hemodynamic parameters positively; (2) measurement of respiration,&#xD;
      pain, and alertness in the recovery room to assess whether reversal with Sugammadex&#xD;
      influences these parameters positively compared to neostigmine/atropine reversal.&#xD;

    <description>During the procedure, the surgical condition will be scored by the surgeon using a 5-point surgical rating scale. In order to reduce variability in the surgical rating all surgeries will be performed by one single surgeon. The rating scale will be a 5-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 = poor condition to 5 = optimal surgical conditions. The surgeon will score the condition at 15 minute intervals. In case of a sudden change in surgical conditions additional scores will be added to the case record form. If conditions are poor (score 1 or 2), muscle relaxation will be increased, a score of 1 will be used.&#xD;
In each subject the scores over time were averaged and a comparison between treatments was performed using a t-test</description>

        <title>Surgical Rating Scale</title>
        <description>During the procedure, the surgical condition will be scored by the surgeon using a 5-point surgical rating scale. In order to reduce variability in the surgical rating all surgeries will be performed by one single surgeon. The rating scale will be a 5-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 = poor condition to 5 = optimal surgical conditions. The surgeon will score the condition at 15 minute intervals. In case of a sudden change in surgical conditions additional scores will be added to the case record form. If conditions are poor (score 1 or 2), muscle relaxation will be increased, a score of 1 will be used.&#xD;
In each subject the scores over time were averaged and a comparison between treatments was performed using a t-test</description>
