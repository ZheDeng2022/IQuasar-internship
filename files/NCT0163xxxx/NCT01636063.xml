  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical abortion in the late first trimester and early second trimester is usually performed&#xD;
      with the aid of a cervical preparing agent, which helps to open up the uterine cervix for the&#xD;
      procedure. Routine use of cervical preparants is recommended by several organizations during&#xD;
      this period of pregnancy before surgical abortion, especially in younger women or those who&#xD;
      have not delivered a baby, because their cervices may be more difficult to dilate without a&#xD;
      preparant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard medication used for cervical preparation is misoprostol. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      misoprostol may cause uncomfortable uterine cramping and vaginal bleeding in patients who use&#xD;
      it. Another medication called mifepristone has been shown to dilate the cervix better than&#xD;
      misoprostol in the first trimester, but little information exists about using mifepristone in&#xD;
      the late first trimester and early second trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to perform a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate&#xD;
      if mifepristone is a better cervical preparant than misoprostol. A total of 110 participants&#xD;
      who are pregnant women desiring pregnancy termination 11 to 15 weeks gestational age will be&#xD;
      recruited. Half will receive mifepristone and the other half misoprostol. The investigators&#xD;
      will measure the amount of cervical dilation achieved right before a surgical abortion to&#xD;
      determine if mifepristone is significantly different than misoprostol as a cervical preparant&#xD;
      at this stage of pregnancy. The investigators expect that mifepristone will work better than&#xD;
      misoprostol for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to generate information about mifepristone so that women and their&#xD;
      health care providers can know more about mifepristone as an option for cervical preparation&#xD;
      before surgical abortion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will use a prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial design. As our&#xD;
      main objective is to determine whether one pharmacological method of cervical preparation is&#xD;
      more effective than the other in our population, this is the most appropriate study design. A&#xD;
      double-blinded, randomized trial will allow for the maximal prevention of bias affecting&#xD;
      study results. The study will be structured as a two-tailed comparison, as it is possible&#xD;
      that mifepristone is significantly less effective than misoprostol in effecting initial&#xD;
      cervical dilation. While previous studies have indicated that mifepristone is superior to&#xD;
      misoprostol in this regard, our study focuses on a later gestational age range. Therefore, we&#xD;
      believe that a one-tailed comparison would be inappropriate to test whether there is a&#xD;
      difference between mifepristone and misoprostol as cervical preparing agents in our&#xD;
      gestational age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll approximately 50 subjects between 11 0/7 and 15 0/7 weeks GA seeking abortion&#xD;
      and randomize them into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Group A subjects will receive mifepristone&#xD;
      200 mg capsulized orally at the time of their preoperative visit and be given two folic acid&#xD;
      tablets (misoprostol placebo) to place buccally on the day of their procedure. Group B&#xD;
      subjects will receive empty capsules (mifepristone placebo) orally at the time of their&#xD;
      preoperative visit and be given two misoprostol 200 mcg tablets to place buccally on the day&#xD;
      of their procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To preserve blinding, we will place mifepristone in capsules provided by the BMC IDS.&#xD;
      Subjects not receiving mifepristone will receive identically-appearing empty capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at Boston Medical Center's outpatient Women's Care Center.&#xD;
      Preoperative appointments will take place in the Pre-Procedure Unit (PPU) and abortion&#xD;
      appointments will take place in the Gynecology Procedures Unit (GPU). Patients seeking&#xD;
      abortion services at BMC will constitute the population that will be the source of the study&#xD;
      sample. Because we seek to investigate mifepristone and misoprostol as cervical preparants in&#xD;
      the population of women seeking abortion services, this is an appropriate population from&#xD;
      which to sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible to enroll as subjects in the investigation will be identified by&#xD;
      the clinical provider who sees them for their preoperative visit. Approximately 20 patients&#xD;
      per month seen at our clinic meet the criteria for inclusion into the study. The provider&#xD;
      will describe the study briefly to the potential subject, and if they are interested, the&#xD;
      provider will contact study staff. The staff member will describe the study in greater detail&#xD;
      and obtain informed consent to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject allocation to treatment group will be double-blind. The Boston Medical Center&#xD;
      Investigational Drug Service (IDS) will prepackage all study medications in a random order&#xD;
      and sequentially number the packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll approximately 110 subjects between 11 0/7 and 15 0/7 weeks GA seeking abortion&#xD;
      and allocate them randomly into two equal groups of subjects. Group A subjects will receive&#xD;
      capsules containing mifepristone 200 mg orally at the time of their preoperative visit and be&#xD;
      given two folic acid tablets (misoprostol placebo) to place buccally on the day of their&#xD;
      procedure. Group B subjects will receive a empty capsules (mifepristone placebo) orally at&#xD;
      the time of their preoperative visit and be given two misoprostol 200 mcg tablets to place&#xD;
      buccally on the day of their procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that the investigation will use cervical preparants in a similar&#xD;
      fashion to what is already standard practice at BMC. Mifepristone ingestion is directly&#xD;
      observed by a clinic provider, while misoprostol is dispensed at the preoperative visit for&#xD;
      the patient to place buccally herself approximately 3 hours before their abortion procedure.&#xD;
      Patients between 11 and 12 weeks GA receive 400 mcg misoprostol buccally three hours prior to&#xD;
      their procedure or no preparant, at the discretion of the surgeon. For patients between 12&#xD;
      and 14 weeks GA, 400 mcg buccal misoprostol for three hours prior to their procedure is the&#xD;
      standard preparant. Patients between 14 and 15 weeks GA have the aforementioned misoprostol&#xD;
      dosing option, and can instead also elect to receive mifepristone 200 mg orally 24 to 36&#xD;
      hours before their abortion procedure. Patients between 14 and 15 weeks GA can also elect to&#xD;
      receive osmotic dilators as the cervical preparant method. Therefore, both agents used in our&#xD;
      study are familiar to our clinicians and are already in use for patients at our facility in a&#xD;
      similar fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be given a study subject number that corresponds to a treatment group&#xD;
      assignment, which will be determined in advance by the BMC IDS in a random fashion. The&#xD;
      clinic provider and study staff member will be blinded to the assignment, as will the&#xD;
      subject. While the study is being conducted, only the BMC IDS will have access to the study&#xD;
      subject treatment assignments. The clinic provider and study staff will then observe the&#xD;
      subject take the first study agent (mifepristone or placebo). In order to preserve blinding,&#xD;
      the BMC IDS will provide indistinguishable capsules of mifepristone and empty capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then direct the patient to place the second study agent (misoprostol or placebo)&#xD;
      buccally approximately three hours before their abortion procedure. This time will correspond&#xD;
      to 6 am for morning procedures and 10 am for afternoon procedures. To preserve provider&#xD;
      blinding, the second study agent will be in an opaque package. The BMC IDS is unable to&#xD;
      provide indistinguishable versions of misoprostol and folic acid because we plan buccal use.&#xD;
      Despite this, we do not anticipate a significant threat to subject blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure abortion provider blinding, the clinic provider and study staff member who&#xD;
      enroll a subject will not be eligible to perform the subject's abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the subject's preoperative visit, the following data will be collected: Study subject&#xD;
      number; date; age; race/ethnicity; ultrasound-confirmed gestational age; gravidity; parity;&#xD;
      time of first study agent ingestion; history of prior live births; history of prior pregnancy&#xD;
      loss; history of prior elective abortion; history of cervical dysplasia treatment procedures&#xD;
      (cold knife cone, LEEP, cryotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A checklist of the aforementioned exclusion criteria will be present on the preoperative data&#xD;
      sheet to prevent enrollment of subjects who meet these criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One follow-up visit will be planned for all subjects: their abortion procedure appointment,&#xD;
      which will occur 24 to 48 hours after their ingestion of the first study agent. At this&#xD;
      encounter, all of the outcome variables will be measured and collected for data analysis.&#xD;
      Once the subject arrives to the GPU, a study staff member will confirm and record the time of&#xD;
      buccal placement of the second study agent. The subject will then undergo the routine intake&#xD;
      process of all abortion patients in the GPU, which includes a preoperative safety screening&#xD;
      by a registered nurse. After the intake process, the patient will undergo their abortion&#xD;
      procedure no sooner than three hours after the buccal placement of the second study agent.&#xD;
      For procedural anesthesia and analgesia, patients receiving care in the GPU have two choices.&#xD;
      They may choose to receive IV conscious sedation, consisting of midazolam and fentanyl in&#xD;
      addition to lidocaine paracervical block. The alternative is IM ketorolac and lidocaine&#xD;
      paracervical block. Study participants will be afforded the same choice as other abortion&#xD;
      patients. The abortion will then be performed, including assessment of initial cervical&#xD;
      dilation, which is described below. The subject will then remain in the GPU recovery area&#xD;
      until she meets criteria for discharge, consistent with guidelines in place for all patients&#xD;
      receiving care in the GPU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure initial cervical dilation, Pratt mechanical dilators will be used. Starting with a&#xD;
      43F Pratt dilator, attempts will be made to pass sequentially smaller diameter dilators until&#xD;
      a dilator passes without resistance. The size of the largest dilator to pass without&#xD;
      resistance will be recorded as the initial cervical dilation value. Using dilators from&#xD;
      largest to smallest will avoid causing dilation during measurement of initial cervical&#xD;
      dilation. This method of measuring initial cervical dilation has been described in published&#xD;
      studies, including by Goldberg, et al. (19) Physicians who perform abortions for patients&#xD;
      within the study will be trained to conduct the measurement of initial cervical dilation in a&#xD;
      standard fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All abortions will be performed by attending OB-GYN physicians and family planning fellows to&#xD;
      limit confounding due to provider inexperience on the part of residents and medical students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data to be collected will include the date and time of buccal placement of the second&#xD;
      study agent; subject's experience of preoperative vaginal bleeding, nausea, vomiting or&#xD;
      diarrhea; preoperative pain score; anesthesia/analgesia agents used and doses used; initial&#xD;
      cervical dilation; the amount of additional dilation needed to perform the procedure;&#xD;
      intraoperative pain score; duration of procedure (speculum in to speculum out time);&#xD;
      postoperative pain score; patient satisfaction; and provider rating of difficulty of&#xD;
      procedure. Complications, if any, of the procedure will also be noted.&#xD;
