  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is learn if adding cabozantinib (also known as&#xD;
      XL184) to hormonal therapy can help to control prostate cancer. The safety of this drug will&#xD;
      also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cabozantinib is designed to block certain proteins in your blood that cause cancer cells to&#xD;
      grow. This may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take 1 capsule of&#xD;
      cabozantinib by mouth 1 time every day while you are on study. You should not eat or drink&#xD;
      anything other than water for 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking the study drug. You&#xD;
      should take the capsule with at least 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. You will also be given&#xD;
      separate directions about how to take the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also receive hormone therapy. The hormone drug you receive will be standard of care&#xD;
      hormone therapy. The study doctor will decide what hormone therapy you will receive and will&#xD;
      explain when and how you should take the hormone therapy, as well as its risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a drug diary where you will record when you take cabozantinib. You should&#xD;
      return this diary to the study staff when you come into the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every visit, you will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any other drugs&#xD;
      you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are receiving Coumadin, every week for the first 3 weeks, you will have blood drawn&#xD;
      (about 1 teaspoon) to test your blood clotting function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 weeks for the first 12 weeks of the study, and then every 6 weeks after that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 weeks for the first 12 weeks of the study, and then every 12 weeks after that, blood&#xD;
      (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your thyroid and pancreatic function. The frequency&#xD;
      of the testing may change if the study doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks, you will have the following tests performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn to measure your PSA levels and for biomarker&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may have these test performed near your home if the study doctor thinks you are&#xD;
           tolerating the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 12 weeks, you will have a bone scan and CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to&#xD;
      check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue receiving the study drug for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      your best interest. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if you have&#xD;
      intolerable side effects, or if your study doctor thinks it is in your best interest to stop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be contacted every 6 months after you stop taking the study drug to check on how you&#xD;
      are feeling and the status of the disease. This will consist of a phone call, e-mail, or&#xD;
      medical record review. If you are called, each call should last about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Cabozantinib is FDA approved to treat patients with certain&#xD;
      types of thyroid cancer. Its use in this study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Sexually active fertile subjects, and their partners, must agree to use medically&#xD;
             accepted methods of contraception (eg, barrier methods, including male condom, female&#xD;
             condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the course of the study and for 4&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Biological agents (antibodies, immune modulators, cytokines, or vaccines) or&#xD;
             radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis or epidural disease requiring current&#xD;
             treatment including steroids and anti-convulsant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has had another diagnosis of malignancy requiring systemic treatment&#xD;
             within the last two years, unless non-melanoma skin cancer, or superficial bladder&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has uncontrolled or significant intercurrent illness including, but not&#xD;
             limited to, the following conditions: Chronically uncontrolled hypertension, defined&#xD;
             conventionally as consistent and repeated systolic pressures above 140 mmHg or&#xD;
             diastolic pressures above 90 mmHg despite anti-hypertensive therapy. This may be&#xD;
             better established with home BP readings than with clinic visit results. There is no&#xD;
             criterion related to a specific BP result required for eligibility, nor are acute BP&#xD;
             elevations that are related to iatrogenic causes, acute pain, or other transient&#xD;
             reversible causes considered to be an exclusion criteria. The intent is to exclude&#xD;
             patients with chronically uncontrolled hypertension that might be further exacerbated&#xD;

             thrombosis or occlusion. ;Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders particularly those&#xD;
             associated with a high risk of perforation or fistula formation including: Any of the&#xD;

             ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, cholecystitis, symptomatic&#xD;
             cholangitis or appendicitis&#xD;

             study treatment: a) history of abdominal fistula b) gastrointestinal perforation c)&#xD;
             bowel obstruction or gastric outlet obstruction; d) intra-abdominal abscess. Note:&#xD;
             Complete resolution of an intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed prior to&#xD;
             initiating treatment with cabozantinib even if the abscess occurred more that 6 months&#xD;
             ago. GI surgery (particularly when associated with delayed or incomplete healing)&#xD;
             within 28 days. Note: Complete healing following abdominal surgery must be confirmed&#xD;

             days ago. Other disorders associated with a high risk of fistula formation including&#xD;
             PEG tube placement within 3 months before the first dose of study therapy or&#xD;
             concurrent evidence of intraluminal tumor involving the trachea and esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject is unable to swallow capsules tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject has a previously-identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of&#xD;
             the study treatment formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Oral corticosteroids &gt;/= 7.5mg/day prednisone (or prednisone equivalents).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Prior treatment with cabozantinib.&#xD;
