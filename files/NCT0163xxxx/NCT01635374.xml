    <textblock>
      Achalasia is an esophageal motility disease that usually requires surgical intervention&#xD;
      (esophagomyotomy). Laparoscopic techniques have reduced the morbidity associated with&#xD;
      myotomy, but post-op GERD, wound infection, hernia and incisional pain are common. A new&#xD;
      NOTES based procedure, per-oral endoscopic esophagomyotomy (POEM), has been developed that&#xD;
      eliminates the need for skin incisions. All patients enrolled in this study, will have a&#xD;
      thorough pre-op workup (including upper endoscopy, upper GI radiographs, high resolution&#xD;
      esophageal manometry) confirming the diagnosis of achalasis at the Northwestern Esophageal&#xD;
      Center. In this procedure, performed in the operating room under general anesthesia, a&#xD;
      flexible endoscope is passed into the esophagus, a mucosal flap and a submucosal tunnel is&#xD;
      created. This tunnel extends onto the stomach. The inner circular muscle layer of the lower&#xD;
      esophagus and sphincter (LES) is identified and a myotomy is started 3-4cm distal to the&#xD;
      mucosal flap and carried all the way onto the stomach. The mucosal opening is then closed&#xD;
      with standard endoscopic clips. Patients will be admitted to the hospital and a gastrograffin&#xD;
      esophagram will be performed on post-op day 1 to rule out esophageal leak. All patient will&#xD;
      have a 2-3 week post-op appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of achalasia may be offered POEM. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that POEM is feasible and safe and can effectively reduce residual LES pressure&#xD;
      (as determined by manometry) and improve patients symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to use a surgical technique that eliminates skin&#xD;
      incisions in patients undergoing esophagomyotomy. All patients will have a standard&#xD;
      pre-operative esophageal work-up that may include upper endoscopy (EGD), endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (EUS), upper GI X-rays, high-resolution manometry, pH, FLIP and impedance&#xD;
      measurement studies. Once the diagnosis of achalasia is confirmed, patients will be offered&#xD;
      POEM or standard treatment for achalasia. All patients undergoing POEM will review and sign&#xD;
      the study consent prior to their procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative and recovery room times as well as hospital length of stay will be collected.&#xD;
      During the hospital stay, severity of pain, use of pain medications and complications will be&#xD;
      recorded. Patients will remain NPO for 1 day. Post-op day 1, all patient will receive an&#xD;
      esophagram to rule out esophageal perforation. If normal, patients will be started on clear&#xD;
      liquids and advanced to a full liquid diet for 1 week post-op.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return and be evaluated by their surgeon two weeks following their procedure.&#xD;
      At this visit, any post-operative complications will be noted in the patient's medical&#xD;
      record. Additionally at this visit and at the preoperative visit, patients will complete a&#xD;
      standardized Quality of Life (QOL) assessment (i.e., SF-36). Perceived pain levels and type&#xD;
      and frequency of pain medications will be recorded in the patient's medical record. Patients&#xD;
      will then return at 6 weeks post-op to complete a second set of questionnaires and have a&#xD;
      high resolution manometry performed to assess residual LES pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential advantages to the patients entered into this study include those mentioned&#xD;
      above regarding elimination of post-operative wound infection and hernia but also the lack of&#xD;
      abdominal incisions may reduce pain and recovery time and likely have a cosmetic advantage as&#xD;
      well. Potential risks of this study include those associated with use of flexible endoscopic&#xD;
      instruments include esophageal perforation, bleeding and sore throat. In addition, there is&#xD;
      the possibility that there may be new, unanticipated complications from this modified&#xD;
      surgical technique. Patient risks will be mitigated by having the procedure performed by a&#xD;
      surgeon with expertise in laparoscopic esophageal surgery, flexible endoscopy and NOTES, as&#xD;
      well as having involvement of a skilled interventional gastroenterologist if deemed&#xD;
      necessary. The principle investigator (who will be the primary surgeon for all procedures)&#xD;
      has performed multiple pre-clinical animal and cadaver POEM procedures and has traveled to&#xD;
      Yokohama, Japan to observe human POEM cases performed by Dr. Haru Inoue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will initially evaluate the potential benefit, risks and impact on the&#xD;
      patient's quality of life of this modified surgical technique in 20 patients. Once a&#xD;
      standardized technique is established and risks are shown to be low, a prospective&#xD;
      comparative evaluation is planned to compare this modified technique to the standard&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach.&#xD;
