    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure and cardiomyopathy that have been referred for Cardiac&#xD;
      Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) will have their CRT devices implanted using an image guided&#xD;
      treatment plan for optimal lead delivery. The validation of image-guided CRT lead delivery&#xD;
      will significantly advance the field of heart failure therapy.&#xD;

      Objective 1: Using established study data from our previous study (Multimodality imaging&#xD;
      Assessment of Pacing InTervention in Heart Failure Heart Failure or MAPIT HF) define&#xD;
      characteristics of the &quot;optimal myocardial target&quot; that maximally yields clinical response to&#xD;
      CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Using established MAPIT-HF study data identify whether alternate coronary venous&#xD;
      pathways to &quot;optimal myocardial targets&quot; exists in clinical non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Evaluate the feasibility of guiding the delivery of CRT leads to &quot;optimal&#xD;
      myocardial targets&quot; through the use of an interactive, 3D &quot;integrated cardiac model&quot; of&#xD;
      coronary vein anatomy, myocardial scar and mechanical dyssynchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no standard definition for response to CRT. Of importance is that measures&#xD;
      of clinical response appear to be incongruent with echocardiographic parameters of reverse&#xD;
      remodeling following CRT. The primary endpoint of clinical response will be an improvement in&#xD;
      Left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) by ≥ 15% at 3 months following CRT, as validated&#xD;
      in prior studies. Secondary clinical endpoints will also be evaluated; 1) Improvement in&#xD;
      ejection fraction ≥ 5 percentage points, 2) Improvement in 6-minute hall walk ≥ 30 meters or&#xD;
      ≥ 10%, 3) Improvement in NYHA (New York Heart Association) functional class by 1, or Specific&#xD;
      Activity Score by 1, and 4) Improvement in Quality of Life (Minnesota Living with Heart&#xD;
      Failure) by 10 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that a single 3D dataset can be developed from multiple MRI datasets for&#xD;
      the simultaneous display of coronary venous anatomy, myocardial scar, and mechanical&#xD;
      dyssynchrony, the latter being derived from tagged MRI data. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the availability of this 3D model during fluoroscopic CRT lead placement will result in&#xD;
      improved rates of lead tip delivery to &quot;optimal myocardial targets&quot; and improved clinical&#xD;
      response. Our specific hypotheses of Project 2 are as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The generation of an integrated cardiac model of venous anatomy, myocardial scar and&#xD;
           dyssynchrony is feasible using multiple MRI-derived datasets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The availability of this interactive 3D cardiac model during fluoroscopic CRT lead&#xD;
           delivery will increase the occurrence of CRT lead tips being delivered to &quot;optimal&#xD;
           myocardial segments&quot; when compared to historic control data within the MAPIT-HF study&#xD;
           cohort.&#xD;
