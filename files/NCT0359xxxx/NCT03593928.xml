  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different plaque morphology may have an important effect on the prognosis of acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (AMI), as recent studies show that patients with plaque rupture have a&#xD;
      significantly higher risk of cardiac events compared with those with plaque erosion. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of this study is to find risk factors and biomarkers for different culprit&#xD;
      lesion morphology to perform accurate risk stratification and determine an appropriate&#xD;
      treatment strategy for patients with AMI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which results from coronary artery occlusion due to&#xD;
      thrombosis, remains the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Pathological studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated that plaque rupture accompanied by subsequent thrombus formation is the&#xD;
      main mechanism responsible for AMI, accounting for approximately two thirds of cases; the&#xD;
      remaining approximately one third of cases are the result of plaque erosion. Moreover,&#xD;
      previous studies showed that the risk of cardiovascular events is significantly higher in&#xD;
      patients with plaque rupture compared to those with plaque erosion. The EROSION study&#xD;
      suggested that in patients with acute coronary syndrome presenting with plaque erosion,&#xD;
      conservative treatment with anti-thrombotic therapy may be a reasonable option instead of&#xD;
      stents implantation. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between the culprit&#xD;
      morphologies in order to perform an accurate risk stratification and determine a personalized&#xD;
      treatment strategy with the goal to improve the prognosis of patients with AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a newly developed high resolution near infrared&#xD;
      light-based intravascular imaging modality, can visualize the microstructure of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques such as the fibrotic cap, lipid pool, thrombi, and so on, and has&#xD;
      been considered as the golden standard for differentiating plaque morphology in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aimed to find risk factors and biomarkers for culprit lesion morphology as&#xD;
      assessed by OCT.&#xD;
