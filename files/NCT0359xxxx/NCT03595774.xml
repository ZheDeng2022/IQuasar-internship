  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitrate is a naturally-occurring substance found in foods, especially green leafy vegetables&#xD;
      and beets. Increasing nitrate intake (by drinking beetroot juice (BRJ) has been shown to&#xD;
      improve muscle function young and middle-aged subjects, athletes, and patients with heart&#xD;
      failure. The purpose of this study is to determine whether dietary nitrate provides a similar&#xD;
      benefit in older individuals, and if so, the optimal dose. We will be comparing the effects&#xD;
      of ingesting BRJ containing a smaller or greater amount of nitrate versus the effects of a&#xD;
      placebo (BRJ from which the nitrate has been removed).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of four visits that will take a minimum of 15 days to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit One (Screening) 1-2 hours The purpose of the screening visit is to explain all&#xD;
      aspects of the study. The investigators will also determine if individuals can participate in&#xD;
      the study. Eligible subjects will undergo a complete medical history and physical exam. They&#xD;
      will have their blood drawn, and will provide a urine sample (to determine if they are&#xD;
      pregnant). Subjects will also practice the entire neuromuscular function exercise test.&#xD;
      During this test, the strength of the subject's muscles will be determined by having them&#xD;
      kick, push and/or pull back as hard as they can while their leg is strapped to an exercise&#xD;
      device. Blood pressure and heart rate and rhythm will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to consume their normal diet throughout the study. However, they&#xD;
      will be asked to avoid eating foods high in nitrate such as beets, spinach, and collard&#xD;
      greens the evening before each visit. They will be asked to refrain from the use of&#xD;
      antibacterial mouthwash, such as Listerine or Cepacol, during the study. Subjects will also&#xD;
      be asked to not chew gum or to consume alcohol or food and drinks that contain caffeine for&#xD;
      24 hour before each visit. This includes coffee, tea, chocolate and soft drinks such as&#xD;
      Mountain Dew. Finally, they will be asked to fast for 12 hour prior to each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Two - Approximately 5 hours At the beginning of this visit a catheter (small,&#xD;
      flexible, sterile plastic tube) will be placed through a vein in one of the subject's arms.&#xD;
      This is for collection of blood samples. Blood will be drawn four times during this visit.&#xD;
      Each draw will be 6mL or about 1.2 teaspoons. The first blood draw will check nitrate and&#xD;
      nitrogen levels. Subjects will then have a breath test to check nitric oxide. They will then&#xD;
      drink about 280 mL (about 1 cup) of BRJ. In one trial, this will be a placebo, that is, BRJ&#xD;
      from which the essentially all of the nitrate has been removed. In another trial, they will&#xD;
      drink BRJ still containing nitrate. In a third trial, they will drink an equal mixture of the&#xD;
      placebo and nitrate-containing BRJ. Blood and breath samples will be obtained every hour.&#xD;
      Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured at the same times the blood and breath samples&#xD;
      are obtained. About 2 hours after ingestion of BRJ (or placebo) subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      perform the neuromuscular function test that was practiced during the screening visit. After&#xD;
      completing the exercise test one final blood and breath sample will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits Three and Four&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedures completed during Study Visit Two will be performed. The order of&#xD;
      treatment (placebo vs. lower dose vs. higher dose of nitrate) will be randomized using a&#xD;
      computer program. Neither the subjects nor the investigators will know the treatment they&#xD;
      receive during each visit until the entire study is completed.&#xD;
