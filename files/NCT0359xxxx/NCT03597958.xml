  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific aims of the project are to understand the genetic basis of Familial&#xD;
      Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) in the Emirati population and estimate the overall prevalence of&#xD;
      the disease. In addition, a clinical aim of the project is to explore the effectiveness of&#xD;
      screening the relatives of individuals affected by FH and other lipid disorders (&quot;cascade&quot;&#xD;
      screening) within Emirati families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Familial Hypercholesterolaemia is an inherited genetic disorder which causes elevated levels&#xD;
      of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. High LDL is a risk factor for with&#xD;
      arterial disease and people with FH develop coronary artery disease (CAD) early in life.&#xD;
      People with only one inherited copy of the defective gene usually develop CAD before the age&#xD;
      of 60, whereas individuals who have inherited two copies usually die before the age of 30&#xD;
      from myocardial infarction (&quot;heart attack&quot;) or sudden cardiac death. Coronary artery disease&#xD;
      is a major cause of death and disability in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the medical&#xD;
      costs associated with treating this condition are significant. Early identification and&#xD;
      treatment of affected individuals can substantially postpone the onset of arterial disease&#xD;
      and reduce the risk of mortality. In clinical practice, FH cases are usually identified by&#xD;
      screening the relatives of people known to be affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current study will focus on identifying individuals with high risk score for FH, based on the&#xD;
      available medical records and laboratory information system (LIS). Furthermore, patients with&#xD;
      history of premature ischaemic vascular disease and/or high readings for LDL-C will be&#xD;
      approached and asked to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying individuals with likelihood of FH diagnosis and confirming FH by genetic&#xD;
           testing (applying Next Generation Sequencing NGS technology to analyse the genes already&#xD;
           known and/or suspected to cause FH).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying novel FH genes and mutations in the Emirati population by performing whole&#xD;
           exome and whole genome sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validating positive genetic test results by performing mutational analysis on parental&#xD;
           samples (if available)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Introducing cascade screening on a clinical basis in order to identify affected&#xD;
           relatives of those index individuals with a clinical diagnosis of FH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining the prevalence of FH in the UAE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining the short and the long-term clinical outcomes of FH in the UAE&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the cascade screening will provide additional clinical benefit to study&#xD;
      participants and their families in terms of early identification and treatment where&#xD;
      diagnosis could otherwise be missed. Early recognition and treatment in individuals with FH&#xD;
      has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality of affected individuals. The information&#xD;
      gathered during this project will help introduce a cost-effective method for identifying&#xD;
      people with dyslipidaemias and provide early intervention and management.&#xD;

Individuals with a high probability of disease according to the Dutch Lipid Network Criteria, score of ≥6 points, will be identified as possible probands (individual serving as our starting point for the genetic study of the family) and will be selected for further screening.&#xD;
Patients will be tested for known and/or suspected FH genes, using next generation sequencing (NGS) panel, whole exome and/or whole genome sequencing (WES/WGS) in cases where FH is highly suspected despite negative results from panel testing, and transcriptomic analysis of RNA blood samples.</description>
