  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of parotid sparing in reducing&#xD;
      measurable xerostomia (dry mouth) in patients undergoing whole brain radiotherapy. This is&#xD;
      primarily a two-arm, single-blind, randomized study of parotid sparing whole brain radiation&#xD;
      therapy (WBRT), with a third observational arm of patients who were identified after&#xD;
      radiation had already started or who refused randomization but were willing to be followed&#xD;
      for quality of life assessment. Qualifying patients who are interested in participating in&#xD;
      the trial will be asked to complete an anonymous screening baseline xerostomia questionnaire.&#xD;
      If their raw score on this questionnaire meets eligibility criteria, they will be offered&#xD;
      enrollment on the study. Patients identified prior to radiation start will be offered&#xD;
      enrollment into the interventional randomization arm, with the observation arm offered to&#xD;
      those who refuse randomization. Patients identified after radiation has already started, but&#xD;
      within 5 days of the first day of radiation, will be offered enrollment into the&#xD;
      observational arm. Questionnaires completed by patients who consent to the trial will be&#xD;
      assigned patient information (de-anonymized) and serve as their baseline quality of life&#xD;
      data. After baseline assessment, subjects will be asked to complete the same questionnaire&#xD;
      again at the end of treatment, as well as two weeks, one month, three months, and six months&#xD;
      after treatment completion.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients to be treated with WBRT using 3-dimensional conformal RT in 10-15 fractions&#xD;
             to a total dose of 30-35 Gy for any diagnosis other than elective treatment of&#xD;
             potentially subclinical intracranial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior radiation that would have exposed the parotids to a significant level of&#xD;
             radiation (estimated &gt;10 Gy mean parotid dose). Patients receiving prior stereotactic&#xD;
             radiosurgery for brain metastasis are eligible for inclusion in this trial as this&#xD;
             form of radiation is highly conformal and exposes the parotids to minimal (estimated&#xD;
             &lt;1 Gy) radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients enrolling on the observational arm may have started their current course&#xD;
                  of whole brain radiation therapy within 5 days prior to completing the baseline&#xD;
                  screening questionnaire and consenting to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age (no upper age limit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Raw xerostomia score &lt; 40 / 80 on the initial screening xerostomia questionnaire. This&#xD;
             is calculated by adding up the values from questions 1-8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initial xerostomia questionnaire and informed consent obtained within the required&#xD;
             time frame (≤ 30 days before RT start for interventional arm; ≤ 5 days after RT start&#xD;
             for observational arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving WBRT without the use of a CT- or MRI-based planning simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving WBRT with the use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient receiving WBRT as elective treatment of potentially subclinical intracranial&#xD;
             disease (e.g., WBRT for prophylactic cranial irradiation of small cell lung cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients physically unable to communicate by paper or phone to complete the study&#xD;
             survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant patients.&#xD;
