      Scientific background ( Statement of the problem) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child abuse continues to be a serious social problem amongst all cultural and socio-economic&#xD;
      groups that causing physical and emotional trauma to children and can even lead to death.&#xD;
      Child abuse or child maltreatment is physical, sexual or psychological maltreatment or&#xD;
      neglect of a child, especially by a parent or caregiver. The term child abuse and child&#xD;
      maltreatment are used interchangeably ( WHO,2002 ) . Although the Egyptian child law no.12 of&#xD;
      1996 saves the right of the child to life, survival, and development in a supportive family&#xD;
      environment and to be protected from all forms of violence, or injury, or physical, mental or&#xD;
      sexual abuse Egyptian children facing different types of abuse (UNICEF Egypt,2014) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentists are in the most favourable position to recognise child abuse , because 50-75 % of&#xD;
      reported lesions involve the mouth region, the face and the neck but many dentists fail to&#xD;
      report suspected cases of abuse ( Bodrumlu et al.,2016 and Kaur et al.,2017 ) . The quality&#xD;
      of dental education could be one crucial factor that may contribute to an increase in the&#xD;
      detection and the reporting of child maltreatment by dental care providers and students&#xD;
      (Malpani et al. ,2017) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for carrying out this study As there is no sufficient data about Egyptian dental&#xD;
      students's knowledge and attitude in regard to child physical abuse , so the aim of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes and educational experiences of a group of&#xD;
      Egyptian dental students regarding child physical abuse .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to the practitioners&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase the awareness of dental students about child abuse and their role in child&#xD;
           protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discovering the main reasons for not reporting suspicion of child abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge about physical signs of abuse will help dental students in detecting child&#xD;
           abuse cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to the patient and population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase the knowledge and awareness of all health care providers toward child abuse&#xD;
           will help in detection of child abuse cases and child protection .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asking the parents or care giver about the physical signs that may indicate child abuse&#xD;
           will make them fear from reporting and stop their act.&#xD;

      Review of literature Databases and websites as PubMed, Google scholar were searched for&#xD;
      relevant literature until October 2017 with key words &quot;Child abuse, Child maltreatment,&#xD;
      Physical child abuse, Violence against children, Dental students &quot; .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thomas et al., 2006 conducted a study to explore dental and dental hygiene students'&#xD;
      educational experiences and knowledge toward child abuse. Data were collected by 233 dental&#xD;
      (116 male/117 female) and 76 female dental hygiene students at the University of Michigan&#xD;
      through a self -administrated questionnaire. The results showed that 94.7 %of the dental&#xD;
      hygiene and 70.5 % of the dental students reported having learned about child abuse in&#xD;
      classroom settings, and 15.8 %of the dental hygiene and 29.3 % of the dental students&#xD;
      reported having learned about it in clinical settings .Only 5.5% of the dental and 16.7 %of&#xD;
      the dental hygiene students defined child abuse correctly; 32.2 %of the dental and 13.2 %of&#xD;
      the dental hygiene students did not know their legal responsibility concerning reporting&#xD;
      child abuse and 82.4% of the dental and 78.9% of the dental hygiene students did not know&#xD;
      where to report child abuse. Dental and dental hygiene curricula should be improved to ensure&#xD;
      that students are well prepared for their role in child protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Al-Jundi et al., 2010 conducted a study to assess eductional experiences ,attitude and&#xD;
      knowledge of Jordanian dental students toward child physical abuse. Data were collected&#xD;
      through a self-administered questionnaire completed by 441 undergraduate and postgraduate&#xD;
      dental students in both dental schools in Jordan. study indicated that both undergraduate and&#xD;
      postgraduate dental students are not sufficiently prepared to undergo their role in&#xD;
      protection of children from abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jordan et al., 2012 conducted a study to assess the educational experiences and knowledge of&#xD;
      a group of Croatian dental students regarding child abuse and neglect. Questionnaires were&#xD;
      completed by 544 students (153 male &amp;391 female) from all six years at the University of&#xD;
      Zagreb School of Dental Medicine with a response rate of 74.9%. The results indicate lack of&#xD;
      knowledge of the signs of physical and sexual abuse of children. Students from more senior&#xD;
      teaching years have a greater amount of knowledge related to child abuse and neglect compared&#xD;
      to students from more junior teaching years. In conclusion, dental students should be better&#xD;
      educated and prepared for their important role in protecting children from abuse .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hashim et al., 2013 conducted a study to assess educational experience, attitudes and&#xD;
      knowledge toward child physical abuse among a group of dental students in United Arab&#xD;
      Emirates. a self-administered structured questionnaire completed by 578 under graduate dental&#xD;
      students ,The results indicated that there was lack of knowledge of reporting procedure,&#xD;
      signs of physical abuse and social indicators among all participants. Over 80 % of the&#xD;
      students agreed that dentists should report abuse cases and 94.3 % of the participants&#xD;
      believed they had an ethical duty to report child abuse. Most students indicated that their&#xD;
      dental school was the main source of information on child physical abuse. The majority of the&#xD;
      respondents expressed a need for further training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hazar Bodrumlu et al., 2016 conducted a study to assess dental students' knowledge and&#xD;
      attitudes towards child abuse at the Faculty of Dentistry of the Ondokuz Mayis University.&#xD;
      The data were collected through a self-report questionnaire administered completed by dental&#xD;
      students (137 female/111 male) in three different dental classes (third, fourth and fifth&#xD;
      study years) with 100 % response rate. About 67.74% of the third year, 40.71% of the fourth&#xD;
      year and 16.67% of the fifth year believed that they could detect child abuse cases. However,&#xD;
      there is a lack of knowledge of social indicators, signs of physical abuse and reporting&#xD;
      procedure amongst all participants. The assessment of the total correct answers indicate&#xD;
      significant differences amongst third-, fourth- and fifth-year students' answers. Fifth-year&#xD;
      students had the highest rate of correct responses (P &lt; 0.05). Most students wanted to&#xD;
      receive more knowledge about child abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
