    <textblock>
      Provision of high and early fat intake may help to reduce the amount of postnatal weight loss&#xD;
      in Very Low Birth Weight Infants. It may also help utilize the high amount of protein that is&#xD;
      currently recommended to these premature babies. Also, we expect babies who get this&#xD;
      appropriate intake to regain their birth weight earlier than others who are on slow fat&#xD;
      increase regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recommendation of the Pediatric Societies of North America and Europe is that postnatal&#xD;
      growth of preterm infants matches the in-utero growth rates of fetuses that remain in utero&#xD;
      until full-term. Despite this long-standing recommendation, approximately 43% to 97% of very&#xD;
      low birth weight (VLBW, less than 1500 g) infants grow slower than the estimated fetal growth&#xD;
      velocity. This slow postnatal growth usually results in extra-uterine growth restriction&#xD;
      (EUGR), defined as having a measured growth parameter (weight, length, or head circumference)&#xD;
      that is less than 10th percentile of intrauterine growth expectation based on estimated&#xD;
      postmenstrual age (PMA) in premature neonates at the time of hospital discharge.4 EUGR is&#xD;
      associated with major morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity (ROP) and impaired neurodevelopment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the etiology of EUGR is multifactorial, inadequate nutrition plays a pivotal role.&#xD;
      There are three critical stages of nutrition support in VLBW infants: (1) acute stage during&#xD;
      the first 1-3 weeks after birth when infants are on parenteral nutrition, (2) intermediate&#xD;
      period when infants are slowly advanced to full enteral nutrition (growing care stage), and&#xD;
      (3) the post-discharge stage. Failure to provide adequate nutrition in the acute stage result&#xD;
      in cumulative energy and protein deficits that is difficult to reverse in the second stage.&#xD;
      Inadequate early postnatal nutrition results in excessive weight loss that cannot be&#xD;
      explained by the physiologic contraction of body water alone. The regain of birth weight may&#xD;
      need two to three weeks or even longer in preterm infants with excessive postnatal weight&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborn infants born at term normally lose 5-10% of their body weight in the first week of&#xD;
      life due to contraction of extracellular water compartment. The proportion of weight loss is&#xD;
      significantly higher in VLBW infants. Increased insensible water loss is widely considered as&#xD;
      the main cause for additional weight loss in this population. Nevertheless, studies&#xD;
      identified low energy intake to be a key driver to excessive weight loss. In fact, an earlier&#xD;
      study showed that significant postnatal weight loss occurs mainly in infants whose energy&#xD;
      intake is inadequate. A more recent epidemiologic study demonstrated similar postnatal growth&#xD;
      trajectories with a minimal crossing of percentiles after the initial weight loss regardless&#xD;
      of gestational age at birth. The growth trajectories for infants in that study had similar&#xD;
      slopes and growth rates which indicate that proportion of postnatal weight loss is a lead&#xD;
      cause for EUGR at discharge. Therefore, we speculate that decreasing the maximum percentage&#xD;
      of initial weight loss in the acute stage would keep the preterm infant on a higher growth&#xD;
      trajectory that is enough to reduce the incidence of EUGR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current fat provision regimen for preterm infants include starting parenteral lipid at 12-24&#xD;
      hours of age with 0.5-1 g/kg per day and advancing by 0.5 g/kg/day until reaching 3 g/kg per&#xD;
      day. Using early (within one hour of birth) and higher (start at 2 g/kg per day and advance&#xD;
      to 3g/kg per day once total fluid intake is increased to 80 ml/kg/day) parenteral fat intake&#xD;
      could reduce the cumulative caloric deficit in the acute stage. Because of high-density&#xD;
      energy in fat, higher parenteral fat intake will reduce the early energy deficit and enhance&#xD;
      protein accretion. The first 2-3 weeks of life offer a critical window to limit postnatal&#xD;
      nutritional and energy deficits. Recent study showed that higher energy and fat intakes&#xD;
      during the first 2 weeks after birth are associated with a lower incidence of brain lesions&#xD;
      and dysmaturation at term equivalent age in preterm neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, studies of &quot;early aggressive nutrition&quot; in preterm infants have mainly focused on&#xD;
      high protein intake to prevent protein catabolism. Nevertheless, provision of high protein&#xD;
      intake without enough energy is unlikely to significantly reduce the early loss of protein&#xD;
      and fat mass that had been accreted before birth.&#xD;
