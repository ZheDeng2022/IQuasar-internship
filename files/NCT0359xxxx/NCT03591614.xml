  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the safety and preliminary efficacy of a dendritic cell&#xD;
      DKK1 vaccine against myeloma. Dendritic cells are immune cells that are collected from the&#xD;
      blood of the patient at Case Western Reserve Medical Center and then brought into contact&#xD;
      with DKK1, a molecule that is present of myeloma cells but not to a significant amount on&#xD;
      other cells except for the prostate and the placenta. It is an investigational (experimental)&#xD;
      vaccine that based on studies in the laboratory and in mice is expected to work by&#xD;
      presentation of DKK1 to anticancer immune cells via dendritic cells leading to an immune&#xD;
      attack on myeloma cells. It is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this pilot study is to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of a dendritic cell DKK1 vaccine in view of possible future use as a strategy to prevent&#xD;
      progression of asymptomatic plasma cell disorders, maintain disease control, and ultimately&#xD;
      contribute to eradication of multiple myeloma, light and heavy chain amyloidosis,&#xD;
      immunoglobulin deposition disease, and other malignant and non-malignant diseases related to&#xD;
      transformed plasma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective Confirm the safety of dendritic cell DKK1 vaccine given every two weeks for&#xD;
      three doses in patients with monoclonal gammopathy, stable or smoldering myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess response according to international response criteria (&gt; partial response, PR)&#xD;
           and clinical benefit response (&gt;minor response, MR, according to adapted EBMT criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine time to progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Describe progression-free and overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore correlation between myeloma DKK1 and PDL-1 expression and response&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine cellular immune response&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess serologic anti-DKK1 antibody response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design including dose escalation / cohorts Pilot study with 3 patient safety run-in,&#xD;
      possible dose level -1 (DL-1) if dose limiting toxicity occurs in one or more patients at the&#xD;
      target dose level, and, at the first dose level where no dose limiting toxicity occurs,&#xD;
      extension by 12 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLT will be defined as any vaccine related toxicity &gt; grade 3 that does not resolve to grade&#xD;
      &lt; 2 within 7 days. If any DLT occurs at DL-1 enrollment will be stopped and an amendment will&#xD;
      be discussed.&#xD;

             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with childbearing potential (last menstrual period within less than 24 months&#xD;
             unless hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy has been performed since) as well as&#xD;
             pregnant women are excluded from this study because DKK1 is expressed in placental&#xD;
             tissue and a DKK1 immune response could harm the child. Breastfeeding women are&#xD;
             excluded from this study because antibodies made in response to the dendritic cell&#xD;
             DKK1 vaccine could enter milk and affect the health of the breastfed child.&#xD;
