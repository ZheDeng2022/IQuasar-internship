  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposed pilot study is to extend the KKC Heroes Circle program to people&#xD;
      with opioid use disorder (OUD) who are currently enrolled in methadone maintenance treatment&#xD;
      (MMT) and who wish to learn these techniques to reduce their behavioral and physiological&#xD;
      dependence on medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to engage these MMT patients in a complementary (non-pharmacological) therapeutic&#xD;
      activity that may improve their self-efficacy and personal control, reduce the impact of&#xD;
      stressors and chronic pain, drug craving, affective and physical function, and lower reliance&#xD;
      on pharmacological interventions.&#xD;

      Overall, this project will take approximately 1 year to complete, and will be divided into&#xD;
      three phases (each about three months long).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: The investigators will identify and consent 10 patients, regardless of age, sex, or&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, enrolled at the Tolan Park Research Clinic who endorse a desire to lower&#xD;
      their daily methadone maintenance dose but have been unable to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will complete a 12-week protocol. There will be twice weekly visits (each&#xD;
      ≈30 min total for all procedures) by the trained adult Kids Kicking Cancer (KKC) martial&#xD;
      artists. Prior to receiving his/her methadone dose, the martial artist and patient will meet&#xD;
      in a private area to promote attention and focus on the intervention, and for measurement of&#xD;
      biomarker data. At baseline and during weeks 4, 8 and 12, the investigators will obtain pre-&#xD;
      and post-session saliva samples (collected with a Salivette held under the tongue 3 min) to&#xD;
      measure two stress biomarkers. The investigators will also measure heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure. Each participant will receive 20 minutes of individual instruction in a therapeutic&#xD;
      approach to lower their stress and life challenges. Each visit will include certain martial&#xD;
      arts rituals, including the KKC &quot;Power, Peace, Purpose&quot;™ mantra, and Breath Brake®,&#xD;
      introduced by videotapes made by the &quot;heroes&quot; (children). Other components of the&#xD;
      intervention session, e.g. movement exercises and mental imagery, will be tailored to the&#xD;
      patient, always ensuring that any physical maneuver is safe for that individual. They will&#xD;
      also receive audio meditations for smart phones or, if unavailable, loaded onto mp3 players&#xD;
      to practice the meditations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning and end of each visit by the martial artist, the participant will use Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scales (VAS, 0-10 range) to rate his/her momentary level of &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;drug craving&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;anxiety&quot;, &quot;anger&quot;, and &quot;depression&quot;; and he/she will complete the short form of the Positive&#xD;
      and Negative Affect Schedule. Each meeting will be supplemented by phone calls 3 times a week&#xD;
      from the martial artist to each patient to supply support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection measurements: Beck Depression Inventory-II, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory,&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale, Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale, Coping Orientation to&#xD;
      Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE), Alcohol and Drug Use Self-Efficacy Scale, Distress&#xD;
      Tolerance Scale, Breath-hold Endurance task, Brief Pain Inventory, Medical Outcomes Study&#xD;
      Short Form, a computerized measure of attentional function, the Attentional Network Task,&#xD;
      also known as Flanker Task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methadone dose (baseline and weekly) and urine drug test results (baseline and twice weekly&#xD;
      for these study participants) will be extracted from the patient's medical record, with the&#xD;
      assistance of an authorized staff member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Phase I participant will undergo non-Virtual Reality (VR) intervention procedures during&#xD;
      weeks 1-6, and will then undergo VR-based intervention during weeks 7-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will extend phase 1 by evaluating a second group of 10 patients who will also&#xD;
      participate over a 12-week period. Identical procedures to Phase 1 will be used; in addition,&#xD;
      the investigators will include whole-brain fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging)&#xD;
      scanning before and after completion of the full intervention. Patients will use a Virtual&#xD;
      Reality (VR) program that enables the patient to choose his/her obstacles and &quot;see&quot; that&#xD;
      obstacle inside his/her head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 will enroll 10 additional patients (different participants from phases 1 and 2) who&#xD;
      use opioids while complaining of specific chronic pain syndrome. In this phase, the same&#xD;
      protocol will be used, including fMRI scanning. The Virtual Reality, however, will focus&#xD;
      specifically on creating the image of the pain in wherever the pain is being reported in the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
