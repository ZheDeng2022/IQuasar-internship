    <textblock>
      This multi-center study will compare the effectiveness of adding virtual peer mentoring (PM)&#xD;
      to a structured education-based (STE) transition program for emerging adults with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease to determine its effect on decreasing the number of acute care visits per year,&#xD;
      improving patient-reported outcomes, and reducing healthcare utilization among emerging&#xD;
      adults with sickle cell disease (EA-SCD)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, cluster randomized study comparing the effectiveness of adding&#xD;
      virtual peer mentoring (PM) to a structured education-based (STE) transition program based on&#xD;
      the 6 core elements of transition in improving acute care reliance, quality of life and&#xD;
      satisfaction with transition process in emerging adults with sickle cell disease (EA-SCD).&#xD;
      The study will involve a total of 14 large (&gt;80 EA-SCD currently in pediatric care) and&#xD;
      small-scale (â‰¤80 EA-SCD currently in pediatric care) clinical sites, with a 1:1 randomization&#xD;
      at the site level. The study will involve approximately 700 subjects, 120 peer mentors, and&#xD;
      25 advisors. The primary endpoint of this study will be the average number of acute care&#xD;
      visits per year over a minimum of 24 months. Secondary objectives are to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of STE+PM versus STE alone at improving patient-reported outcomes and reducing&#xD;
      healthcare utilization among EA-SCD. Enrollment is anticipated to occur over 18-24 months&#xD;
