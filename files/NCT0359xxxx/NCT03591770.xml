  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have been&#xD;
      shown to be at increased risk of developing certain infections, such as shingles from the&#xD;
      Herpes Zoster (HZ) virus, as a result of their underlying disease. Patients with UC are also&#xD;
      often treated with immunosuppressants, and research has shown that IBD patients on&#xD;
      immunosuppressants have an impaired immune response to vaccination in comparison to&#xD;
      immunocompetent controls. Because UC patients are often treated with immunosuppressants, the&#xD;
      live HZ vaccine was not recommended in these patients. Shingrix, however, is a new&#xD;
      inactivated vaccine recently approved by the FDA for prevention of HZ in adults age 50 and&#xD;
      older, and Shingrix should be safe to administer in IBD patients because it does not contain&#xD;
      live HZ virus. Data on efficacy of the Shingrix vaccine also appears promising in&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tofacitinib citrate (Xeljanz), an immunosuppressant that works by inhibiting the Janus kinase&#xD;
      pathway, is currently approved for treatment of certain inflammatory diseases such as&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The drug is currently awaiting FDA-approval for use in&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe UC but has been used off-label in various settings. Notably, tofacitinib&#xD;
      was associated with an increased risk of HZ in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
      psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis is that UC patients on tofacitinib will mount an adequate response&#xD;
      and that the response will be slightly diminished compared to non-immunosuppressed IBD&#xD;
      patients, comparable to those on anti-tumor necrosis alpha (anti-TNF) monotherapy, and&#xD;
      superior to those on anti-TNF therapy in combination with a thiopurine. Strong cell mediated&#xD;
      immunity is shown to prevent reactivation of HZ, and demonstrating a robust immune response&#xD;
      to Shingrix may serve as a surrogate for a reduced risk of developing shingles and might&#xD;
      alleviate prescribers' concerns regarding the use of tofacitinib. The results will also serve&#xD;
      as pilot data to inform larger future studies evaluating the actual risk of developing&#xD;
      shingles in patients on tofacitinib who receive Shingrix.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the immune response from the new Shingrix vaccine&#xD;
      in UC patients on tofacitinib monotherapy in comparison to other UC therapies. the&#xD;
      investigators plan to determine this by vaccinating IBD patients on (a) tofacitinib&#xD;
      monotherapy, (b) anti-TNF monotherapy, (c) anti-TNF combination therapy with a thiopurine, or&#xD;
      (d) aminosalicylates or other non-immunosuppressive therapy with the new Shingrix vaccine and&#xD;
      measuring markers of cell-mediated immunity before vaccination and at one and six months&#xD;
      after the last vaccine dose. Cell-mediated immunity will be measured with an interferon gamma&#xD;
      (IFNγ) enzyme linked immunospot (ELISPOT) test to assess T-cell response. Humoral immunity&#xD;
      will also be measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit to quantify&#xD;
      antibody concentrations of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), the pathogen that when reactivated&#xD;
      results in shingles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include adult patients aged 50 or older with UC (diagnosed by&#xD;
      standard clinical, radiographic, endoscopic, and histopathologic criteria) receiving care at&#xD;
      Boston Medical Center, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, or University of Wisconsin&#xD;
      Hospital and Clinics. There is no randomization or use of placebo in this study. Four study&#xD;
      groups (each containing 25 subjects) will be established -- 1. Group A - UC patients on&#xD;
      tofacitinib monotherapy. 2. Group B - UC patients receiving anti-TNF monotherapy (adalimumab,&#xD;
      golimumab, infliximab). 3. Group C - UC patients on an anti-TNF agent and a thiopurine&#xD;
      (6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine). Group D - UC patients on non-immunosuppressive therapy or&#xD;
      5-aminosalicylates. For each subject, 3 total samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Eligible patients with UC will be recruited from the Center for Digestive Diseases&#xD;
      at Boston Medical Center, the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, or the University&#xD;
      of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. Patients will be screened for participation in the study&#xD;
      and recruited by their primary gastroenterologist. In clinic, a handout of the risks and&#xD;
      benefits of the clinically indicated vaccine (Shingrix) will be given to each patient from&#xD;
      their primary gastroenterologist for their review. Patients will have the opportunity to opt&#xD;
      in or out of the study early in the consent process upon review of the handout. If a patient&#xD;
      elects to participate in the study, patients will sign the consent, be entered into the study&#xD;
      with assignment of a Subject ID number, and complete the initial study assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject contacts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 - Baseline/Enrollment Visit 1 (Day 0): Subjects will have a comprehensive medical&#xD;
           history and physical exam performed, including vaccination history and all medications&#xD;
           over past 30 days. They will also complete a Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index&#xD;
           (SCCAI) questionnaire. A baseline blood sample of approximately 20mL (4 tablespoons)&#xD;
           will then be obtained. If proof of past varicella infection is met by appropriate&#xD;
           history, subjects will receive the Shingrix vaccine indicated based on their vaccination&#xD;
           history as recommended by their gastroenterologist; otherwise subjects will follow-up in&#xD;
           1 week to review confirmatory serology results and receive vaccine if indicated. The&#xD;
           Shingrix vaccine will be given in a two-dose series (0.5 mL each) administered&#xD;
           intramuscularly -first dose at Month 0 followed by a second dose anytime between 2 and 6&#xD;
           months later. Subjects will be instructed to call the study team for any concerns or any&#xD;
           development of fever, chills, rash or other concerning symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2- Follow up Visit 2 (approximately day 7): This visit is only needed for patients who&#xD;
           require serologic confirmation of past varicella infection, therefore patients who meet&#xD;
           proof for past varicella infection by appropriate history do not require serologic&#xD;
           confirmation and will NOT be scheduled for this visit. Subjects will review results of&#xD;
           the VZV antibody level test with their provider. If VZV antibody levels are positive,&#xD;
           subjects will receive the Shingrix vaccine indicated based on their vaccination history&#xD;
           as recommended by their gastroenterologist. Subjects will be instructed to call the&#xD;
           study team for any concerns or any development of fever, chills, rash or other&#xD;
           concerning symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 - Follow up Phone Call 1 (approximately day 14): Subjects will receive a follow-up&#xD;
           phone call to identify any adverse effects including fevers or chills, rash, and visits&#xD;
           to the emergency room or to their primary care physicians. They will also be reminded&#xD;
           about their follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 - Follow up Visit 3 (approximately day 60): Subjects will complete a SCCAI&#xD;
           questionnaire, and information will be collected to identify any adverse effects&#xD;
           including fevers or chills, rash, and visits to the emergency room or to their primary&#xD;
           care physician. The 2nd dose of the Shingrix vaccine will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 - Follow up Phone Call 2 (approximately day 72): Subjects will receive a follow-up&#xD;
           phone call to identify any adverse effects including fevers or chills, rash, and visits&#xD;
           to the emergency room or to their primary care physicians. They will also be reminded&#xD;
           about their follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 - Follow up Visit 4 (approximately day 90): Subjects will complete a SCCAI&#xD;
           questionnaire, and information will be collected to identify any adverse effects&#xD;
           including fevers or chills, rash, and visits to the emergency room or to their primary&#xD;
           care physician. A blood sample of approximately 20mL (4 tablespoons) will then be&#xD;
           obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7 - Follow up Visit 5 (approximately day 240): Subjects will complete a SCCAI&#xD;
           questionnaire, and information will be collected to identify any adverse effects&#xD;
           including fevers or chills, rash, and visits to the emergency room or to their primary&#xD;
           care physician. A blood sample of approximately 20mL (4 tablespoons) will then be&#xD;
           obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire procedure will be identically performed at the additional sites outside of Boston&#xD;
      Medical Center. Subjects' duration of participation will range from 8 to 12 months, depending&#xD;
      on when the 2nd vaccine dose is administered.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the immunogenicity of the herpes zoster subunit vaccine in UC patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and approximately 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity will be assessed by the change in cell mediated immunity (CMI) as measured by ELISPOT from pre-immunization to 1 month after receiving second dose of booster vaccine post-immunization. ELISPOT is an enzyme-linked assay for detecting and enumerating cytokine-producing lymphocytes. A colored spot indicates a cell producing IFNγ. Each well will be inspected and cytokine-producing cells will be counted using AID® imaging system. Any well with more than 300 spots will be considered too numerous to count and reported as &gt;300 cells/well. It will be measured from pre-immunization to 1 month after receiving second dose of booster vaccine post-immunization.</description>
