    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of volitinib in treating patients&#xD;
      with primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors that have come back (recurrent) or does not&#xD;
      respond to treatment (refractory). Volitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommend a phase II dose of volitinib&#xD;
      (savolitinib) administered orally daily in children with refractory, progressive or recurrent&#xD;
      primary CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of savolitinib in children with refractory,&#xD;
      progressive, or recurrent primary CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of savolitinib in children with refractory,&#xD;
      progressive, or recurrent primary CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of savolitinib within the confines of a&#xD;
      phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To perform a genomic analysis within the confines of a phase I study to investigate&#xD;
      correlation between response to treatment (as measured by objective response or progression&#xD;
      free survival [PFS]) and the presence of specific genomic alterations (e.g. MET&#xD;
      amplification, chromosome 7q aneuploidy, MET mutation, or HGF amplification) and/or specific&#xD;
      subgroups of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive volitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment repeats every 28 days for&#xD;
      up to 39 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then periodically&#xD;
      for up to 2 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a primary CNS tumor&#xD;
             (medulloblastoma, high-grade glioma, or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma [DIPG]) that&#xD;
             is recurrent, refractory, or progressive. All tumors must have histologic verification&#xD;
             at either the time of diagnosis or recurrence except patients with diffuse intrinsic&#xD;
             brain stem tumors. These patients must have radiographic or clinical evidence of&#xD;
             progression. Patients with a recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary CNS tumor&#xD;
             with evidence of genetic activation of the MET pathway, regardless of histology, are&#xD;
             also eligible to the Phase I component of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Refractory disease is defined as the presence of persistent abnormality on&#xD;
                  conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging that is further&#xD;
                  distinguished by histology (biopsy or sample of lesion) or advanced imaging, OR&#xD;
                  as determined by the treating physician and discussed with the primary&#xD;
                  investigator prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Efficacy Expansion Cohort: Patients must have a recurrent, progressive, or refractory&#xD;
             primary CNS tumor with evidence of genetic activation of the MET pathway, regardless&#xD;
             of histology. The submitted specimen can be from diagnosis or recurrence and there is&#xD;
             no time limit from when the specimen was obtained to enrollment onto the efficacy&#xD;
             expansion cohort. The assessment will be performed in a Clinical Laboratory&#xD;
             Improvement Act (CLIA) certified laboratory. MET pathway activation status must be&#xD;
             confirmed using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved testing prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. MET pathway activation is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;

                       Actionable Cancer Targets) panel. Alternatively, if a MET aberration is&#xD;
                       identified at a PBTC site using another FDA approved panel (Foundation&#xD;
                       Medicine or Oncomine), the result will be considered sufficient for&#xD;

             cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate protocol therapy, put&#xD;

             results&#xD;
&#xD;

             for age, height, and gender, patients with values above these levels must have their&#xD;
             blood pressure controlled with medication prior to starting study drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The normal blood pressure by height, age and gender tables can be assessed in the&#xD;
                  Generic Forms section of the PBTC member's webpage&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any of the following cardiac diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association &gt;= grade 2)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 450 msec on screening obtained from 3&#xD;
                  electrocardiograms (EKGs) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Factors that may increase the risk of QTc prolongation such as chronic&#xD;
                  hypokalemia not correctable with supplements, congenital or familial long QT&#xD;
                  syndrome, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Family history of unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first-degree&#xD;
                  relatives or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval and cause Torsade de&#xD;
                  Pointes. These drugs must have been discontinued prior to the start of&#xD;
                  administration of study treatment in accordance with guidance&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of&#xD;
                  resting EKG, e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment has&#xD;
             the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;

                  first dose of savolitinib (3 weeks for St John's Wort). Strong inducers of CYP3A4&#xD;
                  and CYP3A4 substrates which have a narrow therapeutic range or CYP3A4 sensitive&#xD;
                  substrates should not be used during the trial or used with caution. Because the&#xD;
                  lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly&#xD;
                  consult a frequently-updated medical reference. Patient drug information handout&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator are unwilling or unable to return for&#xD;
             required follow-up visits or obtain follow-up studies required to assess toxicity to&#xD;
