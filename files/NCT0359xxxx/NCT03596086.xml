      Study to assess the safety and efficacy of HSV-tk (gene therapy), valacyclovir, radiotherapy&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective phase I-II study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of HSV-tk +&#xD;
      valacyclovir gene therapy in combination with radiotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. This study is comprised of patients who have failed&#xD;
      standard of care treatment (maximal safe resection followed by chemoradiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response will be evaluated by neurological evaluation, neuropsychological testing,&#xD;
      and imaging studies as well as by histological examination wherever a re-operation is&#xD;
      clinically indicated. Blood samples will be taken for systemic immunological response, blood&#xD;
      counts and liver functions tests. Toxicity will be graded by the Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) neuro-toxicity scores.&#xD;
      Patients will also be followed to assess median time to progression and median survival.&#xD;
