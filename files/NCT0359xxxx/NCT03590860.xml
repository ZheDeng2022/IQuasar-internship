      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of the study drug known as LY3322207.&#xD;
      Participants must be healthy or must have hypertension (high blood pressure). Participants&#xD;
      with hypertension may already be taking a common drug to reduce blood pressure called an&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).&#xD;
