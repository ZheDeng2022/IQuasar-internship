  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of the risk of pulmonary aspiration, patients are asked to comply with the fasting&#xD;
      guidelines when they are scheduled for an elective cesarean section. This fasting can result&#xD;
      in increased insulin resistance, and that this can delay patient recovery from surgery.&#xD;
      Giving a patient a carbohydrate-rich beverage before surgery has been shown to reduce the&#xD;
      post-operative insulin resistance and reduce the length of stay in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to safely provide pregnant women with a carbohydrate-rich drink when admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital in preparation for an elective cesarean delivery, the investigators must ensure that&#xD;
      their stomach has emptied by the time they go to the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to investigate whether women admitted to the hospital, having complied with&#xD;
      the fasting guidelines, will have an empty stomach 2 hours after being offered 400 ml of a&#xD;
      beverage containing 50g of carbohydrate. This can easily be done with the use of an&#xD;
      ultrasound exam of the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that patients will have an empty stomach 2 hours after drinking 400 ml of a&#xD;
      carbohydrate-rich beverage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fasting, even if for brief periods, results in a marked reduction in insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
      This insulin resistance developed after surgery has been implicated in the increase of the&#xD;
      length of stay at the hospital. Randomized studies involving either preoperative glucose&#xD;
      infusion or ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich beverage have shown that postoperative insulin&#xD;
      resistance may be reduced by about 50% when preoperative fasting is avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the recommended methods to avoid the insulin resistance in the perioperative period is&#xD;
      the provision of isotonic, carbohydrate-containing clear fluids up to 2 hours preoperatively,&#xD;
      so that patients begin their surgery in a fed rather than fasted state. This has been called&#xD;
      &quot;carbohydrate loading&quot;. An amount of 50 g of carbohydrates is sufficient to produce an&#xD;
      insulin response similar to that of a mixed solid meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beverages containing different combinations of carbohydrate or protein have been used in&#xD;
      different patient populations and support the safety of their use in the perioperative&#xD;
      period. Although there is substantial evidence that gastric emptying is similar in&#xD;
      non-laboring term pregnant women and non-pregnant it is unknown whether the maternal anxiety&#xD;
      preceding the procedure and the addition of a 50 g carbohydrate containing beverage may cause&#xD;
      delayed gastric emptying and increase the risk of aspiration in the obstetric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bedside ultrasound assessment of the gastric content has shown good intra- and inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability. Our group has previously demonstrated that in 103 women scheduled for elective&#xD;
      cesarean, 95% of fasting subjects presented with an antral cross-sectional area ≤10.3 cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to implement and to standardize a beverage containing 50 g of complex carbohydrate&#xD;
      offered to women when admitted to the hospital in preparation for their elective cesarean&#xD;
      delivery, the investigators must ensure that women have an empty stomach by the time they&#xD;
      arrive to the operating room.&#xD;
