  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is one multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo controlled Phase&#xD;
      III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LXI-15028 50 mg in treatment of&#xD;
      non-erosive reflux disease in Chinese patients for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening-eligible subjects will be randomized into LXI-15028 50mg group or placebo group at&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Day 0) according to the ratio of 1:1 and receive study treatment for 4 weeks. They&#xD;
      will start to take the investigational products in the following morning of Visit 2 (Day 1)&#xD;
      and start to complete the subject's diary from the day of study treatment initiation. After 2&#xD;
      weeks of study treatment, subjects will return to the study site and complete Visit 3, after&#xD;
      which receive study treatment for another 2 weeks and then complete Visit 4. On the day of&#xD;
      Visit 4, subjects will not take any drug. All the subjects will be followed up by phone&#xD;
      (Visit 5) at Day 28±3 after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
