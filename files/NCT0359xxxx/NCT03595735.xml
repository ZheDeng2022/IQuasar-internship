  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical evaluation to assess the safety and performance of the Zenflow Spring&#xD;
      System when used as intended to relieve symptoms of obstructive Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia&#xD;
      (BPH).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, prospective, single arm safety, performance, and effectiveness trial. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in two stages. Upon the successful completion of stage 1, the study&#xD;
      will be expanded and continue to stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 will enroll subjects in the Intent to Treat (ITT) cohort. The purpose of stage 1 is&#xD;
      to assess acute safety and performance of the Zenflow System at the time of the procedure,&#xD;
      through discharge, 2 weeks and 1 month, in up to 10 subjects enrolled at up to 7&#xD;
      investigational sites, to determine continuation to stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon successful completion of stage 1, the study will be expanded to stage 2 with sites added&#xD;
      and continued enrollment in the ITT cohort. All subjects, including those enrolled in the&#xD;
      stage 1 evaluation, will continue to be followed at all the designated follow-up time points&#xD;
      for the full duration of the study (60 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether or not the study continues to Stage 2, all enrolled subjects will be followed for the&#xD;
      entire duration of the study (60 months), or until exited.&#xD;
