      Both, acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) considered as a continuum of&#xD;
      the disease process. The renal recovery after AKI is currently assessed by measuring serum&#xD;
      creatinine, which has its limitations including change in muscle mass, volume distribution in&#xD;
      critically ill patients. Also, despite complete return of serum creatinine after AKI, these&#xD;
      patients remain at increased risk for developing CKD, which suggest that there may be&#xD;
      persistent subclinical damage to the kidney. The new term acute kidney disease (AKD) has been&#xD;
      proposed to define the renal disease after AKI. Recently (2017), Acute Disease Quality&#xD;
      Initiative (ADQI) 16 workgroup published a consensus document on AKD and renal recovery,&#xD;
      which provide definition as well as research recommendation for AKD. The consensus report of&#xD;
      the ADQI 16 workgroup (2017) recommended that there is need for studies to describe the&#xD;
      epidemiology, clinical course, natural history of patients having AKD; and also determine&#xD;
      optimal methods to assess functional recovery and identify novel biomarker(s), functional&#xD;
      tests, and imaging approach which can reveal ongoing injury and repair in these patients.&#xD;
      This is an observational study to describe epidemiology, clinical course and recovery from&#xD;
      AKD at 90 days in critically ill patients.&#xD;

      Introduction and Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are available definitions for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD), which are being used routinely in research and clinical practice. The AKI is defined&#xD;
      as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or less, as per KDIGO (kidney&#xD;
      disease improving global outcome) guideline. The CKD is defined as persistence of kidney&#xD;
      disease for a period of more than 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both, AKI and CKD considered as a continuum of the disease process. The renal recovery after&#xD;
      AKI is currently assessed by measuring serum creatinine, which has its limitations including&#xD;
      change in muscle mass, volume distribution in critically ill patients. Also, despite complete&#xD;
      return of serum creatinine after AKI, these patients remain at increased risk for developing&#xD;
      CKD, which suggest that there may be persistent subclinical damage to the kidney. The new&#xD;
      term acute kidney disease (AKD) has been proposed to define the renal disease after AKI.&#xD;
      Recently (2017), Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) 16 workgroup published a consensus&#xD;
      document on AKD and renal recovery, which provide definition as well as research&#xD;
      recommendation for AKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study supported by cited literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consensus report of the ADQI 16 workgroup (2017) recommended that there is need for&#xD;
      studies to describe the epidemiology, clinical course, natural history of patients having&#xD;
      AKD; and also determine optimal methods to assess functional recovery and identify novel&#xD;
      biomarker(s), functional tests, and imaging approach which can reveal ongoing injury and&#xD;
      repair in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevance and expected outcome of the proposed study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study to describe epidemiology, clinical course and recovery from&#xD;
      AKD at 90 days in critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary work done so far:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no systematic study so far in critically ill patients, as AKD is defined recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of AKD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute kidney disease (AKD): Acute or subacute damage and/or loss of kidney function for a&#xD;
      duration of between 7 and 90 days after exposure to an AKI initiating event. Outcome of AKD&#xD;
      include recovery, recurrence of AKI, progression of AKD and/or death. Stages (1, 2 and 3) of&#xD;
      AKD are defined same as for AKIN criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To study acute kidney disease severity outcome by measuring serum creatinine and other&#xD;
      biomarkers (NGAL, KIM-1 and Cystatin C) at 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study to know the disease process of AKD. Patients will&#xD;
      be included from the ICU of Department of Critical Care Medicine and Department of&#xD;
      Nephrology. All adult critically ill patients will be consider for inclusion in this study,&#xD;
      who had AKD (at 7 days after exposure to an AKI initiating event) because of various&#xD;
      etiologies during his/ her current illness. After getting written informed consent from the&#xD;
      patient or close relatives to participate in this study, patients will be included in this&#xD;
      study. There will be no intervention in this study. Patients will be followed up in our ICU&#xD;
      follow-up clinic and/ or nephrology OPD at 90 days of event of acute kidney injury and&#xD;
      various biomarkers and imaging parameters will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study, where all eligible patients will be considered for possible&#xD;
      inclusion over 15 month duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed written consent will be obtained from all patients or close relatives for inclusion&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (D7, when defined as AKD), at ICU discharge, and at 90 days (D90): 3 ml blood and&#xD;
      3 ml urine will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical characteristics of all ICU patients who fulfill inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be collected along with relevant laboratory tests done during patient management, as per&#xD;
      treating team. ICU prognostication scores, i.e., Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health&#xD;
      Evaluation (APACHE) II score and Sequential Organ Dysfunction Assessment (SOFA) score will&#xD;
      also be recorded. Episodes of recurrence of AKI will be recorded. Risk factors of acute&#xD;
      kidney injury like presence of circulatory shock, chronic diseases (heart, lung, liver),&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, nephrotoxic drugs, radio contrast agents will also be noted. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the renal outcome of AKD (among survivors) at 90 days, by measuring serum&#xD;
      creatinine, urine routine, albuminuria, serum and urine biomarkers (NGAL, Cystatin C and&#xD;
      KIM-1), need of renal replacement therapy and renal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be analysed for plasma creatinine, urinary albumin, plasma and urine biomarkers&#xD;
      (NGAL cystatin C, and KIM-1) at baseline (D7), at ICU discharge and at 90 days (D90).&#xD;
      Biomarker, Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), Cystatin C and Kidney Injury&#xD;
      Molecule-1 in plasma will be analysed by commercially available ELISA kits (RnD) as per&#xD;
      manufacturer instructions. Renal ultrasonography will be done at baseline (D7) and at 90 days&#xD;
      (D90).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis will be done and data will be presented as mean or median.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 months&#xD;
