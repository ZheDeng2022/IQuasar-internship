      To date, evidence of the effects of robotic training combined with OnabotulinumtoxinA focal&#xD;
      treatment for spasticity is limited. The objective of this study were to compare the effects&#xD;
      of robotic training against conventional rehabilitation on functional recovery, strength and&#xD;
      spasticity, in stroke patients who underwent OnabotulinumtoxinA focal treatment for&#xD;
      spasticity. We performed a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving 24&#xD;
      outpatients with diagnoses of stroke, divided in two groups (experimental and control group).&#xD;
      Experimental group received specific robotic training for the upper limb with the device&#xD;
      Armotion/Motore (Reha Technology AG, Olten, Switzerland). Our primary outcome was Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
      Assessment Motor Scale (FMA). Secondary outcome were Action Research Arm Test (ARAT),&#xD;
      Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Medical Research Council Scale (MRC) and surface&#xD;
      Electromyography (EMG). 14 healthy age-matched controls underwent one session of sEMG&#xD;
      acquisition to collect normative data.&#xD;

      This single-blind RCT with two parallel group was conducted according to the tenets of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines for Good Clinical practice, and the Consolidated&#xD;
      Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population was chronic post-stroke patients who attend to the Neurorehabilitation Unit&#xD;
      (AOUI Verona) where they were assessed for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly allocated in one of two groups,&#xD;
      experimental group ad control group. Each patient, underwent BoNT injection in the paretic&#xD;
      limb. The dose of BoNT injected into the target muscle was based on the severity of&#xD;
      spasticity in each case. Different commercial formulations of BoNT were used according to the&#xD;
      pharmaceutical portfolio contracts of our Hospital (Onabotulinumtoxin A, Abobotulinumtoxin A&#xD;
      and Incobotulinumtoxin A). The dose, volume and number of injection sites were set&#xD;
      accordingly. A Logiq ® Book XP portable ultrasound system (GE Healthcare; Chalfont St. Giles,&#xD;
      UK) was used to inject BoNT into the target muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior of the start of the study authors designed the experimental and the control group&#xD;
      protocols. Two physiotherapists, one for each group carried out the rehabilitation&#xD;
      procedures. Patients of both groups received 10 individual sessions (45 min/session, 2&#xD;
      sessions/week, five consecutive weeks). Treatments were performed in the rehabilitative gym&#xD;
      of the G.B. Rossi University Hospital Neurological Rehabilitation Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup of patients in the experimental group were investigated by Electromyography during&#xD;
      the &quot;hand-to-mouth&quot; motor task (ARAT sub-item). The subject seated in a comfortable position&#xD;
      on a chair with backrest, the feet resting on the floor and the knees and hips flexed at 90°.&#xD;
      The start position consisted of the hand of the examined side lying on the distal third of&#xD;
      the thigh. Then, the patient was asked to touch his mouth with the palm of the hand at normal&#xD;
      speed and return to the starting position. The patient was instructed not move the head&#xD;
      toward the hand. No other indications regarding how to move the arm for not to influence the&#xD;
      spontaneity of the movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EMG activity of 5 upper limb muscles of the affected side (deltoid scapular, deltoid&#xD;
      clavicular, pectoralis major - clavicular head, triceps brachii, biceps brachii) was measured&#xD;
      using pairs of self-adhesive surface electrodes. Disposable Ag-AgCl electrodes were placed&#xD;
      according to SENIAM guidelines with an inter-electrode spacing of 0.02 m. Before electrode&#xD;
      placement, the skin was shaved with a disposable, single-use razor and cleaned with&#xD;
      alcohol.28 Raw EMG signals were collected using BTS FREEEMG 300 wireless surface EMG sensors&#xD;
      (BTS spa, Milan, Italy) at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Raw EMG signals were processed with a&#xD;
      customized routine developed in MATLAB environment (MathWorks, USA). The raw EMG signal was&#xD;
      bandpass filtered at 20-450 Hz and then smoothed using a 20- ms root mean square (RMS)&#xD;
      algorithm to obtain the envelope. Signals were recorded in three conditions: 30 s during&#xD;
      resting position (basal), 5 s of maximal voluntary isometric contraction(MVIC), and during&#xD;
      the hand-to-mouth task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;hand-to-mouth&quot; task was divided into two sub-phases through the definition of three&#xD;
      time-events: 1) start of the movement, 2) the moment when the hand touches the mouth and 3)&#xD;
      return to the initial position. The first sub-phase, named &quot;elbow flexion phase&quot;, was defined&#xD;
      as the interval between the movement onset and the maximum elbow flexion. The second&#xD;
      sub-phase, named &quot;return phase&quot;, refers to the interval between the maximum elbow flexion&#xD;
      until movement offset after returning to the starting position (Figure X). Normative data&#xD;
      were collected from 14 healthy age-matched controls undergoing one EMGs acquisition. The&#xD;
      time-events were determined using an accelerometer (BTS spa, Milan, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the statistical analysis an intention to treat was used. Descriptive statistics included&#xD;
      means, standard deviation and graphs. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test data&#xD;
      distribution. Parametric or non-parametric tests were used for inferential statistics,&#xD;
      accordingly. The T-Test for unpaired data (or the Mann-Whitney test) was used for testing&#xD;
      between-group differences at T0 and T1. For this purpose, we computed the changes of score&#xD;
      (Δ) between T0-T1. The T-Test for paired data (or Wilcoxon signed rank tests) was used to&#xD;
      compare within-group changes over time. The level of significance was set p&lt;0.05. Software&#xD;
      statistics SPSS 20.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0, Armonk, NY, USA).&#xD;
