  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatectomy is an essential treatment for various benign and malignant diseases of the liver.&#xD;
      However, post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is still a life-threatening complication after&#xD;
      hepatectomy. The pathophysiological mechanism of PHLF has not yet been fully elucidated, and&#xD;
      there is still a lack of effective strategies for either prevention or therapy of PHLF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sphingolipids include ceramides (CER), sphingomyelins (SM), glycosphingolipids (GSL),&#xD;
      sphingosine (SPH), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are multi-functional lipids that&#xD;
      regulates cell proliferation, cell survival, cell death, inflammation, tissue fibrosis,&#xD;
      cancer cell metastasis, and invasion. Liver is a main organ for metabolizing sphingolipids,&#xD;
      dysregulation of specific sphingolipids is associated with several liver diseases, therefore&#xD;
      sphingolipids have been proposed to be biomarkers of liver diseases, including hepatitis,&#xD;
      liver cancer, fatty liver diseases, and liver fibrosis. Moreover, several studies have shown&#xD;
      CER, SPH and S1P are critical in regulating pathophysiology of liver diseases, including&#xD;
      liver regeneration, necrosis, and inflammation. Given that PHLF causes dramatic dysregulation&#xD;
      in biochemical metabolism in liver, the investigators hypothesize that dysregulation of&#xD;
      sphingolipid metabolism may also occur in PHLF, and the dysregulation of specific&#xD;
      sphingolipids may serve as a biomarker or regulator during progression and recovery of PHLF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will examine the association between sphingolipid metabolism and PHLF. Levels of&#xD;
      sphingolipid metabolites and their related enzymes in plasma and liver tissue of patients&#xD;
      with hepatic resection will be measured by using liquid chromatograph/electrospray&#xD;
      ionization/mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) and high-throughput real-time quantitative PCR.&#xD;
      This project will facilitate us to identify specific sphingolipid metabolites as biomarker&#xD;
      and regulator of PHLF.&#xD;

      Liver resection is an effective treatment for both benign and malignant liver diseases.&#xD;
      However, post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is still a life-threatening complication of&#xD;
      liver resection. The pathophysiological mechanism of PHLF has not yet been fully studied, and&#xD;
      there is still a lack of effective strategies for either prevention or therapy of PHLF. The&#xD;
      investigation on PHLF has important clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sphingolipids are a group of bioactive lipids, including ceramides (CER), sphingomyelins&#xD;
      (SM), glycosphingolipids (GSL), etc. CER are the basic structure that constitute&#xD;
      sphingolipids. CER are composed of long-chain bases of sphingosine and different fatty acid&#xD;
      carbon chains. CER are of various species. According to the saturation of fatty acid carbon&#xD;
      chains, CER can be divided into saturated CER and unsaturated CER. CER can be divided into&#xD;
      four species, including short chain (less than 6 carbon atoms), medium chain (6-12 carbon&#xD;
      atoms), long chain (14-20 carbon atoms), and super long chain (more than 22 carbon atoms) .&#xD;
      Pathways of CER generation include de novo synthesis, complex sphingolipid lipid degradation&#xD;
      pathways, and salvage synthesis pathways. CER are degraded to produce sphingosine (SPH),&#xD;
      which can be phosphorylated to produce S1P. CER and its metabolites SPH and S1P are enigmatic&#xD;
      lipids that regulates cell survival, death, inflammation, tissue fibrosis, cancer metastasis,&#xD;
      and cancer invasion. Hepatocytes express activities of various sphingolipid enzymes, which&#xD;
      makes liver an important organ for sphingolipid metabolism. Emerging evidences have shown&#xD;
      that dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolite are associated with development and progression&#xD;
      of certain liver diseases. In animal studies, dysregulation of ceramides has been indicated&#xD;
      in hepatocyte survival, liver injury, and liver failure. In clinical studies, dysregulation&#xD;
      of specific ceramide species has been identified to be associated with decompensation of&#xD;
      cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma. In the light of these&#xD;
      evidences, the investigators hypothesize that dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism may be&#xD;
      associated with PHLF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have established a quantitative method to measure different types of&#xD;
      sphingolipids in human plasma, tissues, and cells using liquid chromatograph/electrospray&#xD;
      ionization/mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), including C12-CER, C16-CER, C18-CER, C18:1-CER,&#xD;
      C20-CER, C22-CER, C24-CER, C24:1-CER, SPH, S1P, C12-SM, C12-LacCER, C12-GluCER. In order to&#xD;
      examine the correlation between sphingolipid metabolism and PHLF, the investigators will&#xD;
      collect plasma of patients during peri-operation period of hepatectomy, after lipid&#xD;
      extraction, the levels of sphingolipids will be measured by LC-ESI-MS/MS technology.&#xD;
      Moreover, expression of sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes in liver issues will be determined&#xD;
      using high-throughput real-time quantitative PCR. The diagnostic criteria and grading of PHLF&#xD;
      will be performed following criteria of International Liver Group of Liver Surgery. In the&#xD;
      end, the investigators will analyze the correlation between sphingolipid metabolites and&#xD;
      PHLF. This project will facilitate us to identify specific sphingolipid metabolites as&#xD;
      biomarker and regulator of PHLF, and shed the light on the study of PHLF prevention and&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
