    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well chemokine modulation therapy works when given prior to&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in treating participants with triple-negative breast cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body. Drugs used in chemokine modulation therapy, such as celecoxib,&#xD;
      recombinant interferon alfa-2b, and rintatolimod, work by unleashing or enhancing the cancer&#xD;
      immune responses that already exist by either blocking inhibitory molecules or by activating&#xD;
      stimulatory molecules. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving chemokine modulation therapy before&#xD;
      pembrolizumab may work better in treating participants with metastatic triple-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the increase of CD8+ infiltration into tumor microenvironment after&#xD;
      pre-treatment CKM regime&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) to the combination therapy per RECIST v1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the chemokine modulation (CKM) in combination with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) as&#xD;
           compared to historic outcomes of pembrolizumab and other anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapies alone,&#xD;
           as determined by secondary measures of efficacy including progression-free survival&#xD;
           (PFS), overall survival (OS), and disease control rate (DCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety profile of CKM regimen given as pre-treatment to pembrolizumab&#xD;
           therapy in metastatic breast cancer patients using Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
           Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the immune analysis profile of CKM and pembrolizumab combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the relationship of infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and other immune and&#xD;
           genetic markers, and their associated PD-1, CD45RA or CD45RO levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate PD-L1 expression within both neoplastic and nonneoplastic stromal elements of&#xD;
           the tumor microenvironment to PFS, OS, ORR and adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate Immune Panel results with ORR, PFS, OS and AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of response assessment criteria for a prospective analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo pre-treatment biopsy. Participants then undergo chemokine modulation&#xD;
      therapy consisting of celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), recombinant interferon alfa-2b&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes, and rintatolimod IV over 30-60 minutes on days -11 to -9,&#xD;
      and -4 to -2. Participants then undergo additional biopsy. Following biopsy and chemokine&#xD;
      modulation therapy, participants receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. After&#xD;
      completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 90 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
