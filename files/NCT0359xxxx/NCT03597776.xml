  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of knees and hips is a common medical problem present in elderly, which poses&#xD;
      signiﬁcant impairment to their mobility, independence, and quality of life. Despite the&#xD;
      availability of conservative treatment, such as simple analgesics and physiotherapy, total&#xD;
      joint replacement is the only curative option for this disease entity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latter, however, is not without risk. A study by Poulakka has demonstrated that patients&#xD;
      with poor pain control in the postoperative period were three to ten times more likely to&#xD;
      develop chronic pain, which may signiﬁcantly impair the patients' functional status and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal pain control is therefore essential in facilitating rehabilitation and in preventing&#xD;
      long-term morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine [2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)acetamide] is an amide local anaesthetic&#xD;
      that is characteristically fast in onset and short in duration of action. As such, it has&#xD;
      long been used for providing regional anaesthesia for operation, but with limited role in&#xD;
      terms of post operative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, intravenous infusion of lidocaine has been shown to be safe and eﬀective in&#xD;
      reducing post operative pain (resting and dynamic), opioid consumption, and chronic&#xD;
      post-surgical pain. The mechanism of action involves both peripheral and central actions. In&#xD;
      addition to blockade of the Voltage-gated Sodium Channel of the peripheral nerves, lidocaine&#xD;
      also inhibits priming of the PolyMorphoNuclear granulocyte (PMN) by inducing a time-dependent&#xD;
      inhibition of intracellular G-protein signalling molecule (Gq); thus reducing release of&#xD;
      cytokines and Reactive Oxygen Species Centrally, lidocaine also causes blockade of NMDA&#xD;
      receptors and Neurokinin Receptors of the Wide-Dynamic Range Neurons in the dorsal horn of&#xD;
      spinal cord; thus reduces glutamate activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore hypothesize that the use of intravenous lidocaine may reduce acute pain and&#xD;
      improve the range of knee ﬂexion after total knee replacement. Currently, there is strong&#xD;
      evidence supporting its use in laparoscopic and open abdominal surgeries. There is, however,&#xD;
      a paucity of studies in orthopedic surgeries. To date, there is no randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial that studied its eﬀect in total knee replacement.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to estimate the effectiveness of a preemptive bolus of intravenous&#xD;
      lidocaine on reduction in acute pain, improvement on the range of movement, other&#xD;
      rehabilitation parameters and functional scoring in the post-operative period after total&#xD;
      knee replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT &amp; SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a one-year period, suitable patients will be approached at the pre-admission clinic and&#xD;
      in the general ward before their operation. Informed consent will be obtained before&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size required is calculated to be 45 subjects per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to minimize potential confounding factors, the demographic data of each subject will&#xD;
      be collected during preoperative assessment, including: age, gender, duration of preoperative&#xD;
      pain duration, preoperative NRS (movement) and NRS (rest). Both active and passive ROM of the&#xD;
      knee will be assessed by the attending physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION &amp; BLINDING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be assigned to either Lidocaine Group or Placebo Group. A randomization&#xD;
      list will be established by a computer-generated random sequence before the study begins. An&#xD;
      envelope containing the group assignment will be prepared, sealed, sequentially numbered, and&#xD;
      allocated for each subject. A &quot;blinded&quot; anaesthetist will then prepare lidocaine or saline&#xD;
      according to the group assigned for the attending anaesthetist. The subjects, the&#xD;
      investigators, and all the parties involved in patient management or data collection will be&#xD;
      blinded throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Lidocaine Group: a bolus of intravenous lidocaine of 2mg/kg over 5 mins will be given&#xD;
      before skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Placebo Group: Normal Saline of equal volume will be given as bolus before skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANAESTHESIA &amp; ANALGESIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) PRE-OPERATIVE: Routine preoperative assessment will be taken at the pre-admission clinic&#xD;
      or at the general ward; and standard fasting times (6 hours for solid food and 2 hours for&#xD;
      clear liquid) will be ordered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No analgesics or sedatives will be given as pre-medication. Holter machine will be used to&#xD;
      document any arrhythmia preoperatively and will be attached to patient till Day 1&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) INTRA-OPERATIVE: In addition to continuous ECG monitoring, BP, heart rate and SpO2 will&#xD;
      be monitored at no longer than every 5 mins throughout the operation. Signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      local anaesthetic toxicity will be assessed at 30 minute intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After establishing at least one patent intravenous cannula and ensuring the monitors are&#xD;
      properly applied, Spinal Anaesthesia will be given by the attending anaesthetist under&#xD;
      aseptic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of equipment (Whitacre or Quincke Needle), technique (landmark or&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided), and approach (midline or paramedical) are at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending anaesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intrathecal dose of 2.2-2.6ml 0.5% Heavy Bupivacaine with 15mcg of fentanyl will be given&#xD;
      depending on the height of the patient. Vasopressors and intravenous ﬂuids will be given as&#xD;
      necessary to keep the patient's blood pressure within 20% of his/her baseline, and to keep&#xD;
      the heart rate within normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bolus of lidocaine or placebo will then be given over 5 minutes before skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No Sedation will be given during operation in order to facilitate monitoring of systemic&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No Systemic Analgesics will be given, including Paracetamol, NSAIDS, Ketamine and Opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeries will be performed by the same team of orthopedic surgeons experienced in total&#xD;
      knee replacement at a tertiary level university teaching hospital, using standardized&#xD;
      surgical techniques. All patients will undergo posterior stabilized knee prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized dose of LIA (40ml 0.75% Ropivacaine, 0.5ml 1 in 200,000 Adrenaline, 30mg&#xD;
      Ketorolac in 60ml Normal Saline) will be administered by the orthopedic team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (III) POST-OPERATIVE (PHASE I RECOVERY IN PACU): Upon completion of surgery, the patient will&#xD;
      be transferred to PACU for further monitoring for at least 30 minutes. BP, heart rate, and&#xD;
      SpO2 will be monitored every 5 minutes in addition to continuous ECG monitoring. Signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of local anaesthetic toxicity will be assessed at 15 minute intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be evaluated every 5 mins using NRS. If the score is greater than 4/10, 2mg&#xD;
      morphine will be given intravenously every 5 mins provided the patient has a respiratory rate&#xD;
      of &gt; 12/min and a sedation score of &lt;1 until a NRS of &lt; 4/10 is achieved. At which point, a&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device will be connected to deliver morphine under a&#xD;
      standardized regime: 1mg bolus with 5 mins lockout, an hourly maximum of 0.1mg/kg, and no&#xD;
      background infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (IV) POST-OPERATIVE (PHASE II RECOVERY IN WARD): Continuous ECG monitoring will continually&#xD;
      be applied until Day 1 postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs and symptoms of local anaesthetic toxicity will be assessed clinically at 1-hour&#xD;
      intervals for 12 hours after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BP, heart rate, SpO2, and sedation score will be monitored at 1-hour intervals while on PCA&#xD;
      morphine; BP and heart rate will be monitored at 4-hour intervals once PCA morphine is&#xD;
      terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesics will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCA Morphine for at least 2 days postoperatively, and will be terminated on postoperative Day&#xD;
      3 once NRS (movement) is less than 4/10 or when 24-hour morphine consumption is less than&#xD;
      10mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized analgesic regime, depending on body weight, will be started immediately after&#xD;
      operation. For body weight &gt; 50kg, Oral paracetamol 1gram QID, and pregabalin 75mg nocte for&#xD;
      1 week celecoxib 200mg BD for 5 days. For body weight &lt; 50kg, Oral paracetamol 1gram TDS, and&#xD;
      pregabalin 50mg nocte for 1 week. celecoxib 200mg daily for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0.1mg/kg of intramuscular Morphine will be provided as necessary as rescue analgesic for any&#xD;
      breakthrough pain. Intravenous Ondansetron of 0.1mg/kg will be given as necessary for nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet will be resumed on Postoperative Day 0. The rehabilitation programme will be&#xD;
      standardized for all patients and be carried out by the same team of physiotherapists and&#xD;
      occupational therapists with the goal of early mobilization on Postoperative Day 0.&#xD;
