  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will test the acceptability and feasibility of a sleep extension&#xD;
      intervention in community-dwelling, short-sleeping, racially/ethnically diverse middle-aged&#xD;
      adults with MetS. Baseline sleep habits will be assessed and used to guide individualized&#xD;
      strategies to extend sleep. A 1-group pretest-posttest study design will test the efficacy of&#xD;
      this 18-week study (2 weeks of baseline data collection, 1 week of study intervention&#xD;
      planning, 12 weeks of sleep intervention delivery, final follow up 3 weeks after last day of&#xD;
      the 12-week intervention) on sleep duration, MetS risk behaviors (reduced physical activity,&#xD;
      increased sedentary behavior, poor diet quality), symptoms associated with MetS risk&#xD;
      behaviors (poor affective well-being, fatigue), and self-regulation. Socio-ecological&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to the intervention will be identified using a quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative approac&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than or equal to 35 years of age and less than or equal to 60 years of age.&#xD;
             Middle aged adults have the highest prevalence of short sleep compared to other stages&#xD;
             of adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objectively confirmed MetS defined by three or more of the following: a) waist&#xD;
             circumference greater than 120cm (men) or 88cm (women), b) blood pressure greater than&#xD;
             or equal to 135 mmHg systolic or greater than or equal to 85 mmHg diastolic or&#xD;
             antihypertensive medication use, c) fasting glucose greater than or equal to 110 mg/dL&#xD;
             or insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication use, d) serum triglycerides greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 150mg/dL or hypertriglyceride medication use, e) HDL-c less than 40mg/dL&#xD;
             (women) or less than 50 mg/dL (men) or medication use for low HDL-c1. MetS was&#xD;
             selected because individuals with MetS are at high risk for multiple chronic&#xD;
             conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Accelerometry confirmed short sleep (average work day sleep less than or equal to 6.5&#xD;
             hours/night). Self-reported sleep may overestimate sleep duration. This will ensure&#xD;
             that participants will have short sleep patterns that are associated with MetS&#xD;
             outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English speaking. Participants will need to demonstrate adequate English comprehension&#xD;
             (assessed during informed consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy/lactation (self-reported). Pregnancy and lactation can disrupt habitual&#xD;
             sleep patterns, and hormonal changes during pregnancy increase insulin resistance and&#xD;
             may confound MetS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current chemotherapy treatments (self-reported). Current chemotherapy treatments may&#xD;
             contribute to fatigue and sleep disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol abuse/dependence will be assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders&#xD;
             Identification Test (a measure that has demonstrated good reliability and validity).&#xD;
             Alcohol abuse/dependence may contribute to sleep disturbances and limit the&#xD;
             participant's ability to take part in sleep interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Night shift or shift work (previous 2 months), trans-meridian travel (previous 4&#xD;
             weeks), or planned shift work or trans-meridian travel during intervention period&#xD;
             (self-reported). These will be to ensure that sleep estimates from baseline represent&#xD;
             participants' habitual sleep and to ensure adherence with the sleep intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate-severe or severe depression will be assessed with the PHQ-9. Moderate-severe&#xD;
             depression or severe depression may contribute to sleep disturbances and interfere&#xD;
             with the participant's ability to adhere to the sleep interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic use of sleep-promoting medications (self-reported). These may interfere with&#xD;
             sleep patterns and limit the participant's ability to take part in the sleep&#xD;
             interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Habitual napping, defined as 2 naps per day or &gt; 90 minutes of napping on 3 or more&#xD;
             days of the week will be assessed during baseline with accelerometry. This will be to&#xD;
             ensure adherence with the sleep intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed but untreated obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
