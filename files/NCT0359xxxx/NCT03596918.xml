      This pilot phase I trial studies how well treatment with vincristine and bleomycin affect&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated Kaposi&#xD;
      sarcoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the longitudinal quality of life of participants with human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV)-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS) during treatment with bleomycin sulfate&#xD;
      (bleomycin) and vincristine sulfate (vincristine) at a single institution in East Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore baseline and time-dependent correlates of improvements in quality of life&#xD;
      (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess quality control (completeness and accuracy) in data capture of adverse events,&#xD;
      clinical benefit, and objective response for site evaluation and training purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive vincristine intravenously (IV) over 1-2 minutes and bleomycin IV over 10&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>The four domains of the FACT-G questionnaire will be determined for each questionnaire: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being. Each of these four domains is scored on a subset of 6-7 statements with a 0-4 scale. The domain is scored by summing up the responses to these statements. The ranges for the domains are as follows: physical well-being 0-28, social/family well-being 0-28, emotional well-being 0-24, and functional well-being 0-28. Using general estimating equations, changes in these domains with time will be explored. Logistic regression analyses will be used to correlate changes in quality of life domains with clinical response.</description>

             (RNA) viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: the term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a United States (U.S.) FDA-approved kit or&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

                  should be considered to confirm the presence or absence of pulmonary KS and/or an&#xD;
                  infectious agent; these procedures should be completed outside the study; these&#xD;
                  participants should be excluded if, in the opinion of the site investigator, use&#xD;
                  of bleomycin would be detrimental&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oxygen saturation less than 90% and/or exercise desaturation greater than 4% within 14&#xD;
             days before study enrollment&#xD;
