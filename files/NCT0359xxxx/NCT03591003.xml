      Participating countries: Belgium&#xD;
&#xD;
      Context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In June 2013, WHO notified that &quot;a single dose of YF vaccine is sufficient to confer&#xD;
      sustained life-long protective immunity against YF disease and that a booster dose is not&#xD;
      necessary&quot;. . For HIV infected persons the recommendation was less stringent and the position&#xD;
      paper concluded that hiv infected persons may &quot;hypothetically, benefit from a second dose or&#xD;
      booster dose &quot;.1 Recently, WHO changed the recommendations about a booster dose of YF&#xD;
      vaccine, based on the fact that serum neutralizing antibodies against YF are still at&#xD;
      detectable levels after 20-35 years and probably lifelong in immunocompetent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, data on persistence of Neutralizing antibodies Titers (NT) in&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients are missing and only few studies reported data about HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients. Additional data are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess presence / persistence of Neutralizing Titers (NT) of antibodies after YF&#xD;
      immunization in HIV-infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify risk factors for early and late waning of NT after YF immunization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To modelize kinetics of NT after YF immunization in different subpopulations of HIV&#xD;
           patients, including population of young HIV patients infected vertically&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify risk factors for absence of seroconversion in the year after YF immunization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare persistence of NT in HIV patients infected vertically or not vertically&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To quantify seroconversion rate after YF vaccination Methodology / study design This&#xD;
           study is a single arm, non randomized, cross-sectional, multicenter study in AIDS&#xD;
           Reference Centers from Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum duration of the study for each patient will be 1 visit, consisting of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the screening and inclusion visit (single visit V1) to check the patient eligibility,&#xD;
           sign informed consent, perform the biologic tests necessary for the study and answer the&#xD;
           questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whenever possible, an additional serum / plasma sample coming from serabank / plasmabank&#xD;
           will be identified for each patient. This sample must have been taken during the year&#xD;
           following YF immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  data about patient's HIV history has to be extracted from the HIV database or from&#xD;
           patients' file&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated enrolment 750 patients + 30 patients infected vertically with HIV Primary outcome&#xD;
      Number of HIV patients with protective YF NT ≥ 1:10 at different timepoints after YF&#xD;
      immunization Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of patients with protective YF NT ≥ 1:10 in the year following YF immunization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Risk factors (demographics and immunovirological parameters, antiretroviral treatment)&#xD;
           for absence of seroconversion in the year following YF immunization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Risk factors (demographics and immunovirological parameters, antiretroviral treatment)&#xD;
           of early waning (before 10 years) of YF NT&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Risk factors (demographics and immunovirological parameters, antiretroviral treatment)&#xD;
           of late waning (after 10 years) of YF NT Eligibility Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Infection with HIV-1 (vertical transmission or not) 2. Immunization with at least one&#xD;
      injection of YF vaccine (Stamaril®,17D strain Rockefeller, Sanofi Pasteur) with proof of&#xD;
      vaccine administration 3. Informed consent signed prior to any study procedure Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria Inability to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whenever possible, an additional sera or plasma sample from the year following YF&#xD;
           vaccine will be selected and analyzed to assess early seroconversion rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whenever possible, an additional sera or plasma sample from the year before YF vaccine&#xD;
           will be selected and analyzed to assess seroconversion rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In CHU Saint-Pierre, an additional cohort of patients infected vertically with HIV will&#xD;
           be selected and will participate to the study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter and cross sectional study performed in several ARC (AIDS&#xD;
      Reference Centers) in Belgium and coordinated by CHU Saint-Pierre (Brussels, Belgium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is two parts in the study: a prospective part and a retrospective part. There is no&#xD;
      control group in this study. Prospective study Sera / plasma samples of HIV patients&#xD;
      immunized with at least one injection of YF vaccine (Stamaril® ,17D strain Rockefeller,&#xD;
      Sanofi Pasteur) will be collected prospectively during the patient's single Visit. Analysis&#xD;
      of samples will assess persistence of neutralizing antibodies titers (NT) against YF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective study Whenever possible, serum or plasma sample will also be collected&#xD;
      retrospectively (from a serum/plasma bank). Retrospective collection of samples must identify&#xD;
      at least one sample per patient taken during the year before YF vaccine and from 30 days to&#xD;
      12 months following YF immunization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective study has three study timepoints :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline is defined as an available sample during the period 12 months to day 0 before YF&#xD;
      vaccination. Timepoint one is defined as a sample between one month and one year after YF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of several samples, the sample nearest to one month will be chosen. Time point two is&#xD;
      defined as the last available sample. In case the patient would have been re-vaccinated in&#xD;
      the meantime (eg for interval higher than ten years; identied as DateVaccine2), the last&#xD;
      sample before revaccination will be chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the retrospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess seroconversion rate during the year following YF immunization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify risk factors (demographics and immunovirological parameters, antiretroviral&#xD;
           treatment ) for not seroconverting after primary vaccination with YF vaccine Description&#xD;
           of the retrospective study Blood samples from HIV patients are kept, often for several&#xD;
           years, in a sample bank. Depending of YF date of immunization, samples from the year&#xD;
           before and following YF immunization will be identified and analysed. The PRNT technique&#xD;
           will be used to assess presence of YF neutralizing antibodies (Serum or Plasma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be centralized in CHU Saint-Pierre after one and two years of study. Assessment&#xD;
      of presence of neutralizing antibodies titers (NT) against YF will be performed by PRNT&#xD;
      (Plaque Reduction Neutralizing Test), which is the current gold standard technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After, the samples will be sent to France (Laboratory Cerba, Saint-Ouen l'Aumône) or in&#xD;
      Germany (Berlin) to be analyzed. The surplus of your samples will be destroyed once the&#xD;
      analyses described in this document have been carried out, i.e. in principle in maximum 10&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least one sample will be analysed for each patient. A NT ≥ 1:10 will be considered as&#xD;
      protective against natural YF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data that will be collected include demographics, date of HIV diagnosis, nadir CD4 and date,&#xD;
      % CD4, CD38/CD8 (if available), CD4 and CD8 count at time of immunization against YF and at&#xD;
      time of serological analysis, ARV therapy at time of immunization against YF and at time of&#xD;
      serological analysis, plasma HIV RNA at time of immunization against YF and at time of&#xD;
      serological analysis, number of YF vaccines, number of months with potential exposure to YF.&#xD;
      Data will be collected by questionnaire and collected by local investigator, for instance by&#xD;
      extraction from an HIV database. A CRF will then be completed by local investigators and sent&#xD;
      to the data manager in CHU Saint-Pierre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vertical transmission substudy The same design is applied to this substudy. The population&#xD;
      study is a population of HIV patients infected vertically, selected in only CHU Saint-Pierre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological analysis will be performed at Centre for Biological Threats and Special Pathogens&#xD;
      in Berlin, using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). This technique measures the&#xD;
      neutralizing titers (NT: the highest serum dilution able to induce an 80% plaque reduction in&#xD;
      cells infected by the YF17D strain). An YF virus NT ≥ 1:10 is accepted as a serologic&#xD;
      surrogate marker of clinical protection against natural Yellow Fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling and data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological analysis will be performed on freezed sera/plasma samples (available from a&#xD;
      serum/plasma bank retrospectively) or on fresh sera samples collected prospectively from HIV&#xD;
      patients followed in different Belgian ARC. Samples will be centralized every year in CHU&#xD;
      Saint-Pierre, Brussels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological analysis will be performed at one timepoint for each patient after YF&#xD;
      immunization to assess persistence of NT. When possible, it must also be performed on a&#xD;
      freezed sample from the year before and following YF vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected, for instance extracted from HIV database of ARC: age,&#xD;
      gender, mode of HIV contamination, ethnic origin, date of diagnosis of HIV, CD4 count nadir&#xD;
      and date of nadir, history of AIDS, CD38/CD8 (if available), %CD4, CD4 and CD8 count, plasma&#xD;
      HIV RNA at time of immunization against YF and at time of serological analysis, treatment for&#xD;
      HIV at time of immunization against YF and at time of serological analysis, date of start of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Date(s) of YF immunization(s) will be checked with help of International Certificate of&#xD;
      Immunization for Yellow Fever of every patient or with a medical note from Travel Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential natural YF exposure will be collected by patient questionnaire. All these data have&#xD;
      to be included in the CRF completed by local investigator(s) then sent to the data manager in&#xD;
      CHU Saint-Pierre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study for each patient is one single visit, consisting of the screening&#xD;
      and inclusion visit (visit V1) to check the patient eligibility and to perform the biologic&#xD;
      tests and exams necessary for the study.&#xD;
