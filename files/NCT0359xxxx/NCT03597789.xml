  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to better understand how to best help parents of young children with problem&#xD;
      behavior. Problem behaviors vary between and within children, but can include&#xD;
      inattention/hyperactivity, tantrums, and/or noncompliance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If eligible and choose to participate, this study includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline assessment which will include asking a series of questions about parent, child and&#xD;
      family, as well as parent-child observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible for treatment, sessions occur once per week for approximately 8 to 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Sessions include new information and lots of practice and discussion about how to make the&#xD;
      skills work best for specific families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finishing treatment a post-assessment (similar to BL) conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the assessments (i.e., video-and audio-recorded), as well as the sessions with a&#xD;
      therapist will be recorded (i.e., video recorded).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) Score-Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, study completion, approximately 10 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>The ECBI is a 36 item parent-report scale. For each item, parents rate the intensity of the behavior (0 = never to 7 = always) and whether they consider each behavior to be a problem (0 = no; 1 = yes). Clinically significant symptoms are defined by scores more than 2 standard deviations above the normed mean for the Intensity Subscale (clinical cutoff = 127) and/or Problem Subscale (clinical cutoff = 11) Scales. Intensity scores range from 36 to 252. A mean score decrease indicates a reduction in parent perception of the intensity of the problem behavior.</description>

The number of &quot;yes&quot; responses are counted and averaged. Problem scores range from 0 to 36. A mean score decrease indicates a reduction in parent perception of the number of the problem behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Change in Difficulties With Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, study completion, approximately 10 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) will be used as the measure of caregiver's emotion dysregulation. The 36-item DERS yields a composite total score as well as scores for the following subscales: 1) Nonacceptance Subscale, non-acceptance of negative emotions; 2) Goal Subscale, difficulties in engaging in goal-directed behaviors when experiencing negative emotions, 3) Impulse Subscale, impulse control difficulties; 4) Strategies Subscale, limited access to emotion regulation strategies; 5) Awareness Subscale, lack of emotional awareness; and 6) Clarity Subscale, lack of emotional clarity. DERS total scores range from 36 to 180. The composite total is reported for this small sample size. A mean score decrease indicates a reduction in parent difficulties with emotion regulation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Coping With Children's Negative Emotions Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, study completion, approximately 10 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>The Coping with Children's Negative Emotions Scale (CCNES) assesses the ways that parents cope with their children's distress and negative emotions. Participants use a 7-point Likert scale where 7 indicates high levels of specific parenting behavior (i.e. supportive and non-supportive parenting behavior). Scores are reported condensing 6 categories into 2 broader domains (supportive/non-supportive) with scores ranging from 1 to 21. Assessed at Baseline and end of study. A mean score decrease in non-supportive scores reflects an improvement in parents' non-supportive strategies and a mean score increase in the supportive score indicates improvement in parents' supportive strategies.</description>

        <description>The ECBI is a 36 item parent-report scale. For each item, parents rate the intensity of the behavior (0 = never to 7 = always) and whether they consider each behavior to be a problem (0 = no; 1 = yes).

          <title>Change in Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) Score-Intensity</title>
          <description>The ECBI is a 36 item parent-report scale. For each item, parents rate the intensity of the behavior (0 = never to 7 = always) and whether they consider each behavior to be a problem (0 = no; 1 = yes). Clinically significant symptoms are defined by scores more than 2 standard deviations above the normed mean for the Intensity Subscale (clinical cutoff = 127) and/or Problem Subscale (clinical cutoff = 11) Scales. Intensity scores range from 36 to 252. A mean score decrease indicates a reduction in parent perception of the intensity of the problem behavior.</description>

        <description>The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) will be used as the measure of caregiver's emotion dysregulation. The 36-item DERS yields a composite total score as well as scores for the following subscales: 1) Nonacceptance Subscale, non-acceptance of negative emotions; 2) Goal Subscale, difficulties in engaging in goal-directed behaviors when experiencing negative emotions, 3) Impulse Subscale, impulse control difficulties; 4) Strategies Subscale, limited access to emotion regulation strategies; 5) Awareness Subscale, lack of emotional awareness; and 6) Clarity Subscale, lack of emotional clarity. DERS total scores range from 36 to 180. The composite total is reported for this small sample size. A mean score decrease indicates a reduction in parent difficulties with emotion regulation.</description>

        <title>Change in Coping With Children's Negative Emotions Scale Score</title>
        <description>The Coping with Children's Negative Emotions Scale (CCNES) assesses the ways that parents cope with their children's distress and negative emotions. Participants use a 7-point Likert scale where 7 indicates high levels of specific parenting behavior (i.e. supportive and non-supportive parenting behavior). Scores are reported condensing 6 categories into 2 broader domains (supportive/non-supportive) with scores ranging from 1 to 21. Assessed at Baseline and end of study. A mean score decrease in non-supportive scores reflects an improvement in parents' non-supportive strategies and a mean score increase in the supportive score indicates improvement in parents' supportive strategies.</description>
