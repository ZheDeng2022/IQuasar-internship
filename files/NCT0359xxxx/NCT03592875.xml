      Objective to analyse the performance of nurses in the implementation of Nursing Care&#xD;
      Systematization - (NCS). This Study is a descriptive research developed from a qualitative&#xD;
      approach. The content analysis must be developed through three chronological poles allowing&#xD;
      the researcher to construct an analysis structure that corresponds to the needs of the&#xD;
      research and the objectives of the proposed research; The chronological poles of content&#xD;
      analysis are described as: Phase 1 - Pre-analysis, Phase 2 - Exploration of the material:&#xD;
      Phase 3 - Treatment of the results obtained and interpretation. Only a semi-structured&#xD;
      interview will be conducted with the research subjects who meet the inclusion criteria of the&#xD;
      study, preserving the identity of the individuals and guaranteeing the right to quit the&#xD;
      research at any time during the interview.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a descriptive research developed from a qualitative approach. The descriptive study&#xD;
      will allow to accurately present facts or phenomena of the studied reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative approach, according to Minayo (2010), arises from the impossibility of&#xD;
      investigating and understanding by mean of statistical data some phenomena focused on&#xD;
      perception, intuition and subjectivity. Through qualitative evaluation will be exposed&#xD;
      experience and common sense through the actions of understanding, interpreting and promoting&#xD;
      the dialectics necessary for understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research scenario&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of this research protocol will be performed at Hospital of Rio Branco -&#xD;
      HUERB, an institution maintained by the state public administration, linked to the State&#xD;
      Health Secretariat, a member of the Unified Health System (SUS). The mission of HUERB is to&#xD;
      provide humanized care with quality and ethics, respecting socio-cultural diversity to all&#xD;
      who seek an emergency care service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This emergency service attends clinical emergencies, surgical and traumatic in adults and&#xD;
      children, with back up beds in medical clinic, treatment of acute intoxication and alcohol&#xD;
      and other drug withdrawal, paediatric emergency, surgical centre and service of intensive&#xD;
      care unit. Altogether there are two hundred and four beds distributed between beds of&#xD;
      hospitalization, observation and emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This component of the Urgency and Emergency Network is one of the entry points for secondary&#xD;
      level of health care and is a reference for the entire State of Acre, Brazil, and border&#xD;
      countries, Bolivia and Peru.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be part of the set of research participants the professional nurses who perform&#xD;
      assistance activities in Hospital of Rio Branco- HUERB at the Emergency Hospital of Rio&#xD;
      Branco. It is estimated 30 interviews that will be consolidated by the saturation method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection instrument of empirical material&#xD;
&#xD;
      A semi-structured interview will be used for data collection with 16 guiding questions&#xD;
      addressing aspects related to NCS knowledge and practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The semi-structured interviews will valorise the researcher's presence and offer all possible&#xD;
      perspectives to reach the spontaneity necessary for qualitative research. The interviews&#xD;
      start from certain questions that are not born a priori, but from information that the&#xD;
      researcher already has about the phenomenon that is of interest to study. In this sense, the&#xD;
      informant will have the freedom to follow the line of his thought and his experiences within&#xD;
      the main focus placed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process of Saturation, Corpus Organization and Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The organization of the chronological poles will be carried out according to the technique of&#xD;
      Content Analysis (CA) through stages that will enable to describe and interpret the subjects'&#xD;
      speeches (Bardin, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Bardin (2009) the content analysis must be developed through three chronological&#xD;
      poles allowing the researcher to construct an analysis structure that corresponds to the&#xD;
      needs of the research and the objectives of the proposed research;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 - Pre-analysis: stage of the organization itself. In it the documents that will&#xD;
           be submitted for analysis are selected, the hypotheses and the objectives are formulated&#xD;
           and the rules that base the final interpretation are elaborated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 - Material exploration: this stage consists essentially of coding, discount or&#xD;
           enumeration operations, according to pre-formulated rules. It constitutes the&#xD;
           identification of the units of record, units of context and subjects that arise from the&#xD;
           readings. In this stage, the thematic units and registration units of this study will be&#xD;
           identified. It is emphasized that the thematic categories that were explored in this&#xD;
           phase will be built focused on the objectives in the previous phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3 - Treatment of results obtained and interpretation: the gross results will be&#xD;
           treated in a way that in the end has a meaning. At this stage, the investigator may&#xD;
           propose inferences and advance interpretations about the intended objectives or relate&#xD;
           to other unexpected discoveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the completion of data collection (conducting interviews) the researcher will consider&#xD;
      the process of saturation of the speeches of the subjects which consists in analysing the&#xD;
      empirical data that will be collected. The investigator should focus on the perception of the&#xD;
      decrease of new information in each interview, considering the saturation point when the new&#xD;
      interviews do not present additions or insignificant information to the research directed by&#xD;
      the objectives of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the steps proposed by Bardin in the pre-analysis the researcher will transcribe the&#xD;
      interviews that will allow the floating reading necessary for the initial organization of&#xD;
      CORPUS (set of documents that will be exposed to the analysis) that will be analysed;&#xD;
      Reaffirmed the objectives of the study, that are: understand the nurses' perception about&#xD;
      NCS; Describe the panorama of nursing professional performance in a hospital environment&#xD;
      without NCS; Identify in nurses' practices elements that are consistent with the NCS; and&#xD;
      identify elements that hinder the NCS implementation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the objectives of the study, the researcher predetermined the thematic categories&#xD;
      named as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Daily practices in assistance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The NCS Knowledge;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Difficulties to implement the NCS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The NCS training and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The NCS importance. Thus, to determine the end of the collection, the saturation process&#xD;
           will be used; the researcher should consider the convergence of the respondents'&#xD;
           speeches considering the categories mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the development of the content analysis is oriented the codification of textual fragments&#xD;
      called record units (RU) and subsequent construction of the called context units (CU) that&#xD;
      provide sensing to the speeches of respondents; for the implementation of the codification,&#xD;
      in the material exploration stage, rules were defined for the systematic development of the&#xD;
      enumeration and codification of the registration units by the researcher. The default rules&#xD;
      were:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Define representative colours for each category: Category 1 = YELLOW; Category 2 = RED;&#xD;
      Category 3 = GREEN; Category 4 = BLUE; and category 5 = PINK;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cut the UR by marking the colour of the representative category;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use the weighted frequency method to determine the representativeness of the categories&#xD;
           in the subjects' speeches;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the URs of NCS KNOWLEDGE using the intensity and direction method through&#xD;
           the bipolar scale;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Construct the CU using as reference the RUs and inferences arising from the exploration&#xD;
           of the material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1 presents the flowchart of the construction of the pre-analysis and structuring of&#xD;
      CORPUS for content analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all the reasoning of the rules and how the researcher will direct their analysis of&#xD;
      content, will proceed the second stage called exploration of the material; to begin the rules&#xD;
      implementation the researcher should develop a new reading of CORPUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CORPUS in this research will be structured in an excel worksheet composed by the&#xD;
      transcription of the answers of the respondents, tables with the registration of RU, CU and&#xD;
      analytical categories according to Bardin technique, analytical categories and evidences&#xD;
      identified with the analysis, registration of the weighted frequencies of the RUs by&#xD;
      category, evaluation of the direction and intensity of the RUs for the NCS KNOWLEDGE category&#xD;
      and a synthesis of saturation/category points that determined the closure of the data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the implementation of the CORPUS reading, the RU/category will be cut using the coloured&#xD;
      rule predetermined in the previous step for all the speeches of the subjects interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of the weighted frequency will allow the correct direction of the analysis of&#xD;
      each questioning for the thematic categories and the use of the intensity and direction for&#xD;
      the RUs referring to the NCS KNOWLEDGE category to define the intensity of the right and&#xD;
      wrong answers by the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploration of the material will enable the codification and enumeration of RUs and the&#xD;
      construction of CUs, which is the first significant inference for the analysis of the&#xD;
      subjects' speech and interpretations made by the researcher. Table I shows an example of how&#xD;
      the RU and CU will be organized by analytical category, which is the product of the&#xD;
      exploraion phase of the material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure II represents an example of the flow chart of the implementation of the rules&#xD;
      described above and the beginning of the organization of the evidences that will be&#xD;
      identified until step 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third stage, called Treatment of the results obtained and interpretation, a revision&#xD;
      of the CU will be implemented, finalizing the construction of it and organizing the main&#xD;
      evidences raised in step 2 to proceed a later interpretation of the results obtained with the&#xD;
      exploration of the material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this stage the construction of the table with the categories and a summary of the&#xD;
      evidences that will be submitted to the interpretation of the researcher are going to&#xD;
      completed and will support the construction of the final report of the results and final&#xD;
      discussion of the research in the light of the NCS literature.&#xD;
