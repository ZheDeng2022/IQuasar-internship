      A BIOTRONIK wearable stimulator will be utilized in order to investigate the effects of two&#xD;
      study spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapies on subject reported pain and paresthesia&#xD;
      perception observed over 12 days of study stimulation testing following the conclusion of a&#xD;
      successful SCS commercial trial.&#xD;
