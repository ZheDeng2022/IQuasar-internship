  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safe and independent mobility at home and in the community requires control of walking while&#xD;
      accomplishing other functional tasks. A hallmark of healthy control of walking is&#xD;
      automaticity, defined as the ability of the nervous system to successfully coordinate&#xD;
      movement with minimal use of attention-demanding executive resources [1]. Recent evidence&#xD;
      indicates that walking disorders are often characterized by a shift in the locomotor control&#xD;
      strategy from healthy automaticity to compensatory executive control. This shift is&#xD;
      potentially detrimental to walking performance as an executive control strategy is not&#xD;
      optimized for locomotor control and it places excessive demands on a limited pool of&#xD;
      cognitive reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators hypothesize that walking automaticity, as measured by the prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex activity while walking, will be improved by donepezil (a cholinesterase inhibitor).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A challenge to studying automaticity is that central nervous system circuitry for locomotion&#xD;
      cannot be directly assessed in humans so shifts between automaticity and executive control&#xD;
      have been inferred with a dual-task paradigm. If gait slows or deteriorates during a&#xD;
      concurrent cognitive task, gait is deemed less automatic and using more cortical control.&#xD;
      Recently, a more direct measure of automaticity has been studied with functional near&#xD;
      infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is used to measure changes in cortical oxygenated&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HbO2) levels using light-tissue interaction properties of light within the near&#xD;
      infrared range, similar to the way the HbO2 is detected with magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
      Increased oxygenated hemoglobin are related to increased blood flow, which, in turn, reflects&#xD;
      increased cortical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study shows higher than normal activation of the prefrontal cortex during usual&#xD;
      walking in patients with PD, an indicator of increased cortical control and reduced&#xD;
      automaticity. An enhanced understanding of the neurochemistry underlying gait automaticity in&#xD;
      PD will have implications for pharmacologic management of gait impairment in PD. If reduced&#xD;
      gait automaticity is due to depressed central dopamine, then more aggressive dopaminergic&#xD;
      strategies may be in order. On the other hand, if reduced gait automaticity is due to&#xD;
      depressed central cholinergic tone (as the investigators hypothesize), then cholinergic&#xD;
      strategies will be more effective for optimizing gait in PD. Few studies have explored the&#xD;
      positive effects of cholinergic augmentation on gait and falls but none have examined its&#xD;
      direct effects on gait automaticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim I. Examine the effect of donepezil or levodopa on walking automaticity, as measured by&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex activity while walking. This study will employ a double-blind, two-way&#xD;
      crossover design in which 20 participants with idiopathic PD will be tested either after 14&#xD;
      days of placebo and their regular dose of levodopa or after 14 days of donepezil (5 mg/day&#xD;
      oral) and their regular dose of levodopa. Levodopa doses are not determined or controlled by&#xD;
      the investigators, as the recruited participants are already on levodopa specific to their&#xD;
      own needs. The investigators will measure automaticity by measuring the activity of the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex while walking in single- and dual-task conditions with a wireless fNIRS&#xD;
      system. The investigators predict that donepezil plus levodopa will decrease the prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex activity, indicating more automaticity, during walking compared to placebo and&#xD;
      levodopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim II. Relate walking automaticity with spatio-temporal measures of walking. In addition to&#xD;
      walking automaticity measured with fNIRS while walking, subjects will be equipped with 3&#xD;
      inertial sensors to measure spatio-temporal features of gait, such as stride time, stride&#xD;
      length and their variability. The investigators hypothesize that variability of gait will be&#xD;
      related to level of prefrontal cortex activity. The investigators predict that variability of&#xD;
      gait will not change with levodopa, reflecting prefrontal control of walking. In contrast,&#xD;
      the investigators predict that donepezil will improve variability of gait, both with and&#xD;
      without a concurrent, cognitive task.&#xD;
