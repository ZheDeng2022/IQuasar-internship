  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seroma is the most common complication at the beginning of healing after surgery for breast&#xD;
      cancer treatment. Its incidence varies in the literature from 2.5 to 90% and is defined as a&#xD;
      collection of serous fluid that develops through skin flaps in the dead space after&#xD;
      mastectomy or axillary dissection. The physiopathology for seroma formation has not yet been&#xD;
      fully understood, but appears to be multifactorial with surgery being the main factor.&#xD;
      Although seroma formation is not a threat to life, it can lead to important morbidity due to&#xD;
      associated with necrosis, dehiscence, predisposition to sepsis, reduction of shoulder&#xD;
      functions due to muscle weakness due to restriction of movement, prolonging the recovery&#xD;
      period and, consequently, leading to delay in adjuvant therapy. The best seroma treatment is&#xD;
      still not well defined in the literature and the compressive therapy aims to rebalance fluid&#xD;
      exchange between the lymphatic system and blood, having as effects the increase of the&#xD;
      interstitial pressure, the improvement of the effectiveness of muscular work, increased&#xD;
      resistance of the skin and prevention new collection of interstitial fluid. Recently, the&#xD;
      Kinesio® Taping method were inserted into clinical practice for its ability to reduce pain&#xD;
      and local swelling. Objective: To evaluate the safety of taping in the seroma after surgical&#xD;
      treatment of breast cancer. Methodology: This is a pre and post-clinical application of&#xD;
      taping on the seroma in women submitted to surgical treatment for breast cancer in the Cancer&#xD;
      Hospital III / INCA. The intervention was performed by applying the compression bandage over&#xD;
      the seroma region for an average of five days, when the reassessment was performed.&#xD;

      Patients identified by the nursing team with seroma and with indication of aspiration&#xD;
      puncture, will be evaluated for eligibility criteria. Those who agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be assessed and submitted to the intervention on the same day, they will remain&#xD;
      with four days approximately for nursing and physiotherapy revaluation for intervention&#xD;
      suspension. The neuromuscular bandage will be applied after skin antisepsis with 70% alcohol.&#xD;
      A 5 cm width Vitaltape® neuromuscular bandage will be used. For the bandage application, a&#xD;
      distal base (anchor) with two centimeters of diameter will be maintained with maximum&#xD;
      stretching on the fluctuation region (seroma) and finalized with another base without&#xD;
      stretching, of 2 centimeters, in the proximal region. How many bundles of bandages are&#xD;
      required according to the patient's body characteristics and aspect of the flotation region.&#xD;
      The bandage will not be applied on the scar. If there are any complications such as itching,&#xD;
      redness, discomfort and / or others, the patients will remove the material at home and&#xD;
      communicate on return to the institution. The interview will be conducted at the entrance to&#xD;
      the study, prior to the intervention and the end of the study. In the initial interview will&#xD;
      be collected sociodemographic data and life habits. They will be evaluated by questionnaire&#xD;
      as the local symptoms caused by the use of the bandages, the tolerance and feeling / referred&#xD;
      sensation during and at the end of intervention period, the percentage of seroma volume&#xD;
      alteration before and after the use of the bandage, the number of days of use and bandage&#xD;
      detachment. All reviews will be carried out by another professional who will not make the&#xD;
      interventions. From the hospital record, information will be collected regarding the oncology&#xD;
      treatment, histopathological report and clinical data on curative care.&#xD;

    <description>It was counted how many of the 35 patients felt pain, itching, burning, discomfort, tightness, increased fluctuation (seroma) at the place where the bandage was applied. The symptoms were graded according to the Visual Numeric Scale (0-10), where 0 was considered to be sensations and 10 was unbearable sensation with the use of bandages.</description>
