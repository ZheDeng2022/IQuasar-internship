      The anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) assay is a functional assay that facilitates the measurement of&#xD;
      antithrombin (AT)-catalyzed inhibition of factor Xa by unfractionated heparin (UFH) and&#xD;
      direct inhibition of factor Xa by low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). As a result,&#xD;
      Anti-factor Xa level reflect the in situ pharmacological activity of LMWH. 0.2 to 0.5&#xD;
      units/ml has been considered to be the desired level for prevention of VTE. Although this&#xD;
      method was available since the 1970s, their cost was viewed to prohibit their broad use until&#xD;
      recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies determined the safety and effectiveness of fixed dose prophylactic regiments&#xD;
      via clinical outcomes. This strategy has several shortcomings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study was there for devised to examine in vivo activity of LMWH in patients&#xD;
      receiving a fixed dose prophylactic regimen, in order to assess the effectiveness of this&#xD;

&#xD;
      The current study was there for devised to examine in vivo activity of LMWH in patients&#xD;
      receiving a fixed dose prophylactic regimen, in order to assess the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose To perform an exploratory prospective analysis of longitudinal data sets to assess&#xD;
      anti-factor Xa levels in a cohort of patients recovering from acute ischemic stroke and&#xD;
      receiving prophylactic-dose LMWH for VTE prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assess anti-factor Xa levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. adverse events related to thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. adverse event related to hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographic data Patient anthropometric data Adverse events/weekly (falls,&#xD;
      infections, VTE, stress ulcer…) Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ages Eligible for Study: 40 Years to 80 Years (Adult, Senior) Gender Eligible for Study: All&#xD;
      Accepts Healthy Volunteers: No Sampling Method: Non-Probability Sample Study Population&#xD;
      Patients hospitalized for rehabilitation following acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical decision to administer LMWH prophylactic treatment will be made in line with&#xD;
      standard clinical practice and in accordance to the criteria described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Search for patients diagnosed with sub-acute stroke and receiving LMWH treatment will be&#xD;
      performed on the digital database of the Loewenstien rehabilitation hospital Rannana, Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving LMWH prophylaxis with fixed dose regimen will be recruited flowing signing&#xD;
      of consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flowing at least 7 consecutive days of treatment blood sample will be drown 3-4 hours post&#xD;
      LMWH administration and sent for The anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) assay. In the event of high or&#xD;
      low results the Hematological consult will be contacted for decision about dose adjustment or&#xD;
      other intervention/investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be drawn from patient's electronic/hardcopy files. patient characteristics&#xD;
      (age, gender, , past medical history), Stroke characteristics (type, location, NIHSS), days&#xD;
      from stroke onset to rehabilitation admission, along with each patient's length of stay,&#xD;
      neurological impairments, and Rehabilitation outcomes. Trained research associates, who are&#xD;
      familiar with the process of chart review, will extract the information from the charts using&#xD;
      the form provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: multi variant combative analysis of outcome measures will be carried&#xD;
      out to compare study and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated Enrollment: 100 patients&#xD;
