  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed work is based on the finding that one-third of the world is infected with the&#xD;
      bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and only 10% of these individuals develop TB. The&#xD;
      study aims to identify factors that drive progression to disease and study signals (markers&#xD;
      of the immune response) that detect who will progress to active TB and why this happens.&#xD;
      Armed with these markers, the study will address how malnutrition and worms alter this signal&#xD;
      profile to cause active TB. The work will be conducted in India, where there are 2.8 million&#xD;
      TB cases each year - more than any other country - and where the government has committed to&#xD;
      eliminating TB by 2035. Data suggest that malnutrition and parasites increase risk of TB&#xD;
      disease so the investigators will feed malnourished household contacts and have those with&#xD;
      parasites receive medication to treat these. Using this infrastructure, the investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the immunologic impact of feeding on TB pathogenesis. An additional aim is to&#xD;
      understand the role of parasitic worms with the goal of determining the utility of low-cost&#xD;
      ($.02 per dose) worm treatment as part of TB control efforts. Risk of developing TB will be&#xD;
      evaluated for 120 household contacts of TB patients in the setting of their malnutrition and&#xD;
      parasites. There are four study arms comprised of thirty participants each -- malnourished&#xD;
      with parasite infection, malnourished with no parasite infection, well-nourished with&#xD;
      parasite infection, and well-nourished with no parasite infection. Correlates of risk of&#xD;
      disease will be assessed using blood mRNA/miRNA sequencing and T cell immune markers. The TB&#xD;
      LION study will confirm that malnutrition and worms increase the risk of active TB and will&#xD;
      provide the basis for effective interventions that could change the face of the TB pandemic&#xD;
      and have a profound impact on the health of people worldwide. Participants in this study will&#xD;
      be household contacts of tuberculosis index cases. The index cases in this study do not&#xD;
      participate in the study once a household contact is established. All interventions and&#xD;
      follow up are only being conducted within the household contact cohort. All intervention&#xD;
      supplies, treatments, and biologics will be purchased internationally.&#xD;

As CFSE concentrations in a cell are halved with every cell division, each generation of cells appears as a distinct peak on the flow cytometry histogram providing a proliferative index.
