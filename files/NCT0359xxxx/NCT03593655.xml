    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of and adherence to a vaginal matrix ring&#xD;
      (VR) containing dapivirine and oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) in&#xD;
      adolescent and young adult females.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of and adherence to a vaginal matrix ring (VR) containing&#xD;
      dapivirine and oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) in adolescent and&#xD;
      young adult females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adolescent and young adult females between 16&#xD;
      and 21 years of age. Participants will be randomized to one of two sequences of one VR&#xD;
      containing 25 mg of dapivirine to be inserted monthly for 24 weeks and one 200 mg FTC/300 mg&#xD;
      TDF oral tablet taken daily for 24 weeks. After completing the randomized sequence of two&#xD;
      study product use periods, participants will then select between the two study products to&#xD;
      use in the final 24 weeks of the trial. Participants will be able to choose either or neither&#xD;
      study product during the third product use period. The study includes approximately 76 weeks&#xD;
      of follow-up per participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend monthly study visits, which may include behavioral&#xD;
      assessments/counseling; physical and pelvic examinations; and blood, urine, and pelvic sample&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;

                  uncontrolled active or chronic cardiovascular, renal, liver, hematologic,&#xD;
                  neurologic, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, endocrine, respiratory, immunologic&#xD;
                  disorder or infectious disease.&#xD;

                       providing informed assent/consent for screening, the participant may be&#xD;
