    <description>Prior to the start of study medication, tumor tissue and blood will be collected as baseline. Olaparib 300mg bid will be started after the collection of tumor and blood. Olaparib will be given on days 1-28 days without rest.&#xD;
Tumor tissue and blood will be collected on day 14 before administration of durvalumab, to see the change in biomarkers after 2 weeks of olaparib treatment. After the acquisition of tumor and blood, durvalumab will be given in a fixed one dose of 1.5 gram on day 15.&#xD;
On day 29, there will be a third acquisition of tumor and blood, to see the change in biomarkers after combination treatment of olaparib and durvalumab. Tumor response will also be evaluated according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 based on CT.</description>
