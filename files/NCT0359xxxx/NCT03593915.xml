  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alvocidib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK 9) inhibitor, in time-sequential therapy&#xD;
      demonstrated significant clinical activity in secondary AML patients with prior MDS. Patients&#xD;
      with IPSS-R intermediate and above MDS have an increased risk of developing AML and may be&#xD;
      treated with the same chemotherapy regimens used in patients with AML. Eight Phase I or II&#xD;
      clinical trials have been completed in patients with AML, totaling more than 400 patients&#xD;
      with both relapsed/refractory or newly diagnosed AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies have demonstrated that decitabine exposure increased the expression of&#xD;
      NOXA, which is a specific antagonist of the survival factor MCL 1. Pharmacologic&#xD;
      downregulation of MCL-1 via CDK 9 inhibition, as well as upregulation of the MCL-1&#xD;
      antagonist, NOXA, following decitabine exposure may result in enhanced antileukemic activity&#xD;
      in MCL-1-dependent malignancies.&#xD;

      PHASE 1b:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3-6 patients. Escalation of the alvocidib dose will&#xD;
      follow a standard 3+3 design with sequential cohorts of 3 patients treated with incrementally&#xD;
      higher doses of alvocidib administered in sequence after decitabine (during dose escalation)&#xD;
      or azacitidine until a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed and the MTD is established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD or preliminary RP2D of alvocidib administered via hybrid dosing is identified, 2&#xD;
      cohorts of at least 3 patients each will receive azacitadine followed by alvocidib&#xD;
      administered as a 30-60 minute IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion at MTD Once the MTD or preliminary RP2D of alvocidib administered as a 30-to-60&#xD;
      minute IV infusion is determined, up to 25 patients will be enrolled in an Expansion cohort&#xD;
      to receive alvocidib following azacitadine to confirm safety, explore potential biomarkers,&#xD;
      and evaluate potential signals of alvocidib activity. Once this Expansion cohort is&#xD;
      completed, the study will progress to Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 design is based on the Simon 2-stage minimax design (Simon 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1: Up to 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled and treated at the RP2D identified&#xD;
           in the Phase 1b study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2: Ten patients will be enrolled to bring the total enrollment in Phase 2&#xD;
           (including Stage-1 patients) to 25 evaluable patients. Stage-2 patients will also&#xD;
           receive the RP2D dose of alvocidib administered by 30-to-60 minute IV infusion&#xD;
           identified in the Phase 1b study. If 6 or more responses are observed in 25 patients,&#xD;
           the conclusion will be that the combination regimen is worthy of further investigation.&#xD;
