      This Phase I-II dose-finding trial to determine the optimal dose of intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      injection dose of donor-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for CMV, EBV, BKV and&#xD;
      Adenovirus. A maximum of 36 patients will be treated in up to 18 cohorts each of size 2, with&#xD;
      the first cohort treated at the lowest dose level 1, all successive doses chosen by the&#xD;
      EffTox method, and no untried dose level skipped when escalating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific goal of the trial is to determine an optimal IV-CTL cell dose level among the&#xD;
      three doses 1.0x107cells/m2, 2 x107cells/m2 and 5x107cells/m2., hereafter dose levels 1, 2,&#xD;
      3. Dose-finding will be done using the sequentially adaptive EffTox trade-off-based design of&#xD;

      This Phase I-II dose-finding trial to determine the optimal dose of intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      injection dose of donor-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for CMV, EBV, BKV and&#xD;
      Adenovirus. A maximum of 36 patients will be treated in up to 18 cohorts each of size 2, with&#xD;
      the first cohort treated at the lowest dose level 1, all successive doses chosen by the&#xD;
      EffTox method, and no untried dose level skipped when escalating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific goal of the trial is to determine an optimal IV-CTL cell dose level among the&#xD;
      three doses 1.0x107cells/m2, 2 x107cells/m2 and 5x107cells/m2., hereafter dose levels 1, 2,&#xD;
      3. Dose-finding will be done using the sequentially adaptive EffTox trade-off-based design of&#xD;
      Thall et al. To implement the design's model using the latest EffTox version 4.0.12 program,&#xD;
      doses will coded numerically to be 1, 2, 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV/AdV /EBV/BKV specific T cells will be thawed and given or thawed and diluted into a total&#xD;
      volume of 10 mL of Plasmalyte A by slow intravenous injection over 1-2 minutes. This is a&#xD;
      traditional Phase I dose escalation study of a single infusion of CMV/AdV/EBV/BKV-specific&#xD;
      CTLs to patients at risk for CMV and EBV reactivation and Adenoviral and BK virus infection&#xD;
      after umbilical cord blood transplantation. Three dose levels will be explored. The lowest&#xD;
      dose level will be 1x107cells/m2 and the highest will be 5x107/m2. There will be 2-6 patients&#xD;
      at each dose level (depending on toxicity) following the scheme below. The decision on&#xD;
      whether it is safe to escalate to next dose level or not will be made after at least two&#xD;
      patients in each dose level have finished their 45-days toxicity follow up. If the first two&#xD;
      patients have not finished their 45 days follow-up, up to 2 additional incoming patients can&#xD;
      be enrolled at the current dose level. In addition, we will give the option of administering&#xD;
      2 additional doses (at the same dose level), 28 days after the first infusion of the same&#xD;
      dose, in subjects who have a partial response after one dose or who have received other&#xD;
      therapy that may affect the persistence or function of the infused CTL in vivo. If there are&#xD;
      no toxicities and immunological efficacy is not seen at any dose, then the doses will be&#xD;
      further escalated after additional local and federal approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Levels and Dosing Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level CTL Dose Given from Day +30 post SCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1x107/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 2.0x107/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 5x107/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escalation of Multi-virus-specific CTL infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV/AdV/EBV/BKV CTL will be given from day +30 either as prophylaxis or treatment for CMV,&#xD;
      EBV, BK and/or adenovirus infection. If the patient has viral reactivation or evidence of&#xD;
      CMV/EBV/AdV/BKV disease (e.g. pneumonitis, gastroenteritis and/or retinitis or Post&#xD;
      Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD) or hemorrhagic cystitis the CTL can be given&#xD;
      with concurrent antiviral pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose escalation scheme utilizing cohorts of two patients will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort of 2 patients will be treated and observed for 45 days for toxicity, dose&#xD;
      escalation, and GvHD. The algorithm described in Section 9 will be used to determine the dose&#xD;
      for each cohort. If 1x107CTL/m2 results in unacceptable toxicity or efficacy, the study will&#xD;
      be closed to accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Optimal Dose of Infused CMV/AdV/EBV/BKV-Specific CTL&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all patients in the trial have been evaluated, the optimal dose of infused&#xD;
      CMV/AdV/EBV-specific CTL will be determined by the algorithm using the sequentially adaptive&#xD;
      EffTox trade-off-based design of Thall et al.&#xD;
