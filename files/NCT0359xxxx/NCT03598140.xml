  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 300,000 people are hospitalized for traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year. After TBI,&#xD;
      secondary brain injury escalates due in part to heightened levels of oxidant injury,&#xD;
      inflammation, and vascular injury. Traumatic cerebral vascular injury (TCVI) may begin almost&#xD;
      immediately after the primary injury and evolve into chronic neurodegenerative conditions.&#xD;
      TCVI is a very complex TBI endophenotype and microvascular injuries have been described in a&#xD;
      plethora of animal and human TBI studies. These injuries consist of endothelial injury,&#xD;
      disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB), a reduction of capillary density, intravascular&#xD;
      microthrombi, and white-matter degeneration. Recently, use of magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI)-Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) combined with hypercapnia (high spatial and&#xD;
      temporal resolution) by our research group has proven to be more sensitive at measuring&#xD;
      alterations of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in TBI subjects. The goal of the proposed research&#xD;
      is to test the efficacy of ViagraÂ® (sildenafil) at normalizing CBF and improving cognitive&#xD;
      outcomes in people that have experienced a TBI. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5)&#xD;
      inhibitor that has previously been administered as a therapy for high blood pressure and&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction. In people that have been affected by stroke-induce neurotrauma,&#xD;
      sildenafil improved CBF and was found to be neuroprotective. With respect to chronic TBI,&#xD;
      previous studies have demonstrated that sildenafil therapy potentiates cardiovascular&#xD;
      reactivity (CVR) in areas of the brain with damaged endothelium. In this proposal, the&#xD;
      investigators will test the hypothesis that sildenafil treatment in boxers/Mixed Martial Arts&#xD;
      (MMA) fighters soon after concussion normalizes CBF, potentiates CVR, reduces post-concussion&#xD;
      symptoms, and improves cognition.&#xD;

      In this study, 100 professional boxers that experience a concussion will be enrolled,&#xD;
      randomized to either placebo or sildenafil (60mg) drug treatment, and arterial spin labeling&#xD;
      and BOLD-MRI with hypercapnia will used to assess CBF and CVR, respectively. Symptom&#xD;
      reporting, blood biomarkers, and neuropsychological testing will also be conducted. The&#xD;
      timepoints for this study are baseline (pre-fight), and once between days 1 and 3 and day 30&#xD;
      after injury.&#xD;
