  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Readmissions increasingly serve as a metric of hospital performance, inviting quality&#xD;
      improvement initiatives in both medicine and surgery. Recently, a readmission reduction&#xD;
      program in the United States was associated with significantly shorter length of stay,&#xD;
      earlier discharge, and reduced 30-day readmission after elective neurosurgery. These results&#xD;
      underscore the importance of patient education and surveillance after hospital discharge, and&#xD;
      it would be beneficial to test whether the same approach yields beneficial results in a&#xD;
      different health system, the NHS. In this study, the investigators will replicate the&#xD;
      Transitional Care Program (TCP) published by Robertson et al.(Journal of Neurosurgery 2017)&#xD;
      with the goal of decreasing length of stay, improving discharge efficiency, and reducing&#xD;
      readmissions in neurosurgical patients by optimizing patient education and post-discharge&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;

      Discharge Program Process Abbreviations: AA: administrative assistant; MRN: medical record&#xD;
      number; OT: occupational therapy; PT: physical therapy; and TCT = Transitional Care Team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINIC (pre-enrolment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has clinic visit with surgeon and is identified for surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgeon identifies that the patient is eligible to participate in the program and&#xD;
           consents the patient for enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be given a written information sheet on the program, and will have the&#xD;
           opportunity to receive the information via email as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their consent will be obtained in clinic; the use of interpreters will be used for&#xD;
           individuals with special communication needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AFTER CLINIC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once individuals consent to be randomised into the study, their MRN will be given to the&#xD;
           TCP nurse, who will randomise the patient into the control or intervention group using a&#xD;
           random number generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients randomised to the TCP will be given a pre-determined discharge date when they&#xD;
           are called to schedule their operation. The anticipated discharge date will be&#xD;
           determined by each surgeon's expected length of stay per procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AA provides brief intro to patient about the discharge pilot, including need for family&#xD;
           member to be present to take patient home after appointment is complete. The surgery and&#xD;
           discharge appointments are then booked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AA sends surgical letter (with anticipated length of stay and discharge appointment&#xD;
           date/time) and discharge pilot postcard to patient via email or mail&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AA enters case and discharge information into NSU Discharge Calendar&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transitional Care Team (TCT) checks NSU Discharge Calendar daily for scheduled cases and&#xD;
           discharge appointments&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMISSION (TCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCT monitors operating theatre regularly for post-op pilot patients and visits daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCT updates Safety Round white boards with all discharge appointment information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCT sends daily dept. email, including PT/OT, with following day's discharge appointment&#xD;
           details&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMISSION (INPATIENT/OUTPATIENT TEAMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is deemed appropriate for impending discharge by neurosurgery team&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCT updates Safety Rounds white board and discusses discharge checklist with care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatient team completes discharge summary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatient team completes take-away medication list by 4pm one day prior to discharge&#xD;
           appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatient team rationalises the need for further blood tests (as part of standard&#xD;
           medical treatment, not for study purposes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatient team confirms PT/OT is complete&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatient team completes discharge checklist and puts in letter tray in TCP Nurse office&#xD;
           for collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-DISCHARGE APPOINTMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staff nurse or ward sister discharges patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCT pulls discharge medications from pharmacy for appointments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthcare assistant or staff nurse transports patient to discharge appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge appointment checklist completed by TCT for appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteer transports patient to hospital exit or Discharge Lounge&#xD;
&#xD;
      AFTER POST-DISCHARGE APPOINTMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCT/volunteer scans signed discharge appointment checklist into medical record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCT/volunteer records data in the spreadsheet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCT/volunteer shreds checklists&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCT communicates any outstanding issues to primary teams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is asked to complete a patient satisfaction survey which will be sent via post&#xD;
           and email. A second request will be sent at one week and two weeks post discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP PHONE CALLS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After completion of post-discharge appointments, TCT makes follow-up phone calls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Call template is completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Call template is scanned into medical record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All outstanding issues will be signed out to the primary teams by the TCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be collected through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intake forms Longitudinal data collection from hospital medical records and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will be 30-day unplanned hospital re-admissions (to the same institution as&#xD;
      the index operation) and length of hospital stay, the latter of which will be evaluated&#xD;
      continuously by the number of hours of the initial hospitalisation. Time of discharge (with&#xD;
      an early discharge defined as before 12:00 PM) will also be recorded.&#xD;
