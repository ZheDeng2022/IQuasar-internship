  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer continues to have the dubious honor of being the leading cause of premature mortality&#xD;
      in Canada. The good news is, advances in early detection and cancer treatments are extending&#xD;
      the lives of those diagnosed with the disease. However, as more people are living longer, the&#xD;
      impact of the therapies used to treat the disease are becoming increasingly apparent. Ranging&#xD;
      from the physiological to psychological, cancer survivors are often confronted with&#xD;
      substantial, disabling, and life-threatening consequences. The benefits of physical activity&#xD;
      (all movement) and exercise more specifically have long been established as a means of&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of chronic disease. Several recent reviews and meta-analyses have&#xD;
      demonstrated that exercise is a safe and effective means of preventing and improving a&#xD;
      multitude of physical and psychological treatment and disease-related sequelae across the&#xD;
      cancer trajectory. For example, we know that cancer survivors who exercise not only have a&#xD;
      reduced risk of disease recurrence and cancer mortality, but also have reduced acute/late&#xD;
      effects of their cancer and/or its treatment such as anxiety, depression, and cancer-related&#xD;
      pain. Regrettably, despite our substantial knowledge base, the majority of cancer survivors&#xD;
      are not sufficiently active to realize these benefits over the long-term. Moreover, even with&#xD;
      the development of evidence-based guidelines, exercise has not yet been widely implemented as&#xD;
      a standard of care in the oncology setting largely due to a lack of resources, exercise&#xD;
      expertise, and awareness of benefits. Continuing to provide cancer care with little guidance&#xD;
      and understanding of the benefits of exercise places cancer survivors at an increased risk&#xD;
      for recurrence, late effects, and/or onset of additional co-morbidities, and premature&#xD;
      mortality. Therefore, it is important to consider best practices that will optimize and&#xD;
      improve quality of survival. Building on the ongoing work of our Alberta-based colleagues and&#xD;
      the Alberta Cancer Exercise (ACE) Program (an evidence-based clinic-to-community cancer&#xD;
      exercise model), Activating Cancer Communities through an Exercise Strategy for Survivors&#xD;
      (ACCESS) is designed to bridge the gap between research and practice and in doing so, lessen&#xD;
      the impact of a cancer diagnosis and its treatment(s) on the physical and psychological&#xD;
      well-being of cancer survivors.&#xD;

      Study Design: Type 2, hybrid implementation-effectiveness study The proposed project is&#xD;
      strongly aligned with the multidisciplinary Alberta Cancer Exercise (ACE; Culos-Reed and&#xD;
      McNeely, Co-PIs) lifestyle initiative - a result of the accumulation of over 15 years of&#xD;
      research in the design, implementation and evaluation of cancer exercise programs. While the&#xD;
      Alberta model has and will continue to be adapted to the Nova Scotia context, the utilization&#xD;
      of a Canadian-based, integrated cancer exercise model, with demonstrated success and existing&#xD;
      training resources will provide the much-needed framework to improve health outcomes in&#xD;
      cancer patients/survivors. In brief, ACCESS will facilitate oncologist referral of survivors&#xD;
      to a hospital-based, Certified Exercise Physiologist (CEP) as well as &quot;Cancer Exercise Wise&quot;&#xD;
      certified community-based fitness professionals. The CEP will be responsible for screening&#xD;
      and triaging survivors to assess participant interests and needs and to determine the&#xD;
      appropriate level of activity and any supervision required to maximize benefits and ensure&#xD;
      participant safety. Following screening the CEP will link the survivor with the appropriate&#xD;
      hospital or community-based physical activity supports (see &quot;TRIAGE PATHWAY&quot;). Exercise&#xD;
      programming will include aerobic, resistance, balance, and flexibility training and will be&#xD;
      consistent with the exercise delivery model developed for ACE&#xD;
      (www.albertacancerexercise.com). Participants will include adult cancer survivors of all&#xD;
      cancers and stages at any point along the cancer care trajectory. Eligibility: Participants&#xD;
      will be screened for eligibility and must: 1) Have a diagnosis of cancer; 2) Be 18+ years; 3)&#xD;
      Be able to participate in mild levels of physical activity (at a minimum); 4) Be&#xD;
      pre-treatment, receiving active treatment, or have received cancer treatment within the past&#xD;
      5 years or have a late presenting/ongoing side-effects related to the cancer diagnosis; 5) be&#xD;
      willing to attend a 12-week exercise program in Halifax; and 5) Be able to provide informed&#xD;
      written consent in English. A Certified Exercise Physiologist (CEP), housed within the QEII&#xD;
      cancer care center (Halifax, NS), will have (medically approved) consenting participants&#xD;
      complete a baseline PA and cancer specific screening measure to determine&#xD;
      appropriateness/preferences for hospital and/or community-based PA participation. The CEP&#xD;
      will oversee baseline physical fitness testing and will evaluate screening and testing&#xD;
      results. The CEP will then triage the participant to a hospital or a local community-based&#xD;
      fitness center depending on their cancer-related needs and programming preferences. The&#xD;
      hospital site, under direct supervision of the CEP, will be used for those with identified&#xD;
      cancer or other health-related needs that preclude exercising in a community-based setting.&#xD;
      The community-based site will be supported by the CEP and will serve those participants&#xD;
      cleared to exercise under a &quot;Cancer and Exercise&quot; trained fitness professional, but without&#xD;
      high medical needs that would require direct CEP supervision. INTERVENTION: PA programming&#xD;
      will be consistent with the exercise delivery models used in pilot programming both in&#xD;
      Alberta and here in Halifax (EXACT) and will include a combination of aerobic, resistance,&#xD;
      balance, and flexibility exercises delivered in a circuit-type class setting or&#xD;
      group/individual personal training format, twice weekly, for 12-weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: A&#xD;
      mixed-methods approach will be used to assess study outcomes. Patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      (effectiveness measures) will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, 6 and 12 month&#xD;
      follow-up. Implementation outcomes will be assessed throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
