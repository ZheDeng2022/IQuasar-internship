  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol for compassionate use combines 2 different ways of fighting disease: antibodies&#xD;
      and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers, and&#xD;
      both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This&#xD;
      protocol combines both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment. The&#xD;
      investigational treatment is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells&#xD;
      targeted against the CD19 antigen (ATLCAR.CD19) administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells and will increase their&#xD;
      ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this&#xD;
      study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells&#xD;
      because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD19. For this protocol, the&#xD;
      anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it&#xD;
      is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called&#xD;
      a chimeric receptor. These CD19 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to&#xD;
      kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of&#xD;
      fighting the cancer are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results have shown that many subjects receiving this treatment have experienced&#xD;
      unwanted side effects including cytokine release syndrome. In this protocol, to help reduce&#xD;
      cytokine release syndrome symptoms, the ATLCAR.CD19 cells have a safety switch that when&#xD;
      active, can cause the cells to become dormant. These modified ATLCAR.CD19 cells with the&#xD;
      safety switch are referred to as iC9-CAR19 cells. If the patient experiences moderate to&#xD;
      severe cytokine release syndrome as a result of being given iC9-CAR19 cells, the patient can&#xD;
      be given a dose of a second study drug, AP1903, if standard interventions fail to alleviate&#xD;
      the symptoms of cytokine release syndrome. AP1903 activates the iC9-CAR19 safety switch,&#xD;
      reducing the number of the iC9-CAR19 cells in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to treat a single patient with a second dose of&#xD;
      iC9-CAR19 T cells.&#xD;

      Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive a lymphodepleting regimen of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day administered&#xD;
      IV over 30 min for three consecutive days and a single IV dose of cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2&#xD;
      administered over 1 hr on the fourth day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of iC9-CAR19 T cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post lymphodepletion, if the patient meets eligibility criteria for cellular therapy, then&#xD;
      will receive iC9-CAR19 T cells within 2-14 days after completing the pre-conditioning&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen. We will administer iC9-CAR19 post lymphodepletion at one of the&#xD;
      following doses based on the percentage of circulating lymphoblasts prior to lymphodepletion:&#xD;
      (1) dose of 5 x 10^5 transduced cells/kg or (2) dose of 1 x 10^5 transduced cells/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy under this compassionate use protocol involves 1 infusion of iC9-CAR19 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent retrovirus&#xD;
      evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
