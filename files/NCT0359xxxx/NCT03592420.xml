      Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) aiming at assessing the efficacy of an interdisciplinary&#xD;
      multi-component and personalized multi-factorial intervention for reducing falls at one year&#xD;
      post-enrolment in comparison to the usual care in a sample of community dwelling elderly (age&#xD;
      ≥65 years), with or without Parkinson's Disease and/or previous Stroke.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Current literature on fall prevention for community-dwelling elderly who are at&#xD;
      risk of falling suggests that: 1) either single, multicomponent or multifactorial&#xD;
      interventions are effective at preventing falls; 2) elderly at risk of falling with&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) and previous Stroke, although having an even greater risk of&#xD;
      falling, are often excluded by these interventions; 3) often, present screening methods for&#xD;
      risk of falling do not allow the early identification of subjects at risk before the first&#xD;
      fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of an interdisciplinary multicomponent and personalized&#xD;
           multifactorial intervention aiming at reducing falls in comparison to the usual care, in&#xD;
           a sample of community dwelling elderly, with or without Parkinson's Disease and/or&#xD;
           previous Stroke, within the context of an RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve the accuracy of screening tests for risk of falling by using wearable&#xD;
           inertial sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a reduced set of clinical and instrumental indicators, to be utilized as a&#xD;
           quick and reliable screening tests in outpatients clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: multicenter, randomized controller trial, with blind assessments on pretest, postest&#xD;
      and on one-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION: community-dwelling elderly (aged ≥65 years) with age-related or neurological&#xD;
      condition-related (Parkinson's Disease and/or Stroke) risk of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: interdisciplinary multi-component (group-based exercise; home-based exercise;&#xD;
      increasing knowledge/education; home safety interventions) and personalized multi-factorial&#xD;
      interventions (assessment and treatment of individual fall risk factors) CONTROL: structured&#xD;
      information about participant's own personal risk factors given to the family doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the fall rate at one year in both groups. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoint is the fall risk at one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS: in the intervention group, a significant reduction in the number of total&#xD;
      fall is expected, together with decreases indicators of utilization of acute health services&#xD;
      because of falls. At three months, it is expected a significant improvement of functioning&#xD;
      (motor functions, activity and participation) and health quality indicators.&#xD;
