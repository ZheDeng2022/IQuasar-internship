      The aim of the present study is to compare two different multidisciplinary protocols using&#xD;
      two types of grafts, porcine acellular dermal matrix (Mucoderm®) versus connective tissue&#xD;
      graft, both associated with modified coronally advanced flap, in the treatment of multiple&#xD;
      adjacent gingival recessions associated with non-carious cervical lesion partially (NCCL)&#xD;
      restored by composite resin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, parallel and controlled clinical trial assessing non-inferiority in&#xD;
      root coverage and superiority in oral health-related quality of life. The population that&#xD;
      will be evaluated in this is study will be enrolled at São Paulo State University (Unesp),&#xD;
      Institute of Science and Technology, São José dos Campos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients with multiple adjacent gingival recessions associated with non-carious&#xD;
      cervical lesion will be enrolled and randomly allocated to one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test group (n=20): partial restoration of cervical lesion and modified coronally&#xD;
           advanced flap for root coverage associated with porcine acellular dermal matrix&#xD;
           (MCAF+PR+XMD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group (n=20): partial restoration of cervical lesion and modified coronally&#xD;
           advanced flap associated with connective tissue graft (MCAF+PR+CTG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restorative treatment of non-carious cervical lesion will be performed one week prior the&#xD;
      surgical procedures and will be conducted as follows. After local anesthesia, rubber dam&#xD;
      isolation will be placed, and a coronal bevel will be performed at the incisal margin of the&#xD;
      NCCL to reduce the step of lesions and to allow a correct and harmonious emergence profile of&#xD;
      the restoration. Afterward, acid etching with 37% phosphoric acid will be performed and&#xD;
      washed for 30 seconds with water-air-jet. The lesion will be dried with sterile cotton&#xD;
      pellets to prevent dehydration, and the adhesive will be applied according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions (Single Bond Universal, 3M ESPE). The adhesive will be light&#xD;
      cured for 20 seconds, and the restoration will be made with resin composite (Filtek Z350 XT,&#xD;
      3M ESPE). The apical margin of the restoration will be determined to be 1 mm apical to the&#xD;
      estimated position of the cementoenamel junction(CEJ) in order to rebuild only the anatomical&#xD;
      part of the crown destroyed by the NCCL and 1 mm of the root surface, once the apical portion&#xD;
      of the root surface will be covered by gingival tissue after periodontal surgery. After&#xD;
      rubber dam removal, the restoration will be finished with ultrafine-grained burs, and 48&#xD;
      hours after the restoration procedure, polishing will be completed with diamond paste and&#xD;
      felt discs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeries will be performed by the same expert periodontist (MPS). The surgical procedure&#xD;
      for root coverage will be carried out according to Zucchelli's technique (Zucchelli et al.,&#xD;
      2000). In brief description, following local anesthesia, oblique submarginal incisions in the&#xD;
      interdental areas, which continued with the intrasulcular incision at the recession defects,&#xD;
      will be carried out keeping a blade 15c (Swann-Morton® - Sheffield, England) mounted on No. 3&#xD;
      scalpel handle parallel to the long axis of the teeth to dissect in a split-thickness manner&#xD;
      the surgical papilla. Each surgical papilla will be dislocated with respect to the anatomic&#xD;
      papilla by the oblique submarginal interdental incisions. The envelope flap will be raised&#xD;
      with a split-full-split thickness in the coronal-apical direction: gingival tissue apical to&#xD;
      the root exposures will be raised in a full-thickness manner to provide that portion of the&#xD;
      flap critical for root coverage with more thickness and the most apical portion of the flap&#xD;
      will be elevated in a split-thickness manner to facilitate the coronal displacement of the&#xD;
      flap. The portion of the root exposure with loss of clinical attachment will be instrumented&#xD;
      with the use of curets. The remaining tissue of the anatomic interdental papilla will be&#xD;
      de-epithelialized to create connective tissue beds to which the surgical papilla will be&#xD;
      sutured through sling sutures to coronally cover 2 mm above the CEJ after the placement of&#xD;
      the grafts. For the test group (MCAF+PR+XMD), a porcine acellular dermal matrix (Mucoderm®,&#xD;
      Botiss, Berlin, Germany) will be trimmed with a scalpel in appropriate shape and size to&#xD;
      cover the root surfaces and underlying bone. Lastly, for the control group (MCAF + PR + CTG),&#xD;
      a connective tissue graft will be harvested from the palate according to Bruno's technique&#xD;
      (Bruno JF, 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery, the participants will be requested to take 500 mg of sodium dipyrone every&#xD;
      8 hours for 3 days in case of pain and to avoid brushing and flossing in the treated area for&#xD;
      a period of 2 weeks. During this period, plaque control will be achieved using 0.12%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine solution twice a day. The sutures will be removed after 10 days, and all of the&#xD;
      patients will be recalled for prophylaxis and reinforcement of motivation and instruction for&#xD;
      atraumatic toothbrushing during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical, esthetics, and comfort of patients parameters will be assessed at 45 days, 2, 3 and&#xD;
      6 months after the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be recorded as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and normality will be&#xD;
      tested using Shapiro-Wilk tests. The probing depth (PD), relative gingival recession (RGR),&#xD;
      clinical attachment level (CAL), keratinized tissue thickness (KTT), keratinized tissue width&#xD;
      (KTW), and dentin hypersensitivity (DH) values will be examined by two-way repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA to evaluate the differences within and between groups, followed by a Tukey test for&#xD;
      multiple comparisons when the Shapiro-Wilk p value was ≥ 0.05. Those presenting Shapiro-Wilk&#xD;
      p values &lt; 0.05 will be analyzed using a Friedman test (for intragroup comparisons) and&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney tests (for intergroup comparisons). Patient's esthetics and discomfort measures&#xD;
      using, respectively, visual analog scale (VAS) and postoperative diary (Tonetti et al. 2018)&#xD;
      will be analyzed by T-tests. The frequency of complete root coverage will be compared using&#xD;
      χ2 tests. Intergroup root coverage esthetic score (RES) comparisons will be performed with a&#xD;
      T-test. A significance level of 0.05 will be adopted.&#xD;
