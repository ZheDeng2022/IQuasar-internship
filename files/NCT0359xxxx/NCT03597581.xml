  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RGX-202-001 is a Phase 1, first-in-human, dose escalation and expansion study of RGX-202-01&#xD;
      as a single agent and in combination with FOLFIRI +/- bevacizumab. RGX-202-01 is a small&#xD;
      molecule inhibitor of the creatine transporter SLC6a8, a novel metabolic target that drives&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the dose escalation stage, multiple doses of orally administered RGX-202-01 with or&#xD;
      without FOLFIRI +/- bevacizumab (single agent or combination therapy) will be evaluated in&#xD;
      patients with advanced gastrointestinal tumors (i.e., locally advanced and unresectable, or&#xD;
      metastatic) who have had PD on available standard systemic therapies or for which there are&#xD;
      no standard systemic therapies of relevant clinical impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the expansion stage of the study, additional patients with colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      selected by expression of the creatine kinase B (CKB) biomarker will be treated at the MTD&#xD;
      (or maximum tested dose if no MTD is identified, or dose below the MTD if there is evidence&#xD;
      suggesting a more favorable risk/benefit profile). This stage will provide further&#xD;
      characterization of the safety, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics of RGX-202-01 in&#xD;
      combination with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab.&#xD;
