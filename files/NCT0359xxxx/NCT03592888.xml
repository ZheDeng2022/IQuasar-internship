  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to evaluate the effects of a dendritic cell (kind of white&#xD;
      blood cell) vaccine for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open label trial that will assess the safety and tolerability of mature&#xD;
      dendritic cell (mDC3/8) vaccine (primer and booster) in subjects with resected pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients that provide written informed consent will undergo apheresis to collect&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells for vaccine production approximately 1 week prior to vaccine&#xD;
      infusion. Each study subject will receive cyclophosphamide 300mg/m^2 intravenously 3 to 4&#xD;
      days prior to the vaccine dose to deplete regulatory T cells. For each vaccine dose, all&#xD;
      subjects will receive autologous dendritic cells pulsed with mutant KRAS peptides&#xD;
      corresponding to the subject's specific tumor mutation and human leukocyte antigen type. On&#xD;
      Day 1, the subject will receive the primer vaccine dose; this will be followed by one booster&#xD;
      vaccine dose approximately 8 weeks later. Peripheral blood will be taken weekly, and a second&#xD;
      apheresis procedure will be performed at the end of study to monitor the immune response to&#xD;
      the vaccine. Information will be gathered from usual clinic visits for approximately 1 year&#xD;
      following the End of Treatment Study Visit to evaluate for disease recurrence.&#xD;
