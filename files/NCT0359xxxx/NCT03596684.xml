  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypercholesterolemia is a major cardiovascular risk factor. Statins are the first-line drug&#xD;
      treatment for hypercholesterolemia and have been shown to be effective in both primary and&#xD;
      secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, long-term statin therapy is&#xD;
      associated with impaired carbohydrate metabolism and increased risk of developing type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D), particularly in patients with metabolic syndrome. The risk of developing T2D&#xD;
      is higher with high doses of statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the benefits of statins on the reduction of major cardiovascular events and&#xD;
      mortality are considered superior to the risk of statin-induced diabetes T2D, and no change&#xD;
      in clinical practice has been recommended to date. However, it now appears necessary to&#xD;
      develop strategies to reduce the adverse effects of statins on carbohydrate metabolism and&#xD;
      maintain the carbohydrate tolerance of patients on statins, especially in those at risk of&#xD;
      developing T2D under statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins are able to induce the expression and activity of an enzyme synthesizing nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO), the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), which helps improving insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      insulin secretion. However, availability and metabolism of its substrate arginine is impaired&#xD;
      in obesity and T2D. The investigators thus hypothesized that providing citrulline to statin&#xD;
      treated patients, the arginine precursor with better gastrointestinal tolerance and&#xD;
      bioavailability than arginine, would beneficially impact their glucose homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tested in vivo by Béatrice Morio, a member of the CarMeN laboratory, combining citrulline to&#xD;
      atorvastatin improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice fed a high fat-high&#xD;
      sucrose diet. These data therefore suggest that combining citrulline to atorvastatin may&#xD;
      improve glucose tolerance in statin-treated patients at high risk of developing T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is therefore to investigate the impact of citrulline&#xD;
      supplementation (5g/d) vs. placebo for 4 weeks on glucose tolerance assessed during an oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test in patients at risk for developing T2D and treated with atorvastatin&#xD;
      (40 or 80 mg / day).&#xD;
