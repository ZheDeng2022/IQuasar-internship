    <textblock>
      This study intends to investigate the usefulness of the new &quot;5th generation&quot; cardiac troponin&#xD;
      enzyme in determining which patients presenting with possible acute coronary syndrome can be&#xD;
      quickly and safely discharged or admitted from the Emergency Department. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that introducing this enzyme into practice will reduce the time it takes to make&#xD;
      decisions about admitting or discharging these patients with no increase in adverse events in&#xD;
      the discharged patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The workup of patients for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the most common diagnostic&#xD;
      considerations in medicine today. Chest pain is the cause of over 7 million annual emergency&#xD;
      visits in the United States alone, representing over $10 billion in annual healthcare costs.&#xD;
      Because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with ACS, as well as the&#xD;
      perception that there is a greater degree of professional liability associated with its&#xD;
      misdiagnosis, a disproportionate amount of clinical energy and resources are currently&#xD;
      employed to either make (&quot;rule-in&quot;) or exclude (&quot;rule-out&quot;) the diagnoses. Yet only a small&#xD;
      fraction of these patients are eventually diagnosed with ACS. The combination of high&#xD;
      importance paired with significant clinical heterogeneity makes it a diagnosis that is made&#xD;
      with great difficulty and at great expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the past several decades serial measurements of cardiac biomarkers over a period of&#xD;
      several hours have been the mainstay of ACS evaluation. More recently, &quot;high sensitivity&quot;&#xD;
      assays for the troponin enzyme, the most widely followed marker of cardiac injury, have been&#xD;
      introduced for clinical use outside of the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays have been shown to be more sensitive&#xD;
      for detecting injury to cardiac myocytes and have been employed in protocols that allow for a&#xD;
      more rapid rule-in and rule-out of ACS in European, Canadian, and Australasian settings. In&#xD;
      2017, the FDA approved the Roche Elecsys Troponin T Gen 5 Stat (5th Gen Tn) assay for&#xD;
      clinical use in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American medical community has responded to this with both eagerness and trepidation.&#xD;
      Despite large clinical trials demonstrating the utility of these new assays in study&#xD;
      populations, it is unclear what the impact will be on clinical practice. There is an&#xD;
      understandable concern among providers that this highly sensitive assay will identify many&#xD;
      patients with elevated levels of troponin from non-ACS causes and with uncertain clinical&#xD;
      significance. There is also uncertainty because studies performed in European populations may&#xD;
      not be applicable to the multi-ethnic populations that present to US emergency departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is much literature that attests to the performance of the test in study settings,&#xD;
      there is less understanding of the impact of this assay on real-world practice settings.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is critically important that we track and study how the new assay affects&#xD;
      provider practice and clinical outcomes in our diverse population of patients in our&#xD;
      quaternary medical system which includes a largely inner city, lower income, multi-ethnic&#xD;
      population with a high proportion of Hispanic and black patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current local protocol calls for risk stratification of patients based on a modified version&#xD;
      of the HEART Score in conjunction with serial 4th generation troponin measurements, at a 3&#xD;
      hour interval. Patients who have scores â‰¤ 3 are discharged with close outpatient follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting data collection while the current 4th-generation troponin assay is still being used&#xD;
      will enable us to perform a prospective, observational study on the impact of the 5th Gen Tn&#xD;
      assay on patient throughput in the Emergency Department (ED). In particular the investigators&#xD;
      would want to measure impact of the new assay on the amount of time it takes to evaluate a&#xD;
      patient in the ED, as they anticipate the 5th Gen Tn will allow more rapid decision making in&#xD;
      the clinical environment. The primary outcomes will be the change in the time it takes to&#xD;
      make a clinical decision regarding admission or discharge to the hospital in patients&#xD;
      presenting with possible ACS. This time interval is often referred to as the 'doctor to&#xD;
      disposition time' or 'provider to decision time'. The investigators will also be able to&#xD;
      evaluate impact on other throughput related factors such as admission rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolling patients from the ED, the investigators will perform telephone follow-up 30 and 90&#xD;
      days following their ED visit to ascertain clinical outcomes. They will assess for any&#xD;
      differences in the rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) - defined as likely cardiac&#xD;
      death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, malignant dysrhythmia, or emergent revascularization&#xD;
      procedures - between patients evaluated with the 4th-generation and 5th Gen Tn can be&#xD;
      quantified, both in the discharged and admitted groups. This study will be uniquely qualified&#xD;
      to evaluate these outcomes in a Hispanic cohort, which has been relatively underrepresented&#xD;
      in the literature to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, studying the new assay in a real world clinical practice will allow&#xD;
      investigators to better understand how to interpret rapid changes in troponin values that&#xD;
      remain below the 99th percentile normal range (14 ng/L in females, 22 ng/L in males).&#xD;
      Multiple studies have demonstrated the utility of measuring the change in serum troponin&#xD;
      concentration (delta-troponin) over pre-defined time intervals for identifying patients at&#xD;
      risk for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and MACE. In many EDs, however, limited clinical&#xD;
      resources makes it difficult to obtain repeat blood tests on strict time frames. In the very&#xD;
      high volume setting of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) ED, the&#xD;
      investigators expect to be able to evaluate the utility of tracking the rate of change of the&#xD;
      5th Gen Tn assay over multiple time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being able to quantify the impact of the new test on practice patterns and ED patient&#xD;
      throughput is critical to understanding how to best implement 5th Gen Tn into protocols that&#xD;
      provide safe and efficient care. This data will also be of high significance not just to our&#xD;
      local institution but to many other acute care settings and health systems across the United&#xD;
      States as they in turn adopt this new assay over the next several years. Finally, studying&#xD;
      this new assay in the particular socioeconomic and racial/ethnic patient mix of our&#xD;
      institution will help understand the best way to implement this test throughout the Western&#xD;
      hemisphere.&#xD;
