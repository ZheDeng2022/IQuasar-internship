  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 56 million orphans worldwide, is the most affected region&#xD;
      in terms of orphans to be cared for (UNICEF, 2014). The recently developed preventative&#xD;
      approach Interaction Competencies with Children - for Caregivers (ICC-C; Hecker, Mkinga,&#xD;
      Ssenyonga, &amp; Hermenau, 2017) trains the essential interaction skills in working with&#xD;
      children. The focus here is on strengthening a warm, sensitive and reliable relationship&#xD;
      between caregiver and child as well as on non-violent education strategies. In a first pilot&#xD;
      study the feasibility of the approach icould be demonstrated (Hermenau, Kaltenbach, Mkinga, &amp;&#xD;
      Hecker, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study applies a two-arm cluster-randomized controlled design. The participating&#xD;
      institutions will be randomly divided into intervention and control bodies. The follow-up&#xD;
      examination should take place three months after the intervention. All caregivers in facility&#xD;
      (N = approx. 150) and 25 randomly selected children (age: 6-12) per facility (N = 200) will&#xD;
      be included in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 56 million orphans worldwide, is the most affected region&#xD;
      in terms of orphans to be cared for (UNICEF, 2014). The few studies investigating children in&#xD;
      African orphanages mostly showed inadequate care (Espi√© et al., 2011; Hermenau et al., 2011;&#xD;
      Levin &amp; Haines, 2007; Wolff &amp; Fesseha, 1998, 1999). In addition to the lack of trained and&#xD;
      competent caregivers, children are also confronted with violence and abuse in the orphanages&#xD;
      themselves (Hermenau et al., 2011; SOS Children's Villages International &amp; University of&#xD;
      Bedfordshire, 2014). Abuse and neglect in orphanages, in addition to traumatisation, abuse&#xD;
      and neglect in the families of origin, pose a considerable risk for the healthy development&#xD;
      and mental health of children (Hermenau, Goessmann, Rygaard, Landolt, &amp; Hecker, 2017). In&#xD;
      addition to meeting basic needs (e. g. eating, drinking, basic medical care, etc.), sensitive&#xD;
      and non-violent education in orphanages is crucial for the emotional and physical development&#xD;
      of children. However, the focus of previous intervention studies has been on promoting a&#xD;
      sensitive and reliable relationship between caregiver and child. Violence and maltreatment,&#xD;
      on the other hand, received little attention (Hermenau et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently developed preventative approach Interaction Competencies with Children - for&#xD;
      Caregivers (ICC-C; Hecker, Mkinga, Ssenyonga, &amp; Hermenau, 2017) trains the essential&#xD;
      interaction skills in working with children. The focus here is on strengthening a warm,&#xD;
      sensitive and reliable relationship between caregiver and child as well as on non-violent&#xD;
      education strategies. In a first pilot study the feasibility of the approach could be&#xD;
      demonstrated (Hermenau, Kaltenbach, Mkinga, &amp; Hecker, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study applies a two-arm cluster-randomized controlled design and includes 20 to 25&#xD;
      orphanages. After an initial investigation, the participating institutions will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into intervention and control bodies. The follow-up examination should take place&#xD;
      three months after the intervention. In addition, feasibility data will be assessed in the&#xD;
      intervention facilities only at the beginning and the end of the intervention. All caregivers&#xD;
      in facility (N = approx. 150) and 10-15 randomly selected children (age: 6-12) per facility&#xD;
      (N = 300) will be included in this study. Data of caregivers will be assessed with the help&#xD;
      of self-administered questionnaires, whereas data of children will be assessed with&#xD;
      structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a clear and pressing humanitarian need for science to address the issue of care&#xD;
      quality and maltreatment prevention in institutional care settings in a practical manner.&#xD;
      Perhaps surprisingly in view of this, so far no evidenced-based prevention measures adapted&#xD;
      for the limited resources in low-income countries have been developed and scientifically&#xD;
      evaluated. This research project can address this need, with a scientifically rigorous&#xD;
      evaluation of a violence and maltreatment prevention program that fosters the active&#xD;
      involvement of local personnel and that considers the limited resources of school settings in&#xD;
      low-income countries. Through these efforts this study may help more orphans to grow-up in a&#xD;
      supportive atmosphere, maintaining their psychological well-being and improving their&#xD;
      performance. This preventative program aims to make a significant impact on the psychological&#xD;
      well-being of orphans in Tanzania.&#xD;

    <description>The Conflict Tactics Scale Parent-Child version (CTSPC) will assess the children's self-reported experiences of violent discipline in the child care institution.

    <description>Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) will assess children's internalizing and externalizing problems. The SDQ consists of five subscales of five items each, which are answered in three categories from &quot;not true&quot; (0), &quot;somehow true&quot; (1) to &quot;certainly true&quot; (2). The sum of all items except the ones from the prosocial behavior subscale represents atotal difficulty score (SDQ score; range 0-40, with a higher score indicating more problems). Values of 17 or higher on the SDQ score indicate severely elevated levels of mental health problems.</description>

    <description>Items of the Conflict Tactics Scale Parent-Child version (CTSPC) have been adapted to measure caregivers' and students' attitudes towards violent discipline methods in the child care institution. All items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale from never ok (0) to almost always ok (3). The focus will be particularly on the subscales physical violence (13 items, potential range: 0 to 39 with higher scores indicating more positive attitutudes towards violence) and emotional violence (5 items, potential range: 0-15, with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes towards violence).</description>

    <description>Interaction Competencies with Children - for Caregiver (ICC-C) aims to reduce maltreatment and to improve care quality in institutional care facilities. Following the idea of a train-the-trainer approach, ICC-C is designed to be delivered by trained local facilitators. ICC-C is based on attachment, behavioral and social learning theories.&#xD;
The key principles are its feasibility in low-resource contexts, participatory approach, and practical orientation. ICC-C includes sessions on (a) caregiver-child interaction, (b) maltreatment prevention, (c) effective non-violent caregiving strategies, and (d) identifying and supporting burdened children.</description>
