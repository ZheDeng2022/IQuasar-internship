      Background: apple cider vinegar is natural traditional health beneficial nutraceutical used&#xD;
      for many aliments. Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been considered a globally major health problem&#xD;
      and posing health burden on families and health system. Diabetes is associated with life&#xD;
      style that leading to reduce physical activities and increased in obesity. For development of&#xD;
      diabetes the known mechanism are endocrine disorders which cause impaired insulin secretion,&#xD;
      hepatic glucose over production and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of current randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      apple cider vinegar on glycemic control and biochemical parameters in type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients with poor glycaemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material &amp; Methods: 110 type 2 diabetic patients according to inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      selected and divided into two groups. Interventional group was given 15 ml apple cider&#xD;
      vinegar in 200ml water during meal at night time for 3 months. Before and after HbA1C,&#xD;
      fasting lipid profile, fasting blood sugar, anthropometrics and dietary changes were assessed&#xD;
      and analyzed using IBM SPSS version 20 through paired sample T-test where needed.&#xD;

      A study conducted in pre-diabetic healthy individuals showed significant (p=0.05) reduction&#xD;
      in HbA1C, in apple cider vinegar group . Many RCTs of human and animals showed hypolipidemic&#xD;
      effects of ACV. Anti obesity effect of apple cider vinegar also found in many studies. There&#xD;
      is still lot of work going on and this present study is conducted with an objective to&#xD;
      measure the effect of apple cider vinegar on HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, fasting lipid&#xD;
      profile and body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a single-blind, randomized-controlled placebo trial. Trial period was three&#xD;
      months from August 15, to November 15, 2017. This study was conducted at a 1050 beded&#xD;
      tertiary care, teaching hospital of Lahore, Pakistan. This hospital has high diabetics&#xD;
      out-patient turnover as being a reputable center in management of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients having type 2 diabetes, of both genders with age range from 30-60 years were&#xD;
      included. All having BMI between 20-30, non smoker and non alcoholics and all were on&#xD;
      standard medical therapy for diabetes (including Metformin + Sitagliptin group). Patients&#xD;
      suffering from known chronic renal disease and history of cardiovascular diseases like&#xD;
      stroke, ischemic heart disease and known allergy or intolerance to vinegar, reported by the&#xD;
      patient or relative and any kind of acute infection were excluded from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 110 (55 in each group) was estimated by using 95% confidence level,80%&#xD;
      power with expected mean change in HbA1c 0.53% and 0.11% for cases treated with apple vinegar&#xD;
      and placebo respectively with a SD of 0.77% (by using power + precision 3.0 software).&#xD;
      Assuming a 12.6% non-response rate, RCT started with 126 patients, 63 patients in each group.&#xD;
      16 patients were lost to follow up during study period, so finally statistical analysis was&#xD;
      done on 110 patients 55 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEPENDENT VARIABLES: A structured questionnaire was used for collecting respondents'&#xD;
      information. Blood samples were taken for biochemical test (HbA1c, lipid profile and fasting&#xD;
      blood glucose) and anthropometrics measurements were done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements: Height was measured in centimeter to nearest 0.1 cm by using&#xD;
      standard stadiometer before intervention and weight was measured in kilogram to nearest 100 g&#xD;
      with wearing light cloth by using a calibrated weighing scale machine before and after&#xD;
      intervention. Hip/waist ratio and mid upper arm were measured with measuring tape in&#xD;
      centimeter to nearest 0.1cm. The BMI of study participants were classified as underweight,&#xD;
      normal, over weight and obese according to WHO criteria weight was measured as weight&#xD;
      (kg)/height (cm)2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At before start of intervention and after intervention 5ml venous blood sample was taken with&#xD;
      12hours fasting for biochemical assessments including blood sugar fasting, HbA1C (glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin), total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein and&#xD;
      triglyceride were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFOUNDING VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intake:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet of study participants can influence and confound the intervention during study period so&#xD;
      it was assessed through food frequency questionnaire. Food frequency was filled two times&#xD;
      before and after intervention to measure change during study period which can actually&#xD;
      confound the effect of apple cider vinegar. The food frequency questionnaire was structured&#xD;
      according to Pakistan's cultural food preferences and choices. FFQs contained methods of food&#xD;
      preparation, frequency per day and per week and portion size/ amount of food consumed in&#xD;
      categories from never, monthly to 1-7 days in a week. Food exchange lists were used to assess&#xD;
      the portion size of food. FFQ composed of cereal group, fruits, vegetable, meat, milk,&#xD;
      fat/oil, snacks and beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDEPENDENT VARIABLE/ INTERVENTION: This selected nutraceutical (Apple cider vinegar) was&#xD;
      given for three months. Apple cider vinegar was provided to patients and instructions were&#xD;
      given to all participants about the uses of apple cider vinegar and strictly follow the&#xD;
      prescribed nutraceutical given as per following schedule; Group I: Intervention group&#xD;
      Intervention group taking their diet according to their original meal pattern only dietary&#xD;
      guideline were given regarding high glycaemic and low glycaemic diet. Medical treatments&#xD;
      continued (including Metformin + Sitagliptin group). 15ml apple cider vinegar (American&#xD;
      garden organic vinegar) (containing 5% acetic acid) mixed in 200ml water during meal at night&#xD;
      time was prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: comparison group Control group also taking their diet according to their original&#xD;
      meal pattern only dietary guideline were given regarding high glycaemic and low glycaemic&#xD;
      diet. Medical treatment continued (including Metformin + Sitagliptin group). 15ml apple cider&#xD;
      vinegar (flavor of ACV in plan water was used as placebo) mixed in 200ml plain water during&#xD;
      meal at night time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistical analysis was done for demographic profile, categorical and numerical&#xD;
      variables by measuring frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation of all samples.&#xD;
      Paired sample T test was used for anthropometrics measurement and biochemical assessment for&#xD;
      two time assessment before and after intervention. Independent sample t-test was used for&#xD;
      comparison between groups. Where needed ANOVA was also applied. McNemar statistical test was&#xD;
      used to assess the food frequency questionnaire before and after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper ethical clearance was obtained from Institutional Review Board of Shaikh Zayed Medical&#xD;
      Complex before starting the trial.&#xD;
