  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a first-in-man clinical trial evaluating OVX836, a recombinant broad&#xD;
      spectrum vaccine for Influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and the immune response of increasing doses of&#xD;
      OVX836 after intramuscular or intranasal administrations in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single center, randomized, sequential dose escalation, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      observer-blind study conducted in healthy subjects aged 18-49 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OVX836 recombinant vaccine is based on the well conserved nucleoprotein of the Influenza&#xD;
      virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different dose levels of OVX836 (30µg, 90µg, 180µg) will be assessed sequentially and&#xD;
      administered either by the intramuscular route (Study Part A) or by the intranasal route&#xD;
      (Study Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 6 cohorts in total with one cohort testing one dose level and one route of&#xD;
      administration. Each study cohort will be composed of 12 subjects, with 9 subjects receiving&#xD;
      the OVX836 vaccine and 3 subjects receiving the placebo. Each subject will receive one&#xD;
      administration of OVX836 or placebo on Day 1 and one administration on Day 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration for each subject is approximately 5 months.&#xD;
