    <textblock>
      REM sleep behavior disorder (typical or 'idiopathic' RBD, iRBD) is a novel and distinct&#xD;
      parasomnia characterized by recurrent dream enactment behaviours and polysomnographic&#xD;
      features of loss of normal REM-sleep related muscle atonia, with a male predominance commonly&#xD;
      occurring at the age of 60's. A majority of the patients with iRBD will eventually develop&#xD;
      α-synucleinopathy (e.g., Parkinson's disease). On the other hand, growing evidence reveals a&#xD;
      specific group of psychiatric patients demonstrating comparable clinical RBD features (pRBD)&#xD;
      (e.g., abnormal REM-related electromyographic (EMG) activities) as found in typical iRBD, but&#xD;
      with less male predominance occurring at the age of mid 40's to early 50's. Although recent&#xD;
      findings from both cross-sectional and prospective studies have suggested that pRBD is likely&#xD;
      to be a persistent parasomnia with close association with clinical and neuroimaging&#xD;
      biomarkers related to neurodegeneration, the nosology of the development of RBD symptoms&#xD;
      among patients with psychiatric disorders, notably major depressive disorder, remains unclear&#xD;
      as to whether they are simply antidepressants related, or represent a part of the early phase&#xD;
      of α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration. Family studies on iRBD have confirmed a significant&#xD;
      familial aggregation of iRBD with a higher rate of RBD cases and presence of prodromal&#xD;
      neurodegenerative biomarkers (e.g. tonic EMG activity during REM sleep, constipation, and&#xD;
      motor function impairments) of α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration among first-degree&#xD;
      relatives (FDRs) of patients with iRBD. Thus, the investigators propose this family study to&#xD;
      examine the following hypotheses: 1) FDRs of patients with pRBD have a higher rate of RBD&#xD;
      symptoms and its core features when compared to FDRs of controls with and without psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders; 2) FDRs of pRBD are more likely to exhibit the features associated with prodromal&#xD;
      markers of α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration when compared with FDRs of controls with and&#xD;
      without psychiatric disorders; 3) FDRs of patients with pRBD have a higher rate of&#xD;
      α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration when compared with FDRs of controls with and without&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders. A total of 176 FDRs from each group (e.g., pRBD cases, psychiatric&#xD;
      controls, and healthy controls) will be recruited to undergo a face-to-face clinical&#xD;
      interview and a series of assessments on prodromal markers of Parkinson's diseases (as&#xD;
      according to the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society research criteria)&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All FDRs with possible RBD and a subset of FDRs without possible RBD will be invited to&#xD;
      undergo one-night video-polysomnographic assessment to confirm the clinical diagnosis of RBD&#xD;
      and to assess the abnormal REM-related EMG muscle activities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a novel REM sleep parasomnia characterized by dream&#xD;
      enacting behaviors and sleep-related injuries. Ample evidences have suggested that idiopathic&#xD;
      RBD (iRBD) is a precursor of α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration (e.g. Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      PD) in which dopamine dysfunction is one of the core pathophysiologies. In recent decade, our&#xD;
      group has identified a cohort of patients with psychiatric disorders (mainly major depressive&#xD;
      disorder, MDD) comorbid with RBD (pRBD). While there was a postulation that RBD symptoms in&#xD;
      this psychiatric population may simply be side effects of antidepressant medication (by&#xD;
      enhancing REM-sleep related muscle activity), accumulating evidence from case-control and&#xD;
      prospective cohort studies suggested that pRBD is only partially explained by antidepressant&#xD;
      usage and is better considered as a variant of typical iRBD in terms of comparable clinical&#xD;
      presentation with typical iRBD and its close association with neurodegenerative markers.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, more evidence is needed to substantiate that pRBD is a distinct diagnostic&#xD;
      entity rather than a symptom secondary to antidepressant use. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will employ genetic epidemiology approach to: 1) determine the familial genetic&#xD;
      contribution; 2) search for biomarkers and endophenotypes; and 3) validate the diagnostic&#xD;
      entity of a disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study will enrich the limited scientific literature of the potential&#xD;
      pathogenesis of pRBD and its relationship with α-synucleinopathy. In addition, the&#xD;
      understanding of psychiatric disorders, notably MDD, is often limited by its heterogeneity.&#xD;
      Our proposed study will, by determining the familial aggregation of pRBD, help us to identify&#xD;
      certain subtype of the psychiatric populations who may likely harbour an underlying&#xD;
      neurodegenerative basis. By using a family study design, a number of important aspects with&#xD;
      regard to the pathogenesis of pRBD will be answered. First, if first-degree relatives (FDRs)&#xD;
      of patients with pRBD have a higher rate of possible RBD or clinical diagnosis of RBD (as&#xD;
      confirmed by video-polysomnography) as well as the presence of neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
      when compared with FDRs of controls, it will substantiate the argument that pRBD is not&#xD;
      merely a side effect of antidepressants but rather harbouring a familial and genetic&#xD;
      predisposition to RBD and, ultimately α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration. Second, the&#xD;
      determination of biomarkers of neurodegeneration among unaffected FDRs of patients with pRBD&#xD;
      will also help to identify high-risk individuals for clinical intervention and prevention.&#xD;
      Third, the calculation of heritability will help to delineate to which extent the additive&#xD;
      genetic contribution is responsible for the variance of pRBD phenotypes. Finally, the&#xD;
      findings from this proposed study will be compared with our on-going family study of typical&#xD;
      iRBD to determine the extent to which iRBD and pRBD are similar or different to each other in&#xD;
      terms of genetic and familial associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed study, the investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. FDRs of patients with pRBD have a higher rate of RBD symptoms and its core features&#xD;
           compared with FDRs of controls;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The unaffected FDRs of patients with pRBD are more likely to exhibit the features&#xD;
           associated with prodromal markers of Parkinson's disease compared with FDRs of controls;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. FDRs of patients with pRBD have a higher rate of Parkinson's disease (and other&#xD;
           α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration) compared with FDRs of controls.&#xD;

        In this study, we will employ a combination of family history (proxy report for&#xD;
        unavailable/inaccessible subjects) and study (face-to face interview, clinical and sleep&#xD;
        study) method in determining the familial aggregation of pRBD. The flowchart of subject&#xD;
        recruitments is presented in Figure 1. The study subjects are the FDRs of pRBD cases,&#xD;
        psychiatric controls and healthy controls. As previous studies have suggested that&#xD;
        depression is a significant risk factor of development of Parkinson's Disease, we will&#xD;
        include two control groups. First, those FDRs of patients with psychiatric disorders in&#xD;
        addition to the FDRs of healthy controls (free of depression and RBD), in consideration of&#xD;
