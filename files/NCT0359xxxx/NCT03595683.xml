  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if orally administered EDP1503 will enhance the&#xD;
      response to standard immunotherapy treatment (pembrolizumab) in participants with advanced&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve initial administration of EDP1503 for a run-in period (2 weeks)&#xD;
      followed by administration of both EDP1503 (twice daily) and pembrolizumab (every 3 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandatory biopsies are required before starting study treatment and after 2 weeks of EDP1503&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced, unresectable or metastatic melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 years or older on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
             1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be naïve to exposure in the metastatic setting to PD1/L1 antibody for cohort 1 but&#xD;
             have had exposure to PD1/L1 (or PD1/L1 combination therapy) in cohort 2. Prior&#xD;
             exposure to CTLA4 antibody in the metastatic setting is not allowed for cohort 1&#xD;
             though exposure in the adjuvant setting is allowed for either cohort. To be eligible&#xD;
             for cohort 2, and considered refractory to PD1/L1, a patient must have had a restaging&#xD;
             exam showing progressive disease at least 90 days following initiation of anti-PD1/L1&#xD;
             as prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adjuvant therapy with BRAF-MEK, PD1 or CTLA4 based therapy is allowed. Prior&#xD;
                  adjuvant BRAF-MEK therapy will fulfill treatment requirement in the metastatic&#xD;
                  setting. Patients who experience progression of disease during adjuvant PD1&#xD;
                  therapy or within 6 months of completing adjuvant PD1 therapy will be considered&#xD;
                  refractory and thus eligible for cohort 1. Patients with progression to active&#xD;
                  metastatic disease more than 6 months following completion of adjuvant PD1&#xD;
                  therapy will be eligible for cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)&#xD;
             Performance Scale.&#xD;

                  used in place of creatinine or CrCl) ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR ≥60&#xD;
                  mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with&#xD;
                  total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN&#xD;
                  OR ≤ 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If&#xD;
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study medication. [Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and&#xD;
             preferred contraception for the subject.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of study therapy. [Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual&#xD;
             lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.]&#xD;
