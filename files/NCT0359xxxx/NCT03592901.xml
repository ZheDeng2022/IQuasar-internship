      1. Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this study is to investigate whether phantom limb pain and/or sensations&#xD;
           can arise after induction of BPA prior to upper extremity surgery. In addition, this&#xD;
           study aims to investigate if there is cortical remapping of the hand sensation onto the&#xD;
           face before and after surgery. The outcome of this research will provide insight into&#xD;
           the characteristics of cortical reorganization and how this correlates to phantom limbs,&#xD;
           phantom pain, and hand-to-face remapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale, Research has yet to elucidate the etiology of phantom limb experiences, and&#xD;
           the debate over peripheral or central nervous system mechanisms remains contentious.&#xD;
           Many recent studies on PLP have investigated the relationship between cortical&#xD;
           reorganization and PLP with the objective of discerning new ways to minimize pain in the&#xD;
           residual limb in amputees. However, this approach has not been successful in describing&#xD;
           the changes that occur in the peripheral or the central nervous systems and have not&#xD;
           been able to concretely link any changes to PLP. Studying patients undergoing brachial&#xD;
           plexus anesthesia (BPA) prior to upper extremity surgery has the potential to aid in the&#xD;
           understanding of cortical remapping and the roles of the peripheral and central nervous&#xD;
           systems in not only PLP but PLS as well. During upper extremity surgery, there have been&#xD;
           reports that patients do not sense repositioning of the upper limb by the surgeon after&#xD;
           BPA takes effect. This is similar to the phenomenon of the immobile, &quot;frozen&quot; limb&#xD;
           occasionally experienced by major limb amputees. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
           investigate whether phantom limb pain and/or sensations can arise after induction of BPA&#xD;
           prior to upper extremity surgery. In addition, this study aims to investigate if there&#xD;
           is cortical remapping of the hand sensation onto the face before and after surgery. The&#xD;
           outcome of this research will provide insight into the characteristics of cortical&#xD;
           reorganization and how this correlates to phantom limbs, phantom pain, and hand-to-face&#xD;
           remapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study/Project Population, The general subject population includes male and female&#xD;
           subjects greater than 18 years of age who are receiving BPA for the purposes of upper&#xD;
           extremity surgery. Since this is a pilot study, we seek to recruit thirty (30) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research Design, To complete this study, a sensory map of participants' facial responses&#xD;
           to the brushing of a Q-tip will be collected by a researcher before, and again after,&#xD;
           BPA has been induced. In addition, follow-up phone sessions will be conducted on the day&#xD;
           after surgery while BPA is still in effect, and daily, up to seven days, to identify&#xD;
           whether participants are experiencing any changes in hand-to-face remapping should it be&#xD;
           detected. This will be used to determine if cortical remapping has occurred as well as&#xD;
           the time course of onset and reversal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study/Project Procedures, During the consent process all sections of the study will be&#xD;
           described in detail. Participants will be able to determine if they can and would like&#xD;
           to be enrolled in the study, Phantom Limb Experience After Brachial Plexus Anesthesia.&#xD;
           30 patients undergoing BPA in preparation for upper extremity surgery will be recruited&#xD;
           for up to 10 data collection sessions. The first session will take place before the&#xD;
           administration of BPA. The next sessions will occur after the administration of BPA and&#xD;
           prior to surgery. A third session will occur after surgery is completed and prior to&#xD;
           discharge home. Once the patient is discharged, follow-up phone sessions will be&#xD;
           conducted in order to determine if hand-to-face remapping has occurred overnight and&#xD;
           what the time course of onset and reversal of remapping and reorganization is. After&#xD;
           obtaining informed consent, facial mapping of the patient's responses to light touch&#xD;
           will be collected. To do this, a researcher will brush a Q-tip over all areas of the&#xD;
           face, beginning at the forehead and working down towards the chin, while the&#xD;
           participant's eyes are closed. During this process, the participant will be required to&#xD;
           inform the researcher where the perception of brushing is being felt. During the&#xD;
           follow-up phone sessions, the patient will answer questions about phantom limb&#xD;
           sensations and pain, and will also be asked to touch different areas of his/her own face&#xD;
           and report where the sensations are being perceived.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Outcome Measures. Data will be collected in the form of a verbal report. Participants&#xD;
           will be instructed to inform researchers about the location that the brushing sensation&#xD;
           is portrayed. In addition any feeling of phantom sensations or pain will also be&#xD;
           recorded. Verbal reports will be collected at all in person sessions as well as phone&#xD;
           follow us sessions. Analysis of these reports will include: the determination of the&#xD;
           presence or absence of hand to face remapping, a detailed time course of onset and&#xD;
           reversal if it occurs, specific locations of the hand-to-face remapping, changes in&#xD;
           location of sensation reports prior to and following BPA, presence or absence of phantom&#xD;
           limb sensations, such as the inability to feel limb repositioning, as well as the&#xD;
           presence or absence of PLP. If PLP is experienced, scores of overall pain ratings will&#xD;
           be conducted using a 10-cm visual analogue scale composed of a linear line where one end&#xD;
           is labeled &quot;no pain&quot; and the other end is labeled &quot;worst pain possible.&quot;&#xD;
