  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment is now seen as a learning experience. there is little literature on objective&#xD;
      structured clinical examination role for formative assessment especially in developing world&#xD;
      Many studies showed that formative-OSCE contributes positively to final summative examination&#xD;
      performance though most studies address this point through the students' perception toward&#xD;
      the formative-OSCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having research that evaluates the effect of formative-OSCE introduction on a subsequent&#xD;
      summative-OSCE in randomised controlled design may be of benefit for institutions considering&#xD;
      the establishment of their own formative-OSCEs particularly in low resource countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Formative assessments are systematically designed instructional interventions to assess and&#xD;
      provide feedback on students' strengths and weaknesses in the course of teaching and learning&#xD;
      and educational experts recommend its use in addition to summative assessment. Moreover, it&#xD;
      is a requirement in undergraduate medical education and must be at the heart of student&#xD;
      training not just included to satisfy accreditation requirement, yet unlike other&#xD;
      professional training culture such as music in which feedback is expected, respected and&#xD;
      given regularly to all learners, the investigators haven't cultivated a true feedback culture&#xD;
      in medical education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a performance-based assessment, the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) has&#xD;
      gained importance because of its reliability and could be in a summative or formative manner&#xD;
      to measure clinical competence. Clinical skills development requires time and practice at a&#xD;
      rate that can accelerated by feedback to optimize experiential learning and improve future&#xD;
      performance for which a learner should enter a reflection period during which available&#xD;
      feedback is examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some medical schools where formative assessments are institutionalized and carried&#xD;
      out systematically, unfortunately, this kind of assessment is not very frequent in&#xD;
      Mediterranean countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undergraduate medical education in Iraq is currently going through a transitional period. The&#xD;
      Medical college of Hawler medical university (HMU) which provides a 6-year MBChB program, has&#xD;
      started the process of changing its curriculum to competency-based medical education (CBME)&#xD;
      and formative assessment is a requirement in this process. In the traditional curriculum&#xD;
      training in pediatric is introduced in 5th year with summative assessment composed of 50%&#xD;
      written test, 30% OSCE, 10% logbook, 10% history taking skills. Students should be competent&#xD;
      to record case history, examine children, make a provisional diagnosis, interpret&#xD;
      investigations and communicate with children and their families given that at the allotted&#xD;
      time end, students present the case findings and evaluated by the faculty. However, a faculty&#xD;
      member doesn't actively observe the students' actual performance of these skills or&#xD;
      competencies so the purpose of formative assessment is not fully met. Use of OSCE as&#xD;
      formative assessment can overcome this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts have been made in OSCE implementation for summative assessment, however,&#xD;
      formative-OSCEs introduction and evaluation in Iraqi medical colleges is lacking. Iraqi&#xD;
      medical schools are facing challenges in staff recruitment and adequate resource provision.&#xD;
      The latter is one of the numerous concerns and challenges to the CBME implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies showed that formative-OSCE contributes positively to final summative examination&#xD;
      performance though most studies address this point through the students' perception toward&#xD;
      the formative-OSCE.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Students in the intervention group (first-arm) attended a formative-OSCE on the first day of their pediatric module to assess the competencies they gained from previous modules. The formative-OSCE design involved a blueprint development which served as a guideline for the development and face-validation of the 8 stations, which were both interactive and static.&#xD;
The formative-OSCE examiners consisted of 2 teaching staff and 11 postgraduate pediatric board trainees, who were trained by the researcher using role model and audiovisual aids. The formative-OSCE was carried out following the exact same process of the summative-OSCE. It composed of stations assessing same competencies with standardized mark sheets and feedback. Students received feedback on their performance in the formative-OSCE on the day the results were released on a one-to-one basis.&#xD;

The interactive stations include history taking, examination, communication (counseling about breastfeeding), and procedural skills (pediatric basic life support) while non-interactive stations include data interpretation, management (linked-station) and a video-station (emergency).&#xD;
