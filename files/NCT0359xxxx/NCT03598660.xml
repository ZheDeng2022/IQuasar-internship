  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is the most common female malignancy worldwide and the second leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer death in women. One in eight women in the United States will develop the&#xD;
      illness in their lifetimes. In Egypt, 37.7% of total cancer cases among women is breast&#xD;
      cancer. A locally advanced disease is very common and total mastectomy is the most commonly&#xD;
      performed surgery. Screening methods and adjuvant therapy following surgery led to a&#xD;
      remarkable decrease in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliable prognostic and predictive markers are needed to guide the selection of the most&#xD;
      appropriate adjuvant therapies for individual patients with breast cancer. In fact, a shift&#xD;
      from defining the cancer patients who should receive chemotherapy on the basis of their&#xD;
      prognostic characteristics to defining the patients who are likely to benefit most from this&#xD;
      modality of adjuvant treatment is currently taking place. Understanding the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the spread of cancer cells to distant organs, therefore, is a&#xD;
      prerequisite for the development of novel cancer therapies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy worldwide. Despite advances in cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment in recent years, traditional treatments (radiotherapy, chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and hormone therapy) are always limited by the resistance of some tumor cells, thus forcing&#xD;
      researchers to continue to look for new therapeutic approaches and targets. Soluble&#xD;
      resistance-related Calcium-binding protein (Sorcin) is a penta-EF hand calcium binding&#xD;
      protein, which participates in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in cells and has&#xD;
      molecular mass of 22 kDa. The EF-hand is a common helix-loop-helix structural motif used by&#xD;
      proteins to bind calcium. Most proteins are endowed with an even number of EF-hands, which&#xD;
      are usually structurally and functionally paired. The penta-EF hand (PEF) family includes&#xD;
      sorcin, calpains, programmed cell death protein 6 (PDCD6), peflin and grancalcin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High sorcin regulates the calcium channels and exchangers located at the plasma membrane and&#xD;
      at the endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) and allows high levels of calcium in the ER to be&#xD;
      maintained, preventing ER stress and the unfolded protein response, and increases escape from&#xD;
      apoptosis. The 18-kDa variant of sorcin is regulated by Tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), a mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein upregulated in&#xD;
      several human tumors which controls sorcin folding and expression. Conversely, sorcin&#xD;
      silencing activates apoptotic proteases as caspase-3 and caspase-12 results in major defects&#xD;
      in mitosis and cytokinesis, blocks cell cycle progression in mitosis, increases the number of&#xD;
      rounded polynucleated cells and induces apoptosis and cell death shifting the equilibrium&#xD;
      between cell life and cell death towards proliferation in MDR cancer cells overexpressing&#xD;
      sorcin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorcin is highly expressed in the heart, brain and breast and overexpressed in many cancer&#xD;
      cells. The gene for sorcin (SRI) spans about 21.9 kb of human genomic DNA. The gene is&#xD;
      located in chromosome 7q21. Sorcin gene is in the same amplicon as other genes involved in&#xD;
      the resistance to chemotherapeutics in cancer cells (multi-drug resistance, MDR) such as the&#xD;
      ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCB4 and ABCB1 (Mdr1, or P-glycoprotein 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annexins are a family of intracellular proteins that bind membrane phospholipids in a Calcium&#xD;
      concentration-dependent manner. The human genome encodes for 12 different annexins varying in&#xD;
      expression and distribution within the tissues. Some of these are ubiquitously expressed (A1,&#xD;
      A2, A5, A6, and A7), while some are selective (A3, A8, A9, A10, and A13). Several annexins&#xD;
      play important roles during tumor progression. However, little is known about the clinical&#xD;
      implications and biological functions of Annexin A3 (ANXA3) in breast cancer. ANXA3 has a&#xD;
      role in cell differentiation, cell migration, immune regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ANXA3 gene is located on human chromosome 4q13-q22 and encodes a protein of 323 amino&#xD;
      acid residues. Annexin A3 participates in various tumor-associated biological processes,&#xD;
      including tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and is associated with chemotherapy&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANXA3 is expressed and secreted by neoplastic mammary cells, and its inhibition halts&#xD;
      migration in breast cancer cells. The expression of Annexin A3 in human breast carcinoma&#xD;
      closely correlated with tumor size and axillary lymph node metastasis. Elevated serum levels&#xD;
      of ANXA3 protein were due to its increased secretion from neoplastic breast cells into the&#xD;
      systemic circulation. There is inverse correlation between Annexin A3 expression and overall&#xD;
      breast cancer patient survival. Moreover, Annexin A3 might be a novel and potential&#xD;
      prognostic marker for patients with breast cancer and is involved in regulating apoptosis by&#xD;
      affecting the Bcl-2/Bax balance. It promote the transcription of the anti-apoptotic gene&#xD;
      Bcl-2 and downregulate the proapoptotic gene BAX.&#xD;
