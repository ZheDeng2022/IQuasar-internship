  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate if AGI-134 given alone is safe and tolerate in treating patients&#xD;
      with unresectable/metastatic solid tumours.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unresectable solid tumour is a tumour that cannot be removed completely through surgery,&#xD;
      radiation therapy, drug treatment or any combination of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AGI-134 (alpha-Gal) is a synthetic molecule that by intratumoural injection trigger a&#xD;
      systemic anti-tumour response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of AGI-134 given alone in&#xD;
      treating patients with unresectable metastatic solid tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided to 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will assess on a small group of subjects the safety and tolerability of increasing&#xD;
      doses of AGI-134 injected intra-tumourally (IT) and will determine the maximum AGI-134 dose&#xD;
      that can be tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will assess the safety, tolerability and clinical effect of the dose selected in part&#xD;
      1 in a group of subjects who will receive AGI-134 alone injected intra-tumourally.&#xD;

Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study treatment, is also an AE.
