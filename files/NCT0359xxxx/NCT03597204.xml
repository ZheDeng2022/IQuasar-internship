    <textblock>
      Colorectal neoplasm in Asia is now increasingly common and is rising in an alarming manner in&#xD;
      Hong Kong. Population-based screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) should be implemented. With&#xD;
      the establishment of the CUHK JC Bowel Cancer Education Centre in 2008, about 10,000&#xD;
      asymptomatic subjects aged 50-70 years have completed screening by either faeca&#xD;
      immunochemical test (FIT)or colonoscopy till December 2012. From 2013 onwards, the centre&#xD;
      invites subjects aged 40-70 years with risk factors for CRC to undergo screening by FIT on a&#xD;
      yearly basis. If FIT result is positive, according to local practice, they will be offered a&#xD;
      routine colonoscopy as they will be treated as symptomatic. Currently, about 2,500 subjects&#xD;
      have received CRC screening in this new project. There will be 2,500 subjects more to be&#xD;
      recruited to this till 31 December 2017. The investigators would like to carry out a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study of these 2,500 subjects and also retrospectively review the cohort&#xD;
      of 12,500 subjects who received CRC screening in the CUHK JC Bowel Cancer Education Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Evaluate the knowledge, attitude, perception, practice, perceived obstacles and&#xD;
           changes in choice of CRC screening among the screening participants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Assess the levels of compliance across time among those who joined the screening&#xD;
           programme, according to different subject characteristics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Explore the diagnostic accuracy of faecal immunochemical tests among subjects with&#xD;
           different characteristics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Evaluate the risk factors for colorectal neoplasia and if applicable, devise and&#xD;
           validate a risk scoring system for prediction of neoplasia in different colon sites;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. . Evaluate the association between bowel preparation, colonoscopy withdrawal time and&#xD;
           adenoma detection rate among those who received colonoscopy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. . Validation of the existing risk scoring systems for colorectal neoplasia from the&#xD;
           literature, based on findings from subjects who received colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. . Explore potential associations among colorectal neoplasia detected in different colon&#xD;
           sites.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal neoplasm in Asia is not less common compared to that of the Western population and&#xD;
      screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) should be implemented. In the Asia Pacific Consensus&#xD;
      for Colorectal Cancer, Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) was recommended as the preferred test&#xD;
      in resource limited areas in Asia. Yet, the preference of Asian in the options for CRC&#xD;
      screening might be different. In a recent study from Hong Kong, most subjects preferred to&#xD;
      use colonoscopy instead of stool tests as the screening tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study from Asia showed that fecal immunochemical test (FIT) might be preferred because it&#xD;
      obviates the need for dietary control. Educating the public about different options available&#xD;
      is an important method to change the health seeking behavior of subjects. The CUHK JC Bowel&#xD;
      Cancer Education Centre was established in 2008 with full funding from the Hong Kong Jockey&#xD;
      Club Charities Trust. About 10,000 subjects received CRC screening by either FIT or&#xD;
      colonoscopy till 31 December 2012. From 2013 onwards, the centre invites subjects aged 40-70&#xD;
      years with risk factors for CRC to undergo screening by FIT on a yearly basis. If FIT result&#xD;
      is positive, according to local practice, they will be offered a routine colonoscopy as they&#xD;
      will be treated as symptomatic. Currently, a total of about 2,500 asymptomatic subjects have&#xD;
      received CRC screening in this new project and the Centre will continue to recruit 2,500&#xD;
      subjects more till 31 December 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To inform future screening policy for implementation of population-based screening, it is&#xD;
      important to explore the different aspects of this community-based CRC screening programme&#xD;
      which include various indicators of programmatic performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the knowledge, attitude, perception, practice, perceived obstacles and changes&#xD;
           in choice of CRC screening among the screening participants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the levels of compliance across time among those who joined the screening&#xD;
           programme, according to different subject characteristics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the diagnostic accuracy of faecal immunochemical tests among subjects with&#xD;
           different characteristics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the risk factors for colorectal neoplasia and if applicable, devise and&#xD;
           validate a risk scoring system for prediction of neoplasia in different colon sites;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate the association between bowel preparation, colonoscopy withdrawal time and&#xD;
           adenoma detection rate among those who received colonoscopy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Validation of the existing risk scoring systems for colorectal neoplasia from the&#xD;
           literature, based on findings from subjects who received colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Explore potential associations among colorectal neoplasia detected in different colon&#xD;
           sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective cohort Demographic data, health behavior information and clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      subjects who received CRC screening in CUHK Bowel Cancer Education Centre from December 2008&#xD;
      to Sept 2015 will be retrospectively reviewed without consent and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study subjects will be invited to join the study via routine health talk of a CRC&#xD;
           screening program organized by CUHK JC Bowel Cancer Education Centre&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Each eligible subject completed a self-administered survey, which consists of&#xD;
           sociodemographic information, family history of CRC for a first-degree relative, past&#xD;
           medical history, and use of chronic medications. The completeness of questionnaires is&#xD;
           checked afterwards. Trained volunteers assist survey completion for the relatively&#xD;
           illiterate participants. The investigators used a quantitative FIT (OC Sensor).&#xD;
           Participants received information on procedures for collecting the FIT samples at home,&#xD;
           according to the manufacturer's instructions. They are requested to return their&#xD;
           collection tubes containing faecal specimens to the centre 6 days within the stool&#xD;
           collection. For those with negative FIT, they will be reminded to continue the FIT&#xD;
           screening on a yearly basis till 2018. For those subjects with FIT positive findings,&#xD;
           according to local practice, they will be offered a routine colonoscopy as they will be&#xD;
           treated as symptomatic. Subjects who undergo colonoscopy may receive a phone-call follow&#xD;
           up every year for the period of the study to monitor the clinical outcome of the&#xD;
           subject. Subjects develop symptoms suggestive of colorectal neoplasm will be worked up&#xD;
           by the original team of investigators.&#xD;
