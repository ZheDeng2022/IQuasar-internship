    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are (1) to evaluate the effects of acute dietary&#xD;
      strawberry intake on measures of vascular function in healthy adults following a meal&#xD;
      challenge, (2) to evaluate the effects of acute dietary strawberry intake on metabolic&#xD;
      status, and (3) to assess intervention-associated metabolite and inflammatory signatures and&#xD;
      their relationship to vascular function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, 2-arm, single-blinded, within subject cross-over trial focused on&#xD;
      evaluating the effects of acute dietary strawberry intake on measures of vascular function,&#xD;
      metabolic status, as well as metabolite and inflammatory signatures and their relationship to&#xD;
      vascular function in healthy adults following a meal challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned sample size of 15 will be enrolled into the study. This study will require one&#xD;
      initial screening visit and 2 study visits. This study will take approximately 1 week per&#xD;
      subject to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will provide subject with the informed consent document and&#xD;
      determine subject eligibility through anthropometric measurements, vital signs, fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose test (finger prick), and completion of a survey relate to general eating, health, and&#xD;
      exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will be invited to participate in the study&#xD;
      for 2 study days. Subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual diet pattern and&#xD;
      physical activity throughout study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will arrive at the center in a fasted state for at least 10 hours, well hydrated and&#xD;
      rested. Each study visit will require blood draws and ultrasound measurement throughout the&#xD;
      visit. After evaluation of subject's health status (via anthropometric, vital sign and blood&#xD;
      glucose measurements and in-person interview), a Licensed Health Care Professional will place&#xD;
      a catheter in subject's arm for the purpose of multiple blood sample collections and take the&#xD;
      initial blood draw in the fasting state. A baseline FMD procedure will be completed&#xD;
      immediately after baseline blood sample collection. Afterwards, subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive the strawberry powder treatment or placebo based on randomized treatment sequences&#xD;
      for 2 study visits immediately after fasting blood draw. The sequences of receiving the&#xD;
      supplement at each visit will be randomly assigned to one of 2 following sequences: A-B or&#xD;
      B-A Each study visit will involve with blood samples collection at time points 0 (fasting),&#xD;
      1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hour (h) for assessment of change in metabolites and inflammatory&#xD;
      signatures. FMD procedure will be conducted after completing the baseline blood draw and&#xD;
      later at 2h, 4h, 6h, and 24h. A standard breakfast will be provided immediately after the 0h&#xD;
      blood collection.&#xD;
