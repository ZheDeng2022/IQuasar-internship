  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study with two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating, single dose study in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single dose of up to 1800 mg HMPL004-6599 or matching placebo on Day&#xD;
      1. The planned dose levels are: 600, 1200, and 1800 mg under fed conditions with a standard&#xD;
      meal, according to the randomization schedule. Dose levels may be repeated, or reduced if&#xD;
      deemed appropriate by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating, multiple dose study in&#xD;
      healthy male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose levels in Part B for 14 days are planned as 200mg TID, 400mg TID, 600mg BID and 600mg&#xD;
      TID. These dose were jointly decided by the PI, SMC and the Sponsor based on the results from&#xD;
      Part A. On day 14, only one dose in the morning will be administrated for all cohorts. Dose&#xD;
      levels may be repeated, or reduced if deemed appropriate by the Safety Monitoring Committee&#xD;
      (SMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, cohort 1 will consist of a blinded sentinel group of two subjects; one subject&#xD;
      will receive HMPL004-6599 and the other will receive placebo, at least 24 hours prior to&#xD;
      dosing the remaining 6 subjects in the cohort. The remaining subjects will only be dosed&#xD;
      after review of available safety data from the sentinel subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Part A and Part B, PK sample collections will take place. During Part A, a full PK&#xD;
      profile will be measured throughout Day 1. Samples will be collected from pre-dose to 24&#xD;
      hours post dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B PK sample collection is based on Part A study data. A full PK testing of plasma&#xD;
      samples from pre-dose to 8 (TID) or 12 (BID) hours post dose will be collected on the first&#xD;
      and last dosing days. Stool samples produced at baseline before dose and day 14-15 post last&#xD;
      dose will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentrations of Andrographolide (AND), 14-deoxy-11,12- didehydroandrographolide (DDAND),&#xD;
      HM5013620, neoandrographolide (NAND) and 14-deoxyandrographolide (DAND) in plasma (Part A and&#xD;
      B) and fecal samples (Part B) will be determined for each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma samples will be analyzed at the lab contracted by the Sponsor.&#xD;
