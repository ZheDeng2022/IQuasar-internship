      The primary objective of this prospective trial will be to assess the effects of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine administration on oxygenation and respiratory function in patients undergoing&#xD;
      diagnostic or therapeutic medical thoracoscopy/pleuroscopy for a pleural effusion compared to&#xD;
      conventional conscious sedation/monitored anesthesia care (MAC) with midazolam. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoint of the study will be to also assess the effects of dexmedetomidine administration on&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics and postprocedural complications&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Management in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Department of Thoracic Surgery at the Attikon University Hospital,&#xD;
      Athens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has received approval by the Attikon University Hospital's Scientific &amp; Bioethics&#xD;
      Committee and written informed consent will be obtained from all patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation: A total of 60 patients will be assigned on a 1 to 1 basis to avoid&#xD;
      bias to either a &quot;DEX = dexmedetomidine&quot; (n=30) or a &quot;MIDAZOLAM/FENTANYL&quot; group (n=30). To&#xD;
      determine the required sample sizes quoted above, the statistical G-power calculator&#xD;
      developed by Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, and Buchner was used. Values used to calculate the effect&#xD;
      size (e=0.9326031) are based on results previously reported in the literature. For a study&#xD;
      power of 90% with an alpha value of 0.05, a total of 26 patients in each group will need to&#xD;
      be enrolled. Factoring in possible losses this number was rounded up to 30 patients per&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Measurements Performance &amp; Methods: Patients will initially be assessed with spirometry&#xD;
      and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis prior to the medical thoracoscopy/pleuroscopy to&#xD;
      determine their baseline values of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced Vital&#xD;
      Capacity (FVC) and Partial arterial Pressure of Oxygen/ Fraction of Inspiratory Oxygen&#xD;
      (PaO2/FiO2) ratio respectively. Intra-operatively repeat ABG analysis will be performed at 30&#xD;
      minutes following the start of administration of the study drug. Subsequent to their medical&#xD;
      thoracoscopy/pleuroscopy procedure study subjects will remain in the Post Anesthesia Care&#xD;
      Unit (PACU) for a minimum of 1 hour following the discontinuation of the study drug. Repeated&#xD;
      ABG analysis and spirometry will be carried out at that 1 hour to assess improvement over the&#xD;
      pre-operative values. The administration of the spirometry exam will be by the same&#xD;
      pulmonologist using the same spirometer device so as to minimize inter-observer variability.&#xD;
      Arterial blood gas measurements will also be performed in the same analysis device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for Sedation &amp; Analgesia: Dexmedetomidine (DEX) group: Initial loading dose of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine will be 1.0 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine administered over 10 minutes. Fifteen&#xD;
      minutes after starting the study drug administration, patients will be assessed for their&#xD;
      level of sedation using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAA/S), and&#xD;
      any patient having a score ≥3 will receive intravenous (IV) midazolam in 0.5 mg doses, which&#xD;
      will be repeated until the OAA/S is ≤2. MIDAZOLAM/FENTANYL group: Patients will be assessed&#xD;
      for their level of sedation using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale&#xD;
      (OAA/S), and any patient having a score ≥3 will receive intravenous (IV) midazolam in 0.5 mg&#xD;
      doses, which will be repeated until the OAA/S is ≤2 All subjects will receive local&#xD;
      anesthesia prior to the commencement of the &quot;open&quot; trocar insertion technique performed by&#xD;
      the thoracic surgeon at the point of introduction of the rigid trocar in the pleural cavity&#xD;
      with a combination of lidocaine 1.5% and ropivacaine 0.75%. If a patient is not adequately&#xD;
      sedated, rescue midazolam will be administered as single IV boluses of 0.5 mg, which will be&#xD;
      repeated as needed to achieve an OAA/S score of ≤3. Intravenous fentanyl, 25 μg boluses which&#xD;
      can be repeated as necessary, will be given if a patient expresses a pain score of ≥3 during&#xD;
      the study drugs infusion and ≥4 in the PACU on a Verbal scale of 0-10 (0 = no pain, 10 =&#xD;
      worst pain), or if the anesthetist determines the presence of pain when verbal communication&#xD;
      is not possible. Blood gas analysis will be obtained at 30' and 60' minutes intraoperatively.&#xD;
      The dexmedetomidine infusion will be discontinued after wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time, if clinically indicated, the patient will be converted to an alternative&#xD;
      sedative or anesthetic therapy and the study will be discontinued. OAA/S scores and all&#xD;
      standard vital signs will be obtained every 5 min throughout the study drug infusion and&#xD;
      before the administration of any rescue midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to reach OAA/S =5 from the end of infusion will be recorded. Other data recorded at&#xD;
      the end of surgery will include total fentanyl and midazolam used intraoperatively,&#xD;
      crystalloid infusion in litres, total mcg of the study drug (provided a [dex] = 4 mcg/ml) and&#xD;
      postoperative Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score. If VAS&gt;3 acetaminophen 1 g will be&#xD;
      administered. The patient's monitoring will be continued in the post-anesthesia care unit&#xD;
      (PACU) with vital signs been recorded every 5 minutes for the first 15 minutes, then every 15&#xD;
      minutes for the next 45 minutes. Blood gas analysis will be obtained every 30' until&#xD;
      discharge from the PACU. At 24 hours from the end of surgery, a spirometry will be performed.&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction and surgeon satisfaction score will also be registered (4-point scale -&#xD;
      0 min to 3 max). Patients will be discharged from the PACU when their OAA/S score =5.&#xD;
