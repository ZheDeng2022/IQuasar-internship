  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single arm phase II study to evaluate potential prognostic and/or&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers in patients with metastatic ccRCC undergoing treatment with 1st line&#xD;
      sunitinib on a 4/2 schedule followed by axitinib on 2nd line therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, all included patients will receive sunitinib until disease progression and/or&#xD;
      limiting toxicity. If patients develop toxicities ≥ Grade 2 on 50 mg per day 4 weeks-on / 2&#xD;
      weeks-off schedule, a modified schedule of 50 mg/day 2 weeks-on / 1 week-off will be offered.&#xD;
      After disease progression on sunitinib, all eligible patients will receive axitinib 5 mg&#xD;
      twice a day. The investigators plan to assess, by next generation sequencing, the prevalence&#xD;
      of mutations in several cancer related genes in baseline archived tissue from the patients&#xD;
      included in the study, and the potential correlations between these somatic mutations and&#xD;
      anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) therapy efficacy.&#xD;
