  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, primary liver cancer is the 3rd most common cause of cancer-related death,&#xD;
      accounting for 6% of cancer diagnoses. In the UK, the number of cases reported has more than&#xD;
      trebled since the 1970's, with 5550 new cases in 2014 (CRUK statistics 2014). Liver&#xD;
      transplant or surgery are the main forms of treatment offered but only less than 20% of&#xD;
      patients can tolerate these treatments. There is a need for non-surgical therapies that would&#xD;
      improve these patients' chances of survival. Radiotherapy has been shown to increase the&#xD;
      likelihood of liver cancer cure. To deliver radiotherapy safely to the patient, the radiation&#xD;
      must be delivered to the liver cancer only, avoiding normal liver tissues and other&#xD;
      surrounding normal tissues. Because the liver moves during breathing, a liver cancer will&#xD;
      also move during radiotherapy. To accurately target the cancer the patient can be asked to&#xD;
      hold their breath during treatment to stop the motion. Or motion of the cancer can be&#xD;
      monitored and the radiation beam can be moved to follow its motion. The investigators are&#xD;
      investigating new methods to either: (a) ensure that when the patient repeats their breath&#xD;
      hold the cancer is in the same position each time, or (b) measure the motion of the liver&#xD;
      cancer whilst the patient breathes freely. It is not clear which is the best method and&#xD;
      therefore are investigating both approaches. Ultrasound is a non-invasive and real-time&#xD;
      imaging method that can easily be used to image the liver and may be able to perform both of&#xD;
      these tasks. In this study the investigators will test ultrasound equipment, which has been&#xD;
      specifically designed to guide radiotherapy. 26 healthy volunteers will be recruited to help&#xD;
      evaluate the accuracy of ultrasound to measure the position of the liver in breath hold and&#xD;
      in free breathing.&#xD;

      PURPOSE: This observational study of healthy volunteers will test the use of a safe,&#xD;
      non-ionising and non-invasive imaging system for the purpose of improving radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment of the liver. This study investigates an image guidance method which may be used to&#xD;
      guide liver radiotherapy and enable more accurate treatment on a conventional radiotherapy&#xD;
      machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT: Volunteers will need to provide their National Health Service (UK) numbers and&#xD;
      be registered on the hospital information system. Volunteers need to be aware that if they&#xD;
      are patients at the Royal Marsden Hospital this may raise confidentiality issues. Volunteers&#xD;
      will be made aware of this in the recruiting email and the Volunteer Information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      USE OF HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS: This is an observational study, which tests the use of an&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance system. The accuracy of the system will be evaluated by comparison of&#xD;
      proprietary methods of liver position estimation against a manually derived ground truth&#xD;
      derived from the images of the liver acquired in participants. It is not expected that there&#xD;
      are any differences in the ultrasound guidance images of healthy volunteers and patients with&#xD;
      liver cancer. Ultrasound is a non-invasive and non-ionizing imaging modality with no known&#xD;
      side-effects or complications and therefore, safe to use in a volunteer study. Furthermore,&#xD;
      this study requires that participants lie on a hard couch for up to 45 minutes and up to 4&#xD;
      times. This would be challenging for the vast majority of patients with liver cancer who are&#xD;
      most likely to be frail due to their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REVIEW OF HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS: The ultrasound guidance system provides 3D ultrasound images of&#xD;
      the liver for providing positional information only. It is very unlikely that abnormalities&#xD;
      will be detectable on 3D US guidance images. These images are not of diagnostic quality,&#xD;
      being lower resolution than routine diagnostic 2D ultrasound images. Furthermore, diagnostic&#xD;
      ultrasound of the liver often incorporates ultrasound contrast agent, which will not be used&#xD;
      in this study. If a radiographer does observe any abnormality, this will be reported to a&#xD;
      Consultant Radiologist and the images will be made available for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS, BURDENS and BENEFITS: There is very little risk associated with ultrasound and the&#xD;
      Automatic Breathing Control (ABC) device, both pieces of the equipment are CE-marked and we&#xD;
      are not using outside of their respective intended purposes. The burden to the volunteer is&#xD;
      (1) the time spent, (2) the uncomfortable nature of the couch (it has a hard flat surface)&#xD;
      and (3) discomfort using the ABC device. The participant will made aware of (1), (2) and (3)&#xD;
      by providing details in the volunteer information sheet. Participants who are uncomfortable&#xD;
      using the ABC can opt out and still participate in the study. Participants will be able to&#xD;
      get up from the couch and walk around to relive any discomfort at any point during the&#xD;
      imaging sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no benefits for the participants. It is expected that this study will be of benefit&#xD;
      to future patients with liver cancer. To ensure there is no perceived benefit of the&#xD;
      acquisition of ultrasound images it is stated clearly in the volunteer information sheet that&#xD;
      images are not of diagnostic quality and that persons obtaining the images are trained in&#xD;
      therapy guidance and not diagnostics, and that images will only be reviewed by a radiologist&#xD;
      in the unlikely event that an abnormality is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: There are no conflicts of interest. No study investigator will benefit&#xD;
      financially from the outcome of this study. The manufacturer of the Clarity ultrasound system&#xD;
      will be informed of the results and all results will be published in a peer-reviewed&#xD;
      scientific journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACCESS to DATA: The investigators wish to make anonymised image data available to other&#xD;
      researchers on request for the purpose of medical research. This is intended to maximise the&#xD;
      value of the data and may provide greater benefit to patients. Volunteers will be asked to&#xD;
      consent to their anonymised data being made available to other researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS: This study aims to develop and evaluate the use of 3 ultrasound (3DUS) to estimate the&#xD;
      liver position for radiotherapy guidance. This is an exploratory study, where Clarity US of&#xD;
      the abdomen will be acquired in healthy volunteers. 3D US-sim, 3D US-guide, 3D US-monitor and&#xD;
      4D US-monitor will be used to meet the following study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The accuracy of B-mode 3D US-guide, to estimate the position of the liver in breath-hold&#xD;
           for verification of (1) daily set-up position (set-up US-guide) and (2) repeat breath&#xD;
           hold relevant to radiotherapy delivery (BH 3D US-monitor), will be determined. Accuracy&#xD;
           will be assessed by comparison of US-guide and US-monitor determined liver position with&#xD;
           a manually determined 'gold standard' liver position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of the accuracy of power Doppler and B-mode US-guide/US-monitor for the&#xD;
           estimation of liver position during breath hold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of the accuracy of 4D US-monitor to estimate liver motion during free&#xD;
           breathing (FB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Comparison of liver position stability using spirometry and voluntary breath-hold (vBH)&#xD;
           using US-monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment of the availability of a second or third ultrasound field of view for&#xD;
           increasing the accuracy of US-guide based estimates of liver motion.&#xD;
