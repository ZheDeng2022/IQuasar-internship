  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed randomized controlled trial aims to study the long-term compliance of the LiFE&#xD;
      program and its combined effects with a home safety visit on fall prevention in&#xD;
      community-dwelling older fallers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. The subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the LiFE exercise plus home safety assessment group, or the control group by a&#xD;
      computer program operated by an independent researcher. This study conforms to the ethical&#xD;
      principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
