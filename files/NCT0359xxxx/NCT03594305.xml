  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a cluster randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      an educational intervention for religious leaders in promoting uptake of family planning in&#xD;
      Tanzania.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this community randomized trial, the investigators will randomize 12 rural villages to&#xD;
      receive an educational seminar for their religious leaders about family planning. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare these uptake of family planning in these 12 villages with 12&#xD;
      matched villages whose religious leaders do not attend an educational seminar about family&#xD;
      planning. The investigators will also determine women's reasons for seeking family planning&#xD;
      at the village dispensaries..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the trial, the study team will ensure that dispensaries in all villages&#xD;
      in the trial will have a reliable supply of contraceptive options. To mitigate the effect of&#xD;
      economic barriers and medication shortages on access to contraception, a dedicated medication&#xD;
      supply team will make certain that all dispensaries remain well-stocked with standard&#xD;
      contraceptives that are free from the Tanzanian Ministry of Health. These include oral&#xD;
      contraceptive pills, implants, injections, copper intrauterine devices, and condoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Villages will be paired by proximity (within 50 kilometers of one another). Within the pair,&#xD;
      one village will be randomly assigned, using a computer-generated algorithm, to receive the&#xD;
      intervention of religiously- and culturally-informed teaching intervention about family&#xD;
      planning for religious leaders. The other village will be the control village. Each&#xD;
      intervention village will be followed, and its religious leaders mentored in groups, for 12&#xD;
      months after the start of the intervention. Mentorship groups of 25 leaders, led by the study&#xD;
      team, will meet for 1 hour per month. The investigators will also conduct focus groups in&#xD;
      both intervention and control villages to understand community perceptions of family&#xD;
      planning.&#xD;

    <description>Villages randomized to this arm will receive a one-day educational seminar, which their religious leaders of all denominations will be invited to attend. The seminar will address religious, cultural, and medical aspects of family planning. Leaders who attend will also have the opportunity to participate in mentorship group discussions after the intervention. In addition, both villages will have standard teaching provided by nurses at dispensaries about family planning, and a continual supply of contraceptive options at dispensaries in all villages will be ensured.</description>
