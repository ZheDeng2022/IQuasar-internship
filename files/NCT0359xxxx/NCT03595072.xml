      This study will investigate whether a Vagal Nerve Stimulator (VNS) causes measurable&#xD;
      desynchronization and reduces epileptiform activity, such as spikes and seizures, in&#xD;
      electrocorticograms (ECOGs) recorded by a Responsive Neurostimulator (RNS) in patients who&#xD;
      have both devices implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the change in frequency of epileptiform discharges during active VNS&#xD;
           stimulation compared to interstimulation baseline periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the change in frequency of seizures during active VNS stimulation compared to&#xD;
           interstimulation baseline periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the change in the number of RNS activations during active VNS stimulation&#xD;
           compared to interstimulation baseline periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the change in synchronization of background ECoG (electrocorticogram) during&#xD;
           VNS stimulation compared to interstimulation baseline periods.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Drug resistant epilepsy, is defined by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) as&#xD;
      &quot;the failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AED&#xD;
      (Antiepileptic drug) schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve&#xD;
      sustained seizure freedom.&quot; About a third of epilepsy cases are drug resistant and are&#xD;
      considered for non-pharmacologic treatment. Surgical removal (resection) of the seizure focus&#xD;
      is the treatment of choice in drug resistant epilepsy with focal onset. However, curative&#xD;
      surgery is not always feasible, e.g. if it would lead to unacceptable deficits, or if there&#xD;
      are seizure onset areas in both sides of the brain. In addition, depending on the&#xD;
      circumstances, patients treated with surgery do not become seizure free in about 10-80% of&#xD;
      cases, depending on presence or absence of a lesion and location of the seizure focus. Other&#xD;
      surgical options include implantation of neuromodulatory devices, such as Vagus Nerve&#xD;
      Stimulator (VNS) and Responsive Neurostimulator (RNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIa. Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS) Brain surgery was the only surgical option for some&#xD;
      patients in this drug-resistant patient population until 1997 when the VNS was approved by&#xD;
      the FDA. VNS is approved for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of&#xD;
      seizures in adults and adolescents over age 12 diagnosed with medically refractory partial&#xD;
      onset seizures (FDA 1997). The vagus nerve and its centers (nuclei) in the brainstem have, in&#xD;
      general, an inhibitory effect on organs. VNS therapy can suppress seizures by sending mild&#xD;
      pulses of electrical energy to the vagus nerve in regular intervals. The default setting of&#xD;
      stimulation are cycles of 30-seconds &quot;on&quot; and 5-minutes &quot;off&quot;. These stimulation pulses are&#xD;
      supplied by a thin, round battery-containing device which is placed under the skin on the&#xD;
      left side of the chest, like a pacemaker, with wires connecting the generator to the vagus&#xD;
      nerve on the left side of the neck. VNS is not likely to stop seizures (seizure freedom rate&#xD;
      with VNS added range from 2-9%), but it provides a ~50% chance of cutting the seizure&#xD;
      frequency in half (Ben-Menachem 1999, Scherrmann 2001,Morris 1999, Kuba 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIb. Responsive Neurostimulator (RNS) The RNS was FDA approved in 2013. The RNS System&#xD;
      provides responsive cortical stimulation through an implanted programmable neurostimulator&#xD;
      connected to depth and/or subdural cortical strip leads targeted to the seizure focus. The&#xD;
      RNS device continually monitors brain activity (electrocorticography [ECoG]). It is&#xD;
      programmed by the physician to detect seizure patterns and provide appropriate electrical&#xD;
      stimulation within a few seconds of the seizure onset. RNS was approved by the FDA for use as&#xD;
      an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in individuals 18 years of age or&#xD;
      older with partial (focal) onset seizures who have undergone diagnostic testing that&#xD;
      localized to no more than two epileptogenic foci, are refractory to two or more antiepileptic&#xD;
      medications, and currently have frequent and disabling seizures (FDA 2013). The generator of&#xD;
      the device is implanted in the patient's skull and wires connect to the leads in or on the&#xD;
      brain (see Figure 2). Depending on where in the brain it is implanted, RNS is associated with&#xD;
      seizure free intervals of 6 months in 26-29% of patients and of 12 months in 14-15% of cases.&#xD;
      The rate of seizure freedom is relatively low, compared to resections, but the chance of a&#xD;
      marked (~70%) seizure reduction is high (Geller 2017, Jobst 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIc. No studies to date have investigated the effect of VNS stimulation on the more recently&#xD;
      FDA approved RNS. The initial RNS feasibility study listed VNS as an exclusion criteria as it&#xD;
      was not clear how the two devices would interact. However, before RNS was available, patients&#xD;
      with a seizure focus or several foci that could not be surgically removed, were implanted&#xD;
      with VNS. Therefore, in the current post-approval phase of RNS treatment, many patients&#xD;
      already have a VNS which has not brought the hoped for seizure relief. Across centers it has&#xD;
      been standard practice to implant RNS in patients who have a VNS, and to keep the VNS turned&#xD;
      on, if the patient reported clinical benefit. Even though there are no guidelines, the&#xD;
      rationale for not removing a VNS before RNS implantation appears to be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The devices are not linked or physically close together and are not enabled to&#xD;
           communicate with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Current delivered by either device penetrates only targeted tissue in the immediate&#xD;
           vicinity of the electrodes and is not able to reach the other device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Each device provides a different mechanism of action and is a separate, independent&#xD;
           modality to influence seizures, similar to medications and VNS being different therapy&#xD;
           modalities that act in a complementary fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To date, no case of a concerning interaction has been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, many patients with drug-resistant epilepsy have both VNS and RNS implanted. So far, the&#xD;
      investigators have no data and no knowledge of how the VNS influences brain activity, as&#xD;
      recorded by RNS, close to a seizure focus. The presence of continually-recording Intracranial&#xD;
      RNS electrodes provides a unique opportunity to study changes in normal and abnormal ECoG&#xD;
      patterns during VNS stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. PRELIMINARY STUDIES/PROGRESS REPORT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VNS continues to be used as an adjunctive therapy as many patients with drug resistant&#xD;
      epilepsy are either opposed to a resection or the invasive surgery required for RNS&#xD;
      implantation, or are not a good candidate for these surgeries based on location and/or number&#xD;
      of epileptogenic foci. VNS was approved by the FDA in 1997 for use as an adjunctive therapy&#xD;
      in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over age 12 diagnosed with&#xD;
      medically refractory partial onset seizures. Data suggests that only 2-9% (Ben-Menachem 1999,&#xD;
      Scherrmann 2001) of patients become seizure free after implantation, but over time 43-49% of&#xD;
      patients experience a &gt;50% drop in seizure frequency (Morris 1999; Kuba 2009.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the RNS comparative study - which investigated device efficacy - seizure frequency was&#xD;
      measured for 3 months in both the Treatment Group (received stimulation) and the Control&#xD;
      Group (did not receive stimulation). The Treatment Group had a reduction in seizures of 37.9%&#xD;
      and the Control Group had a reduction in seizures of 17.3%. Seizure frequency was also&#xD;
      measured by determining the number of patients who achieved a 50% reduction in seizures.&#xD;
      After 1 year, almost half of the patients in the treatment group (44%) had at least 50% fewer&#xD;
      seizures. And at 2 years, over half of the patients (55%) had at least 50% fewer seizures.&#xD;
      Seven-year follow-up showed up to 70% seizure reduction, and up to 15% of patients reported&#xD;
      seizure free periods of 12 months (Geller et al 2017, Jobst et al 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VNS was an exclusion criterion in the RNS clinical trial to avoid any interference of the&#xD;
      devices. Of all patients enrolled in the study, 32% had previously used VNS without&#xD;
      sufficient benefit (Bergey 2015). This patient population had the VNS explanted in order to&#xD;
      participate in the RNS trial. Nowadays, after approval of the device, 27% of patients who&#xD;
      receive a RNS also have a VNS (unpublished data collected by Neuropace® the company&#xD;
      manufacturing the device, personal communication). In clinical practice, there is no&#xD;
      contraindication to combined neurostimulation using VNS in addition to RNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no head-to-head comparison studies have been done that compare efficacy of RNS&#xD;
      compared to VNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of VNS stimulation on the RNS recordings (ECoGs) will be determined during one&#xD;
      clinic visit scheduled for RNS assessment and interrogation. ECoGs with brain activity during&#xD;
      VNS stimulation and in-between stimulation - baseline - intervals will be recorded, stored,&#xD;
      and later analyzed. During this visit, as an exception to standard of care, the regular,&#xD;
      patient-specific VNS &quot;on-&quot; and &quot;off-times&quot; will be turned off and VNS stimulation will be&#xD;
      triggered by the investigator using a magnet that activates the VNS for the set time of 30&#xD;
      seconds (see detailed protocol below.) This will represent a temporary change in a patient's&#xD;
      VNS settings for the time of the recordings, but at the end of the visit, the stimulation&#xD;
      &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; times, will be returned to the previous home settings. These VNS changes are&#xD;
      unlikely to affect the patient's seizure control, as VNS effect on seizures is a result of&#xD;
      months and years of stimulation. Though, just like at home, the patient is expected to feel&#xD;
      the VNS &quot;on-time&quot; as a sensation in the throat, often described as &quot;tickling&quot;, which may&#xD;
      prompt clearing the voice or a cough, as well as a transient hoarseness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stimulation time of 30 seconds was chosen for stimulation duration as the typical default&#xD;
      setting for VNS stimulation is 30 seconds and many patients are treated at default settings.&#xD;
      A period of 30 seconds before and after stimulation was chosen as recording time to allow for&#xD;
      at least 1 min between stimulations which is standard of care. Since the purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to compare the effect of active VNS stimulation on the brain and ECoG to intervals&#xD;
      without VNS stimulation, the investigators chose timing that would allow for maximum number&#xD;
      of stimulations/recordings within a clinic appointment that is within the standard of care in&#xD;
      terms of frequency of stimulations&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. DETAILED PROTOCOL FOR RESEARCH DATA COLLECTION IN CLINIC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. RNS recording equipment (so-called &quot;wand&quot;) used to connect to the device through the skin&#xD;
      and collect data will be secured to the patient's scalp over the implanted RNS computer. This&#xD;
      will be done using a velcro cap provided by the RNS Manufacturer (NeuroPace®). Connection&#xD;
      will be made with device and real-time ECoG data visualized on laptop. Clinic appointment&#xD;
      will proceed as per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. Electromyography (EMG) electrode will be in place over left side of neck close to the VNS&#xD;
      contacts. This electrode will be able to detect muscle signal and artifact related to VNS&#xD;
      stimulation which will confirm successful VNS activation when triggered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. VNS will be interrogated using a handheld interrogation device. Stimulation parameters&#xD;
      will be recorded and output current will be turned to zero. VNS magnet stimulation duration&#xD;
      will be set to 30 seconds (rationale, see above) with pulse width and output current at the&#xD;
      patient's baseline stimulation settings. All settings will be within accepted ranges for&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. ECoG recording will be initiated on laptop, by turning on &quot;Real-time ECoG&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Thirty seconds into the recording, the VNS will be triggered with magnet stimulation which&#xD;
      will produce a 30-second vagus nerve stimulation (&quot;stim&quot;). 30 seconds later, the recording&#xD;
      will be stopped and stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4a. This will generate a 30 sec pre-stim, a 30 sec stim, and a 30 sec post-stim recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. This will be repeated 30 times per patient for a total of 30 VNS stimulations or up to 45&#xD;
      minutes of patient time&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. At the end of the appointment, VNS will be returned to its scheduled stimulations with any&#xD;
      adjustments needed as would be part of standard of care.&#xD;
