    <textblock>
      Angular measurement of deviation is an essential element in the clinical evaluation of&#xD;
      strabic patients. It is performed by orthoptic methods. However, studies show that the same&#xD;
      patient presents a great variability of his angular measurement between 2 consultations, and&#xD;
      between 2 observers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated angle measurement is a recent concept that aims to overcome the defects of&#xD;
      subjective angle measurement by alternate occlusion test and prismatic bar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements made by these devices would provide reliable, objective and reproducible&#xD;
      measurements of the angle of deviation by increasing the accuracy of strabal angle&#xD;
      assessment, improving decision making and surgical follow-up, decreasing inter-examiner&#xD;
      variability and variability over time, and facilitating data comparison to improve scientific&#xD;
      publication possibilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gazelab® device is a video-oculograph combined with a laser projection system and an&#xD;
      infrared camera. It allows an objective angular evaluation, in non-dissociating physiological&#xD;
      conditions, possible even in the absence of binocular vision and allows an analysis of the&#xD;
      deviation in all positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is extremely little data in the literature on automated measuring devices. The Gazelab&#xD;
      tool is still little known in the strabology discipline and seems to have a number of&#xD;
      advantages over other devices. The interest of this examination towards this pathology led&#xD;
      the ophthalmology department to use it in the current practice, and since recently it is an&#xD;
      act nomenclaturé.&#xD;

      The objective of this work is to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of the&#xD;
      automated angular measurement by the Gazelab® (ES12/13127) apparatus, compared to the&#xD;
      standard gold which is the angular measurement by alternate occlusion test and prismatic bar,&#xD;
      in horizontal strabisms (converging and diverging). Indeed in our daily practice the 2&#xD;
      examinations are carried out. To compare with the standard gold which denotes a strong&#xD;
      inter-observer variability, the investigator will compare the results of the Gazelab to the&#xD;
      alternate occlusion by prism bar (standard gold) 2 times with 2 trained examiners&#xD;

        Strabismus is a pathology that affects 2 to 4% of the French population. The Ophthalmology&#xD;
        Department sees 200 adult patients with strabismus per month. In 6 months it will be easy&#xD;
        to include in 30 months 30 patients of convergent strabismus and 30 of divergent&#xD;
        strabismus. For patients with eye strain who do not have eye refractive errors the&#xD;
        Department of Ophthalmology sees 2000 patients per month, to include these 30 patients in 6&#xD;
        months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since this study is a prospective non-interventional research study, the patient may be&#xD;
        part of a biomedical research study.&#xD;
