  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anterior abdominal wall from below the xiphoid to infraumbilical area is dominated by the&#xD;
      sensory nerves which originate from the anterior rami of the thoracolumbar spinal nerves from&#xD;
      T6-L1. The branches nerves from T7-T12 are between aponeurosis internal oblique and&#xD;
      transversus abdominal muscle. They can be approached with the ultrasound guidance at&#xD;
      subcostal and lateral abdominal wall position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bilateral transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been demonstrated effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety in postoperative analgesia to the under abdominal surgery. However, the effect of one&#xD;
      to the upper abdominal surgery is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four points TAP block has been described the first in 2010. The effect of the four points&#xD;
      TAP block in postoperative analgesia to the upper abdominal surgery has been reported in&#xD;
      recent years. Besides, the effect of thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) in postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia to liver resection was also reported. The both techniques have been performing in&#xD;
      some studies. The effect and safety of the both techniques have been reported. However, the&#xD;
      evidence level is still weak. The investigators need to find a technique, which has&#xD;
      effectiveness as well as safety to replace the epidural analgesia, which was confirmed that&#xD;
      had many complications, in postoperative analgesia to the hepatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the four points TAP block under the ultrasound guidance&#xD;
      has more effectiveness than the thoracic paravertebral block in postoperative analgesia to&#xD;
      the hepatectomy.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, controlled, no blind, clinical trial. The study was approved by Board&#xD;
      of Scientists and Ethic Council in Gia Dinh People Hospital on May 28, 2018. The written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from all subjects participating in the trial. The trial&#xD;
      will be registered prior to patient enrollment at Gia Dinh People Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will select 60 participants who are selective hepatectomy with the&#xD;
      &quot;J-shape&quot; incision, II-III of Anesthesiologists Society America (ASA), from 18-75 age. The&#xD;
      cases have chronic pain, tolerance opioids, psychology disorder, and allergy opioids or&#xD;
      ropivacaine will excluded. All of participants will be randomly divided two groups. There are&#xD;
      TAP group and PVB group. Each one has 30 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of cases will be examined, prepared, supplied the study's information on the day before&#xD;
      surgical date. The cases, who have enough selective standard, will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, the participants will be performed general anesthesia The participants&#xD;
      will be started anesthesia with 1 mg of midazolam, 0.3 mcg/kg of sufentanil, 1-1.5 mg/kg of&#xD;
      propofol, and 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium. Then, the participants will be maintained anesthesia&#xD;
      with sevoflurane, sufentanil, and rocuronium. The end of surgery, they will be prevented&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting with 4 mg of ondansetron; and reversed residual of muscle&#xD;
      relaxant with sugammadex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approaching the transversus abdominal plane:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique will be performed at the end of surgery. The TAP group will be performed the&#xD;
      four points TAP block under the ultrasound guidance with the ultrasound machine of Logiq E,&#xD;
      and linear 12S probe. The participants will be performed TAP block at subcostal and lateral&#xD;
      abdominal wall at right and left side with stimuplex needle (sized 18G, length 100 mm). The&#xD;
      investigators will approach position between aponeurosis internal oblique and transversus&#xD;
      abdominal muscle with in-plane real-time ultrasound technique. The investigators will inject&#xD;
      10 ml of ropivacaine 0.375% at each one. Then, the investigators will access one catheter at&#xD;
      TAP at right side to continuously infuse ropivacaine 0.375% during 48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approaching the thoracic paravertebral space:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will access one catheter into the right thoracic paravertebral space at T7&#xD;
      before beginning general anesthesia. At the end of surgery, we will inject 20 ml of&#xD;
      ropivacaine 0.5% through catheter, and continuously infuse ropivacaine 0.25% during 48 hours&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients-controlled analgesia (PCA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of participants will be treated postoperative analgesia with sufentanil during 48 hours&#xD;
      after operating. The sufentanil will be injected 2 mcg to patients before awaking. Then, the&#xD;
      participants will be intravenously infused with PCA (2 mcg of single dosage, 6 minutes of&#xD;
      lockout time, and 8 mcg/hour of limited dosage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The both groups will be intravenously injected 0.2 mg/kg of ketamine at the pre-incisional&#xD;
      and post-incisional. After operating, they will be taken 325 mg of paracetamol plus 37.5 mg&#xD;
      of tramadol (ultracet tablet) every 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the consumption of sufentanil (mcg) during 24 hours after operating.&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are the complications of technique, systemic toxicity of ropivacaine,&#xD;
      side-effect of sufentanil, and satisfaction of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complications of the four points TAP block include hematoma in abdominal wall, and&#xD;
      puncturing peritoneum. The complications of the thoracic paravertebral block include&#xD;
      pneumothorax, and injecting vascular. The hematoma in abdominal wall, puncturing peritoneum,&#xD;
      injecting vascular will be observed and recorded by one other anesthesiologist who has not&#xD;
      attend the study. The pneumothorax will be diagnosed with the ultrasound by one doctor who is&#xD;
      educated the general ultrasound. The systemic toxicity of ropivacaine include central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) toxicity and cardiovascular toxicity. The signs and symptoms of CNS toxicity&#xD;
      include tinnitus, disorientation, and ultimately, seizures. The signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      cardiovascular toxicity include hypotension, dysrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. The&#xD;
      complications will be treated depending on severity follow the protocol when they occured.&#xD;
      The side-effect of sufentanil include sedation, dyspnea, pruritus, and nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
      The sedation will be evaluated follow Ramsay scale. The dyspnea is decreasing oxygen&#xD;
      saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) &lt;= 92%, frequence &lt;= 8 breaths/minute. The satisfaction&#xD;
      will be measured follow visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS scale has from 0 to 10,&#xD;
      equivalent to the zero is complete dissatisfaction and the ten is highly satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will process data with SPSS 25.0 (Reg No: 1975-01566-C). The consumption of&#xD;
      sufentanil and satisfaction variables will be described by mean (SD) if it is standard&#xD;
      distribution, or by median (CI 95%) if it isn't standard distribution. The variables of both&#xD;
      groups will be compared by the independent T test or Mann-Whitney test. The quantitive&#xD;
      variables will be described by frequency (percentage rate). The investigators will be&#xD;
      compared by Chi-square test or exact's Fisher test. The sample size is calculated with 90% of&#xD;
      power, and 20% of difference of the consumption of sufentanil of both groups, and 10% of&#xD;
      cases losing. The alpha error is 0.05.&#xD;
