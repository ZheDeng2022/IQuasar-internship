  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with symptomatic Oral Lichen Planus lesions will be treated with Rivelin®&#xD;
      patches containing either 0, 1, 5, or 20 μg clobetasol per patch. Each participant will apply&#xD;
      up to 6 patches twice daily for 4 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical study with 3 active&#xD;
      dose arms (Rivelin®-CLO patches) and one placebo arm (Rivelin® plain patch). Up to 6 Rivelin®&#xD;
      patches will be applied to symptomatic ulcerative and symptomatic erythematous OLP lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening (visit 1, day -14 to day -7), patients who have signed the informed consent&#xD;
      form and who are fulfilling the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized at baseline (visit 2, day 1) to one of the four treatment arms in a double-blinded&#xD;
      fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Rivelin® plain patch (Placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Rivelin®-CLO 1 μg/patch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C: Rivelin®-CLO 5 μg/patch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm D: Rivelin®-CLO 20 μg/patch Randomization will be 1:1:1:1 and patients will be&#xD;
           stratified according to number of patches needed (1-3 and 4-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening phase ranges between 7 and 14 days, i.e. that the screening visit (visit 1)&#xD;
      needs to be performed 7 days prior to baseline at latest. For visits 3 (day 8), 4 (day 15), 5&#xD;
      (day 22), and 6 (day 29) a visit window of +/- 2 days will be allowed. Visit 7 will be&#xD;
      defined as visit 6 + 14 days, with a visit window of +/- 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized patients will enter a 28-days (4-weeks) treatment period. Dosing is two times per&#xD;
      day (morning and evening) with patches applied directly on OLP lesions as instructed by a&#xD;
      clinician or delegated site staff. Patients will record symptoms and adhesion time in daily&#xD;
      diaries by using an electronic diary (eDiary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period, the treating physician or dentist will perform an assessment of&#xD;
      the disease status on a weekly basis. A final examination of disease status will be performed&#xD;
      at the follow-up visit (visit 7), 14 days after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other treatments of symptomatic OLP lesions during the study are prohibited. Only rescue&#xD;
      analgesics determined by the investigator at study entry on a patient specific basis are&#xD;
      allowed to be taken, in case that OLP associated symptoms like pain cannot be managed by the&#xD;
      sole use of the patches. All doses of rescue analgesics will be recorded by the patient in&#xD;
      the eDiary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patients' condition is worsening (at the discretion of the investigator) and if&#xD;
      associated symptoms cannot longer be managed acceptably by the additional use of rescue&#xD;
      analgesics, i.e. if there is the need to start any other OLP treatment, IMP treatment for&#xD;
      that patient should be discontinued prematurely and patient should be withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 3 (day 8), a blood sample will be drawn to measure the blood plasma concentration of&#xD;
      clobetasol and to determine the morning serum cortisol level (between 7 and 9 AM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a follow-up visit that will be performed 2 weeks after the EoT/ET&#xD;
      visit (visit 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data (by means of AE documentation including fungal infections and SAE reporting) will&#xD;
      be closely monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). DSMB will&#xD;
      advise the Sponsor of any potential risk for the safeguard of patients.&#xD;
