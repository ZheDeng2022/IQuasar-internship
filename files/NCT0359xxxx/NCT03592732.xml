      The principal aim of the present study is to analyze adiponectin, omentin-1, apelin and&#xD;
      visfatin plasma levels in patients with and without AF in an effort to identify their&#xD;
      potential role in the development of AF.&#xD;

      Introduction Adipose tissue is no longer considered a triglycerides-storage depot, but it has&#xD;
      been recognized as an endocrine organ that regulates sugar and fat metabolism and energy&#xD;
      homeostasis and implicates in cardiovascular (CV) function through the release of bioactive&#xD;
      factors, the so-called adipokines. Several adipokines including adiponectin, omentin-1,&#xD;
      apelin and visfatin have been identified as well as their link with CV diseases and,&#xD;
      particularly, coronary artery disease (CAD) (1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the potential impact of adipokines in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has not&#xD;
      still elucidated. Although, there is evidence that apelin (4,5) and omentin-1 (6) are&#xD;
      inversely correlated with AF, available data in regard to adiponectin and visfatin are&#xD;
      inconclusive (7-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The principal aim of the present study is to calculate adiponectin, omentin-1,&#xD;
      apelin and visfatin plasma levels in patients with AF and controls matched for age and gender&#xD;
      in an effort to identify their potential role in the development of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study population. Overall, 40 patients with AF and 40 controls will be studied.&#xD;
      Patients with CAD, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cancer, significant valvular disease,&#xD;
      rheumatic heart disease or stroke will be excluded. The present study is conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by the Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      our Hospital. A written informed consent will be obtained from each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed profile including demographic characteristics (age, gender) and traditional CV&#xD;
      risk factors (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus) will be obtained from&#xD;
      every patient. Body mass index was (BMI) will be calculated as bodyweight in kilograms&#xD;
      divided by height in meters squared and will be estimated for all subjects. All participants&#xD;
      will undergo either electrocardiogram or 24-hour Holter monitoring. AF patients will be&#xD;
      divided into the following three groups: paroxysmal AF, persistent AF and permanent AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions. Paroxysmal AF is defined as a history of one or more episodes of AF that were&#xD;
      treated with pharmacological or electrical cardioversion within seven days. Persistent AF is&#xD;
      defined a history of one or more episodes of AF over seven days that required pharmacological&#xD;
      or electrical cardioversion) and permanent AF is defined as continuous AF for more than a&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography. Transthoracic echocardiography will be performed in every patient. Left&#xD;
      atrial dimension, interventricular septal dimension, left ventricular (LV) end diastolic&#xD;
      dimension and ejection fraction (EF) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis. Blood samples will be collected after 12-hour overnight fasting. Plasma&#xD;
      adiponectin (RD195023100,Human Adiponectin, Elisa Bio Vendor Laboratory, Medicine Inc., Brno,&#xD;
      Czech Republic), omentin-1, apelin (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc, Burlingame, CA) and visfatin&#xD;
      (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, California, CA, USA) levels will be measured by the Elisa method.&#xD;
      Natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein (CRP) and parameters concerning lipid profile (total&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density cholesterol, high-density cholesterol), glycemic&#xD;
      profile (plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c) and renal function (urea, creatinine) will be&#xD;
      measured by standardized enzymatic methods as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Continuous variables will be expressed as mean values Â± standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD). Comparisons of continuous variables will be performed by one-way analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA). Categorical data will be expressed as absolute and relative frequencies.&#xD;
      All data will be analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version&#xD;
      18.0 and all tests will be 2-tailed with the 5% indicating level of significance.&#xD;
