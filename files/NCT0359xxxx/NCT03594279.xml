  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood diarrhea and pneumonia remains the leading cause of mortality among children under&#xD;
      five years of age in Pakistan. The prevalence of diarrhea in Pakistan has increased from 15%&#xD;
      in 1990 to 23% in 2013 while there has been no progress in the prevalence of pneumonia and it&#xD;
      has been almost constant over the last two decades. The coverage of preventive and&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions for childhood diarrhea and pneumonia also remains low. This study&#xD;
      aims to improve the adherence to recommended preventive and curative practices for childhood&#xD;
      diarrhea and pneumonia.&#xD;

      Study Components and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Formative phase: The objective of this phase is to assess the existing care seeking&#xD;
           practices and care provision for childhood diarrhea and pneumonia and identify the&#xD;
           existing barriers and facilitators for care seeking for childhood diarrhea and&#xD;
           pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cluster Randomized Trial: (CoMIC Trial - Community Mobilization and Community&#xD;
           Incentivization): The objective of this phase is to assess the impact of a community&#xD;
           engagement and demand creation strategy involving an community-based incentive scheme on&#xD;
           adherence to recommended preventive and curative practices for diarrhea and pneumonia&#xD;
           among children under five years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site: This study will be conducted in Tando Muhammad Khan, which is a rural district in&#xD;
      the province of Sindh. This would a three and half year study with two year of intervention&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This study will follow a mixed methodology approach with a formative research&#xD;
      component followed by a prospective two arm cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formative Phase: The following activities will be conducted in the formative phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GIS Mapping: for the whole district to map all the government health facilities,&#xD;
           schools, major religious places (mosques), water supply sources and roads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative research: comprising of focus group discussion (FGDs) and in-depth&#xD;
           interviews (IDIs) with all stakeholders. These would also identify the potential&#xD;
           non-cash incentives that the community wants and could be attractive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline Household Survey: Baseline survey will be conducted at the household level and&#xD;
           will gather information on health care practices pertaining to childhood diarrhea and&#xD;
           pneumonia, immunization, socio-economic indicators, childhood nutrition indicators and&#xD;
           WASH indicators. LHWs working in the study area and their geographic spread will also be&#xD;
           identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Randomization: After the mapping and formative research, the clusters (villages) will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to two intervention arms and a control arm by an independent statistician&#xD;
      in the ratio of 1:1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The sample size was calculated with a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05 giving 14&#xD;
      clusters per arm (maximum sample size). These clusters will be randomly allocated to three&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: In Arm 1, separate male and female village committees (VC) consisting of prominent&#xD;
      members of the community including local elites/leaders (6 to 8 in a group) in all the&#xD;
      villages will be formed and they would be trained on specific messages regarding the&#xD;
      prevention and management of childhood diarrhea and pneumonia. The VCs would carry out&#xD;
      awareness and motivational activities for the uptake of the identified interventions. They&#xD;
      would also facilitate two hour group meetings to be held twice every month in every village&#xD;
      of their catchment area and focus on issues pertaining to childhood nutrition, WASH, vaccines&#xD;
      and management of diarrhea and pneumonia in children. Apart from these, there would&#xD;
      researcher led awareness sessions in this intervention cluster and specific sessions for&#xD;
      children would also be conducted. These sessions would focus on providing education and&#xD;
      encourage community participation. Group activities would also identify community level&#xD;
      health, nutrition and sanitation problems, and to find locally feasible strategies to address&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: In the second intervention cluster; in addition to the interventions in Arm 1, the&#xD;
      areas which improve the practices for preventive and curative strategies for diarrhea and&#xD;
      pneumonia will receive community-based incentive. This would be a unique incentive scheme as&#xD;
      all the previous financial incentive programs whether conditional or unconditional cash&#xD;
      transfers, voucher schemes, social insurance schemes have targeted individuals and all these&#xD;
      incentives were based on improving individual practices. The financial incentive proposed is&#xD;
      unique as this initiative which would benefit the community as a whole and incentives based&#xD;
      on improvement in the composite coverage of three indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age-appropriate immunization 12-23 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ORS use for diarrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sanitation index (which is a score based on personal, household and environmental&#xD;
           hygiene) The incentives would include structural benefits linked to health including&#xD;
           tube wells, water supply, toilets in community/schools, water storage facility or any&#xD;
           other incentive as decided with the respective village committees. The total cost of&#xD;
           these incentives would be shared by the project (75%) and the community (25%), to&#xD;
           improve ownership. The contribution from the community could also be in-kind including&#xD;
           labor etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: This arm will receive routine standard of care.&#xD;
