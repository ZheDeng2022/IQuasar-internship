  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to investigate why some individuals exercise more than others by focusing on&#xD;
      feelings related to exercise. This two part study first examines whether regular exercisers&#xD;
      (n=30) and non-exercisers (n=30) differ in how a 30-minute moderate-intensity exercise bout&#xD;
      makes them feel. All participants will walk on a treadmill for 30 minutes on two separate&#xD;
      occasions and will be asked to report on how they feel before, during, and after exercise,&#xD;
      how they anticipate that exercise will make them feel, and how they remembered feeling during&#xD;
      exercise. In addition, after exercise session #2, non-exercisers will be randomized to: 1) a&#xD;
      brief intervention focused on providing general information about the physical activity&#xD;
      guidelines, or 2) a brief intervention which provides general information about physical&#xD;
      activity guidelines, but also focuses on affective responses to physical activity.&#xD;
      Non-exercisers will complete an identical, third exercise session approximately 1-week&#xD;
      following this intervention. Further, all participants will receive a 12-week,&#xD;
      Internet-delivered weight loss program following all exercise visits and physical activity&#xD;
      will be assessed before and after the weight loss program.&#xD;

    <measure>Memory of During Exercise Affect (Session 1) - Calculated as the Difference Between Recalled During Exercise Affect and Actual During Exercise Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>average score assessed every 5 minutes during exercise, up to 30 minutes, and 7 days post-exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated as follows: recalled during exercise affect (assessed 7 days post-exercise) minus actual during exercise affect (average of Feeling Scale scores every 5 minutes during exercise). Possible scores for both recalled affect and actual affect range from -5 to +5, where higher numbers indicate more positive affect. A negative change value indicates that participants remembered feeling less positive during exercise than they actually felt.</description>

    <measure>Memory of Post-exercise Affect (Session 1) - Calculated as the Difference Between Recalled Post-exercise Affect and Actual Post-exercise Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes and 7 days post-exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated as follows: recalled post-exercise affect (assessed 7 days following exercise session) minus actual post-exercise affect (Feeling Scale score assessed 15 minutes post-exercise). Possible scores for both recalled affect and actual affect range from -5 to +5, where higher numbers indicate more positive affect. A negative change value indicates that participants remembered feeling less positive post-exercise than they actually felt.</description>

    <time_frame>prior to exercise session</time_frame>
    <description>How one anticipates that they will feel during exercise session 2 (an exercise session that is identical to exercise session 1).This was assessed prior to exercise session 2 via a 100 mm visual analogue scale (range 1-100) where a higher number indicates more positive affect.</description>

          <description>How one anticipates that they will feel during exercise session 2 (an exercise session that is identical to exercise session 1).This was assessed prior to exercise session 2 via a 100 mm visual analogue scale (range 1-100) where a higher number indicates more positive affect.</description>
