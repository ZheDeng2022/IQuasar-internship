    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the effects of giving early treatment of deferiprone to young&#xD;
      children with beta thalassemia who have started receiving regular blood transfusions but have&#xD;
      not yet reached the criteria for starting on iron chelation therapy. Half the patients in the&#xD;
      study will receive deferiprone, and the other half will receive placebo, for up to 12 months.&#xD;

      This study will give deferiprone to infants and young children with thalassemia who have&#xD;
      started receiving regular blood transfusions but whose iron load is not yet at the level&#xD;
      where chelation treatment would normally begin. The purpose is to see if doing this will&#xD;
      postpone the build-up of iron without causing serious side effects. Half the children in the&#xD;
      study will be given deferiprone at a dose that is lower than what is normally prescribed, and&#xD;
      the other half will be given placebo. All patients will receive the assigned product three&#xD;
      times a day for up to 12 months. Tests for signs of iron overload will be done monthly, and a&#xD;
      patient whose iron load reaches the level where chelation therapy would normally begin will&#xD;
      be immediately taken out of the study and started on standard chelation therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female aged ≥ 6 months to &lt; 10 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Confirmed diagnosis of beta-thalassemia, as determined by high performance liquid&#xD;
             chromatography (HPLC) or DNA testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Started on a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Screening level of serum ferritin greater than &gt;200 μg/L but not more than 600 μg/L.&#xD;
             Since SF level may be impacted by the presence of infection, it must additionally be&#xD;
             verified that the child has had no signs of infection in the previous 7 days,&#xD;
             including the day of screening, and that the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) is no&#xD;
             greater than 20% higher than the normal range for the patient's age. If there are&#xD;
             signs of infection and/or the CRP level is above this threshold, the SF level must be&#xD;
             checked again a minimum of one week later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior use of iron chelation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of hepatitis B or C, or HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of abnormal liver or kidney function at screening: serum alanine transaminase&#xD;
             (ALT) level &gt; 5 times upper limit of normal or creatinine levels &gt;2 times upper limit&#xD;
             of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Disorders associated with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x 10^9/L) prior&#xD;
             to the initiation of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A serious, unstable illness, as judged by the investigator, during the previous 3&#xD;
             months before screening/baseline visit including but not limited to hepatic, renal,&#xD;
             gastro-enterologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinologic, neurologic or&#xD;
             immunologic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of any medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator would cause&#xD;
             participation in the study to be unwise.&#xD;
