  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is one of the leading causes of maternal deaths. Its prognosis is&#xD;
      directly influenced by the early diagnosis and treatment of the associated coagulopathy. In&#xD;
      this context, fibrinogen concentration is the best predictor of a severe PPH. The medical&#xD;
      interest of thromboelastography/elastometry to early detect and guide the rapid correction of&#xD;
      coagulopathy in PPH is regularly discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of a new hemostasis point of&#xD;
      care device (thromboelastography - TEG ®6S) for the diagnosis of coagulopathy during PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim will be to determine the normal values of TEG6S at the end of a normal&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a complication of 5 to 10% of deliveries and is the leading&#xD;
      cause of maternal mortality, all over the world. In France, as in other developed countries,&#xD;
      20% of maternal mortality is related to PPH complications with a high rate of avoidance (85%)&#xD;
      due to inappropriate or delayed therapeutic measures). The management of PPH is based on&#xD;
      recommendations highlighting the need for early detection and treatment of coagulopathy,&#xD;
      which is predictive of the hemorrhage severity. The prognosis of the PPH is directly related&#xD;
      to the rapidity of the coagulopathy treatment (30 to 60 minutes after diagnosis). Severe PPH&#xD;
      is often associated with clotting disorders of either primary origin (disseminated&#xD;
      intravascular coagulation) or secondary origin (coagulation factors loss due to hemorrhage).&#xD;
      A hypofibrinogenemia &lt; 2 g/L is the best predictor of a severe PPH with a positive predictive&#xD;
      value of 100% . Similarly, abnormal coagulation tests appear to be predictive of the severity&#xD;
      of the bleeding and the subsequent need for invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of coagulation is currently based on standard laboratory hemostasis tests, but&#xD;
      with delayed time to obtain results, generally greater than 60 minutes. Therefore, early and&#xD;
      fast assessment of hemostasis during PPH is essential to estimate the bleeding severity and&#xD;
      allow early and adequate administration of pro-coagulant products, leading to an improved&#xD;
      prognosis of PPH. The medical interest of thromboelastography (TEG) to early diagnose and&#xD;
      guide the treatment of a coagulopathy in PPH is regularly discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous observational study performed by our team in 2013 during PPH (95 patients and133&#xD;
      samples) compared the TEG 5000 parameters with the standard laboratory hemostasis tests. Our&#xD;
      results confirm the good predictability of TEG 5000 for the early detection of a&#xD;
      hypofibrinogenemia ≤ 2 g / l and/or thrombocytopenia ≤ 80 000 platelets / mm3 (AUC between&#xD;
      0.91 and 0.97). Among the biological parameters analyzed by the TEG 5000, the parameters&#xD;
      K-MRTGG and FF-MRTGG (maximum rate of thrombus generation) were also evaluated. Their&#xD;
      predictabilities were as good as the usual K-MA or FF-MA (comparable AUC) and were available&#xD;
      more rapidly than usual parameters (3 ± 3 min for FF-MRTGG and 8 ± 3 min for K-MRTGG),&#xD;
      allowing a very early evaluation of hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective observational study is therefore to evaluate the performance of a&#xD;
      new delocalized hemostasis monitoring device (thromboelastography - TEG ®6S) for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of coagulopathy during PPH.&#xD;
