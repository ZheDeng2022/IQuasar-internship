  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the NEO-PV-01 vaccine, either with&#xD;
      APX005M or ipilimumab, and nivolumab is safe for the treatment of patients with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma. The study will also investigate an alternative schedule for the&#xD;
      administration of the NEO-PV-01 vaccine. Study interventions will be assessed by both&#xD;
      clinical and immune responses to treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma not having&#xD;
      received treatment for metastatic disease. The 5 agents being used in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A new, investigational, personal cancer vaccine called &quot;NEO-PV-01&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), an investigational adjuvant that is used to help stimulate the&#xD;
           immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cancer drug called APX005M, a drug that stimulates specific types of immune cells that&#xD;
           help the immune system to recognize specific targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cancer drug called ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cancer drug called nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEO-PV-01, APX005M, ipilimumab, and nivolumab are considered immunotherapies and work using&#xD;
      the immune system to fight cancer. NEO-PV-01 is a personal vaccine therapy in that it is&#xD;
      manufactured specifically to include targets for the immune system that are present uniquely&#xD;
      on your cancer. Poly-ICLC is an adjuvant that helps stimulate the immune system and make the&#xD;
      vaccine, NEO-PV-01, more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with NEO-PV-01 + Poly-ICLC (the&#xD;
      NEO-PV-01 vaccine) in combination with either APX005M or ipilimumab, and nivolumab is safe&#xD;
      and useful for patients with melanoma. The study also will assess if the NEO-PV-01 vaccine,&#xD;
      when given at different intervals, can improve your response compared with the standard&#xD;
      schedule. This study will also assess the effects of poly-ICLC in combination with nivolumab.&#xD;
      The side effects of all study drugs will be monitored and additional research tests will be&#xD;
      done to assess your immune response to your cancer. There is no guarantee that you will&#xD;
      benefit from therapy with the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not yet approved the NEO-PV-01 vaccine for use alone or in combination with other&#xD;
      cancer drugs such as APX005M, ipilimumab, and nivolumab. Neither APX005M nor Poly-ICLC are&#xD;
      approved for use in your type of cancer. Ipilimumab and nivolumab are both approved for use&#xD;
      in your type of cancer.&#xD;
