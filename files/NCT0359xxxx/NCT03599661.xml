  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this project is to adapt and validate an eHealth fertility preservation&#xD;
      decision-making support tool (Fertilit-e) for young adults with cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal is to utilize innovations in eHealth technology to address fertility&#xD;
      preservation knowledge deficits and decision-making options for young adults with cancer ages&#xD;
      18-39 years of age. Every year, approximately 70,000 young adults (ages 18-39) are diagnosed&#xD;
      with cancer, which can significantly affect their health-related quality of life in multiple&#xD;
      areas, including the potential for infertility or other reproductive challenges. Despite&#xD;
      this, very few young adults diagnosed with cancer are actually provided fertility&#xD;
      preservation information let alone effective strategies or tools for how to best navigate&#xD;
      their fertility preservation options. It is critical to provide decision-making information&#xD;
      and support about infertility risk and existing interventions to maintain reproductive&#xD;
      potential in a delivery mode that is most congruent with this population's health&#xD;
      communication style, such as eHealth applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to adapt and optimize fertility preservation content in a tailored mHealth tool&#xD;
      for fertility preservation decision-making. More specifically, the team will adapt&#xD;
      fertility-preservation content for tailored, rapid, and clear dissemination of information in&#xD;
      an engaging, cross-platform, patient-friendly mHealth format. The study team will alpha-test&#xD;
      this tool with an ethnically diverse sample of cross-cultural end users to collect&#xD;
      qualitative data and evaluate usability and comprehensibility to refine content and design.&#xD;
      No formal hypothesis testing will be done.&#xD;
