  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational research study will evaluate medical gender affirmation delivered in&#xD;
      primary care as an intervention to reduce disparities in HIV-related outcomes (e.g., low&#xD;
      rates of PrEP uptake for HIV-uninfected patients, high rates of viral suppression for&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients) for transgender patients in two urban federally-qualified community&#xD;
      health centers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This observational, longitudinal prospective cohort study will evaluate whether medical&#xD;
      gender affirmation delivered in primary care improves HIV-related outcomes for transgender&#xD;
      patients. Medical gender affirmation therapies-hormones and surgical interventions-are&#xD;
      medically necessary treatments shown to improve psychological functioning and quality of life&#xD;
      for transgender patients. It is not yet known whether these treatments improve HIV-related&#xD;
      outcomes over time because studies providing the best evidence of medical gender&#xD;
      affirmation's clinical effectiveness do not examine HIV-related outcomes in transgender adult&#xD;
      patients. To fill this gap, the proposed study will prospectively evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      medical gender affirmation delivered in primary care on HIV-related outcomes in a multi-site&#xD;
      clinic-based cohort of 4,500 diverse transgender patients from two urban U.S. health centers&#xD;
      who are leaders in transgender healthcare. Transgender adult primary care patients at Fenway&#xD;
      Health in Boston, MA and Callen-Lorde Community Health Center in New York City, NY will be&#xD;
      enrolled over 12 months and followed prospectively for 12 months. Bio-behavioral data will be&#xD;
      linked, including electronic patient-reported outcomes (baseline, 6-month, 12-month&#xD;
      assessments), and electronic health record (EHR) data.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>De-identified IPD may be available to outside individuals by contacting the principal investigator (PI). The first will be after all of the baseline data is collected. The investigators will institute a concept plan process where internal study staff first have the availability to write primary papers or give presentations on particular topics. After this, if outside individuals wish to analyze data, the investigators may welcome this collaboration. A similar process will happen for outcome data; however this will not be possible until the publication and release of the outcome paper(s). Information regarding the availability of data for analysis will be listed on the PI's web page. Contact information for the PI will be listed in all manuscripts and publications as another means to access data.</ipd_description>
