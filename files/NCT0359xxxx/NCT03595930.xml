  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, PMS study to observe the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      ARNUITY administered in asthma subjects in a real world setting. This PMS shall observe how a&#xD;
      broad range of subjects use the drug in the early stages after obtaining the approval. The&#xD;
      objective of this PMS is to collect safety and effectiveness data on ARNUITY's approved label&#xD;
      in a real world setting. Total of 600 subjects shall be recruited throughout the PMS period;&#xD;
      01 Sep, 2018 to 30 June 2020. ARNUITY is the registered trademark of GSK group of companies.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence rate of adverse events (AEs) after ARNUITY administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 22months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any undesirable, unintended signs (e.g., abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms, or disease that may occur after administration or during use of the product, and does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the product.</description>

    <measure>Incidence rates of unexpected AEs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 22 months</time_frame>
    <description>An ADR is defined as an adverse event whose causal relationship with the product cannot be ruled out.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence rates of serious AEs (SAEs) and serious ADRs (SADRs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 22 months</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE refers to any one of the following adverse events, which: results in death or is life-threatening; results in or prolongs hospitalization; results in persistent or serious disability or incapacity; results in a birth defect or anomaly; or is an important medical event. SADR is defined a SAE whose causal relationship with the product cannot be ruled out.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects with abnormal findings as assessed by physician's effectiveness assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>For the subjective assessment of effectiveness, the physicians shall assess physician's effectiveness assessment at Week 24 after administration of Arnuity, based on the pulmonary function test and/or asthma symptom control.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) before and after ARNUITY administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The physicians shall collect FEV1 data at Week 0 and Week 24 after Arnuity administration. The change in the FEV1 results before and after administration of the product shall be analyzed using a paired t-test.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the asthma symptom control results before and after ARNUITY administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The physician shall collect the asthma symptom control results at Week 0 and Week 24 after Arnuity administration, based on the symptoms the subjects experienced for the past 4 weeks. The results of the asthma symptom control shall be categorized into 'Controlled', 'Partly Controlled', and 'Uncontrolled'.</description>
