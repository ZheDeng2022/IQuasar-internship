    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score is a physician administered scale measuring the amount of scalp without any terminal hair assessed by the investigator. Possible scores range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete scalp hair loss). A negative change in the SALT score over time represents hair regrowth by adding the percentage hair loss in the various areas (i.e. top, back, each side) of the scalp. The primary efficacy variable was the percent change from baseline in SALT score at Week 24. This was calculated as the mean of the changes from Baseline (Visit 2) SALT score to Week 24 (Visit 10) SALT score, divided by Baseline SALT score and expressed as a percentage.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in the Alopecia Density and Extent Score (ALODEX) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Alopecia Density and Extent (ALODEX) score is a measurement of the amount of scalp with terminal hair loss assessed by the investigator at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, and Week 24. ALODEX breaks the scalp up into a grid of 1% scalp surface areas and assigns density rating in each area on a 10 point scale of hair loss (0= no hair loss to 10 = complete baldness). Summation of scores from each 1% scalp surface area provides an overall score which may range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete baldness). A negative change in the ALODEX score over time represents hair regrowth.</description>

The assessment has a recall period of &quot;right now&quot; and includes a five-point VRS ranging from &quot;Full hair, whole scalp completely covered with hair&quot; to &quot;no hair, whole scalp completely exposed.&quot; The instrument produces a score of 1 to 5, with lower scores indicating more hair covering the patient's target patch. Change status is categorized as 'Better by x points' when the score decreases from baseline by x points, and as 'Worse by x points' when the score increases by x points.</description>

          <title>Diagnosis Type</title>
          <description>AAP diagnoses were reported in the placebo group under patient Alopecia History, but only 8 of those patients had target patches identified. This discrepancy occurred due to an investigator mistakenly not collecting target patch information for a patient who was reported with a diagnosis of Alopecia Areata Patchy.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score is a physician administered scale measuring the amount of scalp without any terminal hair assessed by the investigator. Possible scores range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete scalp hair loss). A negative change in the SALT score over time represents hair regrowth by adding the percentage hair loss in the various areas (i.e. top, back, each side) of the scalp. The primary efficacy variable was the percent change from baseline in SALT score at Week 24. This was calculated as the mean of the changes from Baseline (Visit 2) SALT score to Week 24 (Visit 10) SALT score, divided by Baseline SALT score and expressed as a percentage.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline-Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>This primary analysis utilized the SALT score with imputation for last observation carried forward (LOCF) and was based on the intent-to-treat population.</population>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Alopecia Density and Extent Score (ALODEX) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Alopecia Density and Extent (ALODEX) score is a measurement of the amount of scalp with terminal hair loss assessed by the investigator at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, and Week 24. ALODEX breaks the scalp up into a grid of 1% scalp surface areas and assigns density rating in each area on a 10 point scale of hair loss (0= no hair loss to 10 = complete baldness). Summation of scores from each 1% scalp surface area provides an overall score which may range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete baldness). A negative change in the ALODEX score over time represents hair regrowth.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Alopecia Density and Extent Score (ALODEX) at Week 24</title>
          <description>The Alopecia Density and Extent (ALODEX) score is a measurement of the amount of scalp with terminal hair loss assessed by the investigator at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, and Week 24. ALODEX breaks the scalp up into a grid of 1% scalp surface areas and assigns density rating in each area on a 10 point scale of hair loss (0= no hair loss to 10 = complete baldness). Summation of scores from each 1% scalp surface area provides an overall score which may range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete baldness). A negative change in the ALODEX score over time represents hair regrowth.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score is a physician administered scale measuring the amount of scalp without any terminal hair assessed by the investigator. Possible scores range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete scalp hair loss). A negative change in the SALT score over time represents hair regrowth by adding the percentage hair loss in the various areas (i.e. top, back, each side) of the scalp.</description>

        <title>Count of Subjects Achieving at Least a 50% Reduction in Alopecia Density and Extent (ALODEX) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Alopecia Density and Extent (ALODEX) score is a measurement of the amount of scalp with terminal hair loss assessed by the investigator. ALODEX breaks the scalp up into a grid of 1% scalp surface areas and assigns density rating in each area on a 10 point scale of hair loss (0= no hair loss to 10 = complete baldness). Summation of scores from each 1% scalp surface area provides an overall score which may range from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete baldness). A negative change in the ALODEX score over time represents hair regrowth.</description>

        <description>The Alopecia Facial Hair Appearance Assessment (AFHA)-Clinician Reported Outcome is the investigator's assessment of the subject's facial hair (eyebrow(s), eyelashes,and if male, beard) at a particular point in time. The investigator was instructed to NOT refer to any other assessments to assist with these assessments. The investigator or designee assessed the affected facial hair areas (eyebrows, eyelashes and if male, beard) using a 5 point scale for each target area [1-Full (Target Area Hair); 2-Most (Target Area Hair); 3-Some (Target Area Hair); 4-A Little (Target Area Hair); 5-No (Target Area Hair)]. Change status is categorized as 'Better by x points' when the score decreases from baseline by x points, and as 'Worse by x points' when the score increases by x points.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Alopecia Facial Hair Appearance Assessment (AFHA)-Clinician Reported Outcome, Beard, Male Subjects</title>
          <description>The Alopecia Facial Hair Appearance Assessment (AFHA)-Clinician Reported Outcome is the investigator's assessment of the subject's facial hair (eyebrow(s), eyelashes,and if male, beard) at a particular point in time. The investigator was instructed to NOT refer to any other assessments to assist with these assessments. The investigator or designee assessed the affected facial hair areas (eyebrows, eyelashes and if male, beard) using a 5 point scale for each target area [1-Full (Target Area Hair); 2-Most (Target Area Hair); 3-Some (Target Area Hair); 4-A Little (Target Area Hair); 5-No (Target Area Hair)]. Change status is categorized as 'Better by x points' when the score decreases from baseline by x points, and as 'Worse by x points' when the score increases by x points.</description>

        <description>The Alopecia Facial Hair Appearance Assessment (AFHA)-Patient Reported Outcome is the patient's assessment of their facial hair (eyebrow(s), eyelashes, and if male, beard) at a particular point in time. The patient assessed the affected facial hair areas (eyebrows, eyelashes and if male, beard) using a 5 point scale for each target area [1-Full (Target Area Hair); 2-Most (Target Area Hair); 3-Some (Target Area Hair); 4-A Little (Target Area Hair); 5-No (Target Area Hair)]. Change status is categorized as 'Better by x points' when the score decreases from baseline by x points, and as 'Worse by x points' when the score increases by x points.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alopecia Facial Hair Appearance Assessment (AFHA)-Patient Reported Outcome, Left Eyelash</title>
        <description>The Alopecia Facial Hair Appearance Assessment (AFHA)-Patient Reported Outcome is the patient's assessment of their facial hair (eyebrow(s), eyelashes, and if male, beard) at a particular point in time. The patient assessed the affected facial hair areas (eyebrows, eyelashes and if male, beard) using a 5 point scale for each target area [1-Full (Target Area Hair); 2-Most (Target Area Hair); 3-Some (Target Area Hair); 4-A Little (Target Area Hair); 5-No (Target Area Hair)]. Change status is categorized as 'Better by x points' when the score decreases from baseline by x points, and as 'Worse by x points' when the score increases by x points.</description>

        <description>The Subject Global Impression of Severity (SGIS) is a 5-point descriptive scale completed by subjects to capture the subject's assessment of disease severity at a particular timepoint. Scores of 1 to 5 are assigned to responses Mild to Extremely Severe, respectively. Change status is categorized as 'Better by x points' when the score decreases from baseline by x points, and as 'Worse by x points' when the score increases by x points.</description>

        <description>The Physician Global Impression of Severity (PhGIS) is a 5-point descriptive scale completed by investigators and is used to capture the investigator's assessment of the subject's disease severity at a particular timepoint. Scores of 1 to 5 are assigned to responses Mild to Extremely Severe, respectively. Change status is categorized as 'Better by x points' when the score decreases from baseline by x points, and as 'Worse by x points' when the score increases by x points.</description>

        <title>Alopecia Impact Assessment (AIA) Patient Reported Outcome Change From Baseline at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Alopecia Impact Assessment (AIA) is a 13-item patient reported outcome questionnaire which measures the subject's experience with impacts related to alopecia (inclusive of all 3 subtypes observed on study) in managing appearance, worry, sadness, loss of confidence, self-consciousness, embarrassment, feeling unattractive, limitation of social activities, limitation of physical activities, unwanted attention, sweat in eyes, debris in eyes, and debris in nose. The AIA has a recall period of &quot;over the past seven days&quot;. An 11-point NRS with anchors &quot;0 - Not at all [impact]&quot; and &quot;10 - Extremely [impact]&quot; (e.g., &quot;Not at all bothersome&quot; and &quot;Extremely bothersome&quot;; &quot;Not at all worried&quot; and &quot;Extremely worried&quot;) is utilized. The AIA produces single-item (0-10) and mean total (0-10) scores, with higher scores indicating higher levels of impact.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Subject Global Satisfaction With Hair Quality (SGSHQ) for Entire Scalp at Week 24, Patchy Alopecia Areata</title>
        <description>The investigator or study staff instructed the subject to answer the Subject Global Satisfaction with Hair Quality (SGSHQ) questionnaire in relation to their satisfaction with the quality of scalp hair at the time of questionnaire completion (ie &quot;right now&quot;). Subjects assessed their satisfaction with the quality of their scalp hair on a 7-point satisfaction scale from extremely satisfied to extremely dissatisfied at the visits. Change status is categorized as 'Better by x points' when the score decreases from baseline by x points, and as 'Worse by x points' when the score increases by x points.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Subject Global Satisfaction With Hair Quality (SGSHQ) for Entire Scalp at Week 24, Alopecia Universalis or Alopecia Totalis</title>
        <description>The investigator or study staff instructed the subject to answer the Subject Global Satisfaction with Hair Quality (SGSHQ) questionnaire in relation to their satisfaction with the quality of scalp hair at the time of questionnaire completion (ie &quot;right now&quot;). Subjects assessed their satisfaction with the quality of their scalp hair on a 7-point satisfaction scale from extremely satisfied to extremely dissatisfied at the visits. Change status is categorized as 'Better by x points' when the score decreases from baseline by x points, and as 'Worse by x points' when the score increases by x points.</description>

        <description>The Subject Global Impression of Change (SGIC) is a 7-point descriptive scale completed by subjects at Week 24 (Intent-to-treat population with reported data falling within the windowed Week 24 visit timeframe). Scale response options ranged from &quot;1. Very much improved&quot; to &quot;7. Very much worse&quot; and are used to capture the subject's overall impression of change for his/her alopecia during the treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alopecia Scalp Appearance Assessment (ASAA): Scalp-Clinician Reported Outcome for Target Patch, Patchy Alopecia Areata</title>
        <description>The Scalp Clinician Reported Outcome for Target Patch provides the investigator's assessment for Patchy Alopecia Areata (AAP) patients regarding the appearance of the patient's target patch (identified by the patient as his or her most bothersome area of scalp hair loss at Baseline). The assessment was completed by investigators at Baseline, Week 2, Week 12, and Week 24. The assessment has a recall period of &quot;right now&quot; and includes a five-point VRS ranging from &quot;Full hair, scalp of the target patch completely covered with hair&quot; to &quot;no hair, scalp of the target patch completely exposed.&quot; The instrument produces a score of 1 to 5, with lower scores indicating more hair covering the patient's target patch. Change status is categorized as 'Better by x points' when the score decreases from baseline by x points, and as 'Worse by x points' when the score increases by x points.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alopecia Scalp Appearance Assessment (ASAA): Scalp-Patient Reported Outcome for Target Patch, Patchy Alopecia Areata</title>
        <description>The Scalp Patient Reported Outcome for Target Patch was completed by patients with Patchy Alopecia Areata (AAP) and assesses the appearance of the subject's target patch (identified by the subject as his or her most bothersome area of scalp hair loss at Baseline). The assessment was completed by AAP subjects at Baseline, Week 2, Week 12, and Week 24. The assessment has a recall period of &quot;right now&quot; and includes a five-point VRS ranging from &quot;Full hair, scalp of the target patch completely covered with hair&quot; to &quot;no hair, scalp of the target patch completely exposed.&quot; The instrument produces a score of 1 to 5, with lower scores indicating more hair covering the subject's target patch. Change status is categorized as 'Better by x points' when the score decreases from baseline by x points, and as 'Worse by x points' when the score increases by x points.</description>
