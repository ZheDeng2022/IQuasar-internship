      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-significant risk study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      Cala TWO device. Subjects will be screened for eligibility and fitted with a Cala TWO device.&#xD;
      Subjects will wear the device at home for a period of 3 months, during which they will be&#xD;
      asked to stimulate their dominant hand twice a day. The stimulation amplitude will be based&#xD;
      on each subject's stimulation threshold. Subjects will have in clinic assessments at&#xD;
      enrollment, month 1 and 3.&#xD;

    <measure>TRG (Tremor Research Group) Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) subset score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-months</time_frame>
    <description>TETRAS subset score relevant to the stimulated upper limb. The subset score is the sum of 6 rated tasks. Each task is rated 0 to 4, where a higher score indicates more severe tremor. Minimum subset score = 0; Maximum subset score = 24.</description>

    <measure>Bain &amp; Findley Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale subset score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-months</time_frame>
    <description>Bain &amp; Findley ADL subset score relevant to the stimulated upper limb. The subset score is the sum of 8 rated tasks. Each task is rated 1 to 4, where a higher score indicates more severe tremor. Minimum subset score = 8; Maximum subset score = 32.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinematic measurements, as collected with the device during postural holds, change from pre-stimulation to post-stimulation across sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-stimulation and post-stimulation across sessions during 3-month study participation</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be prompted to perform a postural hold task before and after each stimulation session. During this task, the device will record kinematic data using on-board motion sensors to objectively assess if there are any changes in tremor level.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Competent and willing to provide written, informed consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of essential tremor as confirmed from clinical history and examination by&#xD;
             a movement disorder neurologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A tremor severity score of 2 or above in the dominant hand/arm as measured by any one&#xD;
             of the TETRAS upper limb items and a minimum subset score of 6 across all upper limb&#xD;
             items&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant disability due to essential tremor (Bain &amp; Findley score of 3 or above in&#xD;
             any one of the upper limb items and a minimum subset score of 8 across all upper limb&#xD;
             items)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable dose of tremor medications, if applicable, for 30 days prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable dose of antidepressant medications, if applicable, for 90 days prior to study&#xD;
             entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to comply with study protocol requirements including:&#xD;
