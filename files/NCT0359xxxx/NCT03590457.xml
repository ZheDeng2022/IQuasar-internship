      Background: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a non-invasive heated and humidified oxygen&#xD;
      delivery device that is capable of delivering high-flow rates. It is a relatively new&#xD;
      modality that has been introduced as an alternative to conventional oxygen therapy. The&#xD;
      clinical value of the use of HFNC is not limited to its ventilation and oxygenation effects,&#xD;
      it enables the patient to talk and is purported to permit oral feeding during oxygen therapy&#xD;
      despite the limited evidence regarding its impact on swallow function. This study will&#xD;
      determine the impact of different flow rates of a high-flow nasal cannula on spontaneous&#xD;
      swallowing frequency at rest and swallowing effort and timing while swallowing. Methods: This&#xD;
      is a prospective study designed to measure swallowing frequency and swallowing effort in&#xD;
      fifty healthy adult volunteers. Participants will receive three levels of HFNC flow rates&#xD;
      (30, 45, and 60 L/min) through nasal prongs. The study participants will be asked to swallow&#xD;
      measured amounts of water and applesauce and subjected to each flow rate for 15 minutes.&#xD;
      Swallowing effort measurement through surface electromyography (sEMG) will be recorded at&#xD;
      baseline and the three levels of HFNC flow rates interventions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a non-invasive heated and humidified oxygen delivery device&#xD;
      that is capable of delivering up to 60 L/min of flow. It is a relatively new modality that&#xD;
      has been introduced as an alternative to conventional oxygen therapy in patients with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) respiratory failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)6,&#xD;
      post-extubation, and status asthmaticus The humidified gas preserves mucociliary function&#xD;
      that prevents secretion retention and enhances patient's comfort. This feature allows&#xD;
      prolonged use of HFNC in clinical sittings of up to 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its ability to provide adequate humidification levels, HFNC has various&#xD;
      respiratory physiological effects. These physiological effects include: alveolar recruitment,&#xD;
      dead space washout, and decreased airway resistance. The clinical value of the use of HFNC is&#xD;
      not limited to its ventilation and oxygenation effects, it enables the patient to talk and is&#xD;
      purported to permit oral feeding during oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, despite the fact that patients are often permitted to eat while receiving HFNC&#xD;
      therapy, there is insufficient evidence regarding the impact of HFNC on swallow function. The&#xD;
      uncertainty of the effect of this oxygen delivery device on swallow function arises not only&#xD;
      from the limited number of studies, but also the contradictory results. For example, Sanuki&#xD;
      et al. reported that increasing the flow rates of the HFNC resulted in enhanced swallow&#xD;
      function by reducing reflex latency. Based on their findings, the researchers suggested that&#xD;
      the use of HFNC should not affect the decision to start or resume feeding. Similarly, Lader&#xD;
      et al. proposed that the use of high-flow nasal cannula should not delay oral alimentation.&#xD;
      On the contrary, Ferrara et al. conducted a study in neonates and concluded that providing&#xD;
      feeding while using Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP) increased the risk of&#xD;
      aspiration. These opposing outcomes support the need for further studies to obtain more&#xD;
      definitive evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous Swallowing Frequency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous swallowing is an airway protection reflex and the measurement of its frequency is&#xD;
      considered to be a sensitive indicator of swallow function. This index can sensitively&#xD;
      identify dysphagia and other swallowing-related disorders. Furthermore, the reduction in this&#xD;
      index is associated with increased level of secretions and chest infections. One modality&#xD;
      used to measure swallowing frequency is surface electromyography (sEMG), which records&#xD;
      electric activity during swallow via an electrode placed on the skin under the chin. This&#xD;
      non-invasive technology has been used for more than 20 years to record various aspects of&#xD;
      swallowing physiology. In this study, sEMG will be used because of its feasibility, accuracy,&#xD;
      and ability to detect a swallow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowing Effort and Timing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowing effort via submental sEMG provides an objective measurement of lingual and&#xD;
      sub-mental muscle activity during the act of swallowing. Measurements include muscle&#xD;
      contraction amplitude and contraction timing/speed. Clinically, swallowing effort parameters&#xD;
      have been used to document normative values in healthy individuals, as well as to document&#xD;
      the effects of a disease on swallowing. Prior research has shown that both amplitude and&#xD;
      timing are influenced by multiple factors including the volume and viscosity of the item (or&#xD;
      bolus) being swallowed, and the age and gender of the person swallowing. However no study has&#xD;
      investigated the effects of HFNC on either swallowing effort parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this research is to determine the impact of different flow rates of a&#xD;
      high-flow nasal cannula on spontaneous swallowing frequency at rest and swallowing effort and&#xD;
      timing while swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study designed to measure swallowing frequency and swallowing effort in&#xD;
      fifty healthy adult volunteers (25 participants will be between 21 and 49 years old; and the&#xD;
      other 25 above 50 years old). To recruit volunteer participants, an email will be sent via&#xD;
      university internal email system to the faculty, students and employees in the departments of&#xD;
      Respiratory Care and Speech Language Pathology. Snowball sampling (non-probability sampling)&#xD;
      will also be utilized to recruit individuals outside of those departments. No compensation is&#xD;
      offered to the participants. Enrolled participants are sub-categorized into two different age&#xD;
      groups to determine if there are any swallowing differences between the different age groups.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria include individuals who are older than 21 years of age and have no&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. Exclusion criteria include individuals who are less than 21 years of&#xD;
      age, have a history of dysphagia or disease/condition that may cause dysphagia, current use&#xD;
      of medications that alter swallowing function, nasal obstruction, and the presence of a&#xD;
      tracheostomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon meeting inclusion criteria, informed consent explaining the procedure and potential harm&#xD;
      will be obtained and a copy will be given to the subject. Then, a unique identification code&#xD;
      number will be assigned to protect the subject's identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFNC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AIRVO 2 high-flow nasal cannula system (Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Limited, Panmure,&#xD;
      Auckland, New Zealand) will be used. Nasal prongs sizes are chosen as per manufacturer&#xD;
      recommendations. Participants will receive three levels of HFNC flow rates (30, 45, and 60&#xD;
      L/min) through nasal prongs. If a small-size nasal prong is used, the participant will&#xD;
      receive 30, 45, and 50 L/min flow rates instead of 30, 45, and 60 L/min, as manufacturer&#xD;
      recommendations state the maximum liter flow for a small-size nasal prong is 50 L/min. Oxygen&#xD;
      concentration will be set at 21% and a temperature of 37 °C. First, individuals will be&#xD;
      placed on the sEMG monitor. Following the application of the sEMG, each participant will sit&#xD;
      quietly for 10 minutes, before being attached to the HFNC, so a baseline swallow frequency&#xD;
      can be established. After the baseline swallow frequency is established, each participant&#xD;
      will be asked to swallow 8 boluses: 2 trials of water at 2 volumes (5 and 10 mL) and 2 trials&#xD;
      of applesauce at 2 volumes (5 and 10 mL). Participants will rest for 15 seconds after&#xD;
      completing each swallow. This procedure will establish the participant's baseline swallowing&#xD;
      effort measurements. Once these swallows have been completed, the participant will be placed&#xD;
      on the HFNC. Each participant will be placed on three different flow rates (30, 45, and 60&#xD;
      L/min or 30, 45, and 50 L/min) in random order. The random order will be generated by an&#xD;
      online random number tool (https://www.randomizer.org). The study participant will be&#xD;
      subjected to each flow rate for 15 minutes. During the first 10 minutes, swallow frequency&#xD;
      will be recorded. After 10 minutes at the given flow, the participant will complete the 8&#xD;
      aforementioned swallows. After completing all of the swallowing trials, the participant will&#xD;
      be removed from the HFNC for a period of 10 minutes. This process will be repeated for all&#xD;
      three flowrates for a total of 32 boluses swallowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowing Frequency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowing frequency is analyzed by sEMG signals recorded on the KayPentax Digital Swallow&#xD;
      Workstation™ with integrated digital swallowing signals lab (DSW™, Model 7120, New Jersey). A&#xD;
      three-sensor sEMG electrode (Uni-Patch™, Disk #7500, Covidien Corporation, Tyco Healthcare,&#xD;
      Wabasha, MN) will be placed on the anterior neck skin under the chin, over the submental&#xD;
      muscles above the hyoid bone. Each patch will include two recording electrodes and a third&#xD;
      ground electrode. Spontaneous swallowing frequency is calculated as the number of swallows&#xD;
      per minute (SPM) for 10 minutes on room air and then for each HFNC intervention. Swallows&#xD;
      will be counted from the visual myographic waveform produced by the DSW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowing Effort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both swallowing amplitude and timing parameters will be obtained by analyzing the individual&#xD;
      graphic waveforms produced by the DSW algorithm. Measures will be obtained for each of the 8&#xD;
      swallows, at each of the HFNC flow rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Done for Research Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of HFNC with three levels of flow (30, 45, and 60 L/min or 30, 45, and 50 L/min [for&#xD;
      small-size nasal prongs]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallow frequency measurement through sEMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowing effort measurement through sEMG - participants will swallow measured amounts of&#xD;
      water and applesauce. Presentation of the different volumes and viscosities will be done in&#xD;
      pre-determined random order.&#xD;
