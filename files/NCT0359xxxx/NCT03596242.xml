  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine the potential of utilizing Short Message Service (SMS)&#xD;
      messaging to improve health outcomes for patients with uncontrolled hypertension receiving&#xD;
      care from the Outpatient Internal Medicine Clinic at Wake Forest Baptist Hospital.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot will evaluate the feasibility of implementing a Short Message Service (SMS) system&#xD;
      and Home Blood Pressure Measurements (HBPM) in the Outpatient Internal Medicine (OPD) clinic&#xD;
      at Wake Forest Baptist Hospital. Implementing a new short text messaging service will improve&#xD;
      the health delivery system in three ways. 1) Increasing patient engagement: SMS and HBPM&#xD;
      require an active commitment by the patients themselves in their medical care and results in&#xD;
      a marked improvement in the adherence to medication. High adherence to home blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP) measurements has also been reported to improve BP control. 2) Supporting patients&#xD;
      outside of the office visits by identifying and resolving barriers to medication adherence&#xD;
      earlier on (i.e. if patients are unable to get their prescriptions or are having significant&#xD;
      side effects). 3) Adopting clinical guidelines to improve BP control in a vulnerable&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
