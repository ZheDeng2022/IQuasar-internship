  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study of participants who have stable coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (CHD). Participants undergo risk stratification using the SomaLogic Cardiovascular Disease&#xD;
      (CVD) Risk Panel blood test at baseline and again 4-12 months after the initial test.&#xD;
      Participant surveys and chart abstractions are conducted at baseline and follow-up to collect&#xD;
      feedback about the test report and actions taken. Care teams may consider using the risk&#xD;
      information from the SomaLogic panel to address care gaps. Medical treatment decisions and&#xD;
      recommendations are confirmed by established clinical methods, including blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring, body mass index (BMI), lipid and c-reactive protein (CRP) measurements, and&#xD;
      physician's clinical judgment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study of participants who have stable coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (CHD). Objectives of this study are to understand whether CVD Secondary Risk Panel scores&#xD;
      change from baseline to follow-up (4-12 months after baseline) and actions taken, if any,&#xD;
      based upon the results. Participants are surveyed to learn what the test results mean to them&#xD;
      and assess if the results affect adherence to therapy and lifestyle choices (diet, exercise,&#xD;
      alcohol, and tobacco use). In addition, this study will investigate the characteristics of&#xD;
      patients that physicians choose to test with the CVD Secondary Risk Panel, and what actions&#xD;
      the care team takes because of the results of the test. Medical treatment decisions and&#xD;
      recommendations are confirmed by established clinical methods, including blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring, BMI, lipid and CRP measurements, and physician's clinical judgement. Chart&#xD;
      abstractions and participants surveys occur at the baseline and follow-up visits, and charts&#xD;
      may be abstracted annually for up to 10 years post enrollment.&#xD;
