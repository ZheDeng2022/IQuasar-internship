    <textblock>
      This is a short-term longitudinal study of psychotherapy process. Participants will be&#xD;
      treated with 8 sessions of psychotherapy over the course of 8 to 12 weeks.&#xD;

      In response to Covid, completed the study in two phases. Phase 1 procedures were conducted&#xD;
      entirely in-person and Phase 2 procedures were conducted via telehealth. Phase 1 recruitment&#xD;
      began July 2018 and concluded in February 2020. Recruitment for Phase 2 began July 2020 and&#xD;
      concluded March 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 recruitment: We received 638 referrals through a centralized registry system (Pitt +&#xD;
      Me) and assessed 191 for protocol eligibility. We were unable to reach 447 of those referred.&#xD;
      Sixty percent of those reached for preliminary screening failed to meet inclusion criteria&#xD;
      (n=63), lacked interest in the study once all details were explained (n=37), or were lost to&#xD;
      follow-up (n=15). Seventy-six individuals gave informed consent documents and completed a&#xD;
      baseline assessment for eligibility; 64% (49/76) were randomized to one of the two&#xD;
      psychotherapy conditions: Brief Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT; n=24) or Brief Interpersonal&#xD;
      Psychotherapy (IPT; n=25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, four assigned to CBT and six assigned to IPT failed to receive the&#xD;
      intervention because they withdrew from the study (n=6) or were lost to follow-up (n=4).&#xD;
      Seventy-five percent (18/24) of CBT participants and 56% (14/25) of IPT participants&#xD;
      completed the 12-week protocol. Of note, one CBT participant and three IPT participants were&#xD;
      active in the study at the time of COVID-19 lockdown and had to be discontinued because of&#xD;
      COVID related safety requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 recruitment: Phase 2 procedures was conducted virtually via Zoom to comply with COVID&#xD;
      safety protocols. We received 149 referrals through the centralized registry system used in&#xD;
      Phase 1 and assessed 41 for protocol eligibility. We were unable to reach 108 of those&#xD;
      referred. Fifteen percent (6/41) of those reached for preliminary screening were ineligible&#xD;
      due to lack of interest once all details were explained (n=2) or lost to follow-up (n=4).&#xD;
      Thirty-five individuals signed informed consent documents and completed a baseline assessment&#xD;
      for eligibility, of whom 74% (26/35) were randomized to one of the two psychotherapy&#xD;
      conditions: CBT (n=9) or IPT (n=17). The unequal sizes of the two cells was likely caused&#xD;
      randomization stratified on depression severity and gender and the small sample size.&#xD;
      Following randomization, three assigned to CBT failed withdrew from the study or were lost to&#xD;
      follow-up. Sixty-seven percent (6/9) of CBT participants and 94% percent (16/17) of IPT&#xD;
      participants completed the 12-week protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will model the dynamics of individual and dyadic behavior on a moment-by-moment basis&#xD;
      within each therapy session and over the course of treatment. These models will be used to&#xD;
      test hypotheses about multimodal behavior dynamics, psychotherapy process, type of treatment,&#xD;
      and treatment outcome.&#xD;

    <measure>Depression severity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Depression severity will be measured at the visits 1, 4, and 8 via the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17), which consists of 17 items with Likert scale of either 0 to 4 or 0 to 2. Scores can range from 0 to 54. We will compare HRSD-17 scores at visits 1, 4, and 8.&#xD;
Scale ranges are as follows:&#xD;
0-7= Normal 8-13= Mild Depression 14-18= Moderate Depression 19-22= Severe Depression &gt;=23 = Very Severe Depression</description>

    <measure>Working Alliance Inventory--Short Revised Client Version (WAI-SR-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), client version, measures three key aspects of the therapeutic alliance: (a) agreement on the tasks of therapy, (b) agreement on the goals of therapy and (c) development of an affective bond.&#xD;
WAI-SR, client version, has three scales:&#xD;
Goal&#xD;
Task&#xD;
Bond Each scale ranges from 4 to 20. Higher scores represent better alliance.&#xD;
WAI-SR, client version, will be measured at each weekly visit. Score at final visit will be reported.</description>

WAI-SR, therapist version, has three scales:&#xD;
Goal (3 items): Range from 3 to 15.&#xD;
Task (3 items): Range from 3 to 15.&#xD;
Bond (4 items): Range from 4 to 20. Total score ranges from 10 to 50. Higher scores indicate better alliance.&#xD;
