  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a serious and chronic illness representing a major health problem with&#xD;
      high mortality rates. According to the self-regulation model , patients had some&#xD;
      representations of their illness which are cognitive and emotional. Cognitive representations&#xD;
      include the set of beliefs built around the illness, its consequences and treatment.&#xD;
      Emotional representations are negative emotions generated by the presence of the illness.&#xD;
      According to Leventhal et al. (1997), representations are linked to information extracts by&#xD;
      patients from society, relatives, experiences. This model has been particularly studied in&#xD;
      the context of somatic disorders, but Baines &amp; Wittkowski (2013) shown that it may also be&#xD;
      relevant in patients with mental disorders. In bipolar disorders, first results show that&#xD;
      illness representations are related to relapses and to medication adherence. That's why, we&#xD;
      think that this relevant to improve knowledges of the psychological processes that accompany&#xD;
      the experience of bipolar disorders. To assess illness representation, we will use both&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative tools. These results could have direct application to clinical&#xD;
      practice in psychosocial interventions.&#xD;

      Bipolar disorder is a serious and chronic illness representing a major health problem with&#xD;
      high mortality rates (Colom and Lam, 2005). According to the self-regulation model&#xD;
      (Leventhal, Nerenz &amp; Steel, 1986), patients had some representations of their illness which&#xD;
      are cognitive and emotional. Cognitive representations include the set of beliefs built&#xD;
      around the illness, its consequences and treatment. Emotional representations are negative&#xD;
      emotions generated by the presence of the illness. According to Leventhal et al. (1997),&#xD;
      representations are linked to information extracts by patients from society, relatives,&#xD;
      experiences. This model has been particularly studied in the context of somatic disorders,&#xD;
      but Baines &amp; Wittkowski (2013) shown that it may also be relevant in patients with mental&#xD;
      disorders. In bipolar disorders, first results show that illness representations are related&#xD;
      to relapses (Lobban et al., 2013) and to medication adherence (Averous, Charbonnier,&#xD;
      Lagouanelle-Simeoni, Prosperi &amp; Dany, 2018). That's why, we think that this relevant to&#xD;
      improve knowledges of the psychological processes that accompany the experience of bipolar&#xD;
      disorders. To assess illness representation, we will use both qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      tools. These results could have direct application to clinical practice in psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
