  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LOVED stands for the Living Organ Video Educated Donors (LOVED) program. It is a culturally&#xD;
      tailored program for African Americans to reduce the disparity of low rates of living kidney&#xD;
      donation. It is a mobile health delivered platform that does not require transplant center&#xD;
      visits, thus increasing the reach of the program compared to center-based program to enhance&#xD;
      living kidney donation. The purpose of LOVED is to give education and encouragement to those&#xD;
      who need a kidney transplant and teach about the process of living donation to be better&#xD;
      educated when approaching others about donating a kidney. The ultimate goal of the program is&#xD;
      to increase the number of living kidney donor transplants, especially among African Americans&#xD;
      in South Carolina. The program was created to educate those in need of a kidney about the&#xD;
      donor process, to dispel myths about living donation, discuss who can be asked to donate and&#xD;
      develop and practice skills to start asking others for a living kidney donation. The program&#xD;
      is designed to be completed using a tablet computer and is made up of weekly video education&#xD;
      clips, resources, short quizzes to reinforce the learning points and weekly video chat&#xD;
      sessions with others who need a kidney led by a &quot;navigator&quot; who was once a living donor&#xD;
      kidney recipient. The video clips are made up of stories and brief educational messages from&#xD;
      transplant center staff, physicians, former donors and recipients. The video chat sessions&#xD;
      were designed to solve and address individual issues for those enrolled in the program and to&#xD;
      give a sense of community as they continue on their journey to find a kidney. This randomized&#xD;
      control trial uses groups of 6-9 participants in each LOVED group that lasts 8-weeks each. A&#xD;
      total of 60 participants will be recruited with 30 assigned to LOVED and 30 assigned to a&#xD;
      standard care groups. This program is funded by a grant from the National Institute of Health&#xD;
      and was developed at the Medical University of South Carolina.&#xD;
