      A study to evaluate the efficacy of inhaled molgramostim administered open-label to adult&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects with chronic pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM)&#xD;
      infection, with or without ongoing antimycobacterial guideline based combination therapy.&#xD;

      A Screening period will begin up to 10 weeks prior to the Baseline visit for collection of&#xD;
      the sputum sample, but the remainder of the assessments including Safety labs will be&#xD;
      completed within 6 weeks of Baseline, to determine eligibility. Adult participants with a&#xD;
      history of CF and chronic pulmonary NTM infection will be considered for enrollment. Chronic&#xD;
      pulmonary NTM infection will be defined by at least 3 positive NTM cultures (sputum or&#xD;
      broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL)) for the same species/subspecies of mycobacterium avium (MAC)&#xD;
      or mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) within the 2 years prior to screening, with at&#xD;
      least one positive within the past 6 months prior to screening and a minimum of 50% of NTM&#xD;
      cultures positive over the past 2 years. Participants must additionally provide a positive&#xD;
      sputum culture with the same species/subspecies obtained from the central laboratory during&#xD;
      the Screening period to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of participants will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Participants with chronic pulmonary MAC or MABSC infection who have not&#xD;
           consistently achieved negative NTM sputum cultures while currently on a multidrug NTM&#xD;
           guideline-based antimycobacterial regimen, which has been ongoing for at least 9 months&#xD;
           prior to the Baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Participants with chronic pulmonary MAC or MABSC infection who remain sputum&#xD;
           culture positive but have stopped a multidrug NTM guideline-based antimycobacterial&#xD;
           regimen at least 28 days prior to Screening due to lack of response or intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: Participants with chronic pulmonary MAC or MABSC infection not meeting&#xD;
           recommendations for treatment with a multidrug NTM guideline-based antimycobacterial&#xD;
           regimen based on failure to meet American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society&#xD;
           of America (ATS/IDSA) criteria for NTM pulmonary disease (i.e. absence of radiologic&#xD;
           findings and clinical symptoms beyond what is expected from underlying CF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have Screening, Baseline, Week 1, 2 and followed by monthly Treatment&#xD;
      visits from week 4 during the Treatment period. The Treatment period will be 48 weeks.&#xD;
      Following the End of Treatment (Week 48), subjects will have a Follow-up visit at 4 and 12&#xD;
      weeks, and the End of Study visit 24 weeks after the End of Treatment. At the Baseline visit,&#xD;
      eligible participants will start treatment with inhaled molgramostim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit any changes in concomitant medication will be recorded. Participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to contact the clinic between visits if they experience adverse events (AE),&#xD;
      worsening of their condition or have any other concerns. If needed, unscheduled visits will&#xD;
      be conducted at the Investigator's discretion. All participants will be maintained on their&#xD;
      standard CF treatment and medications independent of NTM treatment status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with inhaled molgramostim will be given at a dosage of 300 μg once daily for 48&#xD;
      weeks. Dosing will be done in the morning, after completion of the subject's normal airway&#xD;
      clearance routine, where medications should be taken in the following order: bronchodilator,&#xD;
      dornase alfa (Pulmozyme), inhaled antibiotics (e.g. TOBI) and lastly inhaled molgramostim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants on a cyclical on-off anti-Pseudomonal regimen will have their trial visits&#xD;
      (Baseline and subsequent visits in the Treatment Period) scheduled during a week after at&#xD;
      least three weeks off treatment or after at least one week on-treatment of the antibiotic.&#xD;
      Participants on a continuous inhaled regimen, including continuous alternating therapy (CAT),&#xD;
      should have been on a stable regimen for at least 28 days prior to Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data review will be conducted after the first 6 participants have completed 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. If safety concerns or poor tolerability are identified in this review, the review&#xD;
      committee may decide on less frequent dosing for subsequent participants in the study.&#xD;
      Additional safety reviews will be conducted at regular intervals thereafter. During the&#xD;
      study, participants in Group 1 will continue use of antimycobacterial treatment, whereas&#xD;
      participants in Groups 2 and 3 will receive inhaled molgramostim as monotherapy for their NTM&#xD;
      infection. For participants in Group 1, the antimycobacterial therapy should preferably not&#xD;
      change during the treatment period except in case of drug toxicity or adverse reactions.&#xD;
      Antibiotics discontinued due to toxicity may be replaced, with drug selection and dose&#xD;
      modification at the discretion of the treating physician. All changes in antimycobacterial&#xD;
      treatment will be recorded, including reasons for each change. In the event the Investigator&#xD;
      has evidence of infection while on treatment which requires more intensive therapy (i.e.&#xD;
      additional antibiotics in Group 1 or addition of antibiotics to Group 2 or 3) the participant&#xD;
      may be allowed to continue after discussion with the Sponsor medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No formal sample size calculation was done as this is an initial pilot study. To be able to&#xD;
      assess response in each of the three groups, a minimum of 8 participants with MAC or MABSC&#xD;
      will be enrolled into each of the 3 groups, and a minimum of 30 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      across all 3 groups. The maximum number of participants enrolled into each group will be 12,&#xD;
      and the maximum number of participants enrolled into the study will be 34.&#xD;

             height, using the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who are co-infected with a respiratory pathogen, e.g. P. aeruginosa or S.&#xD;
             aureus, must either be stable on a regular suppression antibiotic regimen or must be,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Investigator, stable despite the lack of such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Female or male ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. If female, subjects who have been post-menopausal for more than 1 year or females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential after a confirmed menstrual period using a highly efficient&#xD;

             (Visit 2) and must not be lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For purposes of this study, the Sponsor defines &quot;acceptable methods of contraception&quot;&#xD;
             as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oral birth control pills administered for at least 1 monthly cycle prior to&#xD;
                  administration of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A synthetic progestin implanted rod (eg, Implanon®) for at least 1 monthly cycle&#xD;
                  prior to the study drug administration but not beyond the 4th successive year&#xD;
                  following insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intrauterine devices (IUDs), inserted by a qualified clinician for at least 1&#xD;
                  monthly cycle prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate (eg, Depo-Provera®) administered for a minimum of 1&#xD;
                  monthly cycle prior to administration of the study drug and continuing through 1&#xD;
                  month following study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hysterectomy or surgical sterilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomized partner&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Double barrier method (diaphragm with spermicidal gel or condoms with contraceptive&#xD;
             foam) is not considered an acceptable form of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: For subjects prescribed Orkambi: Orkambi may substantially decrease hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptive exposure, reducing the effectiveness and increasing the incidence of&#xD;
             menstruation-associated adverse reactions. Hormonal contraceptives, including oral,&#xD;
             injectable, transdermal, and implantable, should not be relied upon as an effective&#xD;
             method of contraception when co-administered with Orkambi.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. If male, subjects who, if sexually active of reproductive potential and non-sterile&#xD;
             (i.e., male who has not been sterilized by vasectomy for at least 6 months and not&#xD;
             diagnosed with infertility through demonstration of azoospermia in a semen sample&#xD;
             and/or absence of vas deferens through ultrasound) are willing to use a barrier method&#xD;
             of contraception, or their female partner must use an acceptable method of&#xD;
             contraception, during the study and until 30 days after last dose of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests,&#xD;
             and other trial procedures specified in the protocol as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
