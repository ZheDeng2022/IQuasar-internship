      In our study; we aim to analyze the correlation between pre-treatment serum vitamin D (VD)&#xD;
      levels and breast cancer prognostic features in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients&#xD;
      presenting to our department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in females in more and less developed&#xD;
      regions, with more cases occurring in less developed (883,000 cases) than more developed&#xD;
      regions (794,000). In Egypt, breast cancer is the commonest cancer in females representing&#xD;
      about (38.8%) of cancers in females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decades of epidemiologic research have led to the identification of a number of lifestyle and&#xD;
      environmental breast cancer risk factors, including menstrual and/or reproductive history,&#xD;
      use of hormones, anthropometry, and alcohol consumption, each typically explaining a modest&#xD;
      proportion of the variation in disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D exists as vitamin D2 (Calciferol, the storage form) and D3 (Cholecalciferol, the&#xD;
      active form), which are metabolized to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the major circulating&#xD;
      vitamin D metabolite; Besides, its physiological functions, vitamin D levels have also been&#xD;
      studied as a risk factor for several hormonal cancers including breast cancer (BC). Vitamin D&#xD;
      is not technically a vitamin, ie, it is not an essential dietary factor; rather, it is a&#xD;
      pro-hormone produced photo-chemically in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol. The molecular&#xD;
      structure of vitamin D is closely allied to that of classic steroid hormones (eg, estradiol,&#xD;
      cortisol, and aldosterone) in that they have the same root ring structure. Technically,&#xD;
      vitamin D is a secosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and plays a&#xD;
      central role in the biological actions of vitamin D. The vitamin D receptor regulates the&#xD;
      expression of numerous genes involved in calcium/phosphate homeostasis, cellular&#xD;
      proliferation and differentiation, and immune response, largely in a ligand-dependent manner.&#xD;
      To understand the global function of the vitamin D system in physio-pathological processes,&#xD;
      great effort has been devoted to the detection of the vitamin D receptor in various tissues&#xD;
      and cells, many of which have been identified as vitamin D targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a 2010 analysis, the vitamin D receptor significantly affects 229 human genes.&#xD;
      Many of these genes have long been associated with autoimmune diseases and cancers. Greater&#xD;
      than 36 types of tissue have been identified as having a Vitamin D Receptor including the&#xD;
      breast .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study by. plasma vitamin D levels were correlated with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      repair capacity levels in women with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study there was an association between vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency and&#xD;
      tumors with worse prognostic features. Low vitamin D levels were shown to be a risk factor&#xD;
      for estrogen receptor (ER) negative tumors, with positive axilla and a higher rate of cell&#xD;
      proliferation in Brazilian postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study that evaluated serum vitamin D levels in female patients with recently identified&#xD;
      benign or malignant lesions of the breast and its associations with tumor histology. Vitamin&#xD;
      D was associated with tumor aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the effect of vitamin D deficiency on breast cancer prognosis and its role as a&#xD;
      non-invasive bio-marker of breast cancer outcomes warrants further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly diagnosed non-metastatic breast cancer patients presenting to clinical oncology&#xD;
      department, Assiut university Hospitals will be assessed for pre-treatment serum vitamin D&#xD;
      levels (classified as sufficiency (30-100 ng/mL), insufficiency (20- &lt;30 ng/mL) and&#xD;
      deficiency (&lt;20 ng/mL) through a blood sample obtained from the patient before receiving any&#xD;
      type of treatments for their cancer and analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      (ELISA) kit for vitamin D serum levels, patients characteristics (age, menopausal status,&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI as weight in kilograms divided by squared height in meters (kg/m2), data&#xD;
      on breast cancer (histopathological type, grade, tumor stage, lymph node status), hormone&#xD;
      status (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor(PR)), human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor type 2 (HER2) and epithelial proliferative activity described in percentage (Ki-67)&#xD;
      will be obtained from patient file records . Time to tumor relapse whether locally or distant&#xD;
      metastases and overall survival will be recorded. Correlation between these data and the&#xD;
      pre-treatment vitamin D levels will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definition of menopause: the permanent cessation of menses for 12 consecutive months in&#xD;
           the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifine, or ovarian suppression and&#xD;
           follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels in the postmenopausal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor grade defined according to the Nottingham (also called Elston-Ellis) modification&#xD;
           of the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grading system Grade 1 tumor (well-differentiated). Grade&#xD;
           2 tumor (moderately differentiated). Grade 3 tumor (poorly differentiated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor stage will be classified according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)&#xD;
           staging manual eighth edition (2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definition of HER-2 positivity according to American Society of Clinical Oncology&#xD;
           (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guideline recommendations for human&#xD;
           epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer: Testing criteria&#xD;
           define HER2-positive status when (on observing within an area of tumor that amounts to&#xD;
           &gt;10% of contiguous and homogeneous tumor cells) there is evidence of protein&#xD;
           overexpression (IHC) or gene amplification (HER2 copy number or HER2/CEP17 ratio by ISH&#xD;
           based on counting at least 20 cells within the area). If results are equivocal (revised&#xD;
           criteria), reflex testing should be performed using an alternative assay (IHC or ISH).&#xD;
