      Interventional study without medicinal, randomized 1: 1 open-label, multicenter, phase 3 to&#xD;
      evaluate the response in terms of reduction of pain symptomatology from bone metastases,&#xD;
      comparing the conformational radiotherapy (3D-CRT) administered in conventional fractionation&#xD;
      vs. extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) administered with concomitant integrated&#xD;
      simultaneous boost (Simultaneous Integrated Boost-SIB)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Palliative antalgic oncological treatments, e.g. For patients in the chronic-evolutionary&#xD;
      phase of the disease with need for pain control, are a serious problem from the point of&#xD;
      view: management, clinical and scientific research. However, they are affecting an&#xD;
      ever-increasing volume of patients due to the increased incidence of cancer in all its phases&#xD;
      and the potential chronicity of illness linked to new therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of palliative anti-radiation radiotherapy treatments potentially involves up to 40%&#xD;
      of patients in a Radiotherapy Center. Radiotherapy is commonly used in palliative treatment&#xD;
      of symptomatic bone metastases (Furfari A, 2017) being an effective treatment to improve&#xD;
      symptoms and consequently improve the quality of life (QoL) of these patients. Due to the&#xD;
      peculiar characteristics of the patients who need these treatments, scientific research aimed&#xD;
      at optimizing these therapies is a need for assistance and even ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally, this treatment should be as short as possible to re-direct them to systemic&#xD;
      therapies or to home care or long-term care systems (e.g.: Hospice). In order to deliver a&#xD;
      clinically effective dose in a short period of time, hypofractionated regimens must be used.&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiotherapy is a type of radiotherapy that allows to deliver a high equivalent&#xD;
      biological dose in a highly conformed manner, with a favorable toxicity profile (Correa RJ,&#xD;
      2016), and generally in a few fractions. The possibility of using special techniques such as&#xD;
      stereotactic radiotherapy has been investigated in several phase 2 studies, in terms of&#xD;
      symptom response with good results at 3 months (van der Velden JM, 2016) (Murai T1, 2014)&#xD;
      (Braam P , 2016) (Deodato F, 2014) (Ryu S, 2014). Further studies have suggested, in order to&#xD;
      better manage the toxicity profile linked to the hypofractioned regimen, the possibility of&#xD;
      using a hypofractionated regimen over the entire bone compartment and going to over-dose with&#xD;
      a stereotaxic regimen only the macroscopically visible disease to the instrumental&#xD;
      examinations. In particular, in patients with favorable prognostic scores, this regimen would&#xD;
      improve the possible onset of acute and late complications. Although there are indications in&#xD;
      the literature (generated by the Consensus Conference) about the radiation treatment&#xD;
      schedules to be preferred, there is no globally coded and clinically applied therapeutic&#xD;
      prescription standard (Chow E1 &amp; Party, 2012). The most commonly applied conventional&#xD;
      radiation treatment schedules include: i) 8 Gy in 1 therapy session; ii) 20 Gy in 5 therapy&#xD;
      sessions; iii) 30 Gy in 10 therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the same pain control, multiple fractionation boards report, according to some authors,&#xD;
      better symptom control over time and are therefore very often preferred for patients with a&#xD;
      prognosis&gt; 6 months. Routine use of prognostic scores to characterize life expectancy and&#xD;
      define the most appropriate treatment regimen is very rarely used in everyday clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern oncology radiotherapy can take advantage of advanced technologies and exploit the&#xD;
      personalization of treatments. To date, some randomized trials are underway investigating the&#xD;
      role of stereotactic radiotherapy for these patients compared to conventional approaches, but&#xD;
      not all of them use adequate personalization of treatment. Furthermore, none of the ongoing&#xD;
      and currently registered trials analyzes the &quot;ii) 20 Gy in 5 treatment sessions&quot; versus&#xD;
      stereotactic in the direct comparison between two single randomized arms. The aim of this&#xD;
      randomized multicenter prospective trial study is to evaluate the pain control effectiveness&#xD;
      of an unconventional fractionation delivered with the most innovative stereotactic technique&#xD;
      approach available in this clinical scenario against the conventional one; enrollment of&#xD;
      patients will be specifically selected with prognosis&gt; 6 months according to the Mizumoto&#xD;
      score (Mizumoto M, 2008) and structural stability defined according to Spine Instability&#xD;
      Neoplastic Score (SINS) &lt;7, with indication to radiotherapy on bone metastases. Highlights of&#xD;
      this study include: the high level of treatment customization for both accurate selection and&#xD;
      ultraconformed radiation therapy planning; the reduction in the number of sessions to which&#xD;
      the patient must be subjected, which reduces his discomfort; the approach innovation; the&#xD;
      location of the study group (multicentric, in the Italian panorama) in a central position in&#xD;
      the international scenario of the specific sector. The results of this trial are potentially&#xD;
      &quot;practice-changing&quot;.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a randomized, controlled superiority trial. The study will appear as an interventionist without medicinal, multicentric, spontaneous. Randomization will take place in a 1: 1 ratio. The study involves the enrollment of 330 patients divided into two groups of 165 patients for each of the two study arms (arm A (gold standard): 4 Gy x 5 fractions (fr); arm B: 5 Gy x 3 fr (Whole Vertebra) + SIB 10 Gy x 3 fr on the Gross Tumor Volume - GTV). The expected difference between the two treatments in terms of three-month pain control rates is 15% more in the experimental arm compared to the standard arm.&#xD;
The calculation of the sample size took into account a 95% CI with a coefficient α of 0.05 and a drop-out rate of 10%.</intervention_model_description>

Patients will be randomized after verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Randomization will be performed according to a random list generated by the computer.</masking_description>
