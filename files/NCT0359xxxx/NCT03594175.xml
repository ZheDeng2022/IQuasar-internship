      Study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CUSA-081 in the restoration of central venous&#xD;
      access device (CVAD) functionality in participants 18 years and older.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,&#xD;
      active and placebo-controlled study to examine CUSA-081 versus placebo or alteplase in&#xD;
      subjects with dysfunctional non-hemodialysis Central Venous Access Devices (CVADs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the treatment period will consist of one visit which may take place on the&#xD;
      same day as screening or on the following day. After meeting all inclusion criteria, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 9:1:6 ratio of CUSA-081: placebo: alteplase. There will be a&#xD;
      follow-up assessment performed on Day 30 (±2 days) after treatment with study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine blood pressure measurement, heart rate and urine pregnancy test will be performed&#xD;
      before enrollment in the study. Safety, including Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs), Adverse&#xD;
      Drug Reactions (ADRs) and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), will be recorded&#xD;
      throughout the study. The end of the trial is defined as the last follow-up contact of the&#xD;
      last subject to receive study drug in the trial.&#xD;
