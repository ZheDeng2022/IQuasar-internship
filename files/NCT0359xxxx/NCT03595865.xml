  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 6-month, parallel-group study of the safety and efficacy of tafluprostin for Chinese&#xD;
      patients with posttrabeculectomy residual primary angle-closure glaucoma or&#xD;
      posttrabeculectomy residual primary open angle glaucoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enroll 60 eyes with posttrabeculectomy glaucoma (30 eyes with posttrabeculectomy residual&#xD;
      primary angle-closure glaucoma. 30 eyes with posttrabeculectomy residual primary open angle&#xD;
      glaucoma). Inclusive at 9 AM at eligibility visit and previously undergone trabeculectomy at&#xD;
      least 30 days before screening visit. Qualified patients had a mean intraocular pressure&#xD;
      (IOP) between 21 and 35mm Hg. All patients had documented residual PACG/POAG after&#xD;
      trabeculectomy, with inadequate IOP control in at least one eye.The right eye was selected if&#xD;
      both eyes showed about the same IOP. The previous IOP-lowering drugs were washed out before&#xD;
      using tafluprost. Because all of the eyes had critical IOP levels, the design of this study&#xD;
      was open-label, with emphasis on IOP change. Both patients in PACG and POAG groups will dose&#xD;
      1 time daily in each eye for 6 months. Each eye will be preformed tafluprost 0.0015% at 9&#xD;
      PM.The investigator monitored compliance via review of bottles at each follow-up visit, and&#xD;
      at the last visit the old bottles will be returned and the investigator will keep them for&#xD;
      storage. Efficacy and safety evaluations will be conducted at months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6&#xD;
      after the start of tafluprost treatment.The IOP will be measured at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6&#xD;
      month visit. All IOP measurements are to be performed at about the same time of day (at 9 AM&#xD;
      at each visit). IOP was measured by Goldmann tonometer. The IOP value was the mean of 3&#xD;
      consecutive measurements.A visual field examination with automated perimetry(Octopus 101)&#xD;
      using a threshold program was performed at the screening visit. If the visual field&#xD;
      examination has been carried out within 12 weeks before the screening visit, no additional&#xD;
      visual filed examination is required at the screening visit. A visual field examination and&#xD;
      RNFL(retina nerve fiber layer) examination are to be performed at screening and the last&#xD;
      visit respectively by the same technician with the same protocol. Topical examination by slit&#xD;
      lamp is to be performed to evaluate the anterior segment. Ophthalmoscope examinations will be&#xD;
      performed at screening and the last visit to examine the vitreous body, retina, and optic&#xD;
      nervehead.The efficacy of tafluprost therapy is to be evaluated by comparing the baseline IOP&#xD;
      and the IOP at various intervals after the start of treatment, by ANOVA test. The comparison&#xD;
      of two groups was estimated by t test. The difference of the time point IOP between the 2&#xD;
      groups was analyzed by X2 test.&#xD;
