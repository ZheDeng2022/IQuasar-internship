      This is a Prospective, Vehicle Controlled, Double Blind, Multicenter, Randomized Phase II&#xD;
      trial, comparing the effect of twice daily B244 application for 8 weeks vs. vehicle&#xD;
      application on treatment of mild to moderate rosacea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Screening and Baseline all subjects must have Type 1 erythematotelangiectatic rosacea&#xD;
      (ETR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study will be approximately 12 weeks. Participants will report for&#xD;
      a Screening visit and if all inclusion criteria are met will undergo a washout period,&#xD;
      between 2 days and 4 weeks, depending on current treatment. Subjects will then report for the&#xD;
      Baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come in for visits at Day 7 (Week 1), Day 28 (Week 4), and Day 56 (Week 8). A&#xD;
      final visit will be conducted at Day 84 (Week 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed using Clinician Erythema Assessment (CEA), Investigator Global&#xD;
      Assessment (IGA), Skindex16, and Patient Self-Assessment (PSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be collected for standard safety laboratory tests. Participant's&#xD;
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to enroll approximately 130 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be 1:1 so that equal numbers of subjects will be treated in each arm of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

    <masking_description>This is a double blind study. Participants will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule generated for the allocation of vehicle or B244 prior to the initiation of the trial. Randomization will be centrally-based and performed using an appropriate IWRS (an automated randomization system).&#xD;
Each participant scheduled to receive investigational product (IP) will receive a randomization number at the time of randomization. The randomization number will be used to identify the study medication kit assigned to the participant and indicate the treatment to be administered to that participant.</masking_description>

             examination, clinical chemistry and hematology.&#xD;
&#xD;

             prevent participation in a clinical trial, or, in the judgment of the Investigator,&#xD;
             would put the subject at undue risk, or might confound the study assessments (e.g.,&#xD;
             other dermatological diseases), or might interfere with the subject's participation in&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Commencement of new hormonal therapy or dose change to hormonal therapy within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to baseline. Dose and frequency of use of any hormonal therapy started more than&#xD;
