  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if the combination of BN-Brachyury plus radiation&#xD;
      therapy can induce objective radiographic response rate (ORR) in patients, using a Simon&#xD;
      2-stage optimal design. In stage 1, a minimum of threshold of activity will be needed to&#xD;
      proceed to stage 2.&#xD;

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed chordoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be scheduled to have radiation therapy to at least 1 target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age â‰¥12 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have recovered completely from any reversible toxicity associated with recent&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There should be a minimum of 2 weeks from any chemotherapy, small molecule/targeted&#xD;
             therapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation prior to enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential and male partners of Females of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must agree to use effective birth control or abstinence from screening to&#xD;
             after the last vaccination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment for cancer, with specific exceptions noted in the inclusion&#xD;
             criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic hepatitis B or C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant disease, that in the opinion of the investigator may impair the&#xD;
             patient's tolerance of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would&#xD;
             prohibit the understanding, or rendering of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune diseases requiring treatment or a history of autoimmune disease that&#xD;
             might be stimulated by vaccine treatment. This requirement is due to the potential&#xD;
             risks of exacerbating autoimmunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiological doses of systemic&#xD;
             steroid replacement or local steroid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents within 28 days before&#xD;
             start of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biological composition to MVA-BN/FPV-Brachyury or other agents used in trial. History&#xD;
             of allergic reactions to aminoglycoside antibiotic or egg products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious or uncontrolled intercurrent illness, included but not limited to, ongoing or&#xD;
             active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, would limit compliance with trial requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this trial due to the unknown effects of the&#xD;
             BN-Brachyury on the fetus or infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are ineligible because of the potential for decreased immune&#xD;
             response to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiovascular disease, which includes but is not limited to New York&#xD;
             Heart Association Heart Failure Class II or greater, myocardial infarction within the&#xD;
             previous 3 months, unstable arrhythmias, unstable angina.&#xD;
