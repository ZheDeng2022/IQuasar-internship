  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of Burst DR stimulation as a treatment for persistent abdominal&#xD;
      refractory visceral pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis. Abdominal pain is a main symptom&#xD;
      in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Patients have a background constant pain with acute&#xD;
      episodes needing admissions. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a recognised treatment for&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. This involves placing an electric wire in the spine and the use of&#xD;
      electricity to manage the pain. This is a pacemaker for controlling pain. Burst DR&#xD;
      stimulation delivers a wave form which mimics the way nerves conduct electrical signals,&#xD;
      there are short bursts or spikes of stimulation followed by short periods of rest. The key&#xD;
      aims and objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of Burst DR SCS as a treatment&#xD;
      for persistent pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female participants aged 18 years or older (no upper age limit) and willing to&#xD;
             provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is able and willing to comply with the follow-up schedule and protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants diagnosed with persistent refractory visceral pain secondary to chronic&#xD;
             pancreatitis for at least 6 months with or without dermal hyperalgesia or allodynia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum baseline pain score of 6 on eleven point NRS scale (0-10) for their visceral&#xD;
             pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously tried and failed at least one conservative treatment for chronic pain&#xD;
             including but not limited to pharmacological therapy, physical therapy and&#xD;
             interventional pain procedures for persistent pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Been deemed suitable for the study by the pancreatic or pain MDT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total daily dose of opioids equivalent to ≤120mg of Morphine or 50% reduction in&#xD;
             opioid dose. If the patients are taking more than this dose, they will be offered a&#xD;
             referral to our opioid reduction clinic to achieve the target opioid dose and the&#xD;
             baseline opioid will be taken as the dose on referral&#xD;
&#xD;

             Stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
