  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today's children have become increasingly inactive and unfit, with &gt;50% of children not&#xD;
      meeting the recommended 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Previous research&#xD;
      has suggested that acute aerobic exercise of moderate intensity was associated with improved&#xD;
      cognition manifested by improved performance and increased P3 amplitude, a neuroelectric&#xD;
      indicator that reflects the amount of attentional allocation, in tasks requiring cognitive&#xD;
      control. While minimal evidence exists to support potential mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      transient effects of exercise on brain and cognition, research suggests that phasic changes&#xD;
      in the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) (as measured by salivary alpha amylase (sAA))&#xD;
      system are a potential mechanism for explaining the acute effect of exercise on brain and&#xD;
      cognition. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to examine the mechanisms linking acute&#xD;
      aerobic exercise to improved cognitive control as well as the underlying neuroelectrical&#xD;
      activities in children, using electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials&#xD;
      (ERPs). We hope to gain a better understanding of the role of acute exercise and cognitive&#xD;
      and brain health. The results from this study will help identify mechanisms linking acute&#xD;
      exercise to enhanced cognitive performance in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that exercise-induced phasic increases in sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      activity will mediate the effect of a single bout of exercise on brain function, cognition,&#xD;
      and standardized achievement test performance.&#xD;
