      The study will test the ability of specially formulated nutritional supplement capsules to&#xD;
      extend the time between recurrent urinary tract infections in women. This objective will be&#xD;
      completed by enrolling women who have suffered from 3-4 uncomplicated UTIs in the past 12&#xD;
      months into a double blind placebo controlled cross-over trial. Cross-over and study&#xD;
      completion are triggered by the next two UTI recurrences. The goal of the study is for the&#xD;
      supplement to extend the time to the next UTI for study participants as compared to placebo.&#xD;

      Background: Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), i.e. having three or more infections&#xD;
      in 12 months, present a common and serious health problem for women. Long-term prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotic use is one treatment approach though there are currently no consensus treatment&#xD;
      strategies for chronic recurrent UTIs which makes development of antibiotic resistant&#xD;
      bacterial strains a major concern. Alternatively, nutritional supplements such as those based&#xD;
      on cranberry and the sugar d-mannose, have shown some mixed success as a complementary&#xD;
      treatment for UTIs. Thus, identification of a multi-ingredient nutritional supplement which&#xD;
      could reduce the recurrence of UTIs when applied in conjunction with standard of care would&#xD;
      be valuable to the heath and healthcare of women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The study will test the efficacy of a twice-daily nutritional supplement for&#xD;
      extending the time between recurrent UTIs in women. The supplement is a commercially&#xD;
      available product (WelTract, AmPurity LLC) whose capsules contain extracts from Hibiscus&#xD;
      flowers and cranberry fruit, lactoferrin, D-mannose, and vitamins C and D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study design will be a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over&#xD;
      trial. The primary outcome will be time to recurrence of next UTI. Women (age 18-75 yrs) will&#xD;
      be enrolled at a private urology clinic upon presentation of their 3rd or 4th simple cystitis&#xD;
      of the lower urinary tract in the past 12 months. Randomization and product consumption will&#xD;
      occur concurrently with standard of care treatment (acute antibiotics) of the infection.&#xD;
      Resolution of the infection will be confirmed by urine culture and supplement or placebo&#xD;
      consumption will continue until UTI recurrence which will trigger cross-over. Again, standard&#xD;
      of care will ensue and consumption of the supplement or placebo will continue until UTI&#xD;
      recurrence which triggers participant study completion. Cross-over is not forced and the&#xD;
      maximum allowable time to cross-over and/or complete the study is one year per participant.&#xD;
      Side-effects will be monitored and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan: The study plans to enroll a maximum of 250 women, intending to ensure that 150&#xD;
      women complete the study. Statistical analysis will be performed using both the&#xD;
      non-parametric Log Rank test and the Gail and Simon method, each with different primary&#xD;
      outputs (statistical significance and effect size, respectively). Both of these methods are&#xD;
      suitable for comparing paired time-to-event measures as found in a cross-over design. The&#xD;
      baseline sample size (N=150) was calculated using the Cox Proportional Hazard method, at 85%&#xD;
      desired power, an alpha level 0.05, a representative hazard ratio of 0.7 from prior cranberry&#xD;
      treatment trials, and allowing for up to 40% of the subjects to not complete the study due to&#xD;
      reasons such as withdrawal or dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Significance: The daily consumption of a scientifically-based multi-ingredient&#xD;
      nutritional supplement may provide a safe and practical means to extend the time until&#xD;
      recurrence of the next UTI for women who have suffered 3-4 UTIs in the past 12 months when&#xD;
      applied in combination with standard of care.&#xD;
