  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project tests a peer mentor intervention to improve outcomes in patients with end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease (ESRD). The investigators will train peer mentors to deliver social support and&#xD;
      to provide information and motivation in order to improve adherence behaviors and self&#xD;
      management practices in assigned mentees who are also patients on maintenance hemodialysis.&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of a weekly telephone call between mentor and mentee, over a&#xD;
      period of 3 months. The study will recruit patients at 7 dialysis facilities (5 in the Bronx,&#xD;
      NY and 2 in Nashville, TN) and randomize the patients to the peer mentorship intervention&#xD;
      versus usual care. The primary outcome will be the sum of number of emergency department&#xD;
      visits and hospitalizations during 3 months of intervention and 9 or 15 months of follow-up&#xD;
      observation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this research is to improve End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) related&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The medical care of patients with ESRD is highly complex and&#xD;
      enormously expensive. Hospitalizations drive up to 40% of the cost for ESRD care.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease and infections account for over 50% of ESRD-related hospitalizations&#xD;
      and contribute to disproportionate mortality in this patient population. This study tests the&#xD;
      implementation and impact on hospitalization outcomes of a peer mentor led intervention&#xD;
      designed to increase effective self-management in patients receiving hemodialysis, in a&#xD;
      real-world setting with high potential for widespread dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving hemodialysis who can self-manage their fluid status effectively, are&#xD;
      adherent to their dialysis schedule and to their dietary plan are hospitalized less&#xD;
      frequently and have lower morbidity and mortality than patients who are less adherent.&#xD;
      However, numerous impediments to dialysis self-management exist including facility, physician&#xD;
      and patient-level barriers. The following are patient-level barriers to optimal&#xD;
      self-management: 1) poor knowledge about the rationale and metrics of estimated dry weight&#xD;
      (EDW), 2) poor knowledge about the metrics of urea clearance and nutritional parameters, 3)&#xD;
      under-utilization of available hours for unscheduled dialysis, and 4) low self-efficacy&#xD;
      leading to non-adherent schedule and dietary behaviors. Dialysis self-management education is&#xD;
      often not successful in improving patients' skills. Educational tools from dialysis&#xD;
      facilities and providers are didactic, have medical jargon and lack concrete steps to&#xD;
      mitigate patient visits to emergency departments (ED) and subsequent hospitalizations. A&#xD;
      culturally sensitive, easy to understand educational program that can increase hemodialysis&#xD;
      self-management is critically needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer mentorship has been used effectively to enhance self-efficacy and self-management&#xD;
      behaviors in patients with chronic disease. A single study of peer mentorship for ESRD&#xD;
      patients found that peer mentors improved adherence and satisfaction with care among mentees.&#xD;
      This strategy has high potential to improve the factors that drive hospitalizations among&#xD;
      this high-risk patient group. The goal of this research is to implement a peer mentor&#xD;
      training program to increase patients' knowledge about the metrics of hemodialysis, enhance&#xD;
      self-management to meet EDW, nutritional and adherence goals, and to enhance self-efficacy in&#xD;
      mentees. The peer-mentor intervention is based on the information, motivation, behavior (IMB)&#xD;
      model of health behavior and the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program. There will be a&#xD;
      didactic component to increase knowledge, and a semi-structured component to increase&#xD;
      perception of social support. The investigators will test the feasibility of implementation&#xD;
      of this program and the efficacy of it to reduce hospitalizations in a pragmatic trial&#xD;
      comparing the peer mentor intervention on mentees to a control group assigned to usual care.&#xD;
      The study will also test the intervention at two geographically diverse locations (Bronx, NY&#xD;
      and Nashville, TN) to provide evidence of its scalability and acceptability in different&#xD;
      patient populations. The study hypothesis states: a structured peer mentor telephone&#xD;
      intervention will be more effective than usual care in increasing hemodialysis related&#xD;
      knowledge, self-management adherent behaviors and in decreasing ED visits and&#xD;
      hospitalizations in ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the effects of a 3-month semi-structured and telephone delivered&#xD;
      peer mentor intervention on a composite of ED visits and hospitalizations in 100 high risk&#xD;
      patients on hemodialysis randomized to peer mentor intervention as compared to 100 high risk&#xD;
      patients on hemodialysis assigned to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcomes include: 1) dialysis adherence (mean weekly minutes of dialysis), 2)&#xD;
           mean monthly inter-dialytic weight gain (IDWG), and 3) mean monthly albumin levels, in&#xD;
           the intervention mentees as compared to the controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare by group patient dialysis knowledge, self-efficacy and social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To test the feasibility of a peer training program focused on teaching&#xD;
      self-management skills focused on adherence, dietary and fluid management, in dialysis&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the feasibility of a training program conducted in 7 dialysis facilities the&#xD;
           investigators will conduct peer training of 20 recruited mentors (10 in New York and 10&#xD;
           in Nashville), using a semi-structured curriculum taught in 4 sets of 2-hour sessions,&#xD;
           over 4 weeks per facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the fidelity of the curriculum training the investigators will use attendance&#xD;
           records, content analysis, pre- and post-knowledge assessments and course evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pragmatic trial will test the effects and implementation of a low cost, educational,&#xD;
      telephone-based, peer-mentor intervention to increase self-management behaviors of patients&#xD;
      receiving hemodialysis.&#xD;
