      Recovery from surgery, injury or illness might require periods of bed rest in-hospital or at&#xD;
      home. Bed rest may be needed for recovery but also has negative consequences. Prolonged bed&#xD;
      rest reduces the ability of muscle to take up sugar from the blood, and increases blood&#xD;
      levels of sugar and fat which may actually delay recovery. Bone starts breaking down when&#xD;
      there is very little skeletal stimulation or 'stress' that typically occurs with walking. Bed&#xD;
      rest stiffens arteries which may increase blood pressure. Different diets may influence the&#xD;
      extent of harmful effects to muscle, bone and arteries during bed rest. This study compares a&#xD;
      diet with increased plant sources (i.e. lentils, chickpeas, beans and peas) to a typical&#xD;
      hospital diet (mostly animal sources and foods high in refined sugar) on blood, arteries,&#xD;
      muscle and bone during bed rest. The investigators will test six healthy adults before,&#xD;
      during and after two periods of 4-day bed rest, one when they eat a typical hospital diet,&#xD;
      one with a diet containing more plant sources. The investigators will learn more about the&#xD;
      effects of diet during bed rest and be able to make recommendations about diets to help&#xD;
      ensure healthy recovery for individuals requiring bed rest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many medical conditions and interventions require periods of bed rest in order to maximize&#xD;
      recovery and restore optimal physical function. Unfortunately, muscle becomes glucose&#xD;
      intolerant, bone starts to break down, and arteries become stiffer during sustained periods&#xD;
      of chronic inactivity, such as bed rest. Elevation of blood glucose during hospital stays&#xD;
      results in increased morbidity, mortality, length of stay and costs. Components of the&#xD;
      typical Western diet (refined carbohydrates and protein from animal sources common in&#xD;
      hospital foods) induce glucose intolerance, bone catabolism, and arterial stiffening;&#xD;
      plant-based proteins may not have the same negative impact. Pulses (i.e. low fat legumes:&#xD;
      lentils, chickpeas, beans, peas) contain carbohydrate with a low glycemic index, and do not&#xD;
      substantially increase blood glucose levels. At the same time, they are high in protein, but&#xD;
      do not contain the same sulphur-containing amino acid profile as animal proteins that induce&#xD;
      bone resorption. Pulses are, therefore, a potential 'super food' to mitigate many of the&#xD;
      negative impacts associated with required bed rest following medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study purpose is to determine the effects of a pulse-based diet compared to a Western&#xD;
      diet of typical hospital foods on glucose tolerance, bone catabolism, and arterial stiffening&#xD;
      during bed rest. The investigators hypothesize that a pulse-based diet will be superior to a&#xD;
      typical Western diet for preventing glucose intolerance, bone catabolism, and arterial&#xD;
      stiffening during sustained bed rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six healthy adults will take part in a cross-over study where they will be randomized to four&#xD;
      days of bed rest while on a pulse-based or Western diet, have a one month wash-out and then&#xD;
      cross-over before another four days of bed rest with the other diet. Immediately before and&#xD;
      after bed rest (i.e. the first morning after the last night of bed rest), oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance tests will be conducted to assess glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (i.e.&#xD;
      markers used to assess diabetes risk). At the same time points, fasting blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for lipid assessments. Urine will be collected for assessment of bone catabolism&#xD;
      (via measures of N-telopeptides: a by-product of collagen from bone which appears in the&#xD;
      urine when bone is breaking down). Blood pressure will be evaluated every two hours during&#xD;
      bed rest days from 9am to 9pm. Arterial stiffness (measured by the gold-standard technique of&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity using applanation tonometry) and beat-by-beat blood pressure will be used&#xD;
      to assess blood vessel function before and after four days of bed rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will inform improved hospital diets and nutritional habits of patients to prevent&#xD;
      or offset negative health implications during periods of bed rest that may be required either&#xD;
      in-hospital, long-term care or at home as part of standard medical care.&#xD;
