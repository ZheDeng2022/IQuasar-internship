    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of abexinostat and how well it&#xD;
      works with given together with pembrolizumab in treating participants with microsatellite&#xD;
      instability (MSI) solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body. Abexinostat may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Giving abexinostat and pembrolizumab may work better in treating&#xD;
      participants with solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximally tolerated and recommended phase 2 dose of abexinostat in&#xD;
      combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI). (Dose escalation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria in patients treated with abexinostat in combination with CPI in&#xD;
      patients with prior primary (cohort A) or acquired (cohort B) resistance to prior CPI&#xD;
      treatment. (Dose expansion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate and median duration of response (DoR) by immune&#xD;
      modified (i)RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the median progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To further characterize the safety profile of the treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of abexinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive abexinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) on over 30 minutes day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 90 days.&#xD;
