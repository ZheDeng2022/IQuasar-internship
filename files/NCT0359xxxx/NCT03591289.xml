    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, outcome trial to evaluate, if depth of neuromuscular blockade&#xD;
      (NMB) will affect surgical conditions and postoperative pain based on the degree of&#xD;
      neuromuscular block during robotic surgery for gynecological and urologic procedures in obese&#xD;
      and non-obese patients.&#xD;

      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be induced with propofol (2 mg/kg), fentanyl (1-2 µg/kg) and rocuronium (0.6&#xD;
      mg/kg) to facilitate intubation. A #8 endotracheal tube in males and #7endotracheal tube in&#xD;
      females will be inserted in the trachea and secured at 22 cm. Anesthesia will be maintained&#xD;
      with sevoflurane to maintain the BIS value between 40 and 60. Analgesia will be provided with&#xD;
      fentanyl at 1-2 µg/kg/h or remifentanil 0.5-2 µg/kg/min. Anesthesia will continue until&#xD;
      surgery is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) or moderate NMB as&#xD;
      described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rocuronium will be administered to keep NMB deep or moderate NMB according to the&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep NMB: Rocuronium will be given as a continuous infusion for deep block. Train of four&#xD;
      (TOF) will be maintained at 0 (zero) with at least one post-tetanic count (PTC). Patients'&#xD;
      paralysis will be continued through the anesthesia period. At the end of surgery, deep Block&#xD;
      patients' will receive 4 mg/kg sugammadex and the patient's trachea will be extubated&#xD;
      according to routine extubation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate NMB: Rocuronium will be used as bolus doses to achieve a moderate block. TOF will be&#xD;
      maintained between 1 to 3 twitches. PTC will not be counted. Paralysis will be continued&#xD;
      throughout the anesthesia period. At the end of surgery, patients will receive 2 mg/kg&#xD;
      sugammadex in the moderate NMB and the patient's trachea will be extubated according to&#xD;
      routine extubation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NMB will be assessed by acceleromyography (STIMPOD NMS410 Peripheral Nerve Stimulator, Xavant&#xD;
      Technology (Pty) Ltd. Silverton, Pretoria, South Africa)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ventilator will be set at pressure-controlled mode and patients will be ventilated with&#xD;
      an airway pressure corresponding to a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg up to a maximum airway pressure&#xD;
      of 35 cmH20. Inspired oxygen will be kept near 50% but will be increased if necessary to&#xD;
      maintain a hemoglobin oxygen saturation ≥95%. PEEP will be set at 5 cmH20. Respiratory rate&#xD;
      will be 12 breaths per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' will have a small finger cuff (finger plethysmography) with a transducer and&#xD;
      continuous real-time cardiovascular monitor (Edwards, Life Science, Irvine, CA) The patient&#xD;
      may also receive an arterial catheter (radial artery) for continuous real-time cardiovascular&#xD;
      monitoring based on the clinicians' preference. Arterial waveform will be recorded&#xD;
      continuously. A pulse oximeter (LNOP Adt, Masimo Corp, Irvine, CA) will be attached to the&#xD;
      index finger of the patient's same hand and connected to a bedside monitor (Radical 7, Masimo&#xD;
      Corp, Irvine, CA); the oximeter will be wrapped to prevent interference from outside light.&#xD;
      Perfusion variability index (PVI) calculates the respiratory variations in the&#xD;
      plethysmography waveform amplitude (Perfusion index [PI]) using the maximum and minimum PI&#xD;
      values over a given time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative fluid management will be performed with normosol 2 mL/kg/h. Fluid boluses will&#xD;
      be given as guided by stroke volume variation (SVV). Hetastarch will be given as a bolus in&#xD;
      250 mL increments to a maximum of 50 mL/kg. The fluid bolus will be given over 2 minutes. A&#xD;
      bladder (foley) catheter will be inserted after induction of anesthesia. This is part of&#xD;
      conventional care and allows for more accurate fluid volume tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is in Trendelenburg position and should a measurement yield that SVV is&#xD;
      staying above 10%, a fluid bolus of 250 mL of hetastarch will be given over 2 minutes and&#xD;
      repeated until the SVV falls below 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During abdominal CO2 insufflation, the intra-abdominal pressure will be kept at 15 cmH2O. The&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position will be 30º, which corresponds to the maximum inclination of the OR&#xD;
      table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, patients will receive a bilateral transverse abdominal plane (TAP) block&#xD;
      with ropivacaine in the post-operative area. Patients will receive a PCA pump with&#xD;
      hydromorphone for pain management.(This is all standard practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Measurements that will be recorded once the patient is brought into the operating room and&#xD;
      throughout the intraoperative period include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Hemodynamic data; Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure in mmHg, Cardiac&#xD;
      Output and Cardiac Index in liters per minute, Stroke Volume Variation in percent, Pulse&#xD;
      Pressure Variation in percent, Perfusion Index (number from 0.1-10, no units), Perfusion&#xD;
      Variability Index in percent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time points the data will be recorded include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After patients placement on operative table, while still awake, lying flat for one&#xD;
           minute but prior to induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intraoperative, one minute after induction of anesthesia and intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intraoperative, one minute after initiation of pneumoperitoneum, with just one trocar&#xD;
           placed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intraoperative, one minute after positioning the patient in Trendelenburg position but&#xD;
           before the surgeon begins&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Intraoperative, every 15 minutes during the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Intraoperative, when the surgeon states the surgery is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Intraoperative, after surgery completed and one minute after reversal of Trendelenburg&#xD;
           position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Intraoperative, while the patient is still on the operative table, one minute after&#xD;
           deflation of the peritoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Intraoperative; additional measurements (as referred to above) may be recorded to&#xD;
           capture observed changes that occurred during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Measurements that will be recorded after general anesthesia has been induced and&#xD;
      throughout the intraoperative period include (same time points as above minus time point&#xD;
      one):&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Assessment of NMB&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) A 5-point surgical rating scale will be used to assess surgical conditions every 15&#xD;
      minutes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The surgeon and the surgical assistant will be asked about surgical conditions every 15&#xD;
      minutes. Surgical conditions will be assessed by the Leiden surgical rating scale (Martini&#xD;
      BJA 2014; 112:498).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Extremely poor conditions: The surgeon is unable to work due to coughing or due to the&#xD;
           inability to obtain a visible laparoscopic field because of inadequate muscle&#xD;
           relaxation. Additional muscle relaxants must be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Poor conditions: There is a visible laparoscopic field but the surgeon is severely&#xD;
           hampered by inadequate muscle relaxation with continuous muscle contractions and/or&#xD;
           movements with the hazard of tissue damage. Additional muscle relaxants must be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Acceptable conditions: There is a wide visible laparoscopic field but muscle&#xD;
           contractions and/or movements occur regularly causing some interference with the&#xD;
           surgeon's work. There is the need for additional muscle relaxants to prevent&#xD;
           deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Good conditions: There is a wide laparoscopic working field with sporadic muscle&#xD;
           contractions and/or movements. There is no immediate need for additional muscle&#xD;
           relaxants unless there is the fear for deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Optimal conditions: There is a wide visible laparoscopic working field without any&#xD;
           movement or contractions. There is no need for additional muscle relaxants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Intraoperatively; The Intra-abdominal pressures (mmHg) will be recorded every 15 minutes&#xD;
      during the surgery. The amount of flow and the total amount of CO2 (in liters) will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Forearm - fingertip temperature gradients will be measured by Mon-a-thermometer&#xD;
      (Mallinckrodt Medical, Inc. St. Louis, MO) and disposable Mon-a-therm thermocouples.&#xD;
      Vasoconstriction will be identified when forearm - fingertip temperature gradient is ≥ 00 Cº&#xD;
      and PI &lt; 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Additional assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intraoperatively; the surgical assistant will report any episode(s) of abdominal&#xD;
           contractions throughout the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The degree of the patients' Trendelenburg position will be measured intra-operatively&#xD;
           with an angle ruler.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The amount of rocuronium received intraoperatively, during the course of surgery, will&#xD;
           be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects demographic information will be collected at the time of consent. This will include,&#xD;
      age, gender, weight in kilograms, height in centimeters, BMI in kg/m^2, waist-to hip ratio,&#xD;
      surgical procedure and co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) Post-operative assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain assessments will be completed using the &quot;visual pain analogue scale&quot; (VAS scale&#xD;
           from 1 to 100 mm, with 1 meaning no pain at all to 100 rated as the worst pain&#xD;
           imaginable). Assessments will be completed by a study team member. Patients will be&#xD;
           asked about their pain level by visual analogue scale at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Baseline; in pre-operative holding area&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. One hour after admission to PACU, post-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Six hours postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Post-operative day one (next morning) between 0600 and 1000&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative hydromorphone PCA requirement will be recorded up until the post-operative&#xD;
           DAY ONE (Overall amount of hydromorphone measured in milligrams total). Pain assessment&#xD;
           will be completed between 0600 and 1000 am.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other pain management (rescue) medications the patient received up to the time of the&#xD;
      &quot;AM&quot; post-operative assessment will be recorded.&#xD;
