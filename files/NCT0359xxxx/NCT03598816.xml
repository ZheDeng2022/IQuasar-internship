  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reported in the 2018 NEJM (378; 1277) article, the combination of checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
      ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) phase III trial&#xD;
      Checkmate 214 demonstrated statistically significant (P&lt;0.0001) improvement of overall&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) at 42% (95% confidence interval (CI), 37-47%) compared to standard of&#xD;
      care (SOC) sunitinib at 27% (95% CI, 22-31%) in treatment naïve advanced or metastatic clear&#xD;
      cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This study also showed increased survival benefit of&#xD;
      Ipi+Nivo over sunitinib in the IMDC intermediate-poor risk ccRCC patients. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      Ipi+Nivo was just approved by U.S. FDA in April 2018 for treating metastatic ccRCC. Hence,&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesized that the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab is&#xD;
      similarly efficacious in advanced or metastatic RCC. Furthermore, the investigators also&#xD;
      hypothesize that the administration of personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine will further&#xD;
      enhance anti-tumor immune response in RCC.&#xD;
