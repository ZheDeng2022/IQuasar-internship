    <measure>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Including by Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 to 30 days after the last dose (approximately 56 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs were defined as adverse events (AE) that occurred after dosing on Day 1 and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A treatment-related TEAE was defined as a TEAE with a relationship to study drug of possible, probable, or definite. TEAEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v4.03) based on: Grade 1: Mild, Grade 2: Moderate, Grade 3: Severe, Grade 4: Life-threatening, Grade 5: Death related to AE.</description>

    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue scale is a 13 item Likert scaled instrument where the subject was presented with 13 statements and asked to indicate their response as it applied to the past 7 days. The 5 possible responses were 'Not at all' (0), 'A little bit (1), 'Somewhat' (2), 'Quite a bit' (3) and 'Very much' (4). With 13 statements the total score had a range of 0 to 52. Higher score corresponds to a higher quality of life (QoL).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Linear Analog Scale Assessment (LASA) Score for QoL</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 365</time_frame>
    <description>The LASA consists of 3 items, where the respondents were asked to rate their perceived level of functioning. Specific domains included activity level, ability to carry out daily activities, and an item for overall QoL. Their level of functioning was reported on a 0 to 100 scale with 0 indicates &quot;As low as could be&quot; and 100 indicates &quot;As high as could be&quot;. The combined score ranged from 0 to 300, with higher scores corresponding to a higher QoL.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This Phase 2a, open-label, multiple-dose study was conducted in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who had not received treatment with eculizumab (Soliris®) in the past, between 16 August 2018 and 22 October 2019.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Up to 20 subjects were planned to be enrolled; however, the sponsor decided to close recruitment after 4 subjects were enrolled based on the conclusion that sufficient data were collected to meet the study objectives.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Including by Severity</title>
        <description>TEAEs were defined as adverse events (AE) that occurred after dosing on Day 1 and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A treatment-related TEAE was defined as a TEAE with a relationship to study drug of possible, probable, or definite. TEAEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v4.03) based on: Grade 1: Mild, Grade 2: Moderate, Grade 3: Severe, Grade 4: Life-threatening, Grade 5: Death related to AE.</description>
