    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 16), Day 32, and Day 59</time_frame>
    <description>Total energy intake in kilojoules (kJ) were recorded in a food diary after ad libitum lunch on Days 16, 32, and 59. The ad libitum lunch was a standardised solid meal with food of known macronutrient content. Participants were advised to eat freely until they feel comfortably full and the meal duration was flexible according to participant's preference. During the meal, the quantity of food ingested was recorded by study site staff without participants' awareness that food consumption was recorded. Percent change in total energy intake from the ad libitum lunch is reported. Day 16 was considered as baseline for this outcome measure. The LOCF analysis was used for missing data imputation for Day 59.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change in Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) as Measured by Whole Room Indirect Calorimetry From Baseline to Day 58</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 15) and Day 58</time_frame>
    <description>A whole room calorimetry assessment was used to measure gaseous exchange while exercising and therefore indirect estimates of energy expenditure over a 24-hour period. For assessment, participants had to enter the whole room calorimeter for up to 36 hours and reside inside for this entire duration (include toilet visits). During the time in the calorimeter participants were asked to exercise on an exercise bike for 15-minute intervals at 4 times. During these sessions participants were asked to aim for a heart rate of 65% of maximum (defined as 220 beats per minute minus age) and complete the full 15-minute session. In addition, participants abstained from caffeinated drinks for at least 24 hours prior to measurements as caffeine may increase energy expenditure (EE) and dietary advice was given to ensure participants had a neutral energy balance prior to whole calorimetry assessments. Percent change in TEE is reported. Day 15 was considered as baseline for this outcome measure.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 17 through 28 days post last dose (approximately 14 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life threatening experience immediate risk of dying, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly. TEAEs are defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug. From Day 1 to Day 16 all participants in both treatment arms received placebo so that analysis of energy intake in participants who were randomised to MEDI0382 may be performed. Hence, TEAEs were not applicable for Day 1 to Day 16. The TEAEs were recorded and reported for double-blind treatment period ie, from Day 17.</description>

    <description>Number of participants with positive ADA to MEDI0382 are reported. Treatment-boosted ADA is defined as baseline ADA titer that was boosted to a 4-fold or higher level following drug administration. Treatment-emergent ADA is defined as the sum of treatment-induced ADA (post-baseline positive only) and treatment-boosted ADA. From Day 1 to Day 16 all participants in both treatment arms received placebo so that analysis of energy intake in participants who were randomised to MEDI0382 may be performed.

        <description>Total energy intake in kilojoules (kJ) were recorded in a food diary after ad libitum lunch on Days 16, 32, and 59. The ad libitum lunch was a standardised solid meal with food of known macronutrient content. Participants were advised to eat freely until they feel comfortably full and the meal duration was flexible according to participant's preference. During the meal, the quantity of food ingested was recorded by study site staff without participants' awareness that food consumption was recorded. Percent change in total energy intake from the ad libitum lunch is reported. Day 16 was considered as baseline for this outcome measure. The LOCF analysis was used for missing data imputation for Day 59.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) as Measured by Whole Room Indirect Calorimetry From Baseline to Day 58</title>
        <description>A whole room calorimetry assessment was used to measure gaseous exchange while exercising and therefore indirect estimates of energy expenditure over a 24-hour period. For assessment, participants had to enter the whole room calorimeter for up to 36 hours and reside inside for this entire duration (include toilet visits). During the time in the calorimeter participants were asked to exercise on an exercise bike for 15-minute intervals at 4 times. During these sessions participants were asked to aim for a heart rate of 65% of maximum (defined as 220 beats per minute minus age) and complete the full 15-minute session. In addition, participants abstained from caffeinated drinks for at least 24 hours prior to measurements as caffeine may increase energy expenditure (EE) and dietary advice was given to ensure participants had a neutral energy balance prior to whole calorimetry assessments. Percent change in TEE is reported. Day 15 was considered as baseline for this outcome measure.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life threatening experience immediate risk of dying, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly. TEAEs are defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug. From Day 1 to Day 16 all participants in both treatment arms received placebo so that analysis of energy intake in participants who were randomised to MEDI0382 may be performed. Hence, TEAEs were not applicable for Day 1 to Day 16. The TEAEs were recorded and reported for double-blind treatment period ie, from Day 17.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Vital Signs Reported as TEAEs</title>
          <description>Number of participants with abnormal vital signs reported as TEAEs are reported. Abnormal vital signs reported as TEAEs included any abnormal findings in body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate. From Day 1 to Day 16 all participants in both treatment arms received placebo so that analysis of energy intake in participants who were randomised to MEDI0382 may be performed. Hence, TEAEs were not applicable for Day 1 to Day 16. The TEAEs were recorded and reported for double-blind treatment period ie, from Day 17.</description>
