    <textblock>
      One factor that limits the effectiveness of adjuvant hormone therapy for breast cancer is&#xD;
      medication nonadherence. Adherence to long-term medication regimens requires valuation of&#xD;
      temporally distant outcomes. Thus, interventions that improve valuation of the future, a&#xD;
      phenomenon known as delay discounting, may improve medication adherence in breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment and improve survival. This study will investigate the acute efficacy of a&#xD;
      prospective thinking intervention (episodic future thinking) for reducing delay discounting&#xD;
      and improving valuation of future health in breast cancer patients. Patients will engage in&#xD;
      either episodic future thinking or a control condition during completion of delay discounting&#xD;
      tasks in which they choose between immediate and delayed outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women. The most common&#xD;
      pathological subtype is hormone receptor positive breast cancer, which accounts for&#xD;
      approximately 70% of all diagnoses. Adherence to adjuvant hormone therapy (HT), including&#xD;
      selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors, in the treatment of hormone&#xD;
      responsive breast cancer decreases risk of recurrence and increases overall survival among&#xD;
      women. Unfortunately, up to half of patients discontinue HT prematurely or administer HT less&#xD;
      frequently than prescribed, which increases risk of disease recurrence and associated&#xD;
      mortality. Understanding the mechanisms underlying nonadherence will allow for development of&#xD;
      targeted interventions to improve breast cancer survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A defining characteristic of adjuvant HT is that it provides no short-term benefits and,&#xD;
      instead, prevents disease recurrence only after years of sustained adherence. In contrast,&#xD;
      the benefits of discontinuing HT are relatively immediate (e.g., avoidance of adverse side&#xD;
      effects, such as hot flashes or arthralgia). Thus, adherence to HT requires one's behavior to&#xD;
      be guided by temporally distant outcomes, as bias toward immediate gratification narrows the&#xD;
      temporal window over which future costs and benefits can motivate behavior. Therefore,&#xD;
      treatment adherence may be understood through the behavioral economic process of delay&#xD;
      discounting (i.e. devaluation of delayed outcomes), which provides a measure of how&#xD;
      individuals value the future. Accumulating evidence shows that delay discounting is&#xD;
      associated with a wide variety of maladaptive health behaviors, including failure to seek&#xD;
      routine medical screening for cancer and other illnesses. However, no work has yet examined&#xD;
      associations between delay discounting and adherence to cancer treatment, generally, or&#xD;
      breast cancer treatment, specifically. This gap in knowledge represents a challenge to the&#xD;
      understanding of risk factors for cancer-related morbidity and mortality and may limit the&#xD;
      efficacy of breast cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the present study will investigate the acute efficacy of an episodic future&#xD;
      thinking (EFT) intervention for reducing discounting and improving valuation of future health&#xD;
      in breast cancer patients. EFT is a form of prospection that involves mental simulation of&#xD;
      events that might occur in one's future. To some extent, EFT is an innate human ability that&#xD;
      guides decision-making (e.g., simulating the experience of an upcoming job interview or&#xD;
      social event); however, populations who discount the future rapidly show deficits in this&#xD;
      ability, considering the future infrequently and demonstrating low-quality EFT content (e.g.,&#xD;
      fewer contextual and sensory details). Thus, EFT interventions are designed to remediate this&#xD;
      deficit and reduce bias toward immediate gratification by guiding individuals to both&#xD;
      generate high-quality EFT content and prompting them to engage in EFT frequently. Prior&#xD;
      laboratory-based research by the investigative team and others has shown that EFT both&#xD;
      reduces delay discounting and improves a wide range of maladaptive health behaviors and&#xD;
      outcomes contributing to the development of cancer and survival following diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment, including tobacco use and dietary and weight control. The present study seeks to&#xD;
      extend these findings by demonstrating that EFT improves laboratory-based measures of delay&#xD;
      discounting and valuation of future health in breast cancer patients. Demonstrating EFT's&#xD;
      acute efficacy in the laboratory would suggest that EFT may be adapted in future grant&#xD;
      proposals as a targeted, remotely delivered intervention to improve HT adherence and&#xD;
      subsequent breast cancer survival.&#xD;
