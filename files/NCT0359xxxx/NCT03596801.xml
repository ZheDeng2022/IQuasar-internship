    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the infectivity, safety, and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      single dose of recombinant, live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines (RSV&#xD;
      6120/∆NS1 or RSV 6120/F1/G2/∆NS1) in RSV-seropositive children 12 to 59 months of age and&#xD;
      RSV-seronegative infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the infectivity, safety, and immunogenicity of a single dose of&#xD;
      recombinant, live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines (RSV 6120/∆NS1 or RSV&#xD;
      6120/F1/G2/∆NS1) in RSV-seropositive children 12 to 59 months of age and RSV-seronegative&#xD;
      infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccines will be evaluated in a stepwise fashion beginning with RSV-seropositive children&#xD;
      (Group 1) and proceeding sequentially in RSV-seronegative infants and children (Group 2). In&#xD;
      each group, participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of RSV 6120/∆NS1,&#xD;
      RSV 6120/F1/G2/∆NS1, or placebo at Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in the study between April 1 and October 31, outside of the RSV&#xD;
      season. Group 1 participants will be followed for 28 days after inoculation, and Group 2&#xD;
      participants will remain on the study until they complete the post-RSV season visit between&#xD;
      April 1 and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. The expected duration of the&#xD;
      initial study is 28 days for Group 1 participants and between 6 and 13 months for Group 2&#xD;
      participants, depending upon time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits for all participants may include clinical assessments, blood collection, and&#xD;
      nasal washes. Additionally, participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by study&#xD;
      staff at various times during the study to monitor participants' health.&#xD;
