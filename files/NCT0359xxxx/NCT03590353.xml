    <textblock>
      Bradyarrhythmia is one of the common diseases. Also, bradyarrhythmia could result in syncope,&#xD;
      clinic convulsion, shock, sudden death and so on, which could influence people's life quality&#xD;
      severely. Artificial pacemaker is the only way that can cure bradyarrhythmia. However,&#xD;
      traditional right ventricular apical pacing, because its electric stimulation is mostly&#xD;
      different of the physiological one, could lead to ventricular thick inhomogeneously. At the&#xD;
      same time, traditional right ventricular apical pacing also could result in cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmia and fibrosis, dyssynchrony of the ventricles, which can increase the volume of&#xD;
      mitral regurgitation. Besides, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), which aims to cure&#xD;
      chronic heart failure, is also unsatisfactory. On the contrary, the electric stimulation of&#xD;
      his bundle pacing (HBP) is the same as the physiological one, which produces a relatively&#xD;
      normal electrical stimulation and synchrony in systolic velocities in ventricular. Thus, HBP&#xD;
      could produce a better haemodynamic effect, which is the hotspot in pace-making area&#xD;
      recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a comparison in patients' cardiac function, ECG, and&#xD;
      pacemakers' threshold value, time limit and so on among dual chamber pacemaker, and HBP.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to conduct a comparison in patients' cardiac function, ECG, and&#xD;
      pacemakers' threshold value, time limit and so on among dual chamber pacemaker, and HBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinic trial is about to conduct pacemaker implantation in 84 participants, which&#xD;
      distribute into dual chamber pacemaker, HBP 2 groups in proportion of 1:1 in random. All of&#xD;
      the participants are supposed to conduct ultrasonic cardiogram (UCG), ECG, BNP and pacemaker&#xD;
      programing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: conduct pacemaker implantation in 84 patients, which distribute into dual chamber&#xD;
      pacemaker, HBP 2 groups in proportion of 1:1 in random. Patients with The implanting progress&#xD;
      of dual chamber pacemaker: 1. Conducting venipuncture. Subclavian vein is our first choice.&#xD;
      Then investigator will set up two venous channels and implant two guiding wires into&#xD;
      postcava. 2.Putting 2 sheathing canals into heart along with guiding wires. 3.Locating the&#xD;
      sheathing canals, and putting electrodes into canals. 3.Adjusting the electrodes and&#xD;
      revolving them anticlockwise to lead them to right atrium and right ventricle respectively&#xD;
      under the X-ray. 4.Immobilizing electrodes. 5. Some ways to determine whether the electrode&#xD;
      is fixed or not: the head of the electrodes could beat rhythmically with atrium or ventricle&#xD;
      or by testing damage current. 6.Removing the canals and suturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implanting progress of HBP: 1. Conducting venipuncture. Subclavian vein is our first&#xD;
      choice. Then investigator will set up two venous channels and implant two guiding wires into&#xD;
      postcava. One of the guide wire is 120cm in length, 0.035 or 0.038 in diameter, which is&#xD;
      required to lead the C315 sheathing canal. 2.Putting C315 sheathing canal into heart along&#xD;
      with guiding wires. 3.Locating the C315 sheathing canal, and adjusting the head of C315&#xD;
      towards ideal pacing location. 3.Implanting the spiral electrodes and fixing them. Leading&#xD;
      the spiral electrode (type 3830 on Medtronic) to the side of his bundle along the C315 canal&#xD;
      under the X-ray. The other electrode is leaded to right atrium like dual chamber pacemaker&#xD;
      under the X-ray. 4.Revolving the 3830 electrode suitably to Immobilizing it in cardiac&#xD;
      muscle. If the electrode can get the his electric potential and produce his bundle pacing&#xD;
      successfully, investigator revolve the 3830 electrode and immobilize it. 5. Some ways to&#xD;
      determine whether the electrode is fixed or not: the head of the electrodes could beat&#xD;
      rhythmically with atrium or ventricle or by testing damage current. 6.Removing the canals and&#xD;
      suturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the participants are supposed to be tested ECG, UCG and some pacemaker programming on&#xD;
      pre-operation, 24 hours after operation, 1 month after operation, 3 months after operation, 6&#xD;
      months after operation, 9 months after operation and 1 year after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of relevant data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ECG: testing the amplitude and time limit of QRS, amplitude and dispersion of P wave, PR&#xD;
           duration, QRS duration and QT duration on the same ECG and cardiac cycle. All the data&#xD;
           is tested by two cardiologists respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Threshold value, sense and damage current of pacemaker. Two technologists of the&#xD;
           pacemaker detect the threshold value, sense and damage current of the pacemakers&#xD;
           respectively. Then all the data will be collected in average value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. UCG: testing the sizes of left atrium (LA), right atrium (RA), left ventricle (LV),&#xD;
           right ventricle (RV) before and after the operation. Besides, the ejection fraction (EF)&#xD;
           of LV and LA, and E peak, A peak and velocity time integral (VTI) of LA will be tested&#xD;
           during the examination. All of the examination will be completed by one cardiologist and&#xD;
           one physician of cardiac uhrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the incidence rate of postoperation complication, heart failure, and arrhythmia:&#xD;
           Cardiologist will contact and ask patients the quality of life by phone or face to face&#xD;
           in 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year. Meanwhile, patients should complete&#xD;
           UCG, and BNP testing during the follow-up visit and complete Holter in 6 months.&#xD;
