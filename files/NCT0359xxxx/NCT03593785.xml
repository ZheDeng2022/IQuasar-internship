  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD8233 has not been evaluated in clinical studies previously. This is a first-in-human (FiH)&#xD;
      study. This study will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD8233,&#xD;
      following subcutaneous (SC) administration of single ascending dose (SAD) of AZD8233. This&#xD;
      study will also investigate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of AZD8233 by investigating the effect&#xD;
      of AZD8233 on levels of cholesterol and related biomarkers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study will be conducted at a single study&#xD;
      center in United States of America. Up to 56 healthy male subjects with elevated LDL-C&#xD;
      levels, aged 18 to 60 years will be randomized into this study. This study will consist of 5&#xD;
      cohorts with 8 subjects in each. Depending on emerging data, 2 additional cohorts may be&#xD;
      added to test additional dose levels at the discretion of the sponsor, if the pre-defined&#xD;
      exposure limits and stopping criteria have not been reached at previous administered doses.&#xD;
      The study will comprise of 3 periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up period of 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive a single SC dose of AZD8233 and 2&#xD;
      subjects randomized to receive placebo. Single dose of AZD8233 SC injection (40 mg/mL) will&#xD;
      be administered in each cohort as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Dose 1 (starting dose) Cohort 2: Dose 2 (provisional dose) Cohort 3: Dose 3&#xD;
      (provisional dose) Cohort 4: Dose 4 (provisional dose) Cohort 5: Dose 5 (provisional dose)&#xD;
      Dosing for each ascending dose cohort will proceed with 2 subjects in a sentinel cohort, such&#xD;
      that 1 subject will be randomized to receive placebo and 1 subject will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive AZD8233.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment period, the sentinel and non-sentinel subjects will be resident at the&#xD;
      clinical unit from the day before IMP administration (Day -1) until at least 72 hours and 48&#xD;
      hours after IMP administration, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel will have 10 follow-up visits (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 weeks post-dose).&#xD;
      Non-sentinel subjects will have 11 follow-up visits (on Day 4 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,&#xD;
      14 and 16 weeks post-dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period (16 weeks) has been selected based on the predicted terminal half-life&#xD;
      of AZD8233 in man (predicted to be 2 to 3 weeks), to cover at least 5 half-lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following review of data from the study, the Safety Review Committee (SRC) may decide to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjust the window for sentinel dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjust the length of data collection prior to dose-escalation diction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prolong the length of the stay at the Clinical Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjust the timing and number of assessments and/or blood/urine samples for subsequent&#xD;
           cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjust the length of the Follow-up Period. Each subject will be involved in the study&#xD;
           for up to 20 weeks.&#xD;
