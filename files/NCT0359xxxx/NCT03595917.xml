    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called ABL001 taken in combination with dasatinib&#xD;
      (Sprycel®) and prednisone (a steroid) as a possible treatment for B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic&#xD;
      Leukemia that is BCR-ABL positive (BCR-ABL+ B-ALL) or Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in&#xD;
      lymphoid blast crisis. BCR-ABL+ B-ALL is also called Philadelphia chromosome positive Acute&#xD;
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Ph+ ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that 25-34 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no clinical data on the effects of ABL001 in combination with dasatinib&#xD;
      and prednisone among adults with Ph+ B-ALL or CML in lymphoid blast crisis. However, there is&#xD;
      data on the use of ABL001 in combination with dasatinib (without steroids) in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed Ph+ B-ALL and Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib (Sprycel®) is currently approved for the treatment in newly diagnosed adults with&#xD;
      Ph+ CML in chronic phase (CP), adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast&#xD;
      phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib, adults with&#xD;
      Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) with resistance or&#xD;
      intolerance to prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABL001 is a newly discovered compound. This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and&#xD;
      information from those experiments suggest that this drug may have beneficial effects in&#xD;
      people who have CML or Ph+ ALL, both of which are a certain type of cancer of the blood&#xD;
      cells. The reason for this study is to learn whether ABL001 is safe and can have possible&#xD;
      benefits for people with Ph+ ALL who are also being treated with dasatinib and prednisone,&#xD;
      two drugs which are commonly used to treat Ph+ ALL. All participants in this study will&#xD;
      receive all three drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisone and dasatinib are both FDA approved and standard of care for participants with&#xD;
      your disease. They are not considered investigational on this study. However, ABL001 is being&#xD;
      tested in combination with these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker testing will also be included in this study. Biomarkers are important biological&#xD;
      &quot;indicators&quot; of whether a drug is working which can be measured from bone marrow and blood&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, blood and bone marrow samples may be tested to try to learn more about the&#xD;
      cancer, and to understand how the drug may be working in cancer.&#xD;

                  normal in patients with known Gilbert's syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of ABL001 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception during dosing and for 30 days after study treatment. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allowable methods of birth control:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement&#xD;
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) orintrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug&#xD;
                  and for 30 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this&#xD;
                  period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to&#xD;
                  prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;

             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known ABL T315I mutation are excluded. ABL kinase mutation analysis is&#xD;
             not recommended for newly diagnosed patient. ABL kinase mutation analysis is&#xD;
             recommended for patients with relapsed disease and results should be reviewed prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment of ALL or CML with dasatinib or ABL001. Prior receipt of other TKIs&#xD;
             and chemotherapy for the treatment of ALL or CML is permitted.&#xD;

               -  H2 antagonists/proton-pump inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grapefruit products are not permitted while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
                  regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
                  http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such&#xD;
                  as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of&#xD;
                  the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the&#xD;
                  risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to&#xD;
                  be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
                  herbal product.&#xD;

                  (NYHA class 3 or 4), unstable angina pectoris, ongoing clinically significant&#xD;
                  cardiac arrhythmia uncontrolled by medication, and myocardial infarction or&#xD;
                  stroke within the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
                  requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Currently requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors,&#xD;
                  and/or hemodialysis (life-support).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorder unrelated to&#xD;
                  cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to comply with an oral regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or nursing at the time of screening. Pregnant women are excluded from&#xD;
             this study because ABL001 is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ABL001,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ABL001. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. Urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test must be performed within 14 days of Day 1 for women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential&#xD;
