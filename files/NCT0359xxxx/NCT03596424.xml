  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain after VATS surgery is significant and associated with moderate to high&#xD;
      post operative morphine requirements, which can cause opioid related side effects and delay&#xD;
      postoperative recovery. To reduce this requirement, multimodal analgesia with non opioid&#xD;
      medication such as dexmedetomidine and ketamine can be used. These drugs have demonstrated&#xD;
      significant opioid-sparing properties after various types of surgeries. However, very little&#xD;
      is known about their ability to do so in VATS surgery. Also, their relative opioid-sparing&#xD;
      properties have not been compared, and it is not known whether their combined use can lead to&#xD;
      an additional opioid-sparing effect. The primary goal of this study will be to determine the&#xD;
      impact of a combined intra operative infusion of ketamine and dexmedetomidine on&#xD;
      postoperative morphine requirements in patients undergoing elective VATS, compared to both&#xD;
      these drugs infused separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that this combined infusion will lead to a 30% further reduction in&#xD;
      morphine requirements, 24h after surgery, compared to both these drugs infused separately.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for pulmonary resection is associated with less tissue&#xD;
      trauma, less impairment in lung function, and reduced postoperative pain compared with&#xD;
      thoracotomy, although many patients continue to report significant acute postoperative pain.&#xD;
      If not well-controlled, postoperative thoracic pain can lead to splinting and inadequate&#xD;
      recovery of pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhancing the quality of postoperative analgesia while reducing intra and postoperative&#xD;
      opioid requirements is an important issue that has been one of the main focus of Enhanced&#xD;
      Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols. Indeed, the key factors that delay postoperative&#xD;
      recovery include parenteral opioids and bed rest and immobility secondary to postoperative&#xD;
      pain. While opioids are effective at treating even severe pain, their use is associated with&#xD;
      dose-related adverse effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, postoperative nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting, urinary retention, ileus, opioid-induced hyperalgesia and chronic postoperative&#xD;
      pain. More importantly, opioids depress host immunity and neuroendocrine function and may&#xD;
      negatively affect cancer recurrence and survival after lung cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, given the importance of good postoperative analgesia and the significance of&#xD;
      opioid-related adverse effects, the reduction of opioid requirements and postoperative pain&#xD;
      through multimodal analgesia is an important matter. Focusing on this goal, the ERAS&#xD;
      protocols have shown great efficacy in improving patient's care after colorectal surgery and&#xD;
      they are now being applied to pancreatic, ENT, bariatric, urologic and many more major&#xD;
      surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is probably only a matter of time before ERAS protocols are applied to VATS surgery;&#xD;
      however, the optimal way of providing postoperative analgesia after VATS has not yet been&#xD;
      determined, unlike colorectal surgery. Indeed, thoracic epidural analgesia, single-shot and&#xD;
      continuous paravertebral and intercostal nerve blocks and patient-controlled intravenous&#xD;
      analgesia have all been evaluated, and none of these has consistently emerged as being&#xD;
      superior to the others or to intravenous analgesia. Thoracic epidural analgesia provides&#xD;
      effective pain control for thoracotomy but its benefits following thoracoscopy are not&#xD;
      uniform. Furthermore, the risks of sympathectomy-induced hypotension and neurologic injury&#xD;
      from epidural hematoma may not be justified considering the lesser postoperative pain and&#xD;
      impairment in pulmonary function compared to thoracotomy. Continuous paravertebral blocks are&#xD;
      an effective alternative to epidural analgesia although their performance may be challenging&#xD;
      and time consuming, and catheters may be difficult to thread or get accidentally removed,&#xD;
      leading to block failure. Furthermore, as for epidural analgesia, paravertebral catheter&#xD;
      placement is contra-indicated in patients with impaired coagulation and/or infection.&#xD;
      Single-shot intercostal and paravertebral blocks are less invasive although their benefit is&#xD;
      restricted to the first twelve postoperative hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, none of these regional anesthesia techniques can treat the ipsilateral shoulder&#xD;
      pain that is often associated with VATS, and opioid analgesia might still be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous opioid patient-controlled analgesia combined to multimodal analgesia with&#xD;
      acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatoy drug (NSAID) is commonly used in many&#xD;
      institutions and has shown to provide adequate and effective postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
      However, significant acute postoperative pain and moderate to high opioid consumption are&#xD;
      still reported after VATS. There is definitely some place for improvement, which could come&#xD;
      from other non-opioid analgesic adjuncts such as ketamine and/or dexmedetomidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that has well-known analgesic properties due to its ability to&#xD;
      block NMDA receptors. An intraoperative bolus followed with a low-dose infusion reduces&#xD;
      postoperative opioid requirements by 30-40%, without causing significant side effects.&#xD;
      Similarly, dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting α2-agonist with sedating and analgesic&#xD;
      properties. When used intra-operatively, it significantly reduces hypnotics and opioids&#xD;
      requirements, decreases median pain scores and reduces postoperative morphine consumption by&#xD;
      approximately 30%. These systematic reviews seem to indicate a greater morphine-sparing&#xD;
      effect from ketamine compared to dexmedetomidine although this has not been evaluated&#xD;
      thoroughly. Indeed, only one study compared ketamine's morphine-sparing effects to that of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine, in patients undergoing spine surgery. Both infusions were started&#xD;
      postoperatively and provided significant morphine sparing effects compared to placebo.&#xD;
      Ketamine's morphine-sparing effect appeared greater than that of dexmedetomidine, although&#xD;
      this was not statistically significant, as this study was not powered for that outcome.&#xD;
      Hence, their morphine-sparing effect might be different but this difference is likely small.&#xD;
      Their impact on postoperative opioid requirement after VATS surgery has not been studied,&#xD;
      even though it could be highly beneficial, not only for the reduction of postoperative opioid&#xD;
      requirements but for the reduction of chronic postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another interesting reason for using these analgesic adjuvants for intra operative analgesia&#xD;
      is their ability to prevent chronic post operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More interesting would be to investigate whether their combined use leads to greater&#xD;
      morphine-sparing effect. Indeed, although their combination for paediatric procedural&#xD;
      sedation is well described, the impact of a combined dexmedetomidine-ketamine intraoperative&#xD;
      infusion on postoperative analgesia and opioid requirements has not been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcome and hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study will be to determine the impact of a combined intra operative&#xD;
      infusion of ketamine and dexmedetomidine on postoperative morphine requirements in patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective VATS, compared to both these drugs infused separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that this combined infusion will lead to a 30% further reduction in&#xD;
      morphine requirements, 24h after surgery, compared to both these drugs infused separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be to evaluate the impact of a combined dexmedetomidine-ketamine&#xD;
      infusion on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative pain scores at rest and after coughing at 24 and 48 h postoperatively;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cumulative morphine consumption 48 h after surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative fentanyl requirements, determined using the NoL index (see methodology&#xD;
           section, page);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to chest tube removal and time to hospital discharge;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients with persistent pain three months after surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of ketamine-induced psychomimetic side effects in the postoperative period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of intraoperative bradycardia &lt;50 beats/min compared to intraoperative&#xD;
           infusions of ketamine only and dexmedetomidine only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, randomized, double blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing elective VATS and receiving an opioid intravenous patient-controlled&#xD;
      analgesia (PCA) combined with acetaminophen and NSAID for postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Postoperative cumulative morphine consumption 24h after surgery in our&#xD;
      institution has been determined by reviewing the files of 50 patients who underwent VATS&#xD;
      surgery and received a PCA combined to acetaminophen and NSAID for postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
      These patients used an average (standard deviation (SD)) of 39.5 (17.3) mg of morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering an opioid-sparing effect of 30% from dexmedetomidine and ketamine alone, a mean&#xD;
      morphine consumption of 27.7(11) mg can be expected in the ketamine and dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 30% further reduction in opioid requirement from combining ketamine to dexmedetomidine will&#xD;
      be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a sample size of 37 patients per group would give us 80% power to detect such a&#xD;
      difference, alpha 0.05.&#xD;
