    <measure>Change in Motivation for PrEP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motivation to use PrEP will be measured with the Contemplation Ladder and the Readiness Ruler, which assess intention to use PrEP and the perceived importance of using PrEP. The Contemplation Ladder and the Readiness Ruler each have a total score range from 0 to 10. Higher scores on the Contemplation Ladder indicate higher levels of contemplation or consideration about PrEP use. Higher scores on the Readiness Ruler indicate higher perceived importance of starting PrEP.</description>

    <measure>Change in PrEP uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PrEP uptake will be verified by the participants' providers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knowledge of PrEP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge of PrEP will be measured using a PrEP fact sheet, with basic information about PrEP. The PrEP Fact Sheet has a total score range of 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating higher levels of PrEP knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Barriers for PrEP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived barriers to PrEP uptake/usage will be measured by an adapted version of the Barriers to Care Scale, in which participants are asked about factors that make it difficult to receive PrEP related services. The Barriers to Care scale has a total score range of 7 to 28, with higher scores indicating increased difficulty regarding barriers to PrEP uptake.</description>
