    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pralatrexate when given&#xD;
      together with pembrolizumab and how well they work in treating patients with peripheral&#xD;
      T-cell lymphomas that has come back after a period of improvement or has not responded to&#xD;
      treatment. Pralatrexate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Giving pembrolizumab and pralatrexate may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of a regimen combining pembrolizumab and pralatrexate&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the&#xD;
      combined pralatrexate and pembrolizumab regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate the overall response rate (ORR) according to the Lugano Classification in&#xD;
      patients treated with pembrolizumab plus pralatrexate at the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the complete response (CR) rate according to the Lugano Classification duration&#xD;
      of response (DOR), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients&#xD;
      treated with pembrolizumab plus pralatrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the ORR and CR rate according to the International Harmonization Project&#xD;
      response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate responses and disease progression according to the Lymphoma Response to&#xD;
      Immunomodulatory therapy Criteria (LYRIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore immunologic and genomic biomarkers of response to pembrolizumab plus pralatrexate&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pralatrexate followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pralatrexate intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes on days 1 and 8 and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, every 12&#xD;
      weeks for 1 year, and then every 18 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
