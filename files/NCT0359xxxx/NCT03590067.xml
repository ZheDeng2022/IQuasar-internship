    <textblock>
      In Egypt, the prevalence of end stage renal disease in pediatric population has never been&#xD;
      estimated on a national scale. The patients at end stage renal disease encounter oral and&#xD;
      dental problems that emphasize regular and careful screening . In Egypt, the prevalence of&#xD;
      oral findings is not studied so we conduct this study to study the oral findings among a&#xD;
      group of pediatric patients at end stage renal disease either on haemodialysis or after&#xD;
      kidney transplantation.&#xD;

      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be held at the center of Pediatric Nephrology and transplantation, El-&#xD;
           Mounira children's hospital (Abu El rish).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The data collected through the questionnaire will be obtained through an interview&#xD;
           between the investigator and the parent or the legal guardian that's based on WHO guide&#xD;
           for health surveys(WHO Oral health surveys, 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients undergoing dialysis, examination will be performed at the dialysis unit&#xD;
           during dialysis session (there is no waiting room for patients before dialysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients who received renal transplantation, examination will be performed at the&#xD;
           outpatient nephrology clinic during follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination will be performed for both oral (soft tissue) and dental (hard)&#xD;
           tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decayed-Missing-Filled Index ( DMF ) which was introduced by Klein, Palmer and Knutson&#xD;
           in 1938 and modified by WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The components are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      D component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Used to describe (Decayed teeth) which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carious tooth. Filled tooth with recurrent decay. Only the roots are left. Defect filling&#xD;
      with caries. Temporary filling. Filled tooth surface with other surface decayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Used to describe (Missing teeth due to caries) other cases should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Used to describe (Filled teeth due to caries). Teeth were considered filled without decay&#xD;
      when one or more permanent restorations were present and there was no secondary (recurrent)&#xD;
      caries or other area of the tooth with primary caries. A tooth with a crown placed because of&#xD;
      previous decay was recorded in this category. Teeth stored for reason other than dental&#xD;
      caries should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      deft / defs , which was introduced by Gruebbel in 1944&#xD;
&#xD;
      d- decayed tooth . e- decayed tooth indicated for extraction . f- filled tooth&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ The coding system for the Modified DDE Index has three items of information that will be&#xD;
      recorded for each tooth surface. (Clarkson and O'Mullane, 1989)&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the Type of Defect, codes 0-7, was recorded. Then the Sub-type of that defect was&#xD;
      noted, i.e., when a demarcated opacity was present, the Sub-type was either white/cream (code&#xD;
      1) or yellow/brown (code 2), or when a diffuse opacity was present, then six options were&#xD;
      possible. Finally, the extent of each defect was recorded. The new additional sub-type (code&#xD;
      3) termed &quot;diffuse confluent opacity&quot; is defined as a diffuse opacity in which any patchiness&#xD;
      has merged into a regular condensed chalky white area, and it could cover the entire surface&#xD;
      of a tooth or be confined to a localized area of the tooth surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral candidiasis assessment will be based on the Lehner scale (Cleverson et al., 2014)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In assessing the degree of gingival hyperplasia we will use the index of Angelopoulos&#xD;
           and Goaz, described by Prof. T. Djemileva. (Dencheva et al., 2011)&#xD;
