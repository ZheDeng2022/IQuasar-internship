      Primary Objective: To examine whether the consumption of preloads varying in protein quality&#xD;
      effect subsequent meal energy and macronutrient content&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To examine whether the consumption of preloads varying in protein&#xD;
      quality effect postprandial feelings of hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective food&#xD;
      consumption, and eating initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective: To examine whether the consumption of preloads varying in protein&#xD;
      quality effect postprandial cognitive performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose the following acute, randomized crossover study to compare 5,&#xD;
      isocaloric yogurt-based preloads containing 20, 30, or 40 g pea protein; 20 g whey protein;&#xD;
      and an isocaloric carbohydrate (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 3 consecutive days/pattern, the participants will consume the respective treatment, at&#xD;
      home, between 7-9 am, based on their habitual breakfast time. (These days are implemented to&#xD;
      allow for the acclimation to the respective preload. Using this approach, the participant&#xD;
      becomes familiar with the taste profile along with the practice of consuming a breakfast&#xD;
      'shake' so that the testing day more closely assimilates the habitual effects of the preload&#xD;
      on appetite, satiety, and food intake.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 4, the participants will report to the research facility 1 h prior to their habitual&#xD;
      breakfast time to complete each 4-h testing day. Upon arrival to the facility, each&#xD;
      participant will become familiarized with the testing day procedures. At time -15 min, a&#xD;
      baseline set of computerized appetite/satiety and cognitive function questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed. At time 0 min, the respective preload will be provided. Immediately following the&#xD;
      first swallow of the preload, the participants will be given a questionnaire assessing the&#xD;
      palatability. The participants will consume the preload within 10 min. Afterwards, the&#xD;
      participants will continue to complete the questionnaires every 30 min throughout the 4-h&#xD;
      postprandial period. In addition to these questionnaires, participants will complete a&#xD;
      cognitive function paradigm at -30 min, +90 min, and +180 minutes in order to assess memory,&#xD;
      executive function, attention, and reaction time. Throughout the day, the participants will&#xD;
      also indicate if/when they would like to eat again. Regardless of their meal timing request,&#xD;
      at 4-h post-breakfast, lunch will be provided. The participants will be given 30 min to&#xD;
      &quot;consume as much or as little as they wish until comfortably full.&quot; Following these&#xD;
      procedures, the participants will be allowed to leave the facility. There will be a 3-7 day&#xD;
      washout period between testing days.&#xD;

    <description>A questionnaire assessing perceived hunger will be completed at specific times throughout each of the the 4-h testing days. The questionnaire contains a 100 mm VAS incorporating a horizontal line rating scale for each response. The questions are worded as &quot;how strong is your feeling of&quot; with anchors of &quot;not all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot; The range is 0 mm (min hunger) and 100 is max (hunger). A summation (area under the curve) will be calculated.</description>
