    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of midostaurin in&#xD;
      combination with standard chemotherapy in pediatrics patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      FLT3-mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The study has two parts: Part 1 to define the&#xD;
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose, and Part 2 to evaluate safety and tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      midostaurin. Both parts will consist of 2 induction blocks, 3 consolidation blocks, 12 cycles&#xD;
      of post-consolidation consisting of continuous therapy with midostaurin, and a follow-up&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is an open label, multi center single arm study to evaluate twice daily oral&#xD;
      midostaurin with standard induction, consolidation chemotherapy with sequential midostaurin&#xD;
      therapy for 5 treatment blocks (2 induction blocks, 3 consolidation blocks, followed by&#xD;
      single agent midostaurin post consolidation therapy for 12 cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total maximum planned duration on treatment is 17 cycles (5 blocks and 12 cycles). A&#xD;
      block is defined as the time from start of study treatment to the time of hematopoietic&#xD;
      recovery, at the latest at Day (D) 42, or determination of persistent disease, whichever&#xD;
      occur first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both Part 1 and Part 2, patients will receive the first course of induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      according to local standard and duration is from 8 to 12 days. Upon FLT3 mutation&#xD;
      confirmation, patients will receive midostaurin for 14 days. After determination of remission&#xD;
      and hematopoietic recovery, patients will receive Block 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 2 FLADx treatment duration is D1 to D6, and midostaurin from D8 to D21. Patients&#xD;
           who achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of Block 2&#xD;
           will receive Block 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 3 consolidation HAM treatment duration is D1 to D4, followed by midostaurin D8 to&#xD;
           D21. Patients who achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day&#xD;
           of Block 3 will receive Block 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 4 HA3E treatment duration is D1 to D5 followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patients&#xD;
           who achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of Block 4&#xD;
           will receive Block 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 5 HiDAC treatment duration is D1 to D3 followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patients&#xD;
           in continuous remission with hematopoietic recovery will receive continuous post&#xD;
           consolidation therapy of midostaurin, during 12 cycles (28 days per cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1 of the study, patients in cohorts of 3 will receive sequential midostaurin&#xD;
      administered at 30mg/m2bid. If the 30mg/m2 bid is well tolerated as measured by the Dose&#xD;
      Limited Toxicity (DLT) rate during Bock 1, additional patients in cohort of 3 will be treated&#xD;
      with sequential midostaurin at 60mg/m2 bid. When the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is&#xD;
      confirmed, subsequent patients will be treated in Part 2 of the study at the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 2 HAM treatment duration is D1 to D4 and midostaurin from D8 to D21. Patienta who&#xD;
           achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of Block 2 will&#xD;
           receive Block 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 3 consolidation HA3E treatment duration is D1 to D5, followed by midostaurin D8 to&#xD;
           D21. Patients who achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day&#xD;
           of Block 3 will receive Block 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 4 HAM treatment duration is D1 to D4 followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patients&#xD;
           who achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of Block 4&#xD;
           will receive Block 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block 5 HiDAC treatment duration is D1 to D3 followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patient&#xD;
           in continuous remission with hematopoietic recovery will receive continuous post&#xD;
           consolidation therapy of midostaurin, during 12 cycles (28 days per cycle).&#xD;
