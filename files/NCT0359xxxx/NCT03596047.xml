      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of radial shock waves for the treatment of&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction [ED].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: Randomized, double-blind clinical trial. The study will include&#xD;
      patients of legal age with diagnosis of ED and score on the International Index of Erectile&#xD;
      Function [IIEF-EF] scale between 11 and 21 points, who voluntarily decide to participate and&#xD;
      sign the informed consent. Patients with bladder cancer, prostate cancer or active colon, ED&#xD;
      of psychological origin, any psychiatric disorder, spinal cord injury, clinical suspicion of&#xD;
      hypogonadism (score on the Aging Males' Symptoms scale greater than 36), infections or active&#xD;
      lesions of the penis or pubic area, ED secondary to treatment with medications&#xD;
      (antiandrogenic therapy, use of corticosteroids, anti-Parkinson's, antipsychotics), radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy or other radical pelvic surgery, history of pelvic radiotherapy, penile&#xD;
      implantation, or endocrine diseases that occur with ED (acromegaly, gigantism, Addison's&#xD;
      disease, hyperprolactinemia, androgenic deficiency), sickle cell anemia, and anticoagulated&#xD;
      patients will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1 (Standard treatment (oral sildenafil) + Radial wave therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 (Standard treatment (oral sildenafil) + Placebo therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be made of the Erection Hardness Score [EHS] and IIEF-EF scale scores, of&#xD;
      the use of medication and of the possible adverse events of the therapy, at the beginning and&#xD;
      end of the treatment, and one month after the therapies are finished.&#xD;

      Background: Radial shock waves are an effective therapy for the management of various&#xD;
      problems at the muscular and joint level, thanks to the effect it has on the activation of&#xD;
      microcirculation. The effect of these waves on patients with erectile dysfunction is&#xD;
      currently unknown; however, it is considered possible to help recovery in patients with&#xD;
      vascular origin dysfunction by increasing microcirculation blood flow in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of radial shock waves for the treatment of&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: Randomized, double-blind clinical trial. The study will include&#xD;
      patients of legal age with diagnosis of ED and score on the IIEF-EF scale between 11 and 21&#xD;
      points, who voluntarily decide to participate and sign the informed consent. Patients with&#xD;
      bladder cancer, prostate cancer or active colon, ED of psychological origin, any psychiatric&#xD;
      disorder, spinal cord injury, clinical suspicion of hypogonadism (AMS greater than 36),&#xD;
      infections or active lesions of the penis or pubic area, ED secondary to treatment with&#xD;
      medications (antiandrogenic therapy, use of corticosteroids, anti-Parkinson's,&#xD;
      antipsychotics), radical prostatectomy or other radical pelvic surgery, history of pelvic&#xD;
      radiotherapy, penile implantation, or endocrine diseases that occur with ED (acromegaly,&#xD;
      gigantism, Addison's disease, hyperprolactinemia, androgenic deficiency), sickle cell anemia,&#xD;
      and anticoagulated patients will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1 (Standard treatment (oral sildenafil) + Radial wave therapy): Sildenafil according&#xD;
           to the degree of patient involvement + 6 sessions of radial waves. A weekly session of&#xD;
           radial waves will be applied with the following parameters: 6000 pulses at 1.5-2.6 bar&#xD;
           (depending on patient tolerance), with a frequency of 17Hz, the frequency should&#xD;
           increase to 22HZ the first 500 impulses to create mild anesthesia in the area; in all&#xD;
           radial wave sessions, 4000 impulses will be distributed in the body of the penis in&#xD;
           scanning technique and 2000 impulses in the perineal area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 (Standard treatment (oral sildenafil) + Placebo therapy): Sildenafil according to&#xD;
           the patient's degree of affectation + 6 sessions of placebo therapy. There will be a&#xD;
           weekly session of placebo wave therapy, using the respective device to prevent the&#xD;
           patient from receiving the radial wave. The same parameters of the &quot;real&quot; therapy will&#xD;
           be used: 6000 pulses at 2.6 bar, with a frequency of 17 Hz; in all radial wave sessions,&#xD;
           4000 impulses will be distributed in the body of the penis in scanning technique and&#xD;
           2000 impulses in the perineal area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be made of the EHS and IIEF-EF scale scores, of the use of medication and&#xD;
      of the possible adverse events of the therapy, at the beginning and end of the treatment, and&#xD;
      one month after the therapies are finished.&#xD;
