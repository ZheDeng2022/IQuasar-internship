  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      β-thalassemia is a worldwide distributed monogenic red cell disorder, characterized by the&#xD;
      absence or reduced β-globin chain synthesis (De Franceschi et al.,2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 7% of the global population is carrier of such disorders, and 300,000-400,000&#xD;
      babies with severe forms of these diseases are born each year (Weatherall, 2005; Modell et&#xD;
      al., 2008). Severe hereditary hemoglobin disorders of red cells occur at highest frequency in&#xD;
      tropical regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemoglobinopathies constitute the single most common monogenic defect worldwide, and among&#xD;
      hemoglobin disorders, the thalassemias prominently contribute to (Weatherall et al., 2001; de&#xD;
      Franceschi et al., 2011). β-thalassemias (β-thal) are characterized by the presence of&#xD;
      mutations on beta-globin gene resulting in the absence or reduced synthesis of β-globin&#xD;
      chains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose metabolism disturbances, among other endocrinopathies, are a common feature of β&#xD;
      -thalassaemia . Pancreatic iron overload and diabetes mellitus (DM) are common in thalassemia&#xD;
      major patients. However, the relationship between iron stores and glucose disturbances is not&#xD;
      well defined (Leila et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of DM in β -thalassemia is suggested to be due to the effect of iron overload on&#xD;
      the different tissues controlling the carbohydrate homeostatic mechanisms; including the&#xD;
      pancreas and liver. However, controversy about the etiology of this glycemic abnormality&#xD;
      still exists (Weinberg 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both insulin deficiency and insulin resistance are reported in patients with β -thalassemia.&#xD;
      Suggested risk factors for development of DM in patients with β -thalassemia include old age,&#xD;
      increased amount of blood transfusion, high serum ferritin level, family history of DM,&#xD;
      hepatic impairment, and genetic modifiers of iron overload( Cario et al., 2003;Suvarna , et&#xD;
      al., 2006; Weinberg 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with DM had significantly impaired insulin sensitivity and insulin release (Bergman&#xD;
      et al., 2010). Traditionally, insulin deficiency and long-standing insulin resistance (De&#xD;
      Sanctis et al, 1988; Pappas et al, 1996) that result from direct toxic damage by iron to&#xD;
      pancreatic-beta cells are thought to be the main underlying mechanisms leading from mild&#xD;
      glucose intolerance to overt diabetes. As these endocrine complications result from chronic&#xD;
      iron overload, they are much more common in patients whose chelation therapy is insufficient&#xD;
      ( Farmaki et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Greater chelation options have improved survival (Chouliaras et al., 2011); however many&#xD;
      patients still carry dangerous extrahepatic iron burdens. As patients live longer, cumulative&#xD;
      iron-mediated toxicity compounded by natural aging makes diabetes a significant clinical&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatic iron loading in thalassemia major patients begins in early childhood, and the&#xD;
      overall prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) ranges from 6.4% to 14.1% on cross-sectional&#xD;
      studies (Borgna-Pignatti et al., 2004; Vogiatzi et al., 2009). Both insulin resistance and&#xD;
      decreased insulin secretion contribute to diabetes in thalassemia major patients.&#xD;
      (Angelopoulos et al., 2006; Cario et al., 2003; Hafez, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes prevalence in thalassemia has been shown to correlate with serum ferritin&#xD;
      (Jaruratanasirikul et al., 2008; Siklar et al., 2008 ), with hepatitis C infection (Chern ,&#xD;
      2001; Sougleri et al., 2001;Mowla et al., 2004) and with pancreatic and cardiac iron (Au et&#xD;
      al., 2007; Matter et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin pump therapy in the form of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) was&#xD;
      introduced in the 1970s and turned out to ensure better metabolic control of diabetes&#xD;
      compared to traditional insulin therapy approaches. It is currently considered to be the&#xD;
      optimal method of insulin administration, since it imitates the pancreatic activity in the&#xD;
      best possible way, ensures precise dosage, and at the same time offers a high level of ease&#xD;
      and comfort (Bruttomesso D et al., 2009; Danne T et al., 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to the traditional methods of insulin therapy by means of multiple daily insulin&#xD;
      injections (MDI), CSII can significantly decrease glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), reduce 24-hour&#xD;
      glucose variability, decrease incidence of severe hypoglycemia, and eliminate dawn&#xD;
      phenomenon. Moreover, the use of CSII is associated with improved quality of life and precise&#xD;
      insulin administration with respect to physical effort and diet(Jeitler K et al., 2008;&#xD;
      Phillip M et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A long-term effect of CSII on the control of diabetes mellitus in thalassemics needs to be&#xD;
      explained (Hammond P, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the pattern of glucose homeostasis in patients with B thalassemia .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect early impairment in glucose metabolism and prediabetic state in B thalassemia&#xD;
           patients using continuous glucose monitoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the prevalence and type of DM in B thalassemia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A comparative study of standard insulin therapy compared to insulin pump therapy in&#xD;
           thalassemic diabetic patients will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include screening of 200 children and adolescents who are regularly attending&#xD;
      the Hematology Oncology Clinic and fulfilling the inclusion criteria for abnormalities of&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis. ADA criteria for diagnosing diabetes mellitus &amp; impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance (American Diabetes Association, 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diabetes symptoms (ie polyuria, polydipsia and unexplained weight loss) plus&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a random venous plasma glucose concentration ≥126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a fasting plasma glucose concentration ≥126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) (whole blood &gt;&#xD;
                6.1mmol/l) or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  two hour plasma glucose concentration ≥200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l). two hours after 75g&#xD;
                anhydrous glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. With no symptoms diagnosis should not be based on a single glucose determination but&#xD;
           requires confirmatory plasma venous determination. At least one additional glucose test&#xD;
           result on another day with a value in the diabetic range is essential, either fasting,&#xD;
           from a random sample or from the two hour post glucose load. If the fasting or random&#xD;
           values are not diagnostic the two hour value should be used&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is a stage of impaired glucose regulation (Fasting&#xD;
                plasma glucose &lt; 7.0 mmol/ and OGTT two hour value &gt; 7.8mmol/l but &lt; 11.1 mmol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Impaired Fasting Glycaemia (IFG) has been introduced to classify individuals who&#xD;
                have fasting glucose values above the normal range but below those diagnostic of&#xD;
                diabetes. (Fasting plasma glucose &gt; 6.1 mmol/l but &lt; 7.0 mmol/l). American Diabetes&#xD;
                Patients proved to be diabetics according to the ADA criteria will be subjected to&#xD;
                therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed consent will be obtained from each patient or his legal guardian before&#xD;
      enrollement in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A- Screening and recruitment stage&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Detailed medical history taking with special stress on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographic data (name, age, sex, consanguinity and socioeconomic class).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age of diagnosis of thalassemia and disease duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transfusion history:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Age of first transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Amount of blood in each transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Type of transfused PRBCs (filtered, washed, untreated).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Frequency of transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Calculation of transfusion index (packed red cell per body weight in Kg per&#xD;
                     year).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Iron chelation therapy:Type, dose, duration, complications and compliance to&#xD;
                chelation therapy. Compliance will be assessed by reviewing patient self-report of&#xD;
                dose-taking and the appropriate number of doses taken during each day will be&#xD;
                checked by prescription refills and pill count (Claxton et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of spleenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of viral hepatitis ( hepatitis B and C virus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Thorough clinical examination laying stress on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of anthropometric measures including weight in kilograms (Kg) and height&#xD;
                in centimeters (cm) and plotting them on the age- and sex-standard percentiles&#xD;
                according to Egyptian growth charts (Diabetic endocrine and metabolic pediatric&#xD;
                unit, 2003). Body mass index (BMI) will be measured as kg/m2. (Guldiken et al.,&#xD;
                2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measurement of vital data including heart rate and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  BMI: simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify&#xD;
                underweight, overweight and obesity. It is calculated as the weight in kilograms&#xD;
                divided by the square of the height in meters( Kg/m2). (WHO, 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete examination including cardiac, chest, abdominal and neurological&#xD;
                examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of sexual maturity using Tanner score (Vichinsky et al., 2008):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Delayed puberty and hypogonadism: Defined as absence of sexual characteristics in girls&#xD;
           above the age of 13 years and a testicular volume &lt; 4ml in boys above the age of 14&#xD;
           years. Arrested puberty is the non-progression of puberty for a period of 12 months.&#xD;
           (Arya et al., 2005)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Laboratory investigations including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete blood picture (CBC): using Sysmex XT-1800i (Sysmex, Japan) with&#xD;
                examination of Leishman-stained smears for red blood cells (RBC) morphology and&#xD;
                differential white blood cell (WBC) count.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Peripheral blood staining: by brilliant cresyl blue and examination of a smear for&#xD;
                reticulocytic count&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Qualitative and quantitative hemoglobin analysis: at time of diagnosis collected&#xD;
                from follow up sheets of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hb electrophoresis to ensure diagnosis of B thalassemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measurement of serum ferritin(Soliman AT, et al.; 2013).&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Measurement of random and fasting plasma glucose level(American Diabetes&#xD;
                Association, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oral glucose tolerance test (Thennadil SN et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study will be done on 15 patients with abnormal glucose tolerance which will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A-Continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) : A glucometer will be given to each patient&#xD;
      and will be asked to measure blood glucose before meals and snacks and record the valus in&#xD;
      the CGMS for better calibration (Khammar A et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-Therapeutic intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thalassemia patients who proved to have diabetes according to the ADA criteria will be&#xD;
      subjected to&#xD;
