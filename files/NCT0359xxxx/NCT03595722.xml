  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can be used&#xD;
      safely to treat rectal and pelvic cancer. The study consists of two trials exploring the use&#xD;
      of HIFU in rectal and pelvic cancer to establish the safety and potential efficacy of HIFU in&#xD;
      this instance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first trial is a feasibility study looking at patients with early rectal cancer. We aim&#xD;
      to recruit thirty patients with early rectal cancer who are due to undergo an operation to&#xD;
      remove their cancer. After recruiting and consenting them for the trial, we will treat their&#xD;
      rectal cancer with HIFU. Approximately one week after treatment they will undergo their&#xD;
      normal cancer operation. This will allow us to demonstrate the safety of HIFU as a treatment&#xD;
      for rectal cancer and evaluate the changes in rectal and surrounding tissue under the&#xD;
      microscope after the cancer is treated with HIFU. In addition, we will monitor patients for&#xD;
      any complications and the impact this treatment has on their quality of life. We will monitor&#xD;
      the response of various markers for cancer with blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second trial aims to evaluate the treatment of a cohort of patients with inoperable&#xD;
      rectal cancer. We aim to recruit thirty patients with either inoperable pelvic cancers -&#xD;
      rectal, cervical or endometrial, or cancers that have returned after previous operations. We&#xD;
      will offer these patients treatment of their cancer using HIFU. We will monitor the symptoms&#xD;
      they experience and impact on their quality of life both before and at multiple time points&#xD;
      after the treatment with HIFU. We will compare MRI scans before and after treatment to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect HIFU has in reducing the size of the cancer. We hope to show that using&#xD;
      HIFU in this group of patients can be both effective and lead to an improvement in both their&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can be safely&#xD;
      and effectively used to treat rectal and advanced pelvic cancers. This study is composed of&#xD;
      two feasibility trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of use in HIFU in early rectal&#xD;
      cancer and late pelvic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first trial will involve a cohort of 30 patients with early rectal cancer. They will have&#xD;
      full work up as per normal care including history, examination, bloods, endoscopy and imaging&#xD;
      (CT and MRI scan). Once eligibility has been confirmed, patients will be approached and&#xD;
      offered to be enrolled in the study. Once successfully recruited, they will be admitted&#xD;
      transrectal HIFU using the Sonatherm (Sonacare Medical, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA)&#xD;
      device under general anaesthetic with monitoring for toxicity. Baseline quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires will be filled in by patients prior to HIFU to establish their symptoms prior&#xD;
      to treatment. Patients will be admitted for treatment and observed overnight. They will then&#xD;
      complete the same questionnaires at two and seven days post HIFU. Blood tests will be taken&#xD;
      one week after HIFU administration to monitor levels of tumour markers and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers. One week after their HIFU treatment, the patients will undergo their total&#xD;
      mesorectal excision (TME) to remove their cancer as per normal treatment protocol. The&#xD;
      specimen will be examined to evaluate the histological changes in the tumour and surrounding&#xD;
      tissues created by the HIFU. We will be able to quantify the effect of HIFU on the rectal&#xD;
      cancer and evaluate for possible thermal damage to surrounding tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential patients will be identified during multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings which&#xD;
      include surgeons, radiologists, oncologists and cancer nurse specialists. The team will&#xD;
      confirm eligibility and suitability prior to patient recruitment to ensure there is no&#xD;
      negative effect on overall patient care due to their involvement in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sonatherm™ systems used ultrasound visualisation to monitor and regulate the HIFU&#xD;
      delivery. This allows tissue response to HIFU to be monitored via echogenic changes seen&#xD;
      during coagulative necrosis. The strong correlation between echogenic changes and tissue&#xD;
      destruction will allow us to alter the power settings if needed to achieve suitable ablation&#xD;
      of the target area. A video record of the ultrasound and ablation will be reviewed by the&#xD;
      team to evaluate the quality of the ablation performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will run for approximately 1 month for each patient: from recruitment into the&#xD;
      study to the resection of the cancer. The HIFU dose will cover the entire tumour, the rectal&#xD;
      wall, and a 5 mm margin of tissue surrounding the tumour. It is anticipated that all tissue&#xD;
      exposed to HIFU, including the rectal wall, will be part of the coagulative necrosis.&#xD;
      Antibiotic prophylaxis will be given for five days to reduce the risk of abscess formation&#xD;
      and sepsis. Patients will be followed up on day 2 post HIFU and the day of their TME to&#xD;
      assess their response to treatment and any complications that develop. Post resection the&#xD;
      patients will be followed up as per the normal local guidelines following surgical excision&#xD;
      of rectal cancer. They will have their quality of life post resection assessed by completing&#xD;
      questionnaires 30 days post resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study will involve a cohort of 30 patients with either locally&#xD;
      advanced pelvic cancer (rectal, endometrial or cervical) or locally recurrent disease. These&#xD;
      patients will be unsuitable for operative intervention or any further chemo-radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. They will have full work up as per normal care including history, examination,&#xD;
      bloods, endoscopy and imaging (CT and MRI scan). Once eligibility has been confirmed,&#xD;
      patients will be approached and offered to be enrolled in the study. Once successfully&#xD;
      recruited, they will be admitted intracavity HIFU using the Sonatherm™ device under general&#xD;
      anaesthetic with monitoring for toxicity. Baseline quality of life questionnaires will be&#xD;
      filled in by patients prior to HIFU to establish their symptoms prior to treatment. Patients&#xD;
      will be admitted for treatment with HIFU and observed overnight to monitor for any toxicity&#xD;
      related to treatment with HIFU. Antibiotic prophylaxis will be given for five days to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of abscess formation and sepsis. Patients will be followed up closely to monitor for&#xD;
      toxicity and any changes in symptom control/quality of life. Patients will complete the same&#xD;
      pre-operative questionnaires at multiple time-points post HIFU treatment. Questionnaires will&#xD;
      be completed at seven, thirty, sixty and ninety days post HIFU, and three-monthly thereafter.&#xD;
      This will enable us to accurately chart the change in quality of life and symptom control&#xD;
      created by the HIFU treatment. Post-treatment imaging will be performed at between 3-4 weeks,&#xD;
      as within this time frame the ablative effect (a necrotic area) as seen in prostate cancer&#xD;
      treated by HIFU. This will allow comparison with pre-operative imaging to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of HIFU. A video record of the ultrasound and ablation will be reviewed by the team to&#xD;
      evaluate the quality of the ablation performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be reviewed at regular intervals after treatment with HIFU to monitor the&#xD;
      effect of HIFU on quality of life. Regular blood tests will be taken to monitor tumour&#xD;
      markers and markers of systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential patients will be identified during MDT meetings which include surgeons,&#xD;
      radiologists, gynaecologists, oncologists and cancer nurse specialists. The team will confirm&#xD;
      eligibility and suitability prior to patient recruitment. If felt appropriate by the MDT,&#xD;
      patients may be offered a second application of HIFU as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will run in two stages: the end of the first phase (for regulatory requirements) is&#xD;
      defined as 30 days from the date that the last patient has completed trial therapy. The&#xD;
      non-interventional follow-up stage will then commence in which patients are followed up for a&#xD;
      minimum of 6 months or death.&#xD;
