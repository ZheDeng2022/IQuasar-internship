    <textblock>
      Ultra-high frequency ultrasound may be useful in the field of vascular research, given its&#xD;
      ability to accurately characterize arterial wall thickness and ultrastructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), it may help identify the &quot;triple signal&quot;&#xD;
      pattern in carotid arterial wall, while in Vascular Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (V-EDS) it may&#xD;
      help to accurately measure carotid intima-media thickness, which may be extremely small and&#xD;
      difficult to measure with standard equipment. Furthermore, novel features might be identified&#xD;
      in small-to-medium sized arteries by ultra-high frequency ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to demonstrate that ultra-high frequency ultrasound has the&#xD;
      same accuracy of standard ultrasound for the identification of &quot;triple signal&quot; in the carotid&#xD;
      artery of FMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims of this study are to evaluate carotid, radial and digital intima-media&#xD;
      thickness, wall ultrastructure and distensibility in 60 patients with FMD and in 30 patients&#xD;
      with V-EDS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is an idiopathic, systemic, non-atherosclerotic,&#xD;
      non-inflammatory vascular disease leading to stenosis, aneurysms, dissections and occlusion&#xD;
      of small and medium-sized arteries, with possible life-threatening complications. Recent data&#xD;
      suggest that FMD is not so rare as previously thought, showing a prevalence up to 4%, but it&#xD;
      is mostly undiagnosed. FMD mainly involves renal and internal carotid arteries, thus its&#xD;
      clinical manifestations include hypertension and stroke. However, increasing evidence from&#xD;
      large registries point out that FMD is a systemic disease, with a very high prevalence of&#xD;
      multiple districts involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (V-EDS) is a rare vascular disease (prevalence 1/150000), due&#xD;
      to heterozygous mutations of COL3A1 gene, coding for collagen tipe III, with dominant&#xD;
      autosomic transmission. V-EDS patients are predisposed to spontaneous ruptures in the&#xD;
      vascular, intestinal districts and in many others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In FMD, vascular subclinical alterations may be observed in usually usually not affected&#xD;
      arterial districts, such as the common carotid artery and the radial artery. In a previous&#xD;
      experience, Boutouyrie and colleagues discovered a peculiar phenotype in the common carotid&#xD;
      artery of individuals with renal FMD. This pattern, known as &quot;triple signal&quot;, is&#xD;
      characterized by a supernumerary acoustic interface, located between the blood-intima and the&#xD;
      media- adventitia interfaces and detected by either the B-mode or the radiofrequency&#xD;
      equipment, which may correspond to medial hyperplasia. The &quot;triple signal&quot; pattern, though&#xD;
      present in a small proportion of hypertensive patients, was able to accurately discriminate&#xD;
      FMD individuals and in particular to identify familiar cases. Furthermore, c-IMT was higher&#xD;
      in FMD, while diameter and elasticity were superimposable to hypertensive control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the study of non-affected and easily accessible medium and small-sized&#xD;
      arteries, such as the radial artery, with similar diameter and histology of affected arteries&#xD;
      such as the renal, cerebral and coronary arteries, might be even more informative in FMD.&#xD;
      This has been recently made possible by the commercial availability of ultra-high frequency&#xD;
      ultrasound for human use. The machine is equipped with transducers up to 70 MHz and allows&#xD;
      imaging superficial tissues with a spatial resolution up to 30 μm (axial) and 65 μm&#xD;
      (lateral). Preliminary results by using ultrahigh frequency ultrasound, confirmed an&#xD;
      increased radial wall thickness in FMD patients in comparison to age-, sex- and BP-matched&#xD;
      controls. Most strikingly, wall ultrastructure was extensively subverted in FMD patients: the&#xD;
      two echogenic layers corresponding to the elastic laminae presented a lower echogenicity and&#xD;
      a greater inhomogeneity as compared to healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, recruiting 60 individuals with FMD and 30&#xD;
      individuals with V-EDS. Patients will be recruited by the Clinical Pharmacology Unit of the&#xD;
      Hopital Europeen George Pompidou, during their routine visit for the ultrasound evaluation of&#xD;
      the carotid arteries by echotracking. In that occasion, supplementary images of carotid,&#xD;
      radial and digital arteries will be acquired by ultrahigh frequency ultrasound (VevoMD;&#xD;
      Fujifilm-Visualsonics: Toronto, Canada).&#xD;
