  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared to other racial groups, African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality rates. Although colonoscopies can prevent CRC, nearly one third of&#xD;
      African Americans have not received a screening colonoscopy within the recommended time frame&#xD;
      (one colonoscopy per ten years). It is critical to increase African Americans' screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy rates in order to reduce racial inequities in CRC morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Previous research suggests that a motivational interviewing based intervention may help&#xD;
      improve screening colonoscopy uptake. This study will conduct a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      examining the efficacy of a motivational interviewing informed tablet app, called e-Motivate,&#xD;
      to improve African Americans' screening colonoscopy uptake. Participants will be African&#xD;
      Americans who receive a referral for a screening colonoscopy. Participants (N=200) will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) usual care group (N=100); or (2) e-Motivate app&#xD;
      group (N=100). Participants in the usual care group will receive standard clinical care which&#xD;
      includes patient navigation (e.g., scheduling, reminder calls). Participants in the&#xD;
      e-Motivate group will complete the e-Motivate app in the clinic immediately after they&#xD;
      receive a referral for the screening colonoscopy. The participants in the e-Motivate app&#xD;
      group will also receive usual care. Six months following the initial referral, participants'&#xD;
      medical charts will be reviewed to determine whether the participants completed the&#xD;
      recommended screening colonoscopy. Secondary outcomes (e.g., bowel prep quality, number of&#xD;
      cancellations) will also be analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC), a largely preventable disease, remains the third leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death in the United States. Compared to other racial groups, African Americans have&#xD;
      the highest CRC morbidity and mortality rates. Recent reports have found that African&#xD;
      Americans' CRC incidence rates are 20% higher and mortality rates are 45% higher than those&#xD;
      of whites. Given these disparities, it is critical to increase African Americans'&#xD;
      participation in CRC screenings. Of the recommended CRC screening mechanisms, a colonoscopy&#xD;
      is often the preferred method because it allows for both the detection and removal of&#xD;
      precancerous and cancerous polyps. Although screening colonoscopies can detect and prevent&#xD;
      CRC, more than 1/3 of African Americans have not received a screening colonoscopy within the&#xD;
      recommended time frame (one screening colonoscopy per ten years). It is critical to increase&#xD;
      African Americans' screening colonoscopy rates in order to reduce racial inequities in CRC&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A motivational interviewing (MI) intervention can help improve African Americans' screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy uptake. MI is a brief patient-centered intervention that increases perceived&#xD;
      competence, autonomy, and relatedness in order to promote behavioral change. Extensive&#xD;
      research supports the efficacy of MI to promote preventive health screening uptake, including&#xD;
      increasing screening colonoscopy rates, and MI has proven efficacious with African Americans&#xD;
      across a wide range of diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, MI is delivered live, where individuals meet with a professional for a&#xD;
      one-on-one intervention. Although efficacious, live-MI is not without limitations. Of&#xD;
      greatest concern, live-MI requires both staffing and economic resources, limiting its ability&#xD;
      to be widely disseminated. A digital intervention, such a tablet app, may overcome these&#xD;
      limitations. By eliminating the need for an on-site professional, a tablet app is a high&#xD;
      reach, low cost intervention with the potential to have a significant public health impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) that examines&#xD;
      the efficacy of a tablet app, called e-Motivate, to improve screening colonoscopy rates in&#xD;
      African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app first underwent iterative field-testing and subsequent modifications to ensure that&#xD;
      the app had high usability and acceptability ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final version of the app, called e-Motivate, will be tested in a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial. African American patients referred for a screening colonoscopy will be recruited to&#xD;
      the RCT. Participants (N=200) will be randomly assigned to a usual care group (N=100) or an&#xD;
      e-Motivate group (N=100). Participants in the usual care group will receive standard patient&#xD;
      navigation (e.g., scheduling, reminder calls). Participants in the e-Motivate group will&#xD;
      receive standard clinical care and will also complete the e-Motivate app. The app will be a&#xD;
      20-minute tablet app that will include motivational interviewing informed exercises and&#xD;
      education. The app will be completed in the clinic immediately after a participant receives a&#xD;
      referral for a screening colonoscopy. Six months following the initial referral, participants&#xD;
      medical charts will be reviewed to determine whether they completed the recommended screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy. It is hypothesized that participants in the e-Motivate group will be more likely&#xD;
      to complete the recommended screening colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also explore whether the e-Motivate app can improve secondary outcomes (e.g.,&#xD;
      bowel prep quality, number of cancellations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential mediators, informed by Self Determination Theory, will be evaluated. Potential&#xD;
      moderators (e.g., age, education, family history of CRC) will be explored.&#xD;

          <title>E-Motivate Group</title>
          <description>Participants completed a 20-minute tablet app, called e-Motivate and received usual care. In particular, participants in the e-motivate group completed a 20-minute, motivational interviewing informed tablet app in the clinic after they received a physician referral for a screening colonoscopy. The tablet app consisted of educational videos, interactive exercises (e.g., decisional balance), and personalized feedback (e.g., print summary).</description>

          <title>Usual Care Group</title>
          <description>Participants in the usual care group received standard clinical care for patients referred for a screening colonoscopy. In particular, they received patient navigation (e.g., assistance scheduling the screening colonoscopy appointment, making reminder calls, and providing print materials regarding the bowel prep instructions).</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>There was notable missing data in the &quot;bowel prep quality&quot; outcome. Not all medical records included a bowel prep quality score. The control condition had 15 missing bowel prep quality ratings and the app condition had 7 missing bowel prep quality ratings. Furthermore, there were inconsistencies in the way in which bowel prep quality was reported (e.g., adequate/inadequate vs. poor, fair, good, excellent).</limitations_and_caveats>
