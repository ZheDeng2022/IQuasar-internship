  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity has shown beneficial effects for cognitive and brain health, suggesting it&#xD;
      may provide a highly scalable intervention to improve academic achievement. This project is&#xD;
      part of a large-scale randomised controlled trial called Fit to Study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID:&#xD;
      NCT03286725). The main Fit to Study trial aims to test the effect of a school-based physical&#xD;
      activity intervention on academic performance (as well as cognition and physical measures)&#xD;
      across Year 8 pupils in 100 secondary schools. The current study - the Fit to Study - Brain&#xD;
      imaging sub-study - will target a sub-sample of participants in the large-scale trial, in&#xD;
      order to test pre- to post intervention changes in hippocampal volume, as well as cognitive&#xD;
      performance, mental health and brain organisation. We hypothesise that the intervention will&#xD;
      change anterior hippocampal volume of Year-8 pupils, as well as mental health, cognitive&#xD;
      performance, and more generally, brain structure and function. We further hypothesise that&#xD;
      changes in brain organisation (e.g. hippocampal volume) may mediate changes in cognitive&#xD;
      performance and mental health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity has shown beneficial effects for cognitive and brain health. In particular,&#xD;
      studies have shown that physical activity has the potential to increase the volume of the&#xD;
      anterior portion of the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in learning and memory. The&#xD;
      Fit to Study - Brain imaging sub-study is being conducted to understand better the effects of&#xD;
      a physical activity intervention delivered during school PE lessons on anterior hippocampal&#xD;
      volume, as well as cognition, mental health, and brain organisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fit to Study main trial aims to test the effect of a school-based physical activity&#xD;
      intervention on academic performance (as well as cognition and physical measures) across Year&#xD;
      8 pupils in 100 secondary schools. A full description of the Fit to study main trail,&#xD;
      including its outcome measures, has been provided as part of its registration at&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03286725).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fit to Study - Brain imaging sub-study will target a sub-sample of participants of the&#xD;
      large-scale trial, in order to test pre to post intervention changes in anterior hippocampal&#xD;
      volume, as well as cognitive performance, mental health and brain organisation. The&#xD;
      assessments will take place pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and 12-months&#xD;
      post-intervention, and will comprise structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fit to Study main trial participants are considered eligible for brain imaging sub-study. The&#xD;
      brain imaging sub-study consists of two sub-samples, recruited at different times during the&#xD;
      trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first cohort of 60 participants completed assessments pre-intervention, will&#xD;
           complete identical assessments post-intervention to investigate pre-to-post intervention&#xD;
           changes, and will be invited to take part in follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A second cohort of ~50 participants will be recruited for post-intervention assessments&#xD;
           that are similar, but not identical, to the assessments of the first group, as well as&#xD;
           1-year follow-up assessments. This cohort will enable cross-sectional analysis of&#xD;
           between-group (intervention-control) differences in a larger sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments are similar, but not identical for the two cohorts. The key assessments are&#xD;
      listed here and details are provided in the 'outcome measures' section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cohort 1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Magnetic resonance imaging (at pre- and post intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Computer-based cognitive tasks (at pre-, and post intervention and follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mental health questionnaires (at pre-, and post intervention and follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical activity assessments (at pre-, and post intervention, and follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fitness assessments (at pre-, and post intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gait assessments (at pre- and post intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort 2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Magnetic resonance imaging (at post intervention only)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Computer-based cognitive tasks (at post intervention and follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mental health questionnaires (at post intervention and follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical activity assessments (at post intervention and follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gait assessments (at post-intervention only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine cross-sectional relations between anterior hippocampal volume and physical&#xD;
           activity and fitness at baseline (cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine whether changes in anterior hippocampal volume are greater in the&#xD;
           intervention group compared to the control group (i.e. group by time interaction tested&#xD;
           in cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine cross-sectional relations between brain structure and function, and physical&#xD;
           activity and fitness at baseline (cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine whether changes in brain organisation, mental health, cognitive performance&#xD;
           and fitness are greater in the intervention group compared to the control group (i.e.&#xD;
           group by time interaction tested in cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine whether brain organisation, mental health, cognitive performance and fitness&#xD;
           is different in the intervention group compared to the control group post intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify MRI markers predisposing the PA intervention effect&#xD;

    <description>A battery of surveys each including a number of measures:&#xD;
To assess symptoms of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) a parent of the participant completed the ADHD rating scale. Puberty status is assessed using the Pubertal Development Rating Scale. Mood is assessed using the abbreviated Profile of Mood States (POMS). The abbreviated POMS scale is a questionnaire that contains 40 self-report items on a five-point Likert scale. Sleep is assessed using the Cleveland Adolescent Sleepiness Questionnaire (CASQ and the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI). The CASQ is a self-report scale to measure excessive daytime sleepiness. The SCI is an 8-item self-report measure of insomnia symptoms.Mental health is assessed with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. General health and behaviour is assessed using various items of the Health Behaviour for School Aged Children (HBSC) survey (2009/2010).&#xD;
