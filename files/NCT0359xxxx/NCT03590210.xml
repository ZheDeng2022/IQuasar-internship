      The &quot;NiTraSarc&quot; trial evaluates the efficacy and feasibility (as determined by the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability) of combined treatment with trabectedin and nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic or inoperable soft tissue sarcomas&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Undoubtedly, there is a strong medical need for new efficacious therapies for patients with&#xD;
      advanced soft tissue sarcomas. While immune oncology treatment approaches like inhibition of&#xD;
      immune checkpoints by administration of anti PD-1 / PD-L1 antibodies displayed very promising&#xD;
      clinical activity in several types of tumors, current data points out to only limited&#xD;
      activity of mono-agent immunotherapy in soft tissue sarcomas (especially in leiomyosarcomas)&#xD;
      - although this type of tumor demonstrably displays a certain grade of immunogenicity. That&#xD;
      means, STS patients are currently not able to benefit from the advancements in cancer&#xD;
      immunotherapy which led to remarkable improvements in outcome in some other tumor entities in&#xD;
      the last few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, most recent data indicates that trabectedin could enhance the activity of&#xD;
      immune-modulating agents via its influence on the tumor micro-environment and the reduction&#xD;
      of tumor associated macrophages. Furthermore, first clinical data obtained from a feasibility&#xD;
      study on combined nivolumab/trabectedin therapy in STS patients did not report on significant&#xD;
      toxicities when combining the two agents, thereby justifying combination of nivolumab and&#xD;
      trabectedin utilizing standard dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this phase II study will examine if combination of nivolumab with trabectedin is&#xD;
      feasible (safe and well tolerated) and efficacious by utilizing potential synergistic effects&#xD;
      of both agents. In the long run, the results of this phase II trial could build the basis for&#xD;
      further evaluation of the efficacy of the trabectedin / nivolumab combination in a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial involving larger patient numbers. Finally, this could render patients with STS&#xD;
      accessible to immunotherapeutics - a promising new class of drugs for anti-cancer treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is the progression-free survival rate after 6 months (PFSR6), assessed by applying RECIST 1.1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>safety, as measured by: - Incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events leading to discontinuation, and deaths - Incidence of clinical laboratory test abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety endpoint is to assess the feasibility of combined treatment with trabectedin and nivolumab in patients with metastatic or inoperable soft tissue sarcomas as determined by the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Response Rate (ORR) defined as the number and percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response designation, recorded between the date of first dose and the date of the initial objectively documented tumor progression per RECIST v1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy or death date, whichever occurs first. For participants without documented progression or subsequent therapy, all available response designations will contribute to the BOR determination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from date of the first dosing date of any study medication to the date of death (due to any cause). Subjects who are alive will be censored at the last known alive dates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the first dosing date of any study medication to the date of the first objectively documented tumor progression, as determined by investigators (per RECIST v1.1), or death due to any cause. Subjects who die without a reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. Subjects who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on the first dosing date of study medication. Subjects who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored at the last tumor assessment prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. In addition to PFS according to RECIST v1.1, PFS according to immune related RECIST 1.1 (irRECIST 1.1) will be determined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>duration of disease stabilization (DoDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of disease stabilization is defined as the sum of duration of response (DoR) and duration of stable disease (DoS) in months. So DoDS is applicable to subjects with best overall response as either CR or PR or SD and it is defined as time from the first assessment of CR or PR or SD until the date of the first occurrence of PD, or until the date of death (if occurred within predefined time period). In case of censored event, the DoDS is censored on the date of last tumor assessment.</description>
