  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with substance use disorders (ASUD) in residential treatment have the most&#xD;
      serious substance use disorders and the highest rates of psychological, motivational,&#xD;
      behavioral, legal, environmental, and vocational problems. ASUD in residential treatment are&#xD;
      also at high risk of relapse, with follow-up studies suggesting that 60% of ASUD will relapse&#xD;
      within 90 days of discharge. Parenting practices have been established as a key influence on&#xD;
      adolescents' initiation and maintenance of substance use, as well as their substance use&#xD;
      outcomes and likelihood of relapse. However, therapists who treat ASUD have reported a myriad&#xD;
      of systemic barriers to engaging parents in treatment. Findings such as these deem ASUD in&#xD;
      residential treatment a high priority population and argue for the value of easily accessible&#xD;
      parenting interventions during this critical time. The proposed study evaluates a low cost,&#xD;
      low intensity model for delivering parenting skills to parents preparing for their&#xD;
      adolescent's discharge from residential substance use (SU) treatment. Specifically, this&#xD;
      project involves adapting the delivery of a computerized parenting intervention (Parenting&#xD;
      Wisely; PW) that has preliminary evidence of efficacy in improving parenting skills and&#xD;
      reducing youth behavior problems. This study adapts the delivery of PW for a new population&#xD;
      (parents of ASUD) and new setting (residential treatment), and obtains initial data on its&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. As a first step, an open trial with 10 parents&#xD;
      was conducted to develop and pilot an adapted version of PW that included moderate engagement&#xD;
      strategies: in-person coaching sessions, daily text messages containing reminders of&#xD;
      parenting skills and links to video vignettes, and an online parent forum containing two&#xD;
      networking boards (Ask an Expert and Connect with Parents). In the current phase, a pilot&#xD;
      randomized trial with 60 parents will compare an adapted PW plus treatment as usual (TAU)&#xD;
      condition (PW+) versus TAU only in a residential treatment center. Both treatment conditions&#xD;
      will be delivered by Bachelor's or Master's-level community clinicians. This small trial will&#xD;
      provide some initial evidence regarding the utility of a low-cost, low-intensity intervention&#xD;
      and whether a larger, fully powered trial is indicated in the future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This small pilot trial evaluates a low cost, low intensity model for delivering parenting&#xD;
      skills to parents preparing for their adolescent's discharge from residential substance use&#xD;
      (SU) treatment. Specifically, this project adapts a computerized parenting intervention&#xD;
      (Parenting Wisely; PW) that has preliminary evidence of efficacy in improving parenting&#xD;
      skills and reducing youth behavior problems for a new population (parents of adolescents with&#xD;
      SU) and new setting (residential treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: A minimum of 60 parent-adolescent dyads will be recruited from residential&#xD;
      treatment. To guide design decisions for a larger trial, we made the decision after trial&#xD;
      registration to recruit from one short-term residential treatment program and one long-term&#xD;
      residential treatment program. Parental inclusion criteria: (1) be parent or legal guardian&#xD;
      of an adolescent, aged 12-17 years; (2) had adolescent admitted to residential treatment due&#xD;
      to problems related to substance use; (3) will be the primary guardian living with the&#xD;
      adolescent immediately post-discharge; (4) willing to receive a parenting intervention; (5)&#xD;
      fluent in English or Spanish; and (6) willing to provide written consent. Adolescents qualify&#xD;
      if their parents meet these criteria as well as: (1) are fluent in English or Spanish and (2)&#xD;
      willing to provide written assent. The only exclusion criteria are conditions that might&#xD;
      preclude the adolescent's or parent's participation in a 2-3 hour interview (e.g., mania,&#xD;
      psychosis, and cognitive impairment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study enrollment and randomization: Parents of all newly admitted adolescents will be&#xD;
      screened for substance use and those screening positive, will receive a Consent to Contact&#xD;
      (CoC) form. Parents that sign a CoC form will be contacted by research staff and invited in&#xD;
      for a consent session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will provide written informed consent and adolescents will provide written assent in&#xD;
      separate private rooms at the residential center. Parents and adolescents may choose to&#xD;
      conduct the informed consent process and all study procedures in English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be given the choice whether to return for the baseline assessment or complete it&#xD;
      following informed consent. Randomization will occur within 24 hours after the baseline&#xD;
      assessment. Parent-adolescent dyads will be randomized by a blind research staff member to&#xD;
      either treatment as usual or PW+ using urn randomization balanced on sex, frequency of&#xD;
      substance use, and race/ethnicity. The evaluator will give parents condition assignments in&#xD;
      sealed envelopes. If the parent is assigned to PW+, the evaluator will schedule the first&#xD;
      coaching session. Coaching sessions were offered via multiple modalities to increase&#xD;
      engagement: in-person, phone, or video conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapist training, fidelity, and competence: Treatment will be delivered by Bachelor's or&#xD;
      Master's-level parent coaches, at least one of whom is bilingual in English and Spanish. The&#xD;
      study principal investigator (PI) will train the coaches. Coach therapeutic competence will&#xD;
      be rated with six items that comprise the &quot;General Therapeutic Skills&quot; section of the&#xD;
      Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS). A score &gt;24 is the criterion for competence. Study&#xD;
      specific adherence checklists have been developed. The coaches will be required to earn a&#xD;
      satisfactory consensus CTRS score of &gt;24 and satisfactory adherence ratings (&gt; 80% of&#xD;
      elements) on two consecutive role plays to be assigned participants. All sessions will be&#xD;
      rated for adherence and competence. A minimum of 25% of tapes will be double rated. The PI&#xD;
      will meet weekly with the coaches for supervision focused on how to deliver PW+ with&#xD;
      adherence and competence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment as Usual (TAU): TAU is the standard treatment offered to all patients at the&#xD;
      residential center. Adolescents receive about 25 hours of treatment per week with average&#xD;
      length of stay 6-10 days at the short-term residential center and 30-45 days at the long-term&#xD;
      residential center. Parents are typically offered 2 family therapy sessions. Adolescents&#xD;
      receive 4-5 hours of individual and group therapy sessions per day, consisting of&#xD;
      psychoeducation and general skills building. Medication management is offered as needed.&#xD;
      Prior to discharge, parents also receive standard discharge planning, which consists of&#xD;
      either a referral to a new outpatient therapy provider or return to a prior outpatient&#xD;
      therapy provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adapted PW program: In addition to TAU , parents in the PW+ will receive: Parenting Wisely&#xD;
      online modules, in-person coaching sessions, personalized text messages, and an&#xD;
      expert-moderated online parent board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenting Wisely online modules: Parenting Wisely (PW/Ser Padres Con Sabiduría) is a&#xD;
      self-administered, interactive, multimedia online program. PW contains video vignettes of ten&#xD;
      common family problems (e.g., adolescent substance use, curfews, household chores, monitoring&#xD;
      of friends, sibling conflict, improving in school, getting up on time, sharing technology,&#xD;
      etc.). For each problem, parents progress through three activities: viewing of a video clip&#xD;
      of a family struggling with the problem; selection of one of three possible solutions to the&#xD;
      problem; and receipt of feedback about the solution selected. Feedback is presented via a&#xD;
      video enactment of the selected solution and an explanation of the solution's pros and cons.&#xD;
      Goals of the feedback are to explain why ineffective solutions lead to problems and discuss&#xD;
      how effective parenting solutions can prevent and resolve common family issues. Parents&#xD;
      receive a parent workbook outlining all 10 vignettes, along with the potential problems and&#xD;
      solutions. Parents create a unique login upon enrollment and can complete sessions at their&#xD;
      own pace. PW typically takes 3-5 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual coaching sessions: Sessions individually tailor PW skills to each parent's&#xD;
      presenting concerns, corresponding with four PW vignettes: substance use, limit setting,&#xD;
      parental monitoring, and parental communication. The initial session is 60-75 min and&#xD;
      consists of three sections: (1) rationale for parenting skills, (2) review of PW substance&#xD;
      use module (in session), and (3) practice applying the skill to a current problem. Subsequent&#xD;
      sessions follow the same outline and last 45-60 min, with active use of the PW program&#xD;
      comprising about half the session. If parents introduce problems/complaints about their&#xD;
      adolescent, the coach provides validation and discusses how to apply a pertinent PW skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text-based messaging: Following discharge, parents will receive text messages daily for up to&#xD;
      24 weeks to: (a) reinforce PW skills, (b) motivate continued PW usage, and (c) encourage&#xD;
      participation in the online parent message board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online parent board: Parents will be given access to a secure, expert-moderated website&#xD;
      containing two networking forums (Ask an Expert, Connect with Parents). The website is&#xD;
      accessible via a user-friendly smartphone application or &quot;app&quot; (similar to app versions of&#xD;
      websites for sites such as Pinterest and Facebook). Parents will be able to submit questions&#xD;
      anonymously using the same unique login as for the PW program. Questions posted on the&#xD;
      message board will be answered by the research team within 48 hours. Answers to questions&#xD;
      posted on the message board will direct parents to a specific PW module(s) most relevant to&#xD;
      their parenting question. Participation on the message board will be encouraged for up to 24&#xD;
      weeks post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exit interviews: At each follow-up, parents complete exit interviews containing questions&#xD;
      about each aspect of the intervention, including the in-person sessions (e.g., number,&#xD;
      content, format), text messages (e.g., content, frequency, format), and online message board&#xD;
      (e.g., ease of access, content, format). Parents will also complete the 16-item Consumer&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ), which rates their satisfaction with treatment delivery,&#xD;
      their adolescent's treatment progress, and their ability to manage their adolescent's&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Follow-up assessments at 6, 12, and 24 weeks post-discharge will be conducted by&#xD;
      an independent evaluator blind to condition. Assessments will be 1.5-2 hours. The primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are detailed in the Outcome section. Multiple steps will be taken to&#xD;
      prevent attrition. First, multiple sources of contact information will be recorded for&#xD;
      parents and adolescents. Follow-up reminders will be made via phone, text, and/or mail. The&#xD;
      research team will meet weekly to review no-shows and outreach attempts, and discuss plans to&#xD;
      connect with missing participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan: All 60 parents will be included in statistical analyses consistent with&#xD;
      an intent-to-treat model. Prior to the main analyses, descriptive statistics will be run on&#xD;
      key variables to examine distributional properties, identify outliers, and transform&#xD;
      variables as needed. The treatment conditions will be compared on baseline demographic and&#xD;
      clinical variables using basic two-group independent sample t-tests. Using a p &lt; .05&#xD;
      criterion, significant pre-existing baseline differences between conditions will be&#xD;
      controlled in subsequent analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attrition analyses will compare follow-up completers and non-completers on baseline clinical&#xD;
      and demographic variables to determine if they differ systematically. If no systematic&#xD;
      differences are found between completers and non-completers, then missing data will be&#xD;
      estimated using multiple imputation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be analyzed at 6, 12, and 24 weeks post baseline. Analyses will compare&#xD;
      trajectories of use over the post-discharge period, controlling for baseline status as a&#xD;
      covariate. For each dependent variable, separate repeated measures Analysis of Covariance&#xD;
      will test the influence of condition, controlling for the following covariates: baseline&#xD;
      status on the dependent variable, baseline differences between groups, and any mental health&#xD;
      or substance use treatment received over the follow-up period. The effect of PW dosage on&#xD;
      each dependent variable will be calculated and partial eta squared (η2) will be used to&#xD;
      estimate the proportion of variance caused by PW. The primary analytical goal will be to&#xD;
      provide measures of association and 95% confidence intervals to reveal the effect size of PW&#xD;
      on each dependent variable. The goal of these analyses is to find promising trends to pursue&#xD;
      in a larger fully powered trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Aim of the NIH-funded application that funded this study was to establish the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the experimental intervention (Primary Aim 1: To examine the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of an adapted PW intervention that includes moderate engagement&#xD;
      strategies for parents of adolescents with substance use disorders preparing for discharge&#xD;
      from residential). The Secondary Aim of the NIH-funded study was to examine the preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of the experimental intervention on adolescent substance use, adolescent&#xD;
      high-risk behavior, and parenting behavior (Secondary Aims 2-4: To test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the adapted PW intervention + treatment as usual (PW+TAU) versus TAU only on: substance use&#xD;
      outcomes, related high-risk behaviors, and parenting skills (the putative mediators of&#xD;
      change).) Approximately midway through this study, with the support of the Program Officer, a&#xD;
      second residential facility was added. This was to ensure that the study met its&#xD;
      pre-specified recruitment targets, and also enabled us to test study procedures at one&#xD;
      short-term residential facility and one-long term residential facility, to help inform the&#xD;
      design of a future fully powered trial.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>74 participants (37 dyads) were recruited from a short-term residential facility and 48 participants (24 dyads) were recruited from a long-term facility.&#xD;
The long-term facility was added in Year 3 of the trial to improve recruitment and inform design of a fully powered trial (consistent with recruitment plan outlined in the grant proposal).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Following informed consent, participants had to complete a baseline assessment and confirm discharge to parental custody (study inclusion criteria) before randomization. 10 participants (5 dyads) that consented were not randomized and not included in the final intent-to-treat sample because of these inclusion criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The GAIN-Q3 is a well-validated substance use screening tool used to assess adolescent substance use in a range of settings. Substance consumption information is collected using a calendar format with temporal cues (e.g., holidays) to assist in recall of days when alcohol and other drugs were used. Possible number of days range from 0 to 90. Values are adjusted to reflect the percent of days used outside of controlled environment, with final values ranging from 0 to 100%.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Approximately 25-30 weeks (baseline assessment done upon admission to residential treatment; follow-ups done over 24 weeks post-discharge. Duration of treatment varied from 6 days to 45 days across the sample)</time_frame>
      <desc>Used standard National Institutes of Health definition of study-related adverse and serious adverse events.&#xD;
Adverse events and serious adverse events were assessed systematically as part of the comprehensive follow-up assessments. Adverse events included instances of juvenile justice involvement (i.e., arrest or incarceration of the adolescent) that were not directly associated with the research, but were temporally associated with the research.</desc>
