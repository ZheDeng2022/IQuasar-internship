  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Convergence insufficiency (CI) is a prevalent binocular vision disorder with symptoms that&#xD;
      include double/blurred vision, eyestrain, and headaches when engaged in reading or other near&#xD;
      work. CI is present in 4% of the population where approximately 27% of CI patients do not&#xD;
      improve even with validated therapy. The project will quantitatively study changes in&#xD;
      convergence eye movements and neural substrates before and after validated therapy in CI&#xD;
      patients. This knowledge can lead to improvements in currently validated therapy, reduction&#xD;
      in therapy sessions, and reduced healthcare costs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Convergence insufficiency (CI), a prevalent binocular vision disorder in adults and children,&#xD;
      is characterized by greater exophoria at near than at distance, reduced fusional convergence&#xD;
      amplitude, receded near point of convergence, and a reduced accommodative convergence over&#xD;
      accommodation ratio (AC/A). CI is associated with symptoms that include double/blurred&#xD;
      vision, eyestrain, and headaches when engaged in reading or other near work, thus interfering&#xD;
      with activities of daily living. The recent NEI/NIH multi-center randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      the Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (CITT), demonstrated the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Office-Based Vergence and Accommodative Therapy with home reinforcement (OBVAT) for CI,&#xD;
      reporting 73% of patients have sustained improvements of vision function and symptoms. The&#xD;
      team published the first fMRI neural substrate data evoked using convergence eye movements in&#xD;
      CI patients before and then post-OBVAT. The team's results suggest that with the reduction of&#xD;
      visual symptoms, the following were observed: 1) an increase in the percent signal change of&#xD;
      functional activity in the frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex and the cerebellar&#xD;
      vermis, 2) an increase in convergence peak velocity, 3) a decrease in the near point of&#xD;
      convergence, 4) an increase in positive fusional amplitude and 5) a reduction in the amount&#xD;
      of exophoria at near. The aims of the current proposal are to test the following two&#xD;
      hypotheses as potential underlying mechanisms of CI that may be improved post OBVAT: 1) a&#xD;
      reduced ability to adapt vergence in near and far space via the 'slow' component of vergence&#xD;
      and 2) a reduced ability to quickly diminish disparity error via the 'fast' component of&#xD;
      vergence. Not only will our quantitative methods integrated with established CITT standards&#xD;
      address important questions about potential mechanisms causing CI, this proposal seeks to&#xD;
      identify how a validated vergence therapy may remediate symptoms. This proposal will&#xD;
      determine whether either of these two potential mechanisms are causing CI by quantifying the&#xD;
      following: 1) rate and magnitude of phoria adaptation, 2) forced vergence fixation disparity&#xD;
      curves, 3) peak velocity of convergence eye movements (studying visual cues such as&#xD;
      disparity, accommodation and proximal stimuli in isolation and combination), and 4) the&#xD;
      functional activity of the fast and slow vergence neural substrates prior to, and then after,&#xD;
      OBVAT. The assembled study team is particularly knowledgeable in terms of OBVAT, convergence&#xD;
      insufficiency, optometry, vision science, oculomotor research, functional imaging, modeling&#xD;
      and statistics with the necessary resources to successfully complete both aims of this study.&#xD;
      Results from the project's aims can lead to targeted treatments with improved success rates,&#xD;
      potentially reducing the time to remediate symptoms, and ultimately reducing health care&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
