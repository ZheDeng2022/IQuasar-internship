  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a population-based, prospective, multicenter and open-label study. 12,500 female&#xD;
      non-respondents to the uterine cervix smear from 30 to 65 years of age in the context of the&#xD;
      organized cervical cancer screening of the uterus, in the 4 Breton departments, will be&#xD;
      proposed after stratification by age and socio-economic level at the revival of the cervical&#xD;
      cancer of the uterus screening by the structure of management of Rennes, an invitation to the&#xD;
      Human Papilloma Virus urine test thanks to the sampling kit sent to the home. It is planned a&#xD;
      revival by simple mail after 4 months in one woman out of two who did not respond to this&#xD;
      invitation to assess the impact of a recovery. This group represents about 5% of the eligible&#xD;
      population in Brittany. The specimen will be sent by post with the signed consent and a&#xD;
      questionnaire to the Hospital of Brest in virology laboratory for the detection of Human&#xD;
      Papilloma Virus DNA (QPCR) in the urine (HPU test) and typing (LipA). In the case of a&#xD;
      positive Human Papilloma Virus test, the woman being tested has a strong incentive to do the&#xD;
      cervical cancer of the uterus with her doctor or midwife. In the case of abnormal smear,&#xD;
      follow-up continues according to national recommendations to a gynecologist. All the data is&#xD;
      collected on a software from the LINKS company, with the networking of the 4 Breton centers,&#xD;
      the virology laboratory, and the Anatomy-Cytology-Pathology laboratories in Brittany; this&#xD;
      collection will allow after extraction, a statistical analysis of the data. The analysis of&#xD;
      the participation rate in this new screening, for each level of the socio-economic level,&#xD;
      will allow a comparison with the participation in smear's revival of organized screening,&#xD;
      between women's groups according to the socio-economic level of their residential place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will take place over 24 months in 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. D0-M6: Pre-inclusion phase with implementation of the protocol (regulatory procedures,&#xD;
           production of newsletters, consent, questionnaire, preparation of urine collection kits,&#xD;
           postal validation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. M6-M18: Inclusion phase with start of the study, sending invitations and inclusion,&#xD;
           Human Papillomavirus Urinary testing and uterine cervix smear monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. M18-M24: Post-inclusion phase with assessment of the inclusions on the 4 Breton&#xD;
           departments, verification and analysis of the data according to the socio-economic&#xD;
           level, recovery of the uterine cervix smear stimulus data, realization of the&#xD;
           statistical analyzes and budget impact analysis, communications and publications.&#xD;
