  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled feasibility trial for women diagnosed with gestational&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). The current front-line treatment for GDM is medical nutrition&#xD;
      therapy (MNT), i.e. personalized diets which may or may not include mild carbohydrate&#xD;
      restriction. Use of carbohydrate restriction increases the risk of the mother developing&#xD;
      ketosis, a harmful condition for both the mother and fetus. If MNT is not enough to stabilize&#xD;
      blood sugar levels, then pharmaceuticals are prescribed. In patients with type-2 diabetes and&#xD;
      prediabetes, the carbohydrate-last food order behavior has been shown to improve post-meal&#xD;
      blood sugar control without the need of reduced carbohydrate intake. Given this data, the&#xD;
      addition of this intervention to MNT in patients with GDM may be helpful in achieving&#xD;
      controlled blood sugar levels without increasing the risk of ketosis. This study will include&#xD;
      two randomized groups diagnosed with GDM. Patients in the control group will be prescribed&#xD;
      standard MNT. Patients in the intervention group will have identical MNT but with additional&#xD;
      food order instruction/therapy. All patients will be followed up with at 1-2 week intervals.&#xD;
      At each follow-up the physician and dietician will analyze the patient's blood sugar&#xD;
      measurements and, among additional factors, determine if pharmaceuticals should be added.&#xD;
      Treatment will continue through delivery. The primary aim of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of the carbohydrate last food order in GDM and generate preliminary data on its&#xD;
      effects on glucose control.&#xD;
