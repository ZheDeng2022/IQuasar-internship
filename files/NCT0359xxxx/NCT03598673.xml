    <textblock>
      Although Nebivolol, a highly selective beta-1 agent has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing blood pressure in Blacks, this was in African Americans with no study in Blacks&#xD;
      residing in sub Saharan Africa. We therefore decided to study the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      Nebivolol in Black patients with stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP of 140-149 and/or&#xD;
      diastolic BP of 90-99 mmHg) presenting to five primary care centres in Nigeria.&#xD;

      Although Nebivolol, a highly selective beta-1 agent has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing blood pressure in Blacks, this was in African Americans with no study in Blacks&#xD;
      residing in sub Saharan Africa. It might be argued that findings in African-Americans can be&#xD;
      extrapolated to Black Africans since they have the same ancestral origin, the differences in&#xD;
      selection in previous generations, ethnic admixture and differences in lifestyle suggest that&#xD;
      such an extrapolation may be inappropriate. We are therefore studying the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of Nebivolol in Black patients with stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP of 140-149&#xD;
      and/or diastolic BP of 90-99 mmHg) presenting to primary care centres in Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise based on previous findings of the effect of Nebivolol on blood control of&#xD;
      African Americans, we hypothesise that 5mg and 10mg of Nebivolol will be effective and well&#xD;
      tolerated by black hypertensive patients residing in Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to study the effect of 5mg and 10mg of Nebivolol on blood pressure&#xD;
      control in Black African hypertensive patients residing in Nigeria. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are: to evaluate the rates of BP control (&lt;140 mmHg systolic and &lt;90 mmHg diastolic) achieved&#xD;
      with 5mg and 10mg of Nebivolol respectively; to evaluate the incidence and the nature of&#xD;
      adverse events with these two doses of Nebivolol; to evaluate the effects of these two doses&#xD;
      of Nebivolol on fasting blood sugar and fasting lipid profile, and to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      these two doses on erectile dysfunction The primary outcome measure is change in office BP&#xD;
      value from baseline to 2 months. This will be calculated as the difference between the mean&#xD;
      office BP at randomization and that at the end of follow up. And the secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
      to determine the proportion of patients who achieve BP &lt;140 mmHg systolic and &lt;90 mmHg&#xD;
      diastolic in two months; to determine the proportion of patients who have adverse events with&#xD;
      both doses of Nebivolol respectively; to study the change in plasma fasting blood sugar and&#xD;
      fasting lipid profile over two months, and to see proportion of male patients who complain of&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction on follow up and end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is is a prospective, observational program among hypertensive patients with 3 months&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;
