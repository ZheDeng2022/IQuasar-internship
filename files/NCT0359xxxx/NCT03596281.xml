    <textblock>
      French multicenter, open-label, phase 1b, evaluating via the mTPI design the paired treatment&#xD;
      of pembrolizumab and PLD (cohort A), pembrolizumab and bevacizumab (cohort B) and finally the&#xD;
      combination treatment of the three drugs PLD plus bevacizumab and pembrolizumab (cohort C).&#xD;
      Thanks to an expansion cohort C+ the ORR will be evaluated in a total of 19 patients at the&#xD;
      RP2 D using an exact binomial one-step Fleming-type design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A and B will be opened for inclusions at the same time. Once safety of the dual&#xD;
      combinations confirmed in cohorts A and B,cohort C will be opened for inclusions.&#xD;
