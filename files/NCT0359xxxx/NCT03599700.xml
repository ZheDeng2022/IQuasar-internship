  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Classic BCR-ABL negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are stem cell disorders&#xD;
      characterized by abnormal myeloid proliferation and increased blood cell counts and comprise&#xD;
      polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are common malignancies in elderly individuals as the&#xD;
      combined annual incidence rates of classical MPNs were reported to be 0.84, 1.03, and 0.47&#xD;
      per 100,000 respectively for PV, ET, and PMF but with a wide variation in prevalence rates&#xD;
      reported in different studies. The 5-year relative survival rates are 84.8, 89.9, and 39% for&#xD;
      PV, ET and PMF patients, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thromboembolic complications represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality in MPN,&#xD;
      particularly in PV and ET. The mechanisms underlying increased thrombotic risk in chronic&#xD;
      myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are incompletely understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several pathophysiological mechanisms help explain the increased likelihood of thrombosis in&#xD;
      these patients. Factors, such as leukocyte and platelet activation leading to the formation&#xD;
      of leukocyte-platelet aggregates, activation of the coagulation cascade by microparticles,&#xD;
      high levels of inflammatory cytokines, and endothelial dysfunction have a crucial role in&#xD;
      thrombosis in MPN patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate prediction of the thrombotic risk still represents a challenge and adequate&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers are not available. The mechanisms underlying thrombosis involve a&#xD;
      complex interplay among blood cells, the endothelium and the coagulation system. Both&#xD;
      increased blood counts and cellular activation, which is due to hyperactivation of&#xD;
      intracellular signaling pathways and enhanced interaction between blood cells, are implicated&#xD;
      in the thrombotic predisposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The JAK2V617F mutation is a diagnostic marker for MPN and it also plays an important role in&#xD;
      patient treatment since inhibition of JAK2-associated proliferative pathways has the&#xD;
      potential to inhibit cell proliferation in MPNs. This mutation is present in ~95% of PV&#xD;
      patients and 50% of ET or PMF patients. Thrombosis and hemostasis are major complications&#xD;
      that affect the life expectancy of patients with MPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines recommend testing for JAK2 mutations in any patient suspected to have an&#xD;
      MPN. JAK2 mutation leads to distinct changes in hematopoietic cells that increase the&#xD;
      likelihood of thrombus formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of thrombosis, in both PV and ET, exceeds 20% and a substantial proportion of&#xD;
      patients experience vasomotor disturbances (e.g. headaches, lightheadedness, acral&#xD;
      paresthesias, erythromelalgia, atypical chest pain, ocular disturbances, tinnitus) and in&#xD;
      case of PV, pruritus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean platelet volume (MPV) is largely considered as a useful indirect marker of platelet&#xD;
      activation. Larger platelets are metabolically and enzymatically more active, and have a&#xD;
      greater prothrombotic potential. Elevated MPV is associated with other markers of platelet&#xD;
      activity, including increased platelet aggregation, increased thromboxane synthesis and&#xD;
      beta-thromboglobulin release, and increased expression of adhesion molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High sensitivity CRP is an inflammatory marker might be useful to reflect a condition of&#xD;
      chronic inflammation which is associated with the disease severity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Elevated CRP and elevated LDH are risk factors for survival in MPN patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevated γ-Glutamyl (γ-GT) transferase is an independent risk factor for Splanchnic venous&#xD;
      thrombosis (SVT) presence in MPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30% of vascular events in Ph-negative MPN patients are VTE, which generally present as&#xD;
      lower limb deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary artery embolism. However, in Ph-negative MPN,&#xD;
      VTE characteristically occurs in uncommon locations such as splanchnic veins, including&#xD;
      hepatic veins (presenting Budd-Chiari syndrome), portal and mesenteric veins, or, less&#xD;
      frequently, cerebral veins or sinuses. In patients with MPN, the prevalence of CVT is 3-7% of&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myeloproliferative neoplasms are known to be pro-thrombotic diseases (arterial and venous).&#xD;
      For both of ET and PV, thromboses occur more frequently in arterial sites (between 64 and 75%&#xD;
      for PV, and between 72 and 91% for ET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      JAK2 mutation can affect cardiac arteries and veins in ET and PV, which results in&#xD;
      thrombosis, ischemia and other cardiovascular events. JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays an&#xD;
      important role in heart diseases. High incidence of atrial arrhythmias among patients with ET&#xD;
      or PV. The patients were older, cumulating more cardiovascular risk factors inducing more&#xD;
      thrombotic events mainly in arteries, and have a higher incidence of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of treatment compliance has now been clearly established in many pathological&#xD;
      conditions as poor adherence has a negative impact on clinical evolution and non-adherence to&#xD;
      cytoreductive therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the complete&#xD;
      haematological remission rate but no significant association between thrombosis or death and&#xD;
      non-adherence was found. This may be related to the fact that thrombosis is a more acute&#xD;
      event, depending on the immediate hemostatic status at the time of thrombus constitution,&#xD;
      whereas the phenotypic evolution of chronic haematological malignancies may be more the&#xD;
      result of long term evolution of the clone, reflecting its exposure to therapeutic pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with MPN should also avoid factors that are known to increase risk of VTE, including&#xD;
      systemic hormone therapy such as oral contraceptive pills and smoking, and optimize&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, including control of blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol,&#xD;
      in order to minimize thrombotic complications.&#xD;
