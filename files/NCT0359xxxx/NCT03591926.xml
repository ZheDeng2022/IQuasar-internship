  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SM04646-IPF-03 is a Phase 2a, multi-center, open-label study evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of a single inhaled, nebulized dose of SM04646 solution over a 12-week treatment&#xD;
      regimen in subjects with mild to moderate IPF. A total of approximately 24 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study (approximately 12 subjects into the &quot;non-bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]&quot;&#xD;
      arm and approximately 12 subjects into the &quot;BAL&quot; arm). Subjects that currently do not&#xD;
      require, have failed to tolerate, or have opted not to have treatment with pirfenidone or&#xD;
      nintedanib will have the option of participation in the &quot;BAL&quot; arm or participation in the&#xD;
      &quot;non-BAL&quot; arm. Subjects currently receiving treatment with pirfenidone or nintedanib must be&#xD;
      on stable treatment for a minimum of 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. Subjects&#xD;
      currently on treatment with pirfenidone or nintedanib may participate in the &quot;non-BAL&quot; arm&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will participate in a treatment period of 12 weeks and a follow-up period&#xD;
      of 12 weeks. The treatment dosing pattern will follow a 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off regimen,&#xD;
      wherein subjects will dose 5 consecutive days of each 7 day &quot;on&quot; week.&#xD;
