  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate whether apixaban is more effective in treating patients&#xD;
      with isolated calf vein thrombosis (DVT) than serial imaging of the DVT for preventing&#xD;
      thrombus spread, pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or recurring DVTs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled superiority clinical trial. Patients&#xD;
      will be identified at the time of the diagnosis of acute calf deep vein thrombosis and&#xD;
      approached at that time. If they agree they would be randomly assigned to placebo or apixaban&#xD;
      treatment for three months. Along with this they will also undergo repeat ultrasounds at 7,&#xD;
      14, and 90 days along with telephone follow-up at 30 and 60 days.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Subjects Who Experience a Composite Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Event Within 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 months of therapy initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The composite VTE event will include thrombus propagation either within the calf veins or into proximal deep veins (popliteal, femoral or iliac veins), symptomatic or incidental VTE recurrence or all-cause mortality within 3 months of therapy initiation. All suspected VTE events will be evaluated by a central, blinded, independent adjudication committee.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Who Experience Either Major Bleeding or Clinically Relevant Non-major Bleeding Within 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 months of therapy initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding plus a hemoglobin decrease of ≥ 2 g/dL or transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells, or bleeding at a critical site: intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, pericardial intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or fatal bleeding.&#xD;
Clinically relevant non-major bleeding is defined as any overt, actionable sign of hemorrhage meeting at least one of the following criteria: (i) requiring nonsurgical, medical intervention by a healthcare professional, (ii) leading to hospitalization or increased level of care, or (iii) prompting evaluation.&#xD;
All patients who received at least one dose of study medication will be included in the safety analysis. All suspected bleeding events will be evaluated by a central, blinded, independent adjudication committee.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Time of Thrombus Propagation</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 months of therapy initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The timing of thrombus propagation for those individuals who have suffered such an event. The date of thrombus propagation confirmation will be compared to the date of the original Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) diagnosis for this purpose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Net Clinical Benefit or Harm for the Two Strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 months of therapy initiation.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome of net clinical benefit or harm will be assessed as the composite of the primary efficacy outcome or the principal safety outcome up to day 90. The difference in the incidences of the combined endpoint at 3 months between treatment arms will be estimated and tested using a normal approximation of the binomial distribution. All tests will be conducted at the two-sided 0.05 significance level.</description>

          2. Both males and females&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Confirmed acute calf vein thrombosis confined to either the deep (posterior tibial,&#xD;
             anterior tibial, or peroneal) or muscular (gastrocnemius or soleal) veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test done (within 2 weeks) prior to randomization,&#xD;
             for women of childbearing potential only. Note: A woman of childbearing potential&#xD;
             (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not&#xD;
             undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) and is not&#xD;
             postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45&#xD;
             years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any of the following because this study involves an investigational agent whose&#xD;
             genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are&#xD;
             unknown:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Nursing women&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate&#xD;
                  contraception Note: Women of child bearing potential must agree to follow&#xD;
                  instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with&#xD;
                  study drug(s) plus 33 days after finishing the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for&#xD;
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 93&#xD;
             days after finishing the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt&#xD;
             from contraceptive requirements. However they must still undergo pregnancy testing as&#xD;
             described in this section.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with&#xD;
             WOCBP on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected&#xD;
             pregnancy Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active&#xD;
             with WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective&#xD;
             methods of contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
             At a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of one method of highly effective&#xD;
             contraception as listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male condoms with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills,&#xD;
                  vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as&#xD;
                  Mirena® by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female partners of male subjects participating in the study may use hormone based&#xD;
                  contraceptives as one of the acceptable methods of contraception since they will&#xD;
                  not be receiving study drug,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IUDs such as ParaGard®,&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Complete Abstinence* *Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of&#xD;
                  heterosexual intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study&#xD;
                  drugs. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be&#xD;
                  discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Acute co-existing proximal DVT (popliteal, femoral, iliac veins or IVC), pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism, splanchnic vein thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis within the past&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Significant kidney disease. Creatinine clearance &lt; 25 ml/min using the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
             equation: glomerular filtration rate (GFR) = (140-age) * (Wt in kg) * (0.85 if female)&#xD;
             / (72 * Cr). (within last four weeks)&#xD;
