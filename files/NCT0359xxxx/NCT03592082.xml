    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficle infection is the leading cause of hospital acquired infection and&#xD;
      infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients. Eradication treatment for this infection is the&#xD;
      challenging tasks for clinicians due to treatment resistance developed from new hypervirulent&#xD;
      strains. The recurrence rate of this infection is around 20% and there is high&#xD;
      likelihood(60-70%) of another episode after index recurrence. Given constant challenge new&#xD;
      treatment options are under study. Aim of the study is to evaluate if use of bismuth&#xD;
      subsalicylate (BSS) can decrease the length of stay in patients admitted with Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile infection. Secondarily investigators will also see if there is any impact of BSS in&#xD;
      decrease the recurrence.&#xD;

      Clostridium difficile (C.Diff) infection is the leading cause of hospital acquired infection&#xD;
      and infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients. Eradication treatment for this infection is&#xD;
      the challenging task for clinicians due to treatment resistance developed from new&#xD;
      hypervirulent strains. The recurrence rate of this infection is around 20% and there is high&#xD;
      likelihood (60-70%) of another episode after index recurrence. Given constant challenges new&#xD;
      treatment options are under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine if the addition of bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) (the&#xD;
      active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol) 524 mg ((2) 262 mg tablets) given four times per day for&#xD;
      14 days to standard of care treatment of C.Diff will decrease the length of stay and decrease&#xD;
      the time to resolution of C.Diff symptoms compared to patients who received standard of care&#xD;
      treatment for C.Diff alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bismuth subsalicylate has been used for long time in infectious diarrhea and is over the&#xD;
      counter drug with few side effects. Studies in hamsters have shown bismuth subsalicylate to&#xD;
      be effective in treating C.Diff. Investigators believe given cheaper cost and less side&#xD;
      effect profile this drug is worth looking for treatment of C.Diff infection which has a huge&#xD;
      burden on health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, randomized, controlled trial. Hospitalized patients aged 18 years or&#xD;
      older with positive stool test for C.Diff toxin will be randomized to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive standard of care treatment for C.Diff alone Group 2 will receive BSS 524&#xD;
      mg four times daily for 14 days along with standard of care treatment Oral antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      will be limited to oral vancomycin 125 mg every 6 hours daily which is the standard dose for&#xD;
      the treatment of clostridium difficile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of stay and time to resolution of symptoms will be measured and compared between the&#xD;
      two treatment groups as primary outcomes. Resolution of symptoms is defined has having &lt; 3&#xD;
      diarrheal episodes in 24 hours. The study will also record episodes of recurrence, defined as&#xD;
      the reappearance of symptoms within 8 weeks of the completion of antibiotic treatment and the&#xD;
      resolution of initial symptoms. Recurrence rates will be compared between the two treatment&#xD;
      groups as a secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Groups 1 &amp; 2 will have 2 week and 8 week follow up phone calls. Group 1 participants&#xD;
      will be called 2 weeks after consent/enrollment in the study to verify antibiotic therapy is&#xD;
      completed, verify when/if CDiff symptoms resolved, collect data about any adverse events.&#xD;
      Group 2 participants will be called 2 weeks after the initiation of study drug (which should&#xD;
      be &lt; 24 hours after consent). The visit window will start on the day the participant is&#xD;
      scheduled to complete study drug. The purpose of the call will be to verify that both&#xD;
      antibiotics and study drug have been completed, verify when/if CDiff symptoms resolved, and&#xD;
      collect data about any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Groups 1 and 2 participants will be called 8 weeks after the expected (or known)&#xD;
      completion date of antibiotic therapy prescribed for the treatment of CDiff to see if CDiff&#xD;
      symptoms have recurred and if there have been any adverse events..&#xD;
