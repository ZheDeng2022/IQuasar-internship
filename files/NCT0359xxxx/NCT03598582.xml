  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigators would like to understand why a small percentage of patients&#xD;
      will be refractory to ESA (independently of International prognostic scoring system (IPSS)&#xD;
      and % of blasts). In a retrospective study of the &quot;Groupe Francophone des Myélodysplasies&#xD;
      (GFM)&quot; , the investigators showed that about 43% of patients are refractory or will relapse&#xD;
      after initial response to ESA and it has been shown that these patients have a poorer&#xD;
      survival. The investigators plan to give a 12-week treatment of Epoetin alfa or zeta in low&#xD;
      risk MDS patients and measure different biological factors to predict response to ESA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation by flow cytometry before and after treatment of the degree of&#xD;
           dyserythropoiesis and dysgranulopoiesis which could explain the primary resistance or&#xD;
           loss of response of a subset of patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  screening by molecular biology of predictive factors of response to ESA,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iron homeostasis will be measured via hepcidin, GDF-15 and ferritin levels.&#xD;

      Lower risk MDS patients, with LOW and INT-1 IPSS score, with anemia Hb&lt;10g/dl, requiring or&#xD;
      not Red blood cel (RBC) transfusions, treated by erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA)&#xD;
      according to national French recommendations ( epoetin zeta 40000 UI/week in lower risk MDS,&#xD;
      &lt;10% blasts, with Hb&lt;10g/dl and sEPO&lt;500UI/l, for 12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BM aspirates are collected prospectively at T0 and at W12 of ESA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BM aspirates will be collected prospectively at inclusion in all 70 patients, after 12 weeks,&#xD;
      in 70 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fresh bone marrow samples will be centralized at Cochin hospital for flow cytometry analysis&#xD;
      of dyserythropoiesis and gene sequencing (Hematology laboratory, Cochin, Paris). &quot;Ogata flow&#xD;
      cytometry score&quot; will be assessed locally in Mulhouse, Creteil, Tours, Grenoble or Cochin.&#xD;
      Patients have been reevaluated at week 12 by flow cytometry &quot;Ogata score&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood plasma will be been collected for analysis of GDF-15 and hepcidin, and sent to Cochin&#xD;
      (Institut Cochin, Paris). Hepcidin level was measured by LC-MS/MS method in Louis Mourier&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Red score analysis was done in a centralized manner in Cochin, according to the methods&#xD;
      described previously. Basically, it was evaluated on CD36, CD71 CV and Hb level according to&#xD;
      the gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic studies and Bioinformatic analysis Mutations in a selected panel of 39 genes will be&#xD;
      screened in the 70 samples by a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification and Statistical analysis Sample size computation was based on the&#xD;
      secondary endpoint which was the response rate. The investigators expected a response rate of&#xD;
      50-60%, therefore about 30 patients will be responders and 30 patients non responders. With&#xD;
      10%-15% of non evaluable biological data, n=70 patients should be included.&#xD;
