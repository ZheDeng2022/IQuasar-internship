  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors of the lung include the small cell carcinoma (SCLC), and large cell&#xD;
      neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and represent 20% of lung cancer. One of the only studies&#xD;
      reported to date is reporting on a progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      of 5.2 months and 7.7 months, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poorly differentiated gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (GEP-NEC) represent a&#xD;
      small sub-group of digestive NENs, according to the studies, 7 to 21% of patients. However,&#xD;
      their prognosis is more negative, with the 5-year survival at less than 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many Phase III trials showed superiority in terms of efficacy and tolerance of&#xD;
      nivolumab+/-ipilimumab versus standard chemotherapy in second-line treatment in metastatic&#xD;
      solid tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors are considered as rare disease without therapeutic&#xD;
      guidelines in this setting. The French academic oncology groups (IFCT, FFCD and GERCOR) have&#xD;
      the opportunity to recruit a sufficient number of patients, in a reasonable period of time,&#xD;
      to provide a proof-of-concept of the safety and efficacy of nivolumab+/-ipilimumab in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
