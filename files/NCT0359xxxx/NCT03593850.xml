    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as lower abdominal pain that occurs during menses and is not&#xD;
      secondary to any type of pelvic disease. It is considered the most common condition in&#xD;
      reproductive age women. First line of treatment are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDS), or oral contraceptives (OCC). This two forms of treatment have not demonstrated&#xD;
      100% efficacy, and adverse events and contraindications for both exist. Moreover, studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated that an important women do not use, or don't like to use, pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment. Music have demonstrated analgesic effects in different clinical contexts, and has&#xD;
      emerged as an important form of complementary therapy in the management of pain. To the&#xD;
      researcher's knowledge, no studies have been conducted to evaluate music's effectiveness in&#xD;
      pain secondary to primary dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is the protocol for a randomized, single blinded, clinical trial, where an&#xD;
      experimental group listened to a 30 minute song, and was compared to a control group that&#xD;
      rest in silence for the same time and conditions. It was expected that music will produce a&#xD;
      larger, and significant, effect on pain reduction when compared to the control silence group&#xD;
      according to pain measured through a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in young women from&#xD;
      the School of Medicine and Health Sciences at the Universidad del Rosario, Bogota DC,&#xD;
      Colombia. Additionally, the investigators wanted to evaluate the clinical effect of music and&#xD;
      analgesic requirements, anxiety and vital signs were also measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Dysmenorrhea (PD) is defined as pain in the lower abdomen, that occurs always during&#xD;
      menses, in the absence of pelvic pathology, and lasts about 24-72 hours. It initiates during&#xD;
      the first 24 months after menarche. Other symptoms like, emotional lability, anxiety, nausea,&#xD;
      headache, and others may accompany the pain. It is considered the most common condition of&#xD;
      reproductive age women, and is considered one of the most important causes for school or work&#xD;
      absence in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music has been proposed as a complementary therapy for the management of pain, and a large&#xD;
      body of clinical evidence supports its use on clinical context. Additionally, functional&#xD;
      imaging research has found that music activates areas related to pain modulation and&#xD;
      perception like the periaqueductal gray matter. Moreover music seems to modify brain activity&#xD;
      during pain perception. Music has been shown to be effective in relieving pain secondary to&#xD;
      surgery, in cancer related pain, and other types of pain, but it has not been studied for&#xD;
      primary dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical trial was designed with the following objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of music listening, compared to a control group&#xD;
      that rested in silence, in the painful experience secondary to primary dysmenorrhea in women&#xD;
      of 18 years or older from the School of Medicine and Health Sciences at the Universidad del&#xD;
      Rosario, Bogotá DC., Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Description of demographic data, clinical, gynecological, and obstetric background from&#xD;
           the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description of pain management, secondary to PD, used by the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the usual pain secondary to PD, as reported by the study participants through a&#xD;
           Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore if the acute perception of pain secondary to PD, as reported by participants&#xD;
           using a VAS, before the intervention, is different between the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate if the acute perception of pain secondary to PD, as reported by participants&#xD;
           using a VAS, after the intervention, differs between those that listened to music and&#xD;
           those that rested in silence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To explore if a difference in the reduction of pain, as reported by participants using a&#xD;
           VAS, from the moment before to the moment after the intervention exists between those in&#xD;
           the music group compared to those in the silence group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To evaluate if the acute perception of pain secondary to PD, as reported by participants&#xD;
           using a VAS, 3-6 hours after the intervention, differs between those that listened to&#xD;
           music and those that rested in silence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To evaluate if the anxiety secondary to PD, as reported by participants using a&#xD;
           validated Spanish short version of the Zung scale, differs between groups, before and&#xD;
           after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To evaluate if a difference in the reported requirements of analgesic drugs is different&#xD;
           between the study groups after and 3-6 hours after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To evaluate if a difference in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure is&#xD;
           identified between groups, using a previously calibrated digital sphyngmomanometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that listening to an instrumental song, unknown to the&#xD;
      patient, will have a significant effect on pain relief. Additionally, investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that music listening will have a clinical effect big enough to also impact&#xD;
      analgesic requirements and anxiety scores .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint was pain reduction from the moment before to after the intervention. Pain&#xD;
      reduction is the better way to evaluate analgesia efficacy and was the proper approach for&#xD;
      these protocol's main objective, which was efficacy of music on pain relief secondary to&#xD;
      primary dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For achieving these aims and answering research questions, a randomized clinical trial was&#xD;
      designed. As patients can't be blinded from listening or not to music, a single blinded&#xD;
      approach was decided. Furthermore, methodology for recruitment was designed to blind patients&#xD;
      from allocation until the day of the intervention and a speech was used to avoid patients to&#xD;
      identify the primary endpoint. Additionally, patients were explained that two interventions&#xD;
      were used, but it was not specified that silence group was the control group, to assure&#xD;
      proper blinding and avoid further bias of results. Silence was decided as a control&#xD;
      intervention as comparison with drug placebo may not be adequate due to differences in the&#xD;
      types of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To isolate the music effects the investigators decided on using a completely new and unknown&#xD;
      song. The song was planned and composed exclusively for the research, so all patients&#xD;
      allocated to the music group listened to the exact same musical piece.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Computer block randomization was used to generate allocation sequence of codes. Allocation was done on the same day of the intervention, patients were given opaque envelope according to the randomization codes. The envelop contained instructions to access the allocated intervention. After baseline data collection patients entered the intervention room and opened the envelop inside while investigator waited outside. Both patients had headphones on and used the same device to access the intervention assuring blinding of the investigator. After the intervention ended, patient closed the intervention file and account to the intervention. All patients were instructed to nor reveal or comment anything about the intervention at any time after the intervention was completed.</masking_description>

The song was composed entirely by investigator Juan Martin-Saavedra and registered to copyright and authorship regulatory entities from Colombia under the name &quot;Occasio adolore&quot; (Musical piece No. 5-559-355 and Phonogram No. 12-105-295 of Colombia's Copyright authorship agency). Patients were instructed to avoid using cellphones or other activities during the time of the intervention. Patients receive the intervention in the same room as the Silence group, but for the intervention they were always alone.
