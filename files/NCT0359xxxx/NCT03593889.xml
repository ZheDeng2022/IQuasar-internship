  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop a viable and sustainable best practice model to promote elderly mental wellness&#xD;
      and prevent elderly depression for Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has&#xD;
      initiated a pilot holistic support project entitled &quot;JC JoyAge: Holistic Support Project for&#xD;
      Elderly Mental Wellness&quot;. Commenced in October 2016, this 3-year project will deliver six&#xD;
      programmes: (1) social services staff training; (2) peer supporters certificate training; (3)&#xD;
      outreach and engagement activities for at-risk older adults; (4) standardized prevention and&#xD;
      early intervention service; (5) community education programmes; and (6) public awareness and&#xD;
      public education activities in four pilot districts in Hong Kong, namely Kwun Tong, Sham Shui&#xD;
      Po, Kwai Chung, and Tseung Kwan O. The project aims specifically to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effectiveness of a collaborative stepped care and peer support programme in&#xD;
           engaging older people at-risk of or with depression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the efficacy of the programme in reducing symptoms/risks and promoting&#xD;
           wellbeing in older people at-risk of or with depression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate the impact of the programme on care resources utilization in these older&#xD;
           adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly depression is a neglected problem affecting our entire society with grave&#xD;
      consequences and high societal costs. Early intervention and prevention can be effective in&#xD;
      addressing the problem. The challenges in implementing early intervention and prevention&#xD;
      within the existing service platforms, however, are threefold: (1) fragmented services; (2)&#xD;
      reactive services; and (3) stigma and low awareness. These challenges resulted in the current&#xD;
      service overload and mismatch, which will be compounded by rapid population ageing and mental&#xD;
      health workforce shrinkage. The study can address these challenges by (1) realigning existing&#xD;
      mental health and elderly services; (2) productive ageing for outreach and engagement; and&#xD;
      (3) building up capacity of a preventive network in the neighbourhood. This pilot project&#xD;
      therefore combines models of collaborative stepped care and productive ageing, with&#xD;
      systematic education programmes, to empower the neighbourhood in providing effective early&#xD;
      intervention and prevention for elderly depression. In the four representative pilot&#xD;
      districts of Kwun Tong, Sham Shui Po, Kwai Chung, and Tseung Kwan O, community mental health&#xD;
      and elderly services will collaborate to deliver a stepped care service protocol for&#xD;
      preventing and detecting elderly depression. In 3 years, this project will deliver six&#xD;
      programmes: (1) social services staff training; (2) peer supporters certificate training; (3)&#xD;
      outreach and engagement activities for at-risk older adults; (4) standardized prevention and&#xD;
      early intervention service; (5) community education programmes; and (6) public awareness and&#xD;
      public education activities. This will produce a mature service model tested in one-fifth of&#xD;
      the districts in Hong Kong with different demographic and service characteristics; create a&#xD;
      strong team of Peer Supporters and Social Workers in Elderly Mental Health with clinical&#xD;
      competence in preventing elderly depression and promoting elderly mental wellness;&#xD;
      significantly raise public and neighbourhood awareness and care for elderly mental wellness;&#xD;
      reach out and serve 2,880 at-risk older adults and 960 depressed older adults; and provide&#xD;
      evidence on the social impact of the model for further service rollout.&#xD;
