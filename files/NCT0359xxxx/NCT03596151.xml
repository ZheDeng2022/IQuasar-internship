    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study with a minimum of three sites in the United States. The study&#xD;
      will enroll approximately 1750 female subjects and will have a study duration of&#xD;
      approximately 9 months after enrollment of the first subject. Female subjects seen at the&#xD;
      participating sites for any reason will be evaluated for enrollment in this study. All&#xD;
      subjects will be managed per standard of care as applicable. Subjects who are enrolled in the&#xD;
      study will perform self-collection of a vaginal swab to be tested by Click device, and allow&#xD;
      the health care provider (HCP) to collect three additional vaginal swabs to be tested by&#xD;
      recognized FDA-cleared comparator methods. Subjects will complete the study in a single&#xD;
      visit. The primary objective is to assess the performance of the Click device for detection&#xD;
      of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) in&#xD;
      self-collected vaginal specimens as compared to Patient Infected Status (PIS) determined by&#xD;
      three approved comparator assays using vaginal specimens collected by a qualified HCP in&#xD;
      support of obtaining FDA clearance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center study with a minimum of three Clinical Laboratory Improvement&#xD;
      Amendments-waived (CLIA-waived) intended operator sites in the United States; approximately&#xD;
      one-third of the total number of sites will have a patient population of low Neisseria&#xD;
      gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) prevalence. Low&#xD;
      prevalence sites are defined as sites with a prevalence &lt; / = 2% for any of the three&#xD;
      targets. Sites with a prevalence higher than 2% for any of the three targets will be defined&#xD;
      as high prevalence sites. The study will enroll approximately 1750 female subjects and will&#xD;
      have a study duration of approximately 9 months after enrollment of the first subject.&#xD;
      Approximately one-third of the total subjects shall be recruited from low prevalence sites&#xD;
      for the infections of interest. Female subjects seen at the participating sites for any&#xD;
      reason will be evaluated for enrollment in this study. All subjects will be managed per&#xD;
      standard of care as applicable. Subjects who are enrolled in the study will perform&#xD;
      self-collection of a vaginal swab to be tested by Click device, and allow the health care&#xD;
      provider (HCP) to collect three additional vaginal swabs to be tested by recognized&#xD;
      FDA-cleared comparator methods. Subjects will complete the study in a single visit. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of this study is that the identification of each organism (CT, NG, and TV) in&#xD;
      self-collected vaginal swabs by women using the Click device will agree with the Patient&#xD;
      Infected Status (PIS) with a high sensitivity and specificity. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      assess the performance of the Click device for detection of CT, NG, and TV in self-collected&#xD;
      vaginal specimens as compared to PIS determined by three approved comparator assays using&#xD;
      vaginal specimens collected by a qualified HCP in support of obtaining FDA clearance. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are: 1) to assess the performance of the Click device for detection of&#xD;
      CT, NG, and TV in self-collected vaginal specimens among symptomatic subjects as compared to&#xD;
      PIS determined by three approved comparator assays using vaginal specimens collected by a&#xD;
      qualified HCP; 2) to assess the performance of the Click device for detection of CT, NG, and&#xD;
      TV in self-collected vaginal specimens among asymptomatic subjects as compared to PIS&#xD;
      determined by three approved comparator assays using vaginal specimens collected by a&#xD;
      qualified HCP.&#xD;

        <title>The Percent Sensitivity and Percent Specificity of Click Device for Detection of Chlamydia Trachomatis (CT) in Self-collected Vaginal Specimens as Compared to Patient Infection Status (PIS) Using Vaginal Specimens Collected by a Qualified HCP</title>

          <title>The Percent Sensitivity and Percent Specificity of Click Device Using Self-collected Vaginal Swabs for Detection of TV as Compared to PIS Using Vaginal Specimens Collected by a Qualified HCP Among Asymptomatic Participants.</title>
          <description>The sensitivity of the Click device is defined as follows:&#xD;
TP = the number of specimens where both the Click result and the PIS designation are Positive; FN = the number of specimens where the Click result is Negative and the PIS designation is Positive; Sensitivity = 100 * TP / (TP + FN)&#xD;
The specificity of the Click device is defined as follows:&#xD;
TN = the number of specimens where both the Click result and the PIS designation are Negative; FP = the number of specimens where the Click result is Positive and the PIS designation is Negative; Specificity = 100 * TN / (TN + FP)</description>
          <population>This population includes all asymptomatic participants with samples that provide an evaluable Click Diagnostics Sexual Health Test result and an evaluable PIS result for TV. An evaluable result is indicated if both the Click device and the PIS provide a valid positive or negative result. If a participant reported &quot;Yes&quot; to any of the symptoms on the Clinical Symptoms Assessment form, the participant is classified as Symptomatic. Otherwise, the participant is classified as &quot;Asymptomatic&quot;.</population>
