      The specific objectives focus on using a train-the-trainer model to educate CHWs in Pakistan&#xD;
      on performing and interpreting pediatric lung POCUS. In the first phase, the POCUS experts&#xD;
      from Toronto will rigorously train the first generation of local lung POCUS users who are&#xD;
      Pakistani health care providers to become local lung POCUS trainers. These first generation&#xD;
      trainers will subsequently collaborate with the POCUS experts from Toronto to develop a&#xD;
      two-day training program for lung POCUS image interpretation and acquisition that is tailored&#xD;
      to novice users (CHWs) in low-resource settings. In the second phase, the first generation&#xD;
      local lung POCUS trainers will deliver and evaluate the new training program to the second&#xD;
      generation of users - a group of CHWs in Karachi. In the third phase, we will establish the&#xD;
      reliability of CHWs to perform lung POCUS on pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms,&#xD;
      upon completion of the training program developed by local trainers.&#xD;

      POCUS is an example of technologies that are moving out of hospitals and to the&#xD;
      point-of-care. The true potential of these novel diagnostics to improve global pediatric&#xD;
      pneumonia outcomes will only be realized if they can be employed by CHWs in community&#xD;
      settings in LMICs. No work has yet focused on the performance of POCUS by&#xD;
      non-medically-trained CHWs in LMICs. Demonstrating that accurate POCUS performance and&#xD;
      interpretation can be achieved by non-medically-trained CHWs after focused and succinct&#xD;
      training is the first step towards developing a novel pediatric pneumonia diagnosis and&#xD;
      management algorithm for LMICs. Feedback from these ultrasound-na√Øve users about their lung&#xD;
      POCUS learning experience is also needed to clarify which POCUS findings would be best suited&#xD;
      to this algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team in AKUH will recruit and consent interested CHWs from AKU field sites in&#xD;
      Karachi. The target is to recruit a convenience sample of 3 CHWs, who will be as&#xD;
      representative as possible of the experience and skill sets as the average CHW in a&#xD;
      government program. Study participants will be identified and approached by clinical team&#xD;
      members in the AKUH emergency department, outpatient clinic and pediatric ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triaging children with ARI into accurate treatment categories will lead to increased&#xD;
      paediatric pneumonia survival, improved antibiotic stewardship, and more appropriate resource&#xD;
      use, all of which are clinically and programmatically significant in highest disease burden&#xD;
      settings. This project also lays the foundation for future projects that harness the&#xD;
      trans-formative potential of POCUS for global child health.&#xD;

    <measure>primary outcome of interest will be the inter-rater reliability of lung POCUS findings (on a cohort of patients at AKUH with ARI) between the newly trained CHWs and a local lung POCUS trainer.</measure>

    <description>Proportion of CHWs undergoing training in lung POCUS with a passing score 80% in a computer-based test (consisting of 60 lung POCUS video clips) with questions to determine their image interpretation skills as a reflection of technical performance. On completion of training program, they will perform lung POCUS on pediatric patients presenting to Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) with respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
For primary outcome of inter-rater reliability, the Cohen's kappa statistic will be calculated using standardized formulas. in the end will be describing the kappa statistic between final interpretations (overall and for each lung zone) of each scan by the CHWs as compared to the POCUS expert.</description>

    <description>the assessment of the first generation local lung trainers will include:&#xD;

5 mentored scans observed by POCUS experts&#xD;
20 lung scans with quality assurance performed by POCUS experts&#xD;
Upon completion of the Train the trainer phase, the first generation users will be deemed qualified local lung POCUS trainers.
