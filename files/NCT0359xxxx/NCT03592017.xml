  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fundus autofluorescence imaging has become an important diagnostic tool in ophthalmology,&#xD;
      guiding diagnosis and assessment of progression of retinal diseases. This study investigates&#xD;
      the performance of optimized long-wavelength autofluorescence imaging. To achieve this goal,&#xD;
      the investigators will determine an optimal long wavelength excitation light and investigate&#xD;
      the autofluorescence signal intensity in normals and patients with different retinal&#xD;
      diseases. The diagnostic performance of the long-wavelength autofluorescence will be&#xD;
      evaluated by assessing sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing a variety of degenerative&#xD;
      retinal diseases and by comparing it to conventional autofluorescence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fundus autofluorescence (AF) imaging of the retina with confocal scanning laser&#xD;
      ophthalmoscopy has been established as a non-invasive imaging modality for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      retinal and macular diseases. Long-wavelength near-infrared autofluorescence (excitation: 787&#xD;
      nm, LW-AF) is a new, innovative alternative to the classic autofluorescence imaging using 488&#xD;
      nm blue excitation light. Excitation of the fluorophores at the ocular fundus using a longer&#xD;
      wavelength has several advantages. However, with the current imaging technique the&#xD;
      autofluorescence signal and thus image quality is considerably lower compared to conventional&#xD;
      short-wavelength autofluorescence (SW-AF). This may be the main reason for the currently&#xD;
      limited application and scarce scientific publications on this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the performance of an optimized setup of&#xD;
      long-wavelength autofluorescence imaging in clinical routine applications. For this purpose,&#xD;
      additional laser sources will be integrated into a scanning laser ophthalmoscope and the&#xD;
      performance with regards to image quality will be investigated systematically using different&#xD;
      excitation wavelengths and filter combinations in healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a next step, the signal intensity will be quantified using an integrated fluorescent&#xD;
      reference. First, factors affecting measurements will be identified, followed by generation&#xD;
      of a normative database. Subjects with various retinal diseases will then be investigated and&#xD;
      compared to the normative database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the diagnostic performance of long-wavelength autofluorescence imaging to detect&#xD;
      retinal degenerative diseases will be investigated and compared to conventional imaging&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Long-wavelength autofluorescence imaging</intervention_name>
    <description>Long-wavelength autofluorescence imaging will be performed with a prototype confocal scanning laser (cSLO) ophthalmoscope which will be equipped with additional laser sources and a reference for quantification of the signal. The experimental long-wavelength laser sources will be integrated into a custom-modified Spectralis HRA cSLO from Heidelberg Engineering. The additional laser sources will operate with long wavelength which are less energetic compared to the conventional short-wavelength lasers used currently for routine autofluorescence imaging. All safety standards have been considered and the light exposure for all imaging modes is well below the exposure limits for Class 1 and Class1M laser products as defined in the standard IEC 60825-1, edition 3.0, 2014-5.</description>
