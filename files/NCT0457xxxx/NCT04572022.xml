  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proximal humerus fracture patient's upper limb complete function restoration mainly depends&#xD;
      on patient rehabilitation exercises. One time teaching in clinic is usually not sufficient&#xD;
      for patients to learn their rehabilitation exercises. This leads to delayed patient recovery&#xD;
      and dis-satisfaction to treatment provided by health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is that mobile health technology might facilitate patient to easily access health&#xD;
      related teaching information other than routine care to support patient in their self-health&#xD;
      care management thus leading to proximal humerus fracture patient treatment outcome&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile health technology positively improves clinical and functional outcomes of proximal&#xD;
      humerus fracture using validated outcome scoring scales.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Patient-centered, open labelled, parallel (1:1), pilot randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total 60 subjects required with 30 in each arm in 24-month duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proximal humerus rehabilitation exercises video will be prepared after obtaining written&#xD;
           informed consent from designated orthopaedic residents/surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients of 18 to 58 years of age with trauma associated proximal humerus fractures, who&#xD;
           or their attendants are willing to participate. Patients who requires special care,&#xD;
           patient not willing to exercise at home without physiotherapist support or participate&#xD;
           in survey questionnaire and patients who does not have facility of classic blue tooth&#xD;
           connectivity will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Written informed consent will be administered the study subjects as per GCP guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Each eligible patient will be randomized into intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Intervention group: Classic Blue tooth technology will be utilized for&#xD;
                interoperable solution of teaching video information sharing from doctor to&#xD;
                patient. The end users will be enrolled trauma associated proximal humerus fracture&#xD;
                patients whether treated surgically or conservatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Control group: Routine care will be provided to control group and as per routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patient will be followed at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months. Data will be collected on Case&#xD;
           report form by assigned person. Clinical and functional outcomes will be assessed by&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to complex anatomy with delayed recovery of proximal humerus fracture patients, there is&#xD;
      high need of optimal treatment planning and care delivery process improvement to achieve&#xD;
      better treatment outcomes. For current study, musculoskeletal service line at AKU will&#xD;
      implement mobile health application specifically for proximal humerus trauma associated&#xD;
      fracture patients which is simple to use. Internationally physiotherapy specialty related&#xD;
      specific exercises are applied which is bit different from current study in the context of&#xD;
      specialty and application. Mostly their focus is on rehabilitation of cases like scoliosis,&#xD;
      dementia etc. This is the first time that orthopaedic specialty related, trauma associated,&#xD;
      proximal humerus fracture specific modules will be developed with no advance IT based&#xD;
      software application due to limited resources and to adhere to the patient data&#xD;
      confidentiality. The application will be simple and user-friendly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For current pilot trial research question is whether mobile health app. improve proximal&#xD;
      humerus fracture patient treatment outcomes compared to standard care? Adhering to patient&#xD;
      data confidentiality, our aim is that mobile health technology might facilitate patient to&#xD;
      easily access health related teaching information other than routine care to support patient&#xD;
      in their self-health care management thus leading to proximal humerus fracture patient&#xD;
      treatment outcome improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As proximal humerus fracture patient upper limb complete function restoration mainly depends&#xD;
      on patient rehabilitation exercises, one time teaching in clinic by surgeons or&#xD;
      physiotherapist is usually not sufficient for patients to learn their home rehabilitation&#xD;
      exercises in routine practice. This leads to delayed patient recovery and dis-satisfaction to&#xD;
      treatment provided by health care providers. Besides standard care, administering teaching&#xD;
      video teaching modules with the help of mobile technology specifically for proximal humerus&#xD;
      fracture patients might improve patient complete function restoration. Thus, mobile health&#xD;
      strategy possibly will assist orthopaedic clinical team to reduce patient visit time, improve&#xD;
      patient clinical and functional outcomes with increase in patient satisfaction and quick&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile health technology positively improves clinical and functional outcomes of proximal&#xD;
      humerus fracture using validated outcome scoring scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To improve adult proximal humerus fracture patient's clinical and functional&#xD;
                outcomes using validated outcome scoring scales resulting in timely recovery within&#xD;
                four months post procedure with resumption of approximately 80% of patient upper&#xD;
                limb function with the help of patient self-health care capacity using mobile&#xD;
                health app.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To compare patient clinical and functional outcomes by validated scoring scales&#xD;
                between using mobile health app versus standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objective: To increase patient and doctor satisfaction rate in perspective&#xD;
           with treatment provision usefully by digital technology application and health&#xD;
           information sharing in health care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum sample size that investigator will require is 60 with 30 in intervention arm and&#xD;
      30 in control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Patient-centered, open labelled, parallel (1:1), pilot randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. (Intervention group receive proximal humerus fracture care with mobile health shared&#xD;
      rehabilitation teaching video instructions and control group will receive routine care for&#xD;
      proximal humerus fracture as recommended by the treating surgeons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: Study procedures will comply with all necessary ethical, Institutional and&#xD;
      legal requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In first step of the study, written informed consent will be obtained from designated&#xD;
           orthopaedic residents/surgeon prior to video production. Proximal humerus rehabilitation&#xD;
           exercises video will be prepared by orthopaedic resident or surgeon under observation of&#xD;
           participating surgeon's expertise in which step wise rehabilitation exercises will be&#xD;
           demonstrated exclusively for patient's teaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient eligibility criteria: Patients of 18 to 58 years of age with trauma associated&#xD;
           proximal humerus fractures, presented at Orthopaedic inpatient and outpatient units, AKU&#xD;
           who or their attendants are willing to follow the rehabilitation instructions via mobile&#xD;
           application at home until completion of study follow up visits and agree to participate&#xD;
           in very small survey questionnaire in the end of study will be selected. Patients who in&#xD;
           special circumstances requiring special care and handling by expert health care&#xD;
           providers, patient not willing to exercise at home without physiotherapist support or&#xD;
           participate in survey questionnaire and patients who does not have facility of classic&#xD;
           blue tooth connectivity for video download will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Written informed consent will be administered by designated person as per good clinical&#xD;
           practice guideline and obtained from the study subjects within the time of initial&#xD;
           hospital arrival to follow-up within 21days post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Randomization: After obtaining written informed consent, on the same day, each eligible&#xD;
           patient will be randomized into intervention or control group by randomly generated&#xD;
           treatment allocation, sealed envelope technique will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Intervention group: Classic Blue tooth technology will be utilized for&#xD;
                interoperable solution of teaching information sharing from doctor to patient. The&#xD;
                end users will be enrolled trauma associated proximal humerus fracture patients&#xD;
                whether treated surgically or conservatively. The video will be divided into 3&#xD;
                modules depending on proximal fracture type. Each module will reflect the necessary&#xD;
                steps of exercises routinely taught by treating surgeons at clinics during&#xD;
                subsequent follow-up visits. The rehabilitation video module (as per fracture type)&#xD;
                will be transferred immediately at first post-procedure patient follow-up. For&#xD;
                assessing patient compliance, it is routine care practice by orthopaedic surgeons&#xD;
                to clinically judge patients for exercise adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Control group: Routine care will be provided to control group and as per routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient follow-ups and Data Collection: Patients will be followed at subsequent visits&#xD;
           after treatment. The patient will be followed at 6Â±1 weeks, 3 months Â±2 weeks and 6Â±1&#xD;
           months. Data will be collected on Case report form by assigned person. Clinical and&#xD;
           functional outcomes will be assessed by assigned person using Quick DASH and Oxford&#xD;
           shoulder score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In order to reduce bias, researchers will be trained on data collection form prior to&#xD;
           data collection. In case of lost to follow-up, patients will be contacted by telephone&#xD;
           to gather necessary information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patient satisfaction questionnaire: At last follow-up, a small questionnaire by research&#xD;
           team will be administered by assigned person to intervention group only about impact of&#xD;
           digital technology application on their health improvement and care outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Doctor satisfaction questionnaire: A small questionnaire by research team will be&#xD;
           administered to assess treating surgeon satisfaction rate for digital technology&#xD;
           application impact on intervention group patients' care and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The research study does not seem to have any potential health hazard. Complying with all&#xD;
           regulatory standards and as per International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical&#xD;
           Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical&#xD;
           Practice (GCP) guidelines, study subjects will be provided optimum care at earliest.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. As per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and GCP definitions and recommendations for&#xD;
           Serious/Adverse event (SAE/AE), any patient who experience SAE/AE, will receive good&#xD;
           clinical care at earliest and all relevant reporting bodies will be notified. Designated&#xD;
           research team member will be responsible to notify the SAE and AE timely to the&#xD;
           Principal Investigator and prepare report with complete event details. Principal&#xD;
           Investigator is responsible for sending reports to the reporting bodies (Ethical Review&#xD;
           Committee, Sponsor etc.) as required, reviewing reports of adverse events (AEs) and&#xD;
           serious adverse events (SAEs) that are submitted by designated research team member,&#xD;
           identify safety concerns quickly and address in the report appropriately&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Study Close-out: Study close-out process will be of two-month duration. Study progress&#xD;
           report and all study closing steps will be carried out during this time with manuscript&#xD;
           writing and study report submission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Method: Non-probability, consecutive sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management Data management, randomization and the statistical analysis will be carried&#xD;
      out at the Department of Surgery. Data entry will be conducted electronically and analyzed on&#xD;
      SPSS version 19.0. Fifteen percent of the data will be double checked/validated by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator. Subject data confidentiality will be maintained by assigning subject&#xD;
      ID, data entry by assigned person only on password protected system and keeping hard copies&#xD;
      in lock and key. After study completion, data will be archived and retained for maximum years&#xD;
      as recommended by Institutional and regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19.0 will be used to analyze data.&#xD;
      Quantitative variables will be expressed as mean Â± standard deviation and qualitative&#xD;
      variables as frequencies (percentages). The efficacy in intervention group on the basis of&#xD;
      successful clinical and functional outcome achievement and the safety in intervention group&#xD;
      on the basis of reported AEs/SAEs will be assessed by intention to treat analysis (ITT). The&#xD;
      p-values for Group comparisons of clinical and functional categorical outcomes will be&#xD;
      generated by chi-square test or Fisher Exact value of less than 0.05 will be considered as&#xD;
      statistically significant with a confidence interval of 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To patient and doctor satisfaction scores will be analyzed using regression analysis. For&#xD;
      Assessment of outcomes at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months Investigator will use repeated&#xD;
      measure ANOVA and generalized estimating equation (GEE). Multiple regression will be used to&#xD;
      assess the association between multiple covariates and numeric outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No specific harm has been demonstrated by limited use of classic blue tooth technology up to&#xD;
      date. Still if any adverse event is encountered like headache due to video based learning,&#xD;
      increasing pain and/or numbness at the affected anatomical site, worsening range of motion&#xD;
      etc., will be reported at the same time to the Institutional and other regulatory authorities&#xD;
      as required and recommended by the Sponsor using telephone and e-mail. SAEs will be reported&#xD;
      within 24 hours of knowing the event via telephone and e-mail. The completed forms will be&#xD;
      submitted in time as recommended by the Sponsor otherwise within 10 days of knowing the&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients would like to withdraw from the study due to any reason, he/she may stop&#xD;
      participating in the research at any time without losing any of his/her patient rights. On&#xD;
      the other hand, if in view of Principal Investigator, the subject is non-compliant and&#xD;
      non-cooperative, he/she has right to withdraw the subject from the research study.&#xD;
