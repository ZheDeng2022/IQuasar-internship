      Main purpose of this study is to determine changes in Vitals caused by Intermittent Occlusion&#xD;
      ( 220 mg ) and to compare the effectiveness of Intermittent Occlusion and Static Stretching&#xD;
      of the lower limb muscle group in preventing the development of exercise induce Muscle&#xD;
      Soreness. As muscle soreness is very major and basis problem of every individual , specially&#xD;
      after enrolling into some physical activity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      First consent form will be given to both male and female participants from 18 to 25 years of&#xD;
      age and after that PAR-Q Questionnaire will be filled for every individual, so that we will&#xD;
      check their readiness for the Exercise then all the four Vitals will measured from every&#xD;
      individual .They will randomly assigned by lottery method to intervention group and control&#xD;
      group. Both group individuals will be exerted by Warm up for 5 mints, heel raise in 3 sets&#xD;
      for 10 to 15 mints until we get 4 on RPE scale, by asking to hold dumbbells of 2 kg on both&#xD;
      of the hands. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) is calculated by Borg grading scale .Plus, leg&#xD;
      circumference, ROM of planter and dorsal flexion and numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) will be&#xD;
      measured for comparison within and between the groups. Again vitals will be monitored.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4th day</time_frame>
    <description>The Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a subjective measure in which individuals rate their pain on an eleven-point numerical scale. The scale is composed of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). It has been shown that a composite scoring system including best, worse, and current level of pain. 27 Recent studies showed that the Majority of patients of all ages and both genders prefer NRS 28. Patients feel this scale of pain measuring technique quite easy and understandable. The benefit of the NRS is that it is validated as well as quick and easy to use.</description>

    <time_frame>4th day</time_frame>
    <description>A goniometer is an instrument which measures the available range of motion at a joint. This can be an indicator of stress which is unavoidable. Many studies showed that The universal goniometer are reliable in repeated measures of joint angles 30 .Manual goniometers can be used with confidence for longitudinal assessments in the clinic</description>

    <description>Tape measurement has been used for decades round measurement or the contour of the Muscle to detect atrophy or hypertrophy of Joint to determine swelling. Research shows that measuring tape is valid and reliable tool for circumference measurements .Circumference measurements taken by spring tape have high reliability</description>

    <description>Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ) clearance has been recommended prior to low-to-moderate exercise involvement. Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ) is safe and effective means of risk stratification for patients interested in becoming more physically active. These results support the concurrent validity of the PARQ and suggest the revisions have had their intended effect</description>

    <description>The pulse rate is a measurement of the heart rate, or the number of times the heart beats per minute which can be felt by the beats by firmly pressing on the arteries, which are located close to the surface of the skin at certain points of the body. In this study we will be using Radial Artery.</description>
