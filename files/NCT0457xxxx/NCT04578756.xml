    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Day 1 to Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (i.e. laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. A TEAE is an AE that occurs or worsens after receiving study drug.</description>
