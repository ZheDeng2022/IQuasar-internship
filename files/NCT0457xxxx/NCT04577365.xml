      Introduction: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) provide clinicians with a greater&#xD;
      understanding of patients' perceived ability in their physical performance. Existing PROMs on&#xD;
      falls efficacy provide meaningful information about the perceived ability in older people to&#xD;
      perform common activities of daily living without falling. However, the perceived ability to&#xD;
      recover the balance from a slip, a trip, or volitional movements has been inadequately&#xD;
      assessed. Balance recovery confidence relates to the judgement of self-reactive ability. The&#xD;
      scale of balance recovery confidence (BRC) is a new PROM that measures perceived balance&#xD;
      recovery self-efficacy. The purpose of the study protocol is to describe the first&#xD;
      psychometric evaluation of BRC's measurement properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: This study is a validation phase of a newly developed PROM conducted in&#xD;
      Singapore. Two hundred community-dwelling older adults, aged 65 years and older, will&#xD;
      complete five self-reported instruments (BRC), Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale&#xD;
      (ABC), Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), Late-Life Function and Disability&#xD;
      Instrument-Function (LLDI-F) and Global Perceived Effect (GPE) and three performance measures&#xD;
      (Hand strength dynamometer, 30-second Chair Stand, Mini BESTest). Classical test theory&#xD;
      methods will assess acceptability, data completeness, targeting of the items, scaling&#xD;
      assumptions, internal consistency reliability and construct validity. Factor analysis will&#xD;
      establish unidimensionality. Rasch analysis will evaluate item fit, differential item&#xD;
      functioning, response scale ordering, targeting of persons and items and the reliability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction: This study aims to conduct the first evaluation of measurement properties in&#xD;
      the scale of balance recovery confidence. There are several measurement properties such as&#xD;
      unidimensionality, validity (to what extent does the instrument measure the construct it&#xD;
      purports to measure) and reliability (the degree to which measurement is free from error) of&#xD;
      the PROM that is needed to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This psychometric validation aims to provide evidence that the PROM can be purposefully used&#xD;
      in practice, given that rigorous methods have been applied for the development and validation&#xD;
      of the BRC. For the study, balance recovery confidence is defined as the perceived ability to&#xD;
      recover one's balance from perturbations, such as a slip, a trip, or a loss of balance that&#xD;
      can occur in common, everyday activities. This focus will leave little ambiguity about&#xD;
      precisely what is being measured. The resulting questionnaire is intended to be approximately&#xD;
      20 questions and should not take longer than 10 min to complete. The instrument is not&#xD;
      intended to be used as a diagnostic tool of impaired specific balance recovery mechanisms.&#xD;
      The BRC allows clinicians and researchers to quantifiably determine the balance recovery&#xD;
      confidence in older adults and use the scale as a conduit for understanding older people's&#xD;
      perspectives when encountering different perturbations during their daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the measurement properties of the BRC, i.e. acceptability, targeting,&#xD;
           scaling assumptions and reliability using Classical Test Theory (CTT), the internal&#xD;
           scale structure using Rasch measurement theory in the Singapore community-dwelling older&#xD;
           adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the construct validity of the refined BRC against commonly used PROMs and&#xD;
           performance measures in the Singapore community-dwelling older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To refine the items, response categories, and scale structure of the BRC using Rasch&#xD;
           measurement theory in an English-speaking sample of community-dwelling older adults in&#xD;
           Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants will attend two sessions in the study. In the first session, the&#xD;
      researcher will use a measurement data form to record the participants' results of four&#xD;
      questionnaires: BRC, ABC, FES-I, LLFDI-F and three performance measures: Jamar hand strength&#xD;
      dynamometer, 30-second chair stand test and Mini BESTest. After seven days, participants will&#xD;
      attend the second session to complete the BRC, and the GPE scale which will be used to ensure&#xD;
      participants' perception of their abilities remained unchanged during the seven days. The&#xD;
      time interval of 7-day had been reported to be sufficient to minimise recall bias.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked if they have had experienced a fall, near-fall, or encountered any&#xD;
      incident that might affect their balance recovery ability over the past seven days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Quantitative data will be analysed and interpreted through two&#xD;
      measurement test theories using IBM SPSS Statistic V.26.0 and Winsteps V.4.5.0. Classical&#xD;
      test theory is a traditional quantitative approach to test the validity and reliability of a&#xD;
      scale based on its items. This approach is based on the assumption that every observed score&#xD;
      is a function of an individual's true score and random error. In contrast, RA works on the&#xD;
      probability of a person's level on an item is a function of the person's ability and of the&#xD;
      difficulty of the item. RA evaluates a scale against a mathematical measurement model and&#xD;
      analyses the scale at the level of each item, and each person. Measurement properties&#xD;
      including unidimensionality, internal structure, validity and reliability will be evaluated.&#xD;
