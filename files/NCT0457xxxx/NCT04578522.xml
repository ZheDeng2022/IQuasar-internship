  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature coronary heart disease (CHD) refers to the onset of myocardial infarction in men &lt;&#xD;
      55 years old, women &lt; 65 years old. At present, researches on early-onset coronary heart&#xD;
      disease mostly focus on its risk factors and clinical characteristics, but there is no&#xD;
      relevant research on the relationship between early-onset myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      atherosclerosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature coronary heart disease is defined as the first onset of male &lt; 55 years old, female&#xD;
      &lt; 65 years old, confirmed by clinical examination. A number of studies have found that&#xD;
      smokers have a significantly increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, and suggest that&#xD;
      continued smoking is still an independent predictor of mace. These findings suggest that&#xD;
      smoking is significantly associated with early-onset coronary heart disease. A number of&#xD;
      studies have found that smoking can increase peripheral arterial stiffness. At present, there&#xD;
      is no study on peripheral arterial stiffness in patients with early-onset myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, so we suspect that peripheral arterial stiffness in patients with early-onset&#xD;
      myocardial infarction is significantly increased&#xD;
