  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to investigate the use of high-dose Vitamin D3 plus a multivitamin in the&#xD;
      prevention of cluster headache attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can be enrolled anywhere in the United States that has access to one of our&#xD;
      participating labs (for blood work - anticipated to be available in most of the USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening: Participants may be interviewed, examined, fill out surveys, and get blood&#xD;
           testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 1: baseline period (no added medications - to establish a baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 2-4: double-blinded experimental period - participants receive either 1) high-dose&#xD;
           Vitamin D3 + multivitamin, or 2) placebo + multivitamin. Participants also fill out a&#xD;
           survey and have blood testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 5-7: open-label period - ALL participants receive high-dose Vitamin D3 +&#xD;
           multivitamin. Participants also fill out a survey and may have blood testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, our primary outcome is the change from baseline to experimental weeks 1-3 in&#xD;
      the frequency of cluster headache attacks between placebo and high-dose vitamin D. Specific&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes are listed below.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of episodic cluster headache according to the International Classification&#xD;
             of Headache Disorders 3rd edition as well as cluster periods that are predictable and&#xD;
             have a duration of 6 weeks or greater and approximately one attack daily minimum OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of chronic cluster headache according to the International Classification&#xD;
             of Headache Disorders 3rd edition as well as approximately one attack daily&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are unlikely to need to change their preventive cluster headache&#xD;
             treatment regimen in the next 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-existing disease or other characteristic that precludes appropriate diagnosis of&#xD;
             cluster headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site&#xD;
             investigator,would interfere with adherence to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness of subject to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to study drug, multivitamin, or placebo components&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation (breastfeeding)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Usage of greater than 4,000 International Units of Vitamin D3 daily within 60 days of&#xD;
             the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of Vitamin D and/or multivitamin along with the inability to stop them&#xD;
             before the study begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver failure or known coagulation disorder (as this study includes vitamin K) such as&#xD;
             haemophilia, von Willebrand disease, Factor V Leiden, Antithrombin III deficiency,&#xD;
             Protein C or S deficiency, or anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A personal medical history of more than 1 deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism (as this study includes vitamin K).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of anticoagulants (as this study includes vitamin K). Anticoagulants&#xD;
             include: apixaban (Eliquis), betrixaban (Bevyxxa), dabigatran (Pradaxa), dalteparin&#xD;
             (Fragmin), edoxaban (Savaysa), enoxaparin (Lovenox), fondaparinux (Arixtra), heparin,&#xD;
             rivaroxiban (Xarelto), and warfarin (Coumadin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of medications that alter vitamin D metabolism, including&#xD;
             steroids,interferon, phenytoin, phenobarbital, digitalis/digoxin, and thiazide&#xD;
             diuretics (such as hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are aware that their most recent labwork in the last 2 years showed&#xD;
             any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels &gt;75 nmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Elevated calcium level&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Elevated phosphate level&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Abnormal parathyroid hormone levels&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Elevated creatinine level&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Of note if any values are outside the acceptable range for the study, candidates&#xD;
                  may still participate in the study if the most recent lab testing is inside the&#xD;
                  acceptable range for the study. For example, if a candididate were taking a&#xD;
                  vitamin or medication that may have caused these elevated levels, but no longer&#xD;
                  take the vitamin or medication, they may be enrolled if retesting is normal.&#xD;
