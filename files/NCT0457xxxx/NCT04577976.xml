  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm study intended to&#xD;
      characterize the safety of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) when used to manage&#xD;
      diabetes in pediatric patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 400 subjects aged 4-17 years and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who&#xD;
      require daily blood glucose monitoring to manage their diabetes will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Subjects and/or their caregivers will utilize capillary SMBG for managing diabetes for&#xD;
      6 months. Subjects and/or their caregivers will maintain a diary/log book of Adverse Events&#xD;
      experienced during the duration of the study. Assessment of Adverse Events will occur via&#xD;
      self reporting at each monthly visit and/or phone call.&#xD;
