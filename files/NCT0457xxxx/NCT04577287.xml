      The objective of the study is thus to compare the effects 5 consecutive sessions of anodal&#xD;
      and cathodal tDCS combined with conventional physical therapy on upper and lower limb motor&#xD;
      performance in acute stroke at immediate, and 1-month followup.&#xD;

      Stroke is a major cause of long-term disability in stroke survivors that related with motor&#xD;
      impairment. After stroke, the cortical excitability of ipsilesional hemisphere is decreased;&#xD;
      in contrast, the cortical excitability of contralesional hemisphere is increased.&#xD;
      Conventional physical therapy is beneficial to motor recovery, but early rehabilitation was&#xD;
      not always help the patients get full recovery. tDCS is an adjuvant tools which deliver weak&#xD;
      direct current through scalp to promote motor recovery in stroke rehabilitation. The&#xD;
      anodal-tDCS increases cortical excitability, while the cathodal-tDCS decreases cortical&#xD;
      excitability. Previous studies demonstrated that both monocephalic techniques of tDCS can&#xD;
      improve motor function in chronic, subacute, and acute phase, but it is still inconclusive&#xD;
      that which monocephalic montages had better effect, especially in acute phase. There are&#xD;
      several studies supported the benefits of monocephalic tDCS combined with rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs on upper and lower limbs motor function in acute stroke. However, there is no&#xD;
      evidence that directly compared the effect of monocephalic tDCS in acute stroke patients. The&#xD;
      objective of the study is to compare the effects of anodal and cathodal tDCS combined with&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy for 5 sessions on motor performance in acute stroke at&#xD;
      immediate, and 1-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) will be applied for 20 mins before conventional physical therapy (about 1 hours). Anodal on the supraorbital area of affected hemisphere, Cathodal on the motor are (M1) of unaffected hemisphere. Current intensity is fixed at 1.5 mA and current will flow continuously. Physical therapist will give an intervention program base on the same basic conventional physical therapy treatment.
