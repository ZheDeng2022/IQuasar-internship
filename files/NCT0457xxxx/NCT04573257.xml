  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a serious threat to human health and a major global economic burden.Chronic&#xD;
      hypertension can cause left ventricular remodeling and loss of function, eventually leading&#xD;
      to heart failure.Exploring the early changes and mechanisms of left ventricular cardiac&#xD;
      function caused by hypertension, and to identify individuals who may develop into serious&#xD;
      heart injury, may play a positive role in the early prevention and control of heart failure&#xD;
      caused by hypertension.Therefore, this study intend to use two-dimensional speckle tracking&#xD;
      technology, a non-invasive method to measure left ventricular pressure-strain loop to&#xD;
      quantitatively reflect cardiac work index , to study different hypertension patients with&#xD;
      normal left ventricular ejection fraction the change of the global and local cardiac work,&#xD;
      and the influence of aterosclerosis in thes patients to myocardial work, and explore their&#xD;
      relationship with ventricular remodeling and abnormal diastolic function.To improve the&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension, hypertensive heart disease and heart&#xD;
      failure, and to provide scientific support for the early prevention and control of such&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

      Hypertension is a serious threat to human health and a major global economic burden.Chronic&#xD;
      hypertension can cause left ventricular remodeling and loss of function, eventually leading&#xD;
      to heart failure. Ventricular remodeling in hypertensive patients is an adaptive and&#xD;
      decompensating response to persistent elevated blood pressure and increased myocardial work&#xD;
      load. Exploring the early changes and mechanisms of left ventricular cardiac function caused&#xD;
      by hypertension, and to identify individuals who may develop into serious heart injury, may&#xD;
      play a positive role in the early prevention and control of heart failure caused by&#xD;
      hypertension.Therefore, this study intend to use two-dimensional speckle tracking technology,&#xD;
      a non-invasive method to measure left ventricular pressure-strain loop to quantitatively&#xD;
      reflect cardiac work index , to study different hypertension patients with normal left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (including hypertension without heart damage performance with&#xD;
      different degree of high blood pressure, hypertension with diastolic dysfunction ,&#xD;
      hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy ) the change of the global and local cardiac&#xD;
      work, and the influence of aterosclerosis in thes patients to myocardial work, and explore&#xD;
      their relationship with ventricular remodeling and abnormal diastolic function.To improve the&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension, hypertensive heart disease and heart&#xD;
      failure, and to provide scientific support for the early prevention and control of such&#xD;
