  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis&#xD;
      (&gt;5%-10% of hepatocytes are fatty) in people without history of excessive alcohol consumption&#xD;
      (&gt;21 drinks/week in men and &gt; 14drinks/week in women) and other disease etiologies that&#xD;
      result in fatty liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of coexisting risk factors such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity&#xD;
      increases the risk of NAFLD. As a consequence of obesity pandemic and type 2 diabetes, an&#xD;
      increased number of patients with NASH-the most severe form of NAFLD-is expected in the near&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the latest epidemiological studies, the prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 25%&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developed countries such as the United States, the prevalence of NAFLD is 30%. In&#xD;
      developing countries such as China, the prevalence has reached up to 32.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAFLD comprises a spectrum of pathological conditions, Including simple steatosis (NAFL),&#xD;
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that approximately one-sixth of NAFL patients progress to NASH, and 20% of&#xD;
      NASH patients can develop cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional view suggests that HCC formation is a multi-stage process, involving&#xD;
      inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, recent research found that NASH can progress&#xD;
      to HCC without fibrosis and cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAFLD patients are often associated with higher risk of developing both cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and type 2diabetes, therefore early diagnosis of NAFLD and intervention would greatly&#xD;
      benefit the patient by preventing the progression of major hepatic and extra hepatic&#xD;
      manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with NAFLD, the most important factor is the assessment of fibrosis severity and&#xD;
      monitoring fibrosis progression. Most patients remain asymptomatic until their liver&#xD;
      functionis compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the identification of the presence and severity of liver fibrosis remains a clinical&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, early predictors need to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple factors are involved in NAFLD development, including lipotoxicity, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, endoplasmic reticulum stress, adipose tissue, gut microbiota, and genetics [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease remains limited because of its broad&#xD;
      range and complexity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver biopsy is the current gold standard in diagnosis and prognosis; nevertheless, it is an&#xD;
      expensive and invasive procedure with high sampling error and risk of complications including&#xD;
      pain bleeding; and, in very rare cases, death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biomarker is a patient characteristic assessed as an indicator of a normal or a pathologic&#xD;
      process or of a biological response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, to date, existing non- or minimally invasive biomarkers are inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating extracellular vesicles (exosomes and ectosomes) contain various cellular&#xD;
      molecules such as proteins, mRNA, miRNAs, and DNA can serve as biomarkers in NAFLD and NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding single stranded RNAs strand of 20-25 nucleotides.&#xD;
      miRNAs play complicated and important roles in regulating the expression of downstream genes&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      MiRNAs contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH at various levels of disease development&#xD;
      and progression and probably are the most extensively studied epigenetic modifications in&#xD;
      NAFLD .&#xD;
&#xD;
      miR-122 is the most abundant miRNA in human liver, representing more than 70% of the total&#xD;
      liver miRNA pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During hepatocytes maturation, miR-122 stimulates the expression of 24 hepatocytes-specific&#xD;
      genes, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF6) [13], and in liver regeneration it has&#xD;
      been reported to regulate hepatocytes proliferation and differentiation, recapitulating the&#xD;
      developmental processes.&#xD;
