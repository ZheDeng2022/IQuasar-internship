      Intra operative hypotension is a risk factor in pediatric anesthesia (McCann ME et al.Pediatr&#xD;
      Anesth 2014; 24: 68-73). In summary, the study aims at examine if ultrasound assessment of&#xD;
      the diameter and collapsibility index of the subclavian vein is correlated to fasting time&#xD;
      and if they are correlated to the degree of hypotension seen post anesthesia induction in&#xD;
      children undergoing general anesthesia.&#xD;

      Background: Intra operative hypotension is a risk factor in pediatric anesthesia (McCann ME&#xD;
      et al.Pediatr Anesth 2014; 24: 68-73). Bedside ultrasonic assessment of the inferior vena&#xD;
      cava (IVC) and IVC collapsibility index (IVCCI) has been shown to indicate fluid status in&#xD;
      both adults and children breathing spontaneously (Marcell Szabó et al. BMC Anesthesiol. 2019;&#xD;
      19: 139., Lei Chen et al.Acad Emerg Med. 2007 Oct;14(10):841-5.). Ultrasound assessment of&#xD;
      subclavian vein/axillary vein collapsibility has recently been shown to predict hypotension&#xD;
      after induction of general anesthesia in adults (Min Hee Choi et al. Eur J Anaesthesiol 2020;&#xD;
      37:474-481). The inverstigators hypothesized that subclavian vein (SCV) collapsibility index&#xD;
      is correlated to fasting time and potentially can be used to predict post induction&#xD;
      hypotension in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To examine if ultrasound assessment of the diameter and collapsibility index of&#xD;
      the SCV is correlated to fasting time and can be a predictor of post induction hypotension in&#xD;
      children undergoing general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and setting: Prospective observational study in a day case surgical unit in a tertiary&#xD;
      university hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Children aged 0-18 years ASA 1-2 undergoing anesthesia for day case surgery after&#xD;
      written and informed consent from parents is obtained according to local ethical permit.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: ongoing medication for hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and results: Based on previous studies (Min Hee Choi et al. Eur J Anaesthesiol&#xD;
      2020; 37:474-481), a sample size of approximately 80 subjects will be needed. Data on fasting&#xD;
      time will be collected after informed and written consent has been obtained. Before the&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia, the patients will be breathing spontaneously in a supine position.&#xD;
      Noninvasive blood pressure will be recorded. An ultrasound examination of SCV will then be&#xD;
      performed on cross section of the vessel both in 2D and M-mode and the minimum and maximum&#xD;
      diameters of the SCV will be recorded. Collapsibility index will then be calculated from&#xD;
      these data as previously described (Min Hee Choi et al. Eur J Anaesthesiology 2020;&#xD;
      37:474-481). After this, the subjects will undergo anesthesia under which blood pressure will&#xD;
      be recorded according to departmental standard as usual. SCV collapsibility index will then&#xD;
      be investigated for potential significant correlation with fasting time and percentage&#xD;
      decrease in blood pressure from baseline after anesthesia induction and during the surgical&#xD;
      preparation phase, before start of surgery.&#xD;
