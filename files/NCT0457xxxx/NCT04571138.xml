  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia or lymphoma are often refractory to further&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In this study, the investigators will attempt to use T cells obtained directly&#xD;
      from the patient, which can be genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      (CAR). The CAR used in this study can recognize CD22, a protein expressed on the surface of&#xD;
      leukemia and lymphoma cells. The phase 1 part of this study will determine the safety and&#xD;
      appropriate dose level of these CAR T cells, and the phase 2 part of the study will determine&#xD;
      how effective this CAR T cell therapy is. Both patients who have never had prior CAR T cell&#xD;
      therapy and those who have had prior CAR T cell therapy may be eligible to participate in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
