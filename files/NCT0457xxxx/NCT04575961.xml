  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single arm, multi-centre study to assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (investigator's choice: carboplatin +&#xD;
      gemcitabine or carboplatin + pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or carboplatin monotherapy)&#xD;
      administered concurrent to chemotherapy and in maintenance, in patients with low grade&#xD;
      ovarian cancer (including patients with primary peritoneal and / or fallopian tube&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma) having platinum-sensitive relapse (platinum-free interval &gt; 6 months).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will evaluate efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy (physician's choice) in subjects with low-grade ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive Pembrolizumab 200mg q3w until progression or unacceptable toxicity, for&#xD;
      a maximum of 35 cycles PLUS one of the following standard chemotherapies for LGSOC&#xD;
      (investigators' choice):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin AUC 4 + Gemcitabine 1000mg/m² (q3w for 3-6 cycles) or Carboplatin AUC 5 +&#xD;
      pegylated liposomal Doxorubicin 30mg/m² (q4w for 3-6 cycles) or Carboplatin AUC 5 monotherapy&#xD;
      (q3w for 3-6 cycles). As primary objective 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate will&#xD;
      be analysed. About 2 sites in Germany will participate in this study to recruit 29 patients&#xD;
      in 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>Patients are asked to answer the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30). Responses of questions 1-28 are based on a 4-point scale (1=not at all; 4=Very much), with a higher score indicating a high degree of symptomatology and must therefore be assessed negatively. Responses of questions 29 and 30 are based on a 7-point scale (1=Very poor; 7=Excellent), with a higher score indicating a better global health status.</description>

    <description>The safety objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in subjects with advanced low grade ovarian cancer. The following safety parameters will be analyzed: adverse events and serious adverse events graded per NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0 criteria with time to onset/recovery, causality and outcome; changes in laboratory values, vital signs since baseline, treatment discontinuations and reason for discontinuation, death and cause of death etc. concomitant medications will be collected with time and reasons of use. These are routine safety parameters collected and analyzed in Phase II /III oncology trials. Furthermore, specific immune-related adverse events (irAEs) will be collected</description>
