      The primary safety objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      garetosmab in Japanese male and female adult patients with FOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy objective of the study is to assess the effect of garetosmab on&#xD;
      Heterotopic ossification (HO) in Japanese adult patients with FOP, as determined by the&#xD;
      number of new heterotopic bone lesions identified by computed tomography (CT).&#xD;
