    <textblock>
      This phase III trial investigates the best dose of vinblastine in combination with&#xD;
      selumetinib and the benefit of adding vinblastine to selumetinib compared to selumetinib&#xD;
      alone in treating children and young adults with low-grade glioma (a common type of brain&#xD;
      cancer) that has come back after prior treatment (recurrent) or does not respond to therapy&#xD;
      (progressive). Selumetinib is a drug that works by blocking a protein that lets tumor cells&#xD;
      grow without stopping. Vinblastine blocks cell growth by stopping cell division and may kill&#xD;
      cancer cells. Giving selumetinib in combination with vinblastine may work better than&#xD;
      selumetinib alone in treating recurrent or progressive low-grade glioma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of selumetinib&#xD;
      sulfate (selumetinib) + vinblastine sulfate (vinblastine) for children with progressive or&#xD;
      recurrent low-grade gliomas (LGGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if selumetinib + vinblastine will lead to improved event-free survival (EFS)&#xD;
      outcome compared with selumetinib alone for children with progressive or recurrent LGGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the objective response rates and overall survival associated with treatment&#xD;
      with selumetinib + vinblastine versus single-agent selumetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the difference in EFS and response rate between patients with BRAF rearranged&#xD;
      LGG and patients with non-BRAF rearranged LGG after treatment with selumetinib + vinblastine&#xD;
      versus single-agent selumetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate toxicities associated with selumetinib + vinblastine and single-agent&#xD;
      selumetinib for children with progressive or recurrent LGGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare the quality of life among patients treated with selumetinib + vinblastine and&#xD;
      single-agent selumetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To examine the vision outcomes among patients with optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) treated&#xD;
      with selumetinib + vinblastine and single-agent selumetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain paired blood and tumor specimens for future biology studies, including studies&#xD;
      to correlate genomic drivers to response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation feasibility study of vinblastine sulfate in combination&#xD;
      with selumetinib, followed by a randomized efficacy study. Patients in the feasibility study&#xD;
      are assigned to Arm I, while patients in the efficacy study are randomized to Arm I or Arm&#xD;
      II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive vinblastine sulfate intravenously (IV) over 1 minute or IV infusion&#xD;
      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and selumetinib sulfate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days. Patients receive selumetinib and vinblastine for a total&#xD;
      duration of 17 cycles followed by 10 additional cycles of selumetinib alone in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive selumetinib sulfate PO BID on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 27 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for year 1,&#xD;
      every 6 months for years 2-3, and annually for years 4-5.&#xD;
