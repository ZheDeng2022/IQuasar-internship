  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of HIV Infant Tracking System&#xD;
      2.1 (HITSystem, an eHealth intervention that uses short message service (SMS) texts to&#xD;
      patients and algorithm-driven electronic alerts for providers) to increase retention in&#xD;
      guideline-adherent prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV services (PMTCT) and to&#xD;
      increase viral suppression and appropriate clinical action through the extended period of 6&#xD;
      months postpartum, compared to standard of care PMTCT services in a matched, cluster&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite progress in providing comprehensive prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV&#xD;
      (PMTCT) services, significant gaps in the timely uptake and provision of guideline-adherent&#xD;
      services and maternal retention in care remain. Such gaps create missed opportunities for&#xD;
      preventing mother-to-child transmission and result in nearly 6,100 infants becoming infected&#xD;
      with HIV each year in Kenya. Effective interventions that routinize the delivery of&#xD;
      evidence-based PMTCT services and foster consistent patient engagement are essential to close&#xD;
      the remaining gaps and eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Building off of a&#xD;
      successful R34 grant to develop and pilot test the HITSystem 2.0, an eHealth intervention&#xD;
      targeting PMTCT services, the overall goal of this proposal is to use a cluster randomized&#xD;
      control design at 12 Kenyan government hospitals to evaluate a modified HITSystem 2.1&#xD;
      intervention. HITSystem 2.1 reflects the 2018 Kenyan PMTCT guidelines, including routine&#xD;
      viral load monitoring and interventions to suppress maternal viral load. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to evaluate the impact of HITSystem 2.1 to optimize the provision of guideline-adherent&#xD;
      services and viral suppression through the antenatal, delivery, and early postpartum periods.&#xD;
      Aim 1 of the proposed study will assess the efficacy of the HITSystem 2.1 to increase the&#xD;
      proportion of mothers who receive complete PMTCT services (including appointment attendance,&#xD;
      medication adherence support, viral load testing, hospital-based delivery, and infant testing&#xD;
      per Kenyan National Guidelines) through 6 months postpartum. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that mothers receiving the HITSystem 2.1 intervention will have a significantly higher&#xD;
      completion rate for guideline-adherence PMTCT services compared to mothers receiving standard&#xD;
      of care PMTCT services. In Aim 1b, the investigators will evaluate HITSystem 2.1&#xD;
      implementation using the RE-AIM model to inform sustainable scale up. Aim 2 will assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of HITSystem 2.1 to increase viral suppression (&lt;1,000 copies/mL) among pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum women, including those who disengage from care. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      mothers at HITSystem 2.1 sites will have higher rates of viral suppression at delivery and 6&#xD;
      months postpartum. Aim 3 will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HITSystem 2.1. Driven by&#xD;
      differences in PMTCT retention, viral suppression, and modeled estimates of pediatric HIV&#xD;
      infections averted, the investigators hypothesize that the HITSystem 2.1 will be&#xD;
      cost-effective, based on World Health Organization criteria. This proposal is aimed at&#xD;
      improving the quality of PMTCT services in the health facility setting. If efficacious and&#xD;
      cost-effective, HITSystem 2.1 holds strong promise for national dissemination.&#xD;

    <description>HITSystem 2.1 is an intervention that tracks HIV+ pregnant women and their infants to improve the completeness and efficiency of PMTCT services. Key intervention features include: (1) SMS messages sent to enrolled women and mothers to support essential PMTCT services, (2) automated, algorithm-driven alerts for providers when per-guidelines PMTCT services are missed, and (3) automatic enrollment of infants into early infant diagnosis (EID) and linkage with maternal PMTCT file at documentation of infant birth to improve the continuum of care for HIV+ mothers and HIV-exposed infants. The HITSystem 2.1 intervention aims to facilitate complete PMTCT retention and viral load (VL) monitoring with prompt clinical action (adherence support, antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen change) in the antenatal, delivery, and 6-month postpartum periods to increase viral suppression during windows critical for HIV prevention.</description>
