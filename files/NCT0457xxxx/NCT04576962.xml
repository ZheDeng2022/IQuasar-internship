  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to document geographic variability in HPV vaccine series completion&#xD;
      across the state of Indiana and to identify factors associated with low versus high rates of&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective a: To map HPV vaccine series completion rates across Indiana's 92 counties for&#xD;
      children aged 14 years and younger. Hypothesis: The investigators expect wide variability in&#xD;
      completion rates from county to county. Further, the investigators expect significantly less&#xD;
      variability in county-level administration of vaccines required for middle-school entry&#xD;
      (Tdap, MenACWY, and HepA vaccines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective b: To identify county-level characteristics associated with HPV vaccine series&#xD;
      completion rates across Indiana's 92 counties. Hypothesis: The investigators expect factors&#xD;
      reflective of pragmatic obstacles to be associated with lower completion rates: such as lower&#xD;
      population density, fewer primary health care providers (HCP) per capita, longer commute to&#xD;
      work, lower median household income, and lower rates of insurance coverage of children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will obtain HPV vaccine series completion data from the Indiana State&#xD;
      Department of Health Immunization Information System (IIS) registry. The data will include&#xD;
      all children 9 through 14 years of age who received the 1st dose of HPV vaccine during the&#xD;
      2017 and 2018 calendar years. A minimum of 18 months after 1st dose administration will be&#xD;
      allowed for follow-up evidence of two-dose series completion. For comparison purposes, the&#xD;
      investigators will also request Tdap, MenACWY, and HepA administration coverage. Tdap,&#xD;
      MenACWY, and HepA vaccines are all required for middle-school-entry in the state of Indiana.&#xD;
      The investigators already have data on missed opportunities for the 1st dose of HPV vaccine&#xD;
      during the 2017 calendar year. Again, for comparison purposes, the investigators will request&#xD;
      similar data for 2018. Tdap, MenACWY, and HepA administration rates will focus on children&#xD;
      11-14 years of age. County-level data will include measures of population density, primary&#xD;
      health care providers per capita, mean household income, child insurance coverage, children&#xD;
      living in poverty, length of work commute, participation in health screening behaviors, and&#xD;
      other sociodemographic, health, and quality of life factors covered in&#xD;
      CountyHealthRankings.Org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the primary variable of interest is 2-dose series completion for HPV vaccination, measured&#xD;
      via IIS data. All children and adolescents ages 9-14 years who received their first dose of&#xD;
      vaccine during the 2017 and 2018 calendar years will be followed for series completion. For&#xD;
      comparison purposes IIS data on Tdap, MenACWY, HepA, and HPV vaccine (missed opportunities&#xD;
      for 1st dose) also will be derived from the IIS. Potential predictors of HPV vaccine series&#xD;
      completion will be derived from CountyHealthRankings.Org. The County Health Rankings program&#xD;
      is a collaborative effort of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of&#xD;
      Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Multiple health and sociodemographic indices measured&#xD;
      at the county level are compiled and made publicly available on the website. As noted above,&#xD;
      county-level measures derived from this program include population density, primary health&#xD;
      care providers per capita, mean household income, child insurance coverage, children living&#xD;
      in poverty, length of work commute, participation in health screening behaviors, and other&#xD;
      sociodemographic, health, and quality of life factors covered in CountyHealthRankings.Org.&#xD;
