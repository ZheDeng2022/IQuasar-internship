      The objective of this study is to build the Texas Youth Depression and Suicide Research&#xD;
      Network to support the development of a Network Participant Registry and characterization of&#xD;
      systems and interventions to examine statewide population health outcomes. All 12-13 sites&#xD;
      represented in the Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium&#xD;
      (https://www.utsystem.edu/pophealth/tcmhcc/) have been invited to participate in the Texas&#xD;
      Youth Depression and Suicide Research Network as &quot;Nodes.&quot; 12 Nodes have been selected for&#xD;
      this project. Each Node has obtained support of senior institutional leadership including the&#xD;
      department chair. Leadership from each Node provided input and edits in the study design&#xD;
      process by committee, with a focus on the inclusion of the &quot;end user&quot; in design decisions.&#xD;
      Nodes must have the patient volume to be able to recruit up to 500 patients over the course&#xD;
      of 14 months, and they will be required to work closely with Network Hub leadership to&#xD;
      recruit, monitor, and retain participants. This will require active engagement and sustained&#xD;
      relationships with clinics within the academic medical center as well as clinics in the&#xD;
      community (i.e., psychiatry, psychology, counselling).&#xD;

      Objective: To build the Texas Youth Depression and Suicide Research Network to support the&#xD;
      development of a Network Participant Registry and characterization of systems and&#xD;
      interventions to examine statewide population health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Youth patients of participating clinics (ages 8-20) and their parents will be&#xD;
      recruited for participation in the Network Participant Registry Study. Upon informed&#xD;
      consent/assent, baseline data will be collected regarding mood symptoms, suicidal ideation&#xD;
      and behavior, associated comorbidities, treatment history, services use, and social&#xD;
      determinants of health. Youth participants and parents will be sent monthly measures through&#xD;
      the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system developed and maintained by UT Southwestern.&#xD;
      Additionally, measures will be given at provider visits to support delivery of&#xD;
      measurement-based care within the clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants: 5000 Participants and/or Coupled Participants (coupled-Parent and&#xD;
      Youth)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Inclusion: This study will enroll youth with depression and/or suicidal&#xD;
      ideation. and meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be 8 to 20 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a positive screen for depression (e.g., based on PHQ-2 (score ≥3) and/or PHQ-A of&#xD;
           10 or greater, OR positive for suicidal ideation or behavior (e.g., based on CHRT-SR or&#xD;
           PHQ-A item 9); OR be in treatment for depression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be willing to provide consent/assent (parents/LAR or young adult participant, aged&#xD;
           18-20, must be willing to provide consent; youth, aged 8-17, must be willing to provide&#xD;
           assent);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be able to speak English or Spanish sufficiently to understand the study procedures and&#xD;
           provide written informed consent to participate in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be willing to dedicate appropriate time to complete scheduled study assessments and&#xD;
           measures (both parent/LAR and youth).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be able to provide a reliable means of contact. Visit Schedule: Screening Visit,&#xD;
           Baseline, 6 Follow-Up Visits (2 of which are In-Person, and 4 of which are Remote), and&#xD;
           Final Visit. Duration of study is approximately 12-13 months; some visits will be&#xD;
           conducted remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Multiple streams of outcome measures will be utilized for this protocol,&#xD;
      including self-report and parent-report measures, research assessor-completed measures,&#xD;
      clinic level measures, and data obtained through chart review from the EHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and Tolerability Measures: Adverse event (AE) recording, 9 item Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PHQ-A), Concise Health Risk Tracking (CHRT)-SR, and Self-Report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Justification: The goals of the statistical analyses includes the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide a descriptive summary of the data by participating network nodes as well as&#xD;
           by various socio-demographic characteristics of the participants such as age groups,&#xD;
           gender (as a biological variable), urban or rural, degree of fidelity to MBC, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To build predictive models for treatment outcomes and trajectories of disease course as&#xD;
           well as models to assist with treatment selection that may benefit subgroups of&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
