  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the clinical performance of LIVERFAStTM In&#xD;
      Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Tests (Fibrosis score, Activity score and Steatosis score) in NAFLD&#xD;
      suspected patients for staging of fibrosis and for grading of inflammatory activity and&#xD;
      steatosis, taking as reference the liver biopsy with histological classification of the&#xD;
      elementary lesions determined according to SAF scores (Bedossa P., Hepatology 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the performance of LIVERFAStTM for the histological&#xD;
      definition of NAFLD, including NAFL and NASH and severe NASH&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic liver diseases (CLDs), such as chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      diseases (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are a leading cause of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality globally and usually develops over many years. The prevalence of NAFLD has&#xD;
      increased in recent years (15% in 2005 to 25% in 2010) mainly due to the increase prevalence&#xD;
      of obesity and diabetes. As, approximately 20% of NAFLD cases develop NASH, the associated&#xD;
      increase in NASH during the same period is to be expected (33% in 2005 to 59.1% in 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, staging of liver fibrosis is essential in determining the prognosis and optimal&#xD;
      treatment for patients with NASH. Furthermore, evaluation of fibrosis in NAFLD patients can&#xD;
      help refine treatment options designed to prevent the progression to NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One recent study demonstrates significant sampling variability of routine liver biopsy in&#xD;
      patients with NAFLD (Ratziu V. et al. Gastroenterology 2008). The diagnosis of NASH would&#xD;
      have been missed in 35% and the discordance for steatosis grading was encountered in 22% of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing safe and easily accessible noninvasive modalities to accurately evaluate fibrosis&#xD;
      stage of NAFLD and NASH is of utmost importance in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibronostics breaks through the burden to serve patients. By empowering their providers with&#xD;
      IVD clinical tools within the clinic, the ability to ensure screening and clinical adherence&#xD;
      is assured, and the ease for early detection profoundly shifts the $2B economic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIVERFASt is a non-invasive clinical and staging In-Vitro-Diagnostic (IVD) tool, which has&#xD;
      been developed as an alternative to liver biopsy. LIVERFASt is a safe, and reproducible tool&#xD;
      which provides surrogate grading and staging of the three elementary features of NASH:&#xD;
      steatosis, inflammatory activity and fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIVERFAStTM combines age, gender, weight and height with common liver function tests (ALT,&#xD;
      AST, GGT, total bilirubin), lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides), fasting glucose&#xD;
      and three specific proteins of the liver with hepatoprotective functions and predictive value&#xD;
      in NAFLD -alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M), haptoglobin (HAP) and apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical value of LIVERFAStTM as a non-invasive&#xD;
      biopsy-proven surrogate assessment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cohort cross-sectional prospective, multi-centre study of an algorithm-based&#xD;
      assessment of liver fibrosis, inflammatory activity (steatohepatitis) and steatosis compared&#xD;
      to the histological assessment provided by liver biopsy performed in patients with suspected&#xD;
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).&#xD;
