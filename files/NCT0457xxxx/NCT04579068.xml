  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problematic alcohol use can lead to worse social and health related consequences for&#xD;
      underserved minorities, requiring urgent intervention. By training underserved minority&#xD;
      health professional students, this proposed project will develop and test the feasibility of&#xD;
      an innovative and culturally tailored intervention for adults studying at a minority&#xD;
      institution, with specific focus on alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral of&#xD;
      treatment (SBIRT). This proposal is expected to have a positive impact on alcohol reduction&#xD;
      and prevention for minority communities&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Problematic alcohol use, including alcohol use disorders (AUD) and high episodic drinking&#xD;
      (HED), remains a public health crisis among college students, particularly those from&#xD;
      underserved minority groups. Less likely to disclose alcohol use, underserved minority&#xD;
      college students participate in riskier drinking, attributed to multiple social factors,&#xD;
      including racial/ethnic discrimination, financial strain, and neighborhood disadvantage.&#xD;
      Faced with worse alcohol health-related consequences, effective interventions to reduce&#xD;
      alcohol use among this population is critically needed. To reduce alcohol-related health&#xD;
      disparities, the investigators aim to develop a public health-based, comprehensive program&#xD;
      (Alcohol Awareness Peer Leaders) that will train underserved minority non-traditional health&#xD;
      professional students to conduct alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral to&#xD;
      treatment (SBIRT) by using a culturally sensitive approach and screening tool (Rapid Alcohol&#xD;
      Problems Screen - RAPS4-QF). By utilizing a culturally adapted SBIRT curriculum, AAPLs will&#xD;
      be able to deliver alcohol education and messaging to motivate alcohol risk reduction and&#xD;
      decrease in consumption for non-traditional college students studying at a predominantly&#xD;
      minority academic institution in an underserved area. The Andersen Healthcare Utilization&#xD;
      Model will be utilized to guide this intervention. This theoretically and culturally tailored&#xD;
      proposed project is evidence-informed and promising for underserved minority college students&#xD;
      and will be advanced through the following three aims: 1) Using an explanatory-sequential&#xD;
      mixed methods design, examine a) alcohol consumption and HED patterns, b) attitudes toward&#xD;
      alcohol use, c) social and environmental factors, and d) alcohol-related consequences among&#xD;
      minority health professional students, 2) Through training of minority health professional&#xD;
      students as Alcohol Awareness Peer Leaders (AAPLs), assess the acceptability and relevance of&#xD;
      a peer-based SBIRT that was culturally-tailored based on Aim 1 findings, and 3) To compare&#xD;
      the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering a culturally-tailored SBIRT using RAPS4-QF by&#xD;
      AAPLs by race/ethnicity, drinking status (abstainer vs. drinker), and adverse life&#xD;
      experiences. These outcomes will result in the training of 208 underserved minority AAPLs who&#xD;
      will conduct culturally competent and evidence-based alcohol screening, brief intervention,&#xD;
      and treatment referral for over 2000 students. The result of this innovative proposal will&#xD;
      produce future healthcare professionals who will be a valuable community resource for&#xD;
      underserved areas as they can continue to decrease alcohol health disparities for&#xD;
      underrepresented minority populations, inducing sustainability.&#xD;

    <description>We plan to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the delivery of the peer-based SBIRT using the RAPS4-QF screening tool with CDU students. Furthermore, we will compare delivery by AAPLs' race/ethnicity, drinking status (abstainer vs. non-abstainer), and adverse life experiences. Following the screening by AAPLs, we expect a 30% detection of problematic alcohol use (i.e. high episodic drinking [HED] or AUD) and at-risk alcohol use. Participants that screen positive will receive brief motivational interviewing and referral to treatment and will be contacted 6 months following the SBIRT to assess their drinking behaviors. We expect that participants will decrease their alcohol consumption or drinking risk at the 6-month follow up.</description>
