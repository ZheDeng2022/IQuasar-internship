      This study will be undertaken to evaluate the association of serum uric acid (SUA) level with&#xD;
      metabolic risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes and their relation to eGFR status&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (syndrome X, insulin resistance) is a multifactorial disease with multiple&#xD;
      risk factors that arises from insulin resistance accompanying abnormal adipose deposition and&#xD;
      function . It comprises a combination of risk factors for coronary heart disease, as well as&#xD;
      for diabetes type 2 , fatty liver, and several cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sign and symptoms are ; Hypertension... Hyperglycemia.. Hypertriglyceridemia... Reduced&#xD;
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).. Abdominal obesity... Chest pain or shortness&#xD;
      of breath: Suggesting the rise of cardiovascular and other complications.. The prevalence of&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome is often more in the urban population of some developing countries&#xD;
      than in its Western counterparts . The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, coronary diseases, stroke, and other disabilities. The present trend is not&#xD;
      sustainable unless a magic cure is found (unlikely) or concerted global/governmental/societal&#xD;
      efforts are made to change the lifestyle that is promoting it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a renewed interest in the association of uric acid with diabetes and its&#xD;
      complications. Uric acid is a product of purine metabolism. Increased serum uric acid (SUA)&#xD;
      level has been shown to be associated with hypertension(1) cardiovascular disease (CVD)(2)&#xD;
      and chronic kidney disease(3) . Elevated SUA level was also associated with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome in both normal subjects as well as in patients with type 2 diabetes. And with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus(4) Higher SUA level independently predicted the incidence of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes in subjects who had abnormal fasting glucose levels (5) . It has been shown that SUA&#xD;
      levels are higher in patients with prediabetic conditions and in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes compared with the level in normal controls (6) . SUA level has been shown to be&#xD;
      positively associated with all cause mortality risk, but cardiovascular mortality was&#xD;
      associated with SUA level only among those with hyperglycemia (prediabetes and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes)(8) . Hyperuricemia has been found to be associated with risk factors of diabetes&#xD;
      such as obesity and insulin resistance(9) . Uric acid has also been reported to be involved&#xD;
      in the endothelial dysfunction by impairing nitric oxide production and causing&#xD;
      inflammation(10) , These effects of uric acid likely account for its impact on CVD&#xD;
      incidence(11) . In acute ischaemic stroke, the survivors with both lower (&lt;4.7 mg/dL) and&#xD;
      higher (&gt;6.7 mg/dL) baseline SUA levels had poor outcomes after a 12 month follow up when&#xD;
      compared with those who had SUA levels in the range of 4.7-6.7 mg/dL. This is suggestive of&#xD;
      the protective nature of uric acid when it is within the optimal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUA level was positively associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD)&#xD;
      in patients with abnormal eGFR (&lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m2) . HbA1c was found to be inversely&#xD;
      associated with hyperuricemia in patients with normal eGFR level (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2).&#xD;
      Incidence of metabolic syndrome did not show any relationship with SUA level. However, the&#xD;
      incidence of hypertension, a component of metabolic syndrome, was significantly higher among&#xD;
      patients with hyperuricemia. Waist circumference and serum triglycerides were higher, whereas&#xD;
      serum high-density lipoprotein level was lower in patients with higher SUA level. (12) Serum&#xD;
      urea and creatinine were elevated in hyperuricemic patients, suggesting impaired kidney&#xD;
      function. Hyperuricemia is known to be associated with the decrease in kidney function (13)&#xD;
      and because chronic kidney disease itself elevates SUA level,(14) it is difficult to&#xD;
      interpret the causes of the elevated serum urea and creatinine in hyperuricemia. However,&#xD;
      eGFR values were only slightly lower in hyperuricemic patients. Correlation analysis showed&#xD;
      that both serum urea and creatinine levels were positively associated with SUA level.. This&#xD;
      association was found to be significant in patients with normal eGFR levels as well. However,&#xD;
      eGFR appears to be negatively associated with SUA level in patients with abnormal eGFR level.&#xD;
      Decreased urine output leads to decreased excretion of uric acid, resulting in the elevated&#xD;
      SUA level. Therefore, reduction in eGFR may increase SUA levels in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of uric acid has been increasingly appreciated because of its association with&#xD;
      the development of diabetes mellitus and related diseases. SUA level and susceptibility to&#xD;
      hyperuricemic conditions depend on the factors such as gender, age and ethnicity. (15) With&#xD;
      the increasing incidence of diabetes studying the impact of hyperuricemia in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes is necessary.&#xD;
