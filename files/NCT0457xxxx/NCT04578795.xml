      The miniaturization of endourological instruments and improvements in laser lithotripsy have&#xD;
      revolutionized the approach to renal stones .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is currently the gold standard for management of&#xD;
           large renal calculi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCNL is associated, however, with a higher complication rate, degree of risk, and longer&#xD;
           recovery period compared with ureteroscopy - ESWL was introduced in the 1980s and&#xD;
           quickly became the gold standard for the treatment of kidney stones . In the 1990s, URS&#xD;
           emerged with the advantages of direct visualization and extraction of kidney calculi .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, the American Urological Association guideline recommends ESWL or URS as&#xD;
           equivalent first-line interventions for the treatment of kidney stones &lt; 20 mm . - The&#xD;
           guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) additionally distinguish between&#xD;
           lower pole and non-lower pole kidney stones. They recommend both treatments as&#xD;
           equivalent options for kidney stones of 1020 mm, but favor URS for lower pole stones if&#xD;
           adverse factors (such as anatomy and stone composition) argue against ESWL - Flexible&#xD;
           URS has become popular with urologists, as it is easy to learn, is associated with high&#xD;
           stone-free rates, and is acceptable to patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Firstly described in 1964 by Marshall, the uretroscope was only passively deflectable&#xD;
           and did not include working channel. - Although the first successful procedure in humans&#xD;
           with a ureteroscope integrating active deflection has been reported by Takayasu, it was&#xD;
           not until 1987 that Demetrius Bagley introduced flexible ureteroscopy as we know it&#xD;
           today ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  we can distinguish two types of flexible URS: fiberoptic and digital flexible URS. The&#xD;
           difference between them is the image relay and light transmission. - In fiberoptic&#xD;
           flexible URS, light and image are transmitted in analog format through fiberoptics&#xD;
           bundles whereas illumination in digital scopes is made by fiberoptics or by a diode&#xD;
           (DEL) and image capture charged by a digital sensor located at the tip of the endoscope:&#xD;
           either charged coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS ) -&#xD;
           In both fiberoptic and digital flexible URS, most manufacturers have models with a 3.6&#xD;
           Fr working channel (for irrigation and use of accessory instruments) and at least one&#xD;
           270° active deflection of the tip. The most recent development in flexible URS was the&#xD;
           introduction of single use digital flexible URS .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the other hand the traditional reusable scopes have a fixed purchase cost, there is&#xD;
           additional cost related to scope processing and repairs . - The cost of single-use&#xD;
           flexible URS is defined with the initial purchase price, whereas the procedural cost of&#xD;
           reusable flexible URS is dependent on the initial and repair cost, maintenance and scope&#xD;
           disinfection and on the number of procedures performed before it needs to be repaired. -&#xD;
           There is also the cost of repair and the number of procedures with a refurbished scope&#xD;
           until it has to be replaced.&#xD;
