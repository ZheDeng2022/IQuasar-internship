  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to evaluate the association between the obesity grade and the age of the&#xD;
      first acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The effect of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and the&#xD;
      age of first ACS in patients with severe obesity was also examined. Consecutive patients with&#xD;
      diagnosis of first episode of ACS were prospectively enrolled in 2014 to 2024.Cardiovascular&#xD;
      risks of patients will be determined according to clinical and laboratory evaluation and&#xD;
      patients were categorized by their body mass indices (BMI). Independent variables that&#xD;
      effected the age of first ACS were examined by linear regression analysis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first stage, the first ACS diagnosis of the patients will be tried to be clarified. It&#xD;
      will be tried to clarify whether the patients have had ACS before, according to their&#xD;
      history, ecg echo and coronary angiography findings. Patients with previous ACS or uncertain&#xD;
      ACS diagnosis will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, cardiovascular risk burdens of patients for whom the initial ACS&#xD;
      diagnosis is clear will be revealed. Smoking, DM, HT, psychological stress, socio-economic&#xD;
      status, migration history, cholesterol parameters will be determined. The duration and&#xD;
      severity of these risk factors will be determined. In the final model, each risk factor will&#xD;
      be examined in detail with its sub-tabs and the effect of each risk factor will be examined&#xD;
      separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eventually, a model will be developed that allows predicting the first ACS age. The&#xD;
      shortcomings of this model and the narrow scope of the definition of the population will be&#xD;
      determined and the direction will be determined for the studies that improve these points.&#xD;
