  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine whether combining Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics&#xD;
      (CBIT) with inhibition of the supplementary motor area (SMA) using transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS) normalizes activity in the SMA-connected circuits, improves tic suppression&#xD;
      ability, and enhances CBIT outcomes in young people with tic disorder. The study will also&#xD;
      examine different TMS dosing strategies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive 10 daily sessions of CBIT, a well-established behavioral&#xD;
      treatment that is considered by the American Academy of Neurology to be the first-line&#xD;
      intervention for tics. Immediately prior to each CBIT session, participants will undergo TMS&#xD;
      targeting the SMA. The specific type of TMS procedure will be randomly assigned between&#xD;
      subjects and be either: 1 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS), continuous theta burst stimulation&#xD;
      (cTBS), or sham stimulation.&#xD;

    <description>The Tic Suppression Task is a clinician-rated tool for assessing tic frequency. A video recording of participant is rated and yields a score in units of tics per minute. Outcome reported as change from baseline to post treatment; change from baseline to 1 month post treatment; change from baseline to 3 months post treatment; change from post treatment to 1 month post treatment; and change from post treatment to 3 months post treatment.</description>
