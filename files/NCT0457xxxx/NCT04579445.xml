      Non-interventional, multi-center, international registry in patients with severe aortic&#xD;
      stenosis (sAS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The BENCHMARK&#xD;
      Registry aims to implement standardized, reproducible and scalable quality improvement&#xD;
      measures, which will help to reduce resource requirements, intensive care unit bed occupancy&#xD;
      and overall length of hospitalization with uncompromised patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will consist of the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrospective phase (purpose: capture the status quo of each site prior to any Quality&#xD;
           of Care improvement measures): The TAVI of patients being eligible for retrospective&#xD;
           documentation must have been performed prior to the site's enrollment into the BENCHMARK&#xD;
           prospective phase (follow-up: 30 days, 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Education phase: Each center will undergo an online BENCHMARK education. The contents of&#xD;
           the education will be: Reflection on treatment pathways with the TAVI team, education on&#xD;
           8 defined Quality of Care improvement measures, followed by a center self-assessment (to&#xD;
           self-assess the current alignment of hospital performance with the BENCHMARK Quality od&#xD;
           Care measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementation phase: After having self-assessed the current alignment of hospital&#xD;
           performance with the following BENCHMARK Quality of care measures, each center will&#xD;
           start to introduce the tailored Quality of Care improvement measures to their hospital&#xD;
           routine within a time frame of 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective phase (purpose: to document the effects of defined quality of care&#xD;
           improvement measure and to make sure patient safety is as least as good as in the&#xD;
           retrospective phase. (8 months of recruitment, Follow-up: 30 days, 12 months)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become standard of care in patients&#xD;
      suffering from severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis, irrespective of risk. However, despite&#xD;
      the advances in valve technology and implantation techniques, there is still no consensus on&#xD;
      how to effectively screen, manage and discharge patients undergoing such an intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort not to lose grounds because of an increasing inner-hospital competition for&#xD;
      resources including intensive care unit (ICU) and general hospital beds, there is a need for&#xD;
      a streamlined Quality of Care (QoC) pathway that delivers the procedure more efficient, but&#xD;
      with at least the same patient safety. In this context, the recent FAST-TAVI and North&#xD;
      American Multidisciplinary, Multimodality, But Minimalist (3M) studies have shown that&#xD;
      optimized risk assessment and patient management results in a more effective, as least as&#xD;
      safe treatment pathway and a reduced length of stay (LoS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results gain importance especially in a situation where patients suffering from the&#xD;
      coronavirus disease compete for hospital resources throughout Europe. Using a clear set of&#xD;
      Quality of Care criteria, the BENCHMARK registry aims to document the progress that can be&#xD;
      made if tailored Quality of Care improvement measures are initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the implementation of standardized, reproducible and scalable Quality&#xD;
      of Care improvement measures will help reducing resource requirements, intensive care unit&#xD;
      bed occupancy and overall length of hospitalization with uncompromised patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be up to 30 centers participating across Europe (Germany, Austria, Italy, France,&#xD;
      Spain, Czech Republic, Romania). Each center will enroll 80 patients (retrospective&#xD;
      documentation of 30 patients, prospective enrollment of 50 patients), resulting in 2400&#xD;
      patients in total.&#xD;
