  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the effects of oral ketone and sodium bicarbonate administration&#xD;
      on physiological and metabolic parameters during cycling endurance exercise in hypoxia.&#xD;
      Ketone body supplementation is commonly used among elite endurance athletes that also compete&#xD;
      in the hypoxia (at altitude). To-date effects of ketones have only been investigated in&#xD;
      normoxia and the data in hypoxia is lacking. Hence, we want to investigate the effect of oral&#xD;
      ketone ester intake with and without additional sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) ingestion on i)&#xD;
      blood-acid base balance and ii) exercise performance during prolonged exercise under hypoxic&#xD;
      conditions. Information obtained via this study should provide valuable information with&#xD;
      regard to optimisation of exercise training and athletic performance, and more importantly,&#xD;
      provide pioneering insight on the metabolic and physiological responses to ketosis under&#xD;
      hypoxic conditions.&#xD;
