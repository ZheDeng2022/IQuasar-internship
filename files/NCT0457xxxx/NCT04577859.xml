    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common debilitating heart rhythm condition that can cause heart&#xD;
      failure and negatively impact a patient's outlook in terms of symptoms and disability. It is&#xD;
      an irregular fast heart rhythm disorder coming from the top chamber of the heart (left&#xD;
      atrium). Catheter ablation treatment has been shown to be effective in controlling or&#xD;
      eliminating AF and its associated symptoms. This is now a common and effective treatment&#xD;
      option for patients suffering with AF. During ablation, thermal energy is applied in the top&#xD;
      chamber of the heart (the left atrium) to abolish abnormal electrical signals that cause AF.&#xD;
      It is generally a safe procedure, but one potential risk associated with this procedure is&#xD;
      damage to the oesophagus caused by thermal energy being transmitted to the oesophagus from&#xD;
      the heart. The oesophagus sits just behind the heart chamber where ablation work is&#xD;
      performed, about 5mm away, so it is vulnerable to damage. Although the risk of severe&#xD;
      oesophageal damage is low, if it occurs it can be serious as the patient may become very ill&#xD;
      as a result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, we have shown that a more advanced type of oesophageal probe that cools&#xD;
      the oesophagus during ablation is better at protecting the oesophagus from ablation-related&#xD;
      injury compared to the standard care probe currently used. As it was a single-centre study,&#xD;
      more evidence is required before we can say that this type of probe is better in protecting&#xD;
      the oesophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to run a multi-centre randomized study to compare the safety of AF ablation&#xD;
      when there is protection by the oesophageal cooling probe versus the standard of care&#xD;
      oesophageal temperature monitoring probe. This means that there is a 50:50 chance of the new&#xD;
      cooling probe being used during AF ablation for participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to investigate the use of an oesophageal cooling&#xD;
      probe as a new and potentially better method of oesophageal protection for AF ablation&#xD;
      patients compared to standard care. This is the multi-centre version of the recently&#xD;
      completed single-site study (IRAS ID: 253844). This multi-centre version is required to&#xD;
      confirm if the oesophageal cooling probe is definitively superior to standard care in&#xD;
      protecting AF ablation patients and to clarify the extent of this protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the method of protection is limited余 an oesophageal temperature monitoring probe&#xD;
      is inserted whilst the patient is under general anaesthesia and we simply measure the&#xD;
      temperature during ablation, stopping if temperatures markedly increase, which may suggest&#xD;
      significant oesophageal thermal injury. This method is unreliable as the temperature probe&#xD;
      does not sit well in the oesophagus and is often too far away from the area requiring&#xD;
      monitoring. The probe is difficult to place as it can coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the project is in the form of a randomised controlled trial like the&#xD;
      single-centre study, so participants will have a 50:50 chance of being allocated to the study&#xD;
      group receiving the new oesophageal cooling probe or the standard care (or control) group,&#xD;
      receiving the oesophageal temperature monitoring probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is blinded to the result of the randomization, to avoid bias/placebo effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If enrolled to the study group, the oesophageal cooling probe will be used- called the&#xD;
      ensoETM probe. This is a smooth medical-grade silicone multi-lumen oesophageal probe (the&#xD;
      device has a CE mark and is designed for the purpose of oesophageal insertion and cooling)&#xD;
      that allows water irrigation in a closed loop system, when connected to an external console.&#xD;
      If the console cools the irrigated water (this is controlled by manual up/down buttons&#xD;
      depending on what temperature is desired), the oesophageal probe is then cooled also, which&#xD;
      allows local oesophageal wall temperature to be controlled. Oesophageal cooling via the&#xD;
      ensoETM probe can then counteract any transmitted thermal energy from the ablation. This&#xD;
      probe is already in clinical use in critical care patients where it can control body&#xD;
      temperature, if the probe is left in situ for purposely extended hours or days. It is&#xD;
      therefore already known to be safe余 it also has a good safety profile in the context of AF&#xD;
      ablations based on experience from the single-centre study (IRAS ID: 253844余 in press-&#xD;
      doi:10.1093/europace/euaa276). In the single-centre study, all participants had endoscopic&#xD;
      examination after their ablation to review the oesophagus, and no device/probe related&#xD;
      abrasive trauma was seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure is normally done under general anaesthetic so the participant will not be aware&#xD;
      of this and will not be subjected to any sensation of pain or discomfort. The probe is soft&#xD;
      and much gentler than the camera probe that we normally have to insert during the catheter&#xD;
      ablation procedure (the camera probe or transoesophageal echocardiography, TOE- is part of&#xD;
      standard care), so the study authors are of the opinion that this additional precautionary&#xD;
      measure does not itself increase the patient's risk or exposure to harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, all participants (study or control) will have an endoscopy camera&#xD;
      between 12-72 hours after the catheter ablation procedure to review for degree of oesophageal&#xD;
      thermal damage caused by ablation, if any. (Please note: A biopsy is NOT part of this&#xD;
      research protocol余 this is simply a diagnostic camera.) The endoscopist is also blinded to&#xD;
      the result of the randomization to avoid bias during reporting of the endoscopy result. The&#xD;
      short time window between ablation and endoscopy camera follow up means that it can be done&#xD;
      at the same admission as the ablation procedure itself, this is advantageous for the patient&#xD;
      as both the ablation treatment and the follow up camera can be completed in 1 hospital&#xD;
      admission. The endoscopy camera result is explained to the patient on the day and if any&#xD;
      further action required. The timing is also advantageous to minimise separate hospital&#xD;
      attendances in the Covid-19 era.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, normal/standard care clinic follow up of the patient will be adhered to but as&#xD;
      part of the trial, at the first clinic follow up, participants in both groups will be asked&#xD;
      about any lingering gastro-oesophageal symptoms and we will make a record of this, for the&#xD;
      study. The patient is still blinded to the results of the randomization at the time of&#xD;
      reporting their symptoms during recovery, if any. This is to avoid bias/placebo effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project does not create any areas of ethical concern as the soft oesophageal&#xD;
      cooling device/probe is of gentle design, specifically made to sit in the oesophagus.&#xD;
      Especially when compared to the TOE probe that we normally use as part of standard protocol&#xD;
      for an AF ablation procedure. The patient will also not be aware of this step at all as the&#xD;
      procedure is conducted under general anaesthesia. The device is appropriately CE marked and&#xD;
      used for the indication of body cooling via the oesophagus and protection. Even in standard&#xD;
      care, an oesophageal temperature monitoring probe is required, so effectively, this study&#xD;
      simply randomizes the patient to either the new probe or the standard of care one, during&#xD;
      their AF ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is one additional follow up the participant is required to have, as part of this trial:&#xD;
      the endoscopy camera (regardless of if randomised to study or control group). The endoscopy&#xD;
      camera will be completed by 12-72hrs post catheter ablation procedure. The purpose is to&#xD;
      review any areas of inflammation or thermal injury in the oesophagus that may alter clinical&#xD;
      management but this specific information will also be used during study analysis of the 2&#xD;
      randomized groups after the study has completed. An endoscopy camera is considered to be a&#xD;
      low risk day case procedure that takes 20 minutes to complete. The risk of this camera test&#xD;
      causing any damage itself is &lt;0.5%. A TOE probe/any other oesophageal probe used during the&#xD;
      ablation procedure is similar to the endoscopy probe so apart from the participant having to&#xD;
      attend an additional appointment after their ablation, the overall risk to the patient is not&#xD;
      significantly increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up endoscopy camera may be slightly uncomfortable in the beginning but it is not&#xD;
      painful, is straightforward and relatively quick- this will be explained in the beginning&#xD;
      during the recruitment process so the potential participant has an accurate idea of what to&#xD;
      expect from the endoscopy camera and if they are happy to be enrolled. There is added benefit&#xD;
      to the patient from this follow up, as the endoscopy camera will confirm to the patient about&#xD;
      any oesophageal injury from ablation and if any treatment is required. If no injury, this can&#xD;
      help to reassure the patient before they go home. Lastly, the follow up clinics will be as&#xD;
      normal for the participant, only that we will ask specifically for any ongoing&#xD;
      gastrooesophageal symptoms as well. We will make a record of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study authors reviewed the steps involved with this study design and conclude that no&#xD;
      major ethical or legal issue has been identified. The summary of the steps involved here&#xD;
      hopefully clarifies our viewpoint. From a management perspective, our centre is designed to&#xD;
      conduct catheter ablation procedures for AF with general anaesthetic cover. We have&#xD;
      experience and acquired the necessary equipment from the oesophageal cooling device company&#xD;
      and have appropriate device management protocols and storage space in place. External funding&#xD;
      for the project has been secured to cover for the additional cost of the oesophageal cooling&#xD;
      devices. The endoscopy department at our centre is also equipped and supportive of our study&#xD;
      and are able to conduct the additional follow up endoscopy tests post ablation. They are&#xD;
      already accustomed to endoscopy test requests from our department, due to strong clinical&#xD;
      indication, post catheter ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, we have conducted this proposed research trial at a single-site setting to great&#xD;
      success and with excellent safety record with no probe-related trauma and we did not&#xD;
      encounter any new or unexpected issues or difficulties. We obtained good patient feedback&#xD;
      from the single-centre study. This same trial will run at 5 sites across the UK&#xD;
