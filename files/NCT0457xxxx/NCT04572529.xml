      This study aims to achieve the following objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  objective 1 : To review the Investigators' experience of surgical management of&#xD;
           infective endocarditis (IE) and analyze the outcomes and associated prognostic factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  objective 2 : To provides information on early and late clinical outcomes of patients&#xD;
           undergoing surgery for IE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  objective 3 : To evaluate the impact of perioperative clinical variables and&#xD;
           identification of perioperative prognostic factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  objective 4 : To determine the indications of surgical intervention and the best time of&#xD;
           the surgery&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of surgery in active infective endocarditis (IE) has been expanding since the first&#xD;
      report of successful ventricular septal repair and removal of tricuspid vegetation in 1961&#xD;
      and the first successful valve replacement during active IE in 1965 &quot;4&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of death and complications of infective endocarditis (IE) treated medically has to&#xD;
      be balanced against those from surgery in constructing a therapeutic approach .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of surgery depend upon many factors. The general preoperative condition of the&#xD;
      patient, antibiotic treatment, timing of surgery, perioperative management, surgical&#xD;
      techniques( including choice of methods for reconstruction), postoperative management, and&#xD;
      follow-up are all important determinants of outcome .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite substantial improvements made in the diagnosis and management of infective&#xD;
      endocarditis (IE), infective endocarditis remains a serious condition that is associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality. Compared with antibiotic treatment alone, surgery for IE&#xD;
      has greatly increased survival &quot;1&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery for IE is required in 25-30% of cases during the acute phase and in 20-40% during the&#xD;
      convalescent phase &quot;2&quot;. The most common indications for surgery in IE include intractable&#xD;
      heart failure, uncontrolled infection related to peri-valvular extension and resistant&#xD;
      organisms, recurrent embolic events and presence of prosthetic material &quot;3&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk stratification to identify patients at high risk of developing significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality is important in the management of IE. Some authors have found operation during the&#xD;
      acute phase of endocarditis to be associated with a higher risk of persistent or early&#xD;
      recurrent prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)&quot;5&quot;. Other studies did not find an increased&#xD;
      recurrence rate &quot;6&quot;, particularly not after surgery for mitral valve endocarditis &quot;7&quot;. In&#xD;
      general, the prognosis is better after early surgery undertaken before the cardiac pathology&#xD;
      and the general condition of the patient have deteriorated too severely &quot;8&quot;&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint in this study will be overall cumulative postoperative survival up to one year post-operatively , which will me meassured by the mortalitiy rates . All-cause mortality such as development of sepsis , complications related to stroke , and the development of multisystem organ failure will be discussed . All mortality factors including age of the patient , size of vegetations , type of the involved valve wheather native or prosthetic , Cardiopulmonary bypass time will be well analysed . Statistical analyses were performed using (SPSS) program version 20 (IBM Corporation; Endicott, New York, USA).</description>

    <description>The incidince of recurrence of the disease will be on of the primary outcomes in this study . It will be measured by follow up echocardiography , physical signs of the patient , and blood cultures . The following variables will be analyzed for each case: site of infection, active infection at surgery, drug abuse, presence of type 2 diabetes, perivalvular involvement, prosthetic endocarditis, positive blood cultures, previous embolism, and type of prosthetic valve implanted .</description>

Expected early complications include : multi-organ failure secondary to low cardiac output syndrome, fulminant sepsis secondary to residual IE or hospital-acquired pneumonia , acute intracranial hemorrhage, Reoperation for bleeding , Reoperation (valve-related) and Permanent pacemaker .&#xD;
Expected late complications include : reoperation for recurrent or residual IE, for structural valve deterioration of a biological prosthesis , for nonstructural dysfunction and for valve thrombosis of a mechanical valve prosthesis .</description>

        All patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be managed in Asyut university hospitals&#xD;
        . The information gathered from the eligible patients will be entered into a data sheet&#xD;
        containing the variables of interest that will be analysed later at the end of the study.&#xD;
        This study will not alter the patients' treatment and follow up at our centre, by any&#xD;
