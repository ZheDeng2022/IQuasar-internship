  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An alarming number of students report depressive symptoms that make it difficult to function&#xD;
      academically. Previous research has indicated that exercise can be effective in treating&#xD;
      mild-moderate depression. However, individuals with depression may struggle psychologically&#xD;
      to adhere to exercise programs. Researchers have highlighted the potential role of&#xD;
      self-compassion, a psychological approach that is useful in dealing with personal&#xD;
      inadequacies, to facilitate health behaviour regulation. Behavioural coaching is another&#xD;
      approach that consists of self-regulatory strategies such as action planning and less&#xD;
      emphasis on emotion-focused strategies. The purpose of this study is to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a structured exercise and psychoeducation program on improving depressive&#xD;
      symptoms among inactive students with depression and to evaluate if the addition of&#xD;
      psychological components (self-compassion or behavioural coaching) affects this&#xD;
      effectiveness. Students with mild-to-moderate depression will refer themselves to participate&#xD;
      or be referred/recommended by Student Health Services at Western University. The study will&#xD;
      consist of attending 3 exercise + psychoeducation sessions per week for 10-weeks. Study&#xD;
      participants will be randomly allocated to one of three groups; exercise only, exercise +&#xD;
      self-compassion, or exercise + behavioral coaching. All will complete questionnaires before,&#xD;
      after, and 3-months following the end of their sessions. It is expected that participants in&#xD;
      the exercise + self-compassion or exercise + behaviour coaching groups will show greater&#xD;
      improvements in their depressive symptoms, program adherence and follow-up exercise behaviour&#xD;
      and depression after 3 months than the exercise only group and that the exercise +&#xD;
      self-compassion group will be superior to the exercise + behavioural coaching group in those&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10-week randomized parallel study assessing the effectiveness of exercise in&#xD;
      reducing depressive symptoms among students with mild-to-moderate depression. This study has&#xD;
      three treatment arms: exercise; exercise + self-compassion; exercise + behavioral coaching.&#xD;
      Each participant will be invited to attend 3 supervised group-based sessions each week either&#xD;
      virtually through Zoom or in-person at the Exercise and Health Psychology Lab for 10 weeks.&#xD;
      Senior undergraduate Kinesiology students will facilitate a personalized exercise program&#xD;
      adapted to the participant's abilities, teach participants how to exercise, and gauge&#xD;
      exercise intensity in a safe manner. The CANMAT guidelines will be implemented, with the&#xD;
      program consisting of supervised moderate-intensity exercise sessions lasting 30-minutes&#xD;
      (plus 10-minutes for warm-up and cool-down), 3 times weekly, for a period of 10-weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will start exercising at a low intensity and progressively increase until they&#xD;
      are consistently exercising at a moderate intensity. The exercise intervention will integrate&#xD;
      moderate intensity aerobic and resistance training activities while accounting for the&#xD;
      physical abilities and interests of the individual participant and theh group.The exercise +&#xD;
      psychoeducation groups will receive equal contact supplemental individual manualized&#xD;
      strategies each session (+15-20 minutes) centered either on behaviour change strategies&#xD;
      (i.e., action planning, implementation intentions, relapse prevention, and goal setting) or&#xD;
      self-compassion strategies (i.e., mindfulness, self-directed kindness meditations, and&#xD;
      writing tasks). The manualized psychoeducation sessions will be group-based with the trainer&#xD;
      that is supervising the exercise sessions. Participants will fill out surveys before, after&#xD;
      and three months following the intervention period.&#xD;

    <description>Undergraduate peer-facilitators part of a curricular kinesiology program will facilitate a personalized group-based exercise program adapted to the participant's abilities, teach participants how to exercise, and gauge exercise intensity in a safe manner (26). The CANMAT guidelines will be implemented, with the program consisting of supervised group-based moderate-intensity exercise sessions lasting 30-minutes (plus 10-minutes for warm-up and cool-down), 3 times weekly, for a period of 10-weeks. Participants will start exercising at a low intensity and progressively increase until they are consistently exercising at a moderate intensity. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, the intervention will be conducted either via a virtual platform or in-person at the Exercise and Health Psychology Lab, depending on the health and safety restrictions applicable to when the student enrolls and begins their program.</description>
