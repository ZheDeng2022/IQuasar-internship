    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular cancer is the 6th most common seen disease in the world and the 3rd in&#xD;
      cancer-related deaths. Liver transplantation is the primary curative treatment of HCC, as it&#xD;
      eliminates liver cancer and underlying cirrhosis. However, liver transplantation is not&#xD;
      offered to every HCC patient, since advanced stage HCC patients are lost with tumor&#xD;
      recurrence early after liver transplantation. The Milan criteria, which are accepted&#xD;
      worldwide, are the patient selection criteria that we have to follow in cadaver-to-liver&#xD;
      transplantation for HCC in our country. However, as the Milan criteria are very strict&#xD;
      criteria, it pushes patients out of liver transplantation who exceed the Milan criteria but&#xD;
      who can benefit from liver transplantation. Liver transplantation centers all over the world&#xD;
      have declared their own criteria under the expanded Milan criteria. In our country, Malatya&#xD;
      Criteria have been defined by İnönü University on this subject, and our studies on this&#xD;
      subject still continue. When we scan the original articles of all these defined criteria,&#xD;
      incomplete data are formed and therefore the strength of the criteria cannot be clearly&#xD;
      revealed. For this reason, we aimed to analyze the results of our center and present&#xD;
      information about the power of the criteria to the literature.&#xD;

      Aim: To investigate the criteria with the longest overall and disease-free survival and&#xD;
      lowest recurrence rates in liver transplantation for hepatocellular cancer (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: When the liver transplant criteria for HCC were examined, we saw that many&#xD;
      criteria defined in their original articles did not include the rates of extending the Milan&#xD;
      criteria, survival and recurrence rates of non-milan patients who were within the newly&#xD;
      defined criteria. Therefore, information on which of the criteria defined for liver&#xD;
      transplantation in HCC extends the Milan criteria more, which has a longer survival rate and&#xD;
      which has a lower recurrence rate is lacking. In order to eliminate this deficiency or at&#xD;
      least to have a rough idea, we aimed to compare the results of liver transplantation,&#xD;
      performed for HCC in our institute which is a high-volume liver transplant center, by&#xD;
      analyzing it according to the existing defined criteria. Thus, we were able to compare the&#xD;
      criteria in a homogeneous patient group that was formed as a result of the same inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria in the same period of time. The highest overall and disease-free survival,&#xD;
      the lowest recurrence rate, and the criterion that extends the Milan criteria will be&#xD;
      introduced. In addition, this study is the first comprehensive comparison of liver transplant&#xD;
      criteria for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Between March 2002 and July 2020, the data of 424 patients who underwent liver&#xD;
      transplantation due to HCC at the Liver Transplantation Institute of İnönü University will be&#xD;
      retrospectively analyzed from the prospectively recorded data bank and automation system.&#xD;
      Tumor size, tumor number, differentiation and microscopic venous invasion data will all be&#xD;
      recorded from the data in the explant pathology report. Since the primary aim of our study is&#xD;
      cancer-related survival in patients who can be transplanted, 31 patients with tumor invasion&#xD;
      outside the liver (extrahepatic portal vein tumor thrombosis, perihilar lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis, diaphragmatic invasion etx) and 70 patients with follow-up period after liver&#xD;
      transplantation below 90 days will be excluded from the study. The remaining 323 patients&#xD;
      will be included in the study and their data will be analyzed. First, demographic data, tumor&#xD;
      characteristics, overall and disease-free survival and recurrence rate of 323 HCC patients&#xD;
      who were the study group, will be calculated, and then these patients will be divide groups&#xD;
      according to be within or beyond the criteria, than survival and recurrence rates will be&#xD;
      calculated. It was then examined whether these expanded criteria actually extended the Milan&#xD;
      criteria. It was checked whether a defined Expanded criterion allowed liver transplantation&#xD;
      for patients outside of Milan while excluding patients within Milan from liver&#xD;
      transplantation. How far the expanded criteria expand the Milan and survival of the patients&#xD;
      who beyond Milan but within the criteria were analyzed separately. Thus, the most useful&#xD;
      criterion for liver transplantation in HCC treatment will be revealed.&#xD;
