    <textblock>
      Background The flaps closure including natal cleft obliteration and eccentric closure are&#xD;
      becoming more popular due to their lower rate of recurrence including both the lateral&#xD;
      advancement adipo-fascio-cutaneous flap and the classic limberg flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective This study was aim to compare the results of the surgery for non-complicated&#xD;
      pilonidal sinus with the lateral advancement adipo-fascio-cutaneous flap versus the classic&#xD;
      Limberg flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods This study was a prospective randomized controlled, and was conducted on&#xD;
      patients with non-complicated pilonidal sinus attending Zagazig University Hospitals, Egypt&#xD;
      during the period from February 2017 to August 2019. Patients were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      undergo either lateral advancement flap or classic Limberg flap groups. The follow-up period&#xD;
      ranged from 12 to 36 months. Patient satisfaction, complications and recurrence rates were&#xD;
      analyzed and compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hodges was the first to use the term &quot;pilonidal&quot; (which was derived from the Latin pilus=hair&#xD;
      and nidus=nest) in 1988.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilonidal disease is usually predisposed by the presence of a deep natal cleft containing&#xD;
      a lot of hairs within it, which is also supplies a good environment for maceration, sweating,&#xD;
      hairs penetration, and bacterial contamination . A lot of surgical treatment techniques are&#xD;
      described for pilonidal sinus disease as simple excision and packing, excision with primary&#xD;
      midline closure, marsupialization and eccentric closure by different types of flaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though no surgical technique has been widely accepted, but the flaps closure including natal&#xD;
      cleft obliteration and eccentric closure are becoming more popular due to their lower rate of&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the off-midline approach seems optimal for closure, the standard off-midline surgery&#xD;
      has not yet been concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our best knowledge, no randomized study has yet compared the lateral advancement&#xD;
      adipo-fascio-cutaneous flap and the classic Limberg flap. Therefore, the aim of the present&#xD;
      study was to compare in a randomized controlled trial the short-term results of the surgical&#xD;
      treatment of non-complicated pilonidal sinus with the lateral advancement&#xD;
      adipo-fascio-cutaneous flap versus the classic Limberg flap.&#xD;
