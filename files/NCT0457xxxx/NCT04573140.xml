  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective will be to demonstrate the manufacturing feasibility and safety, and to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RNA-LP vaccines in (Stratum 1) adult patients&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed GBM (MGMT unmethylated).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human Phase I/II study of RNA-LP vaccines for newly diagnosed adult MGMT&#xD;
      unmethylated glioblastoma (GBM). The phase I portion of the study will involve a&#xD;
      dose-escalation study to identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD). Up to 28 participants&#xD;
      may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will consist of three parts: Surgery, Radiation, and Immunotherapy.&#xD;
      Surgery and chemoradiation will be standard of care for patients with GBM. Potentially&#xD;
      eligible participants will be enrolled on a screening consent for the sterile collection of&#xD;
      tumor material in a manner suitable for RNA extraction, amplification, and loading of lipid&#xD;
      particles (LPs). Tumor material will be sent to the University of Florida (UF). Following&#xD;
      surgical resection with confirmatory pathologic diagnosis, patients will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      trial after informed consent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RNA-LP vaccination will begin within 4 weeks following radiation and after review of&#xD;
      post-radiation MRI (for baseline). After radiation patients will receive three RNA-LP&#xD;
      vaccines every 2 weeks before beginning 12 cycles of adjuvant monthly RNA- LP vaccines for a&#xD;
      total of 15 vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may receive RNA-LP vaccines for up to 14 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed until death due to any cause. MRI and clinical evaluation for&#xD;
      assessment of disease progression will be conducted every 3 months for the first year&#xD;
      post-immunotherapy and then every 6-12 months over the next 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>Potentially eligible subjectsparticipants will be enrolled on a screening consent for the sterile collection of tumor material in a manner suitable for RNA extraction, amplification, and loading of lipid particles (LPs). Tumor material will be sent to the University of Florida (UF) where tumor specific RNA-LP vaccines will be manufactured. Manufacturing feasibility will be determined based on the percentage of vaccines that are successfully manufactured in the DLT window during the first three vaccines. If two-thirds of vaccines are successfully manufactured with Qa/Qc clearance, we will conclude that RNA-LPs can be successfully manufactured.</description>

    <description>The Phase I Stratum 1 dose-escalation study will be performed in up to 28 adult participants using a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design with an initial embedded accelerated titration design (ATD) to efficiently identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD). For the initial ATD, patients will be enrolled and treated in cohorts of size 1 starting at dose level -4 to dose level -1. After the first DLT is observed or if dose level 0 is reached without prior DLT in dose level -4 to -1, the study will expand to a BOIN design with a cohort size of 3 to identify the MTD. For the initial ATD, patients will be enrolled and treated in cohorts of size 1 starting at dose level -4 to dose level -1, and will expand to a cohort size of 3 after the first DLT is observed or at dose level 0. There are 8 dose levels to potentially be assessed including the possibility of 4 dose levels for the ATD and 4 for the BOIN.</description>
