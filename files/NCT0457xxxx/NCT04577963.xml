  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, Phase 1b/2 study to assess the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of fruquintinib in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced,&#xD;
      refractory TNBC. This study will be conducted in 2 parts; a safety lead-in phase (Part 1) and&#xD;
      a dose expansion phase (Part 2). The safety lead-in phase will determine the RP2D. The RP2D&#xD;
      will be administered to 2 cohorts of patients in the expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: TNBC (IO-treated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: TNBC (IO-Naïve)&#xD;

             correctly, starting during the screening period, continuing throughout the entire&#xD;
             study period, and for 120 days after taking the last dose of study drug. Such methods&#xD;
             include: oral hormonal contraception (combined estrogen/ progestogen, or&#xD;
