  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to analyse the effectiveness of the VIRTUAL FIBROWALK&#xD;
      multicomponent treatment program as coadjuvant of treatment-as-usual (TAU) compared to TAU&#xD;
      alone. In this Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), in addition to evaluating the clinical&#xD;
      effects of VIRTUAL FIBROWALK treatment in the short- and longterm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a tree-arm RCT focused on the safety and potential effectiveness of the&#xD;
      multicomponent program VIRTUAL FIBROWALK as coadjuvant of treatment-as-usual (TAU) vs. TAU&#xD;
      alone and on the comparation of the physiotherapy part of the multicomponent program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VIRTUAL FIBROWALK combines multicomponent approach based on Pain Neuroscience Education&#xD;
           (PNE), therapeutic exercise, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiotherapy part of VIRTUAL FIBROWALK combines multicomponent approach based on Pain&#xD;
           Neuroscience Education (PNE) and therapeutic exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main hypothesis is that improvement on functional impairment of patients with&#xD;
           fibromyalgia can be achieved by the direct intervention on mechanisms such as&#xD;
           kinesiophobia and fear avoidance&#xD;

    <measure>Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FIQR comprises three dimensions: physical dysfunction (scores from 0 to 30), overall impact (scores from 0 to 20), and intensity of the symptoms (scores from 0 to 50) is used to measure the impact generated by FM during the last week. It consists of 21 items, which are answered on a numerical rating scale of 11 points (from 0 to 10). Total scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting greater deterioration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>TSK-11 is used to assess fear of pain and movement. It consists of 11 items, which are answered on a Likert scale of 4 points. Total scores of each scale range from 11 to 44, where higher scores indicate a greater fear of pain and movement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>HADS is used to quantify the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms. It consists of two dimensions (anxiety and depression) of 7 items each responding on a Likert scale of 4 points. Total scores of each scale (HADS-A and HADSD) range from 0 to 21, where higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Function of the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Function of the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) was used to measure physical function.This dimension comprises a total of 10 items, which are answered on a Likert scale of 3 points. Total scores on each scale are then transformed and can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicate better physical function.</description>
