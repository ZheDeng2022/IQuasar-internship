      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study, with parallel groups, to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy and safety of a new low-concentration estriol formulation (ITFE-2026&#xD;
      0.005%) for application by vaginal route in the treatment of postmenopausal vaginal atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the efficacy of 0.005% Estriol vaginal gel by evaluation of the change in the&#xD;
      maturation value of the vaginal epithelium (MV) after 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the variation of the vaginal pH, as well as symptoms and signs suggestive&#xD;
           of vaginal atrophy after 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the variation of the MV, pH and symptoms and signs suggestive of vaginal&#xD;
           atrophy after an initial observation period of 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of 0.005% Estriol vaginal gel&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study, with parallel&#xD;
      groups, to determine the efficacy and safety of a new low-concentration estriol formulation&#xD;
      (ITFE-2026 0.005%) for application by vaginal route in the treatment of postmenopausal&#xD;
      vaginal atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to 0.005% Estriol vaginal gel : placebo.&#xD;
      Each patient was treated for 12 weeks followed by a one-month observational period. The&#xD;
      patients attended the study centre at baseline and at 3, 8 and 12 weeks after start of&#xD;
      treatment. Vaginal cytology was performed at baseline and at weeks 3 and 12; the vaginal pH&#xD;
      and the signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy were recorded at baseline and after 3 and 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment. Vital signs, gynaecological exploration and changes in health and&#xD;
      concomitant medication were documented at each visit. Transvaginal ultrasound was performed&#xD;
      at screening and week 12. The investigators telephoned the patient approximately one month&#xD;
      after the final visit to check if the patient had experienced any adverse events since the&#xD;
      final visit. Two independent cytopathologists assessed the maturation value of each cytology&#xD;
      sample at the end of the study.&#xD;

    <description>Maturation value (MV) is a cytologic parameter indicative of the degree of atrophy of the vaginal mucosa.&#xD;
This variable is a quantitative parameter indicative of the cytological status of the vaginal epithelium. The number of parabasal, intermediate and superficial cells was calculated from 300 consecutive cells of the samples of vaginal cytology, and the percentages of each type of cells obtained. The Maturation Value was obtained based on the following formula: 0.2 x (% parabasal) + 0.6 x (% intermediate) + 1.0 x (% superficial). The higher the value, the higher the maturation degree.</description>

        <description>Maturation value (MV) is a cytologic parameter indicative of the degree of atrophy of the vaginal mucosa.&#xD;
This variable is a quantitative parameter indicative of the cytological status of the vaginal epithelium. The number of parabasal, intermediate and superficial cells was calculated from 300 consecutive cells of the samples of vaginal cytology, and the percentages of each type of cells obtained. The Maturation Value was obtained based on the following formula: 0.2 x (% parabasal) + 0.6 x (% intermediate) + 1.0 x (% superficial). The higher the value, the higher the maturation degree.</description>

        <description>Signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy are: vaginal dryness, pruritus or itching, burning, dyspareunia, dysuria.&#xD;
For each of these symptoms the subject indicates one the following status: present, absent, missing.&#xD;
Symptoms of vaginal atrophy were scored by the patients in a numeric scale from 0 to 3, as shown below:&#xD;
0 Absence. The symptom is not present&#xD;
The symptom is of mild intensity, without interfering in the patient's activity&#xD;
The symptom is of moderate intensity, causing obvious discomfort to the patient's&#xD;
The symptom is very irritating and severe in intensity&#xD;
Signs of vaginal atrophy were evaluated by the investigator and scored on a numerical scale as shown below:&#xD;
0 Absence. The symptom is not present&#xD;
The sign is present and is considered a mild alteration&#xD;

          <description>Signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy are: vaginal dryness, pruritus or itching, burning, dyspareunia, dysuria.&#xD;
For each of these symptoms the subject indicates one the following status: present, absent, missing.&#xD;
Symptoms of vaginal atrophy were scored by the patients in a numeric scale from 0 to 3, as shown below:&#xD;
0 Absence. The symptom is not present&#xD;
The symptom is of mild intensity, without interfering in the patient's activity&#xD;
The symptom is of moderate intensity, causing obvious discomfort to the patient's&#xD;
The symptom is very irritating and severe in intensity&#xD;
Signs of vaginal atrophy were evaluated by the investigator and scored on a numerical scale as shown below:&#xD;

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 3 in Maturation Value (MV) After 3 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>Maturation value (MV) is a cytologic parameter indicative of the degree of atrophy of the vaginal mucosa.&#xD;
This variable is a quantitative parameter indicative of the cytological status of the vaginal epithelium. The number of parabasal, intermediate and superficial cells was calculated from 300 consecutive cells of the samples of vaginal cytology, and the percentages of each type of cells obtained. The Maturation Value was obtained based on the following formula: 0.2 x (% parabasal) + 0.6 x (% intermediate) + 1.0 x (% superficial). The higher the value, the higher the maturation degree.</description>

        <description>Signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy are: vaginal dryness, pruritus or itching, burning, dyspareunia, dysuria.&#xD;
For each of these symptoms the subject indicates one the following status: present, absent, missing.&#xD;
Symptoms of vaginal atrophy were scored by the patients in a numeric scale from 0 to 3, as shown below:&#xD;
0 Absence. The symptom is not present&#xD;
The symptom is of mild intensity, without interfering in the patient's activity&#xD;
The symptom is of moderate intensity, causing obvious discomfort to the patient's&#xD;
The symptom is very irritating and severe in intensity&#xD;
Signs of vaginal atrophy were evaluated by the investigator and scored on a numerical scale as shown below:&#xD;
0 Absence. The symptom is not present&#xD;
The sign is present and is considered a mild alteration&#xD;
