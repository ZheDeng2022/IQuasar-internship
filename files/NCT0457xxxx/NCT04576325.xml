    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of voriconazole inhalation powder&#xD;
      (VIP) in adult subjects with well-controlled Step 2 or Step 3 asthma. This study will involve&#xD;
      a minimum of 2 cohorts. The first 2 subjects randomized into each cohort will be sentinel&#xD;
      subjects (i.e., one assigned to VIP and one assigned to placebo). If study drug is deemed&#xD;
      safe by the PI, the remaining 6 subjects (5 on VIP and 1 on placebo) may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Cohort 1, 8 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio (6 on active and 2 on&#xD;
           placebo) to receive 7 doses BID (over 3.5 days) of 40mg VIP or inhaled placebo.&#xD;
           Following completion of Cohort 1 and after dose escalation has been approved by the SMC,&#xD;
           Cohort 2 may begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Cohort 2, 8 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 7 doses&#xD;
           BID (over 3.5 days) of 80 mg VIP or placebo . Doses will be administered twice daily&#xD;
           every 12 (Â± 1 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third cohort with the same design and number of subjects may be initiated if there are&#xD;
      safety or other findings from Cohort 2 that warrant investigation of an intermediary dose&#xD;
      (e.g., VIP 60 mg BID). The decision to initiate this potential 3rd cohort will be made by the&#xD;
      Sponsor in collaboration with the safety monitoring committee (SMC). A sentinel design will&#xD;
      not be required for this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a variable length Screening period, all subjects will be domiciled in a clinical&#xD;
      research facility from the Check-In Day (Day -1) and will remain domiciled until the morning&#xD;
      of Day 5. A follow-up phone call or clinic visit (depending on best practices at the time for&#xD;
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 [COVID-19] precautions) will be made one week later to assess&#xD;
      subject status and record any adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by monitoring AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, spirometry, 12-lead ECGs, and physical examinations. Blood PK will be assessed from&#xD;
      serial blood collections following Dose 1 and Dose 7. Study treatment stopping rules for&#xD;
      individual subjects will be based on AEs, SAEs, required changes during the treatment period&#xD;
      to asthma medications, spirometry measure of forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), and&#xD;
      increases in QTcF values on ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SMC will review the safety information accrued during the study and will be responsible&#xD;
      for reviewing Cohort 1 safety information before authorizing dose escalation to Cohort 2.&#xD;
