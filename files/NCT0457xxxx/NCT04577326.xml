    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of MSLN-targeted CAR-T cells at different doses to find the&#xD;
      safest dose to give to people with MPM. The researchers want to see what effects, if any, the&#xD;
      study treatment has on people with this type of cancer. This study is the first time that an&#xD;
      MSLN-targeted CAR-T cell treatment with an anti-PD1 component is being given to people.&#xD;

    <description>Following eligibility screening and enrollment, patients will undergo leukapheresis for the collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), to enable generation of M28z1XXPD1DNR. Following successful M28z1XXPD1DNR CAR T-cell manufacturing, patients will be reevaluated for eligibility. A preconditioning regimen of one dose of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide 1.5 g/m2 will be administered 2-7 days before the infusion. A single dose of M28z1XXPD1DNR CAR T cells will be instilled into the pleural cavity via a pleural catheter or through an interventional radiology-guided needle. All patients will be monitored in the hospital for a minimum of 48 h following the administration of CAR T cells.</description>
