  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experiencing an episode of musculoskeletal (MSK) pain in young age significantly increases&#xD;
      the risk of developing MSK pain later in life. Consequently, knowledge on modifiable risk&#xD;
      factors early in life is needed. In this prospective cohort study, data from the&#xD;
      population-based Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) will be used to investigate whether a&#xD;
      combination of lifestyle factors in adolescence is associated with persistent MSK pain in&#xD;
      young adulthood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is need for knowledge on modifiable risk factors for MSK pain in young ages to better&#xD;
      target treatment and preventive. A combination of lifestyle factors has been associated with&#xD;
      several health issues including MSK pain in adults, but has to the best of our knowledge not&#xD;
      previously been investigated as a risk factor for MSK pain in the youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to investigate whether a combination of lifestyle&#xD;
      factors in adolescence is associated with later persistent MSK pain in young adulthood.&#xD;
      Lifestyle factors will be assessed by combing levels of physical activity, sleep problems,&#xD;
      fruit/vegetable consumption, alcohol consumption, use of drugs and smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be conducted in a sample of adolescents with MSK pain, and in a sample of&#xD;
      adolescents without MSK pain in the first survey, separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN This study will be a prospective cohort study using data from the large&#xD;
      population-based Nord Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT). Data from YoungHUNT3 (2006-2008) and&#xD;
      HUNT4 (2017-2019) will be used, including the same participants examined With 11-year&#xD;
      follow-up. The data in Young-HUNT 3 was collected through questionnaires, interviews and&#xD;
      measurements during school time. Adolescents, who did not attend school, received an&#xD;
      invitation to participate by mail. The outcome data was obtained by electronic questionnaire&#xD;
      or paper from HUNT 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPOSURE VARIABLE A combined lifestyle variable will be composed based on scorings in the&#xD;
      lifestyle variables physical activity level, sleep problems, fruit/vegetable consumption,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, drug use and smoking level from Young-HUNT3, which will all be&#xD;
      categorized as healthy/ unhealthy (as defined below). The combined lifestyle variable will be&#xD;
      arranged with 0/1 unhealthy lifestyle factors present as the reference category, and 2&#xD;
      factor, 3 factors and ≥4 unhealthy lifestyle factors present as the other categories. The&#xD;
      combined variable will be investigated with different thresholds of alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity level: less than 2-3 days a week with sports or exercise is classified&#xD;
           as a unhealthy level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep problems is measured by two questions; one of whether the adolescents have&#xD;
           problems falling asleep at night and one of whether the adolescents wake up early and&#xD;
           have problems falling asleep again. Answering &quot;often&quot; or &quot;almost every night&quot; on one or&#xD;
           both of these questions is classified as unhealthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fruit / vegetables consumption is measured by questions of consumption frequency.&#xD;
           Answering &quot;several times a day&quot; on both questions will be considered a sufficient&#xD;
           consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol consumption is measured by a question of whether the participants have ever&#xD;
           tried to drink alcohol, and a question of whether the participants have ever been&#xD;
           drinking so much that they have felt intoxicated (drunk). Those who have never tried&#xD;
           drinking alcohol or have been intoxicated ≤10 times will be classified as healthy.&#xD;
           Reporting &gt;10 intoxications will be classified as unhealthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of drugs: those who answer that they have tried hash, marijuana or other drugs will&#xD;
           form the unhealthy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking will be dichotomized with no smokers in the healthy group and daily and&#xD;
           occasional smokers in the unhealthy group. Previously smokers will be included in the no&#xD;
           smoking group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFOUNDING FACTORS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceived family economic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological distress, measured by the Symptom Checklist-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other chronic diseases, including asthma, diabetes, migraine and/or epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain impact on daily activities at baseline (in the analyses of the sample with MSK pain&#xD;
           at baseline only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of pain sites at baseline (in the analyses of the sample with MSK pain at&#xD;
           baseline only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Additional analyses will be conducted with adjustment for BMI, measured by kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS METHODS Statistical tests will be two-sided, and p-values &lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant. P-value and the 95% confidence intervals will be reported. All&#xD;
      continuous variables will be investigated for normality through histograms and QQ-plots.&#xD;
      Normally distributed descriptive data of study participant will be presented with means and&#xD;
      standard deviations (SD), skewed data will be presented with median and ranges and&#xD;
      categorical data will be presented as counts and percentages. The analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      with STATA statistical software system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For missing data on the exposure variable and confounding factors, multiple imputation will&#xD;
      be considered. Variables with more than 20% missing data will be excluded. Participants with&#xD;
      missing outcome data will be excluded from the analyses. Characteristics of the individuals&#xD;
      lost to follow-up will be compared to characteristics of responders at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence and prevalence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence and incidence rate of MSK pain will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression will be used to investigate the association between combined lifestyle&#xD;
      factors in adolescence and persistent MSK pain in young adulthood. The combined lifestyle&#xD;
      factor variable will be investigated with different thresholds of alcohol consumption. The&#xD;
      associations will be investigated in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. The adjusted analyses&#xD;
      will be conducted first with adjustment for background factors, second with adjustment for&#xD;
      background factors and health factors. There will be conducted additional analyses with&#xD;
      adjustment for BMI (kg/m2). The results will be reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-group analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be conducted subgroup analyses for girls and boys separately, if there is a&#xD;
      sufficient number of participants.&#xD;
