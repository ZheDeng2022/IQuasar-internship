  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prediction of motor recovery in the acute phase of stroke is crucial for several clinical&#xD;
      reasons: (i) informing the patient and his relatives, (ii) helping to identify the patient's&#xD;
      endorsement (return home or rehabilitation) as well as the adaptation of the rehabilitation&#xD;
      program to what can be expected from it. To date, an algorithm (decision tree) proposed by C.&#xD;
      Stinear's team named PREP2 is the best predictive tool with 75% of patients well classified&#xD;
      at 3 months. It predicts the functional recovery of the upper limb after stroke 3 months&#xD;
      before the episode by categorizing recovery as &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;limited&quot; as well as&#xD;
      &quot;minor&quot; (poor). With two data (SAFE score, age) or three (SAFE score, Motor evoked potential,&#xD;
      NIHSS), the prediction is effective three times out of 4. In the study we are proposing&#xD;
      &quot;PREP-UCV&quot;, we would like to validate this algorithm as it is with patients in our active&#xD;
      file who are victims of stroke. The expected accuracy is 75% or more. As a secondary&#xD;
      objective, we would like to confirm that we find the same algorithm starting from the initial&#xD;
      data from PREP 2 (side of the stroke, type of stroke (ischemic and / or hemorrhagic),&#xD;
      involvement of the corticospinal tract on MRI, sex at birth ) as well as two other factors&#xD;
      which are also very important: cognitive status (dysexecutive / aphasia / neglect), as well&#xD;
      as the neutrophils on lymphocytes ratio.&#xD;

      Retrospective cohort of stroke patients with a upper limb deficit.Clinical scores such as&#xD;
      SAFE score, NIHSS; demographic data such as age and electrophysiological data (such as the&#xD;
      absence/presence of Motor evoked potential) will determine the predictive functional outcome&#xD;
      of the upper limb deficit according to the PREP2 algorithm. The accuracy of this prediction&#xD;
      will be verified according to the actual state of the patient at 3-6 months. Second, another&#xD;
      algorithm will be built taking in account cognitive deficits and biological data to determine&#xD;
      if the accuracy is higher. All data will be acquired during the clinical routine work-up.&#xD;
