  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this retrospective study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      abatacept and rituximab treatment of ILLD in a cohort of pediatric patients with different&#xD;
      forms of PID, who received one of the two therapy regimens predominantly based on the lesions&#xD;
      histopathology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary immunodeficiencies (PID) represent a heterogeneous group of more than 400 inherited&#xD;
      conditions with associated immune dysfunctions. Though severe recurrent/chronic infections&#xD;
      are the main cause of mortality and morbidity in PID, immune dysregulation manifesting with&#xD;
      oncological and autoimmune or autoinflammatory conditions involving various organs and&#xD;
      systems have been the focus of research in the recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interstitial lymphocytic lung disease (ILLD) is one of the recently characterized&#xD;
      non-malignant PID complications. Immune dysregulation in ILLD causes reactive&#xD;
      bronchi-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) hyperplasia that manifests in several&#xD;
      pathomorphological forms: follicular bronchiolitis (FB), nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH),&#xD;
      and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP). Treatment of ILLD patients with various&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs leads to inconsistent results ranging from partial\transient effect&#xD;
      to no effect at all and has been often associated with adverse effects and an increase in&#xD;
      infections' rate. Therefore there is a need for targeted therapy of ILLD. In small cohorts of&#xD;
      adult PID patients rituximab in combination with azathioprine proved to be effective. Yet,&#xD;
      the reports are scarce and there is currently no consensus on ILLD treatment, especially in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect and analyze information on the effectiveness and safety of ILLD&#xD;
      monotherapy with rituximab or abatacept, chosen predominantly based on the pathomorphological&#xD;
      characteristics of lymphoid infiltration, as well as genetic defects, in a cohort of&#xD;
      pediatric patients with PID.&#xD;
