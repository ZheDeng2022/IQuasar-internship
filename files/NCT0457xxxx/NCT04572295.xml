    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of E7090 as&#xD;
      monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents in participants with ER+, HER2-&#xD;
      recurrent/metastatic breast cancer and also to determine the recommended dose (RD) of E7090&#xD;
      in combination with other anticancer agents for subsequent phase studies.&#xD;
