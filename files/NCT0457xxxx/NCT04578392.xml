  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence to suggest that the mesentery may play an active role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of Crohn's disease. There is significant clinical, endoscopic, and surgical&#xD;
      recurrence of disease following ileocolic resection at the site of the anastomosis. The study&#xD;
      is seeking to understand if the mesentery plays a role in recurrence following ileocolic&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestinal tract with an&#xD;
      unknown etiology and an unknown cure. The characteristic transmural inflammation can progress&#xD;
      to refractory inflammatory disease, stricturing disease, and fistulizing disease - all&#xD;
      potential indications for surgery when medical management has been exhausted. An important&#xD;
      tenant to remember is that surgery is not curative but is rather an adjunct to maximal&#xD;
      medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One third of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) will require a major abdominal resection&#xD;
      within 5 years of their diagnosis, and two-thirds will ultimately require operative&#xD;
      management at least once during the course of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, surgery for Crohn's disease (CD) is not curative and disease recurrence is&#xD;
      common with 62% having endoscopic recurrence at six months, and 80% and 30% of patients&#xD;
      having endoscopic and clinical recurrence, respectively, at one year. A third of these&#xD;
      patients will require a reoperation at 10 years and up to 80% will require an additional&#xD;
      operation by 15 years.This undoubtedly leads to an increased probability of malabsorption&#xD;
      syndrome and decreased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant volume of research has been conducted in attempt to determine how to prevent&#xD;
      postoperative recurrence of CD following an ileocolic resection. Some studies have focused on&#xD;
      the timing of resuming postoperative medical therapy. Others have looked at surgical&#xD;
      technique at the time of ileocolic resection including anatomic configuration of the&#xD;
      anastomosis and performing a stapled versus handsewn anastomosis. Various configurations&#xD;
      include a side to side anastomosis, end to end, and Kono-S anastomosis. A randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial compared a side to side versus an end to end, and found endoscopic recurrence rates&#xD;
      were similar in the two groups (42.5% versus 37.9%) at a mean follow up of 11.9 months. A&#xD;
      later multi-institution international trial of the Kono S anastomosis determined that the&#xD;
      anastomosis was associated with a decreased surgical recurrence rate as compared to&#xD;
      conventional anastomoses; 5 and 10 year surgical recurrence-free survival was 98.6%.15&#xD;
      Several Cochrane Database reviews have reported no difference in a stapled versus handsewn&#xD;
      anastomosis for an ileocolic resection. Therefore, other than the potential decreased&#xD;
      recurrence with the Kono-S anastomosis, no other surgical techniques have altered the&#xD;
      postoperative recurrence rate of CD following an ileocolic resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly there is recent evidence to suggest that CD may be a disease of the mesentery&#xD;
      rather than just the mucosa of the bowel alone. In CD, the transmural inflammation&#xD;
      facilitates increased bacterial translocation into the creeping fat. These translocating&#xD;
      antigens and activate adipocytes which are cells than have complex metabolic and immunologic&#xD;
      functions. Additionally, it is thought that functional abnormalities in the mesenteric&#xD;
      structures exert an inflammatory effect: the secretion of adipokines that have endocrine&#xD;
      functions contribute to immunomodulation through a response to afferent signals,&#xD;
      neuropeptides, and functional cytokines; mesenteric nerves are involved in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      through neuropeptides; and lymphatics in the mesentery may obstruct, remodel, and impair&#xD;
      contraction, contributing to the irregularly thickened mesentery seen in CD. Interestingly,&#xD;
      the interaction between neuropeptides, adipokines, and vascular and lymphatic endothelia&#xD;
      leads to adipose tissue remodeling. This makes the mesentery an active participant in CD,&#xD;
      seemingly as much as the bowel itself. However, the mesentery is typically spared, or left in&#xD;
      situ, during resection for CD, unlike resections for adenocarinocma of the colon. In&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, a 'high ligation' is performed, where the feeding vessel is taken at its&#xD;
      origin in order to take sufficient mesentery and lymph nodes with the colon specimen.&#xD;
      However, in operations for CD, the mesentery is spared and typically taken close to the bowel&#xD;
      wall despite enlarged lymph nodes and thickened diseased mesentery. A high ligation of the&#xD;
      ileocolic artery in order to sample an increased volume of mesentery and lymph nodes to&#xD;
      prevent postoperative CD has never been evaluated in a randomized control trial. A recent&#xD;
      retrospective study comparing surgical recurrence following a mesenteric sparing versus&#xD;
      mesenteric resection approach with ileocecal resection found cumulative reoperation rates&#xD;
      were significantly lower in the mesenteric resection group (40% versus 2.9%; p=0.003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoscopic recurrence of CD typically precedes clinical symptoms, and the severity of&#xD;
      lesions can predict the subsequent symptomatic course of the disease. Over a four year&#xD;
      follow-up period, 100% of patients with severe endoscopic recurrence (Rutgeerts score of&#xD;
      i2-i4) developed symptomatic recurrence compared to only 9% of patients with a low score&#xD;
      (i0-i1). With such a high rate of endoscopic recurrence, it is thought that post-surgical&#xD;
      evaluation should be performed at six months rather than one year when considering adequate&#xD;
      early treatment.&#xD;
