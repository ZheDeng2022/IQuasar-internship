  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a retrospective, parallel, two years longitudinal pilot trial.&#xD;
      Twenty-eight patients (mean age: 48.34 ± 6.06) aged between 35 and 60 years and 66 TiUnite&#xD;
      surfaces (Nobel Biocare Parallel Conical Connection), bone level dental implant were included&#xD;
      in the study. The implants were divided into two different groups according to the NPIs and&#xD;
      regular platform implants(RPIs). The mean implant lengths, plaque index(PI), gingival&#xD;
      index(GI), periodontal pocket depth(PD), gingival recession(GR), keratinized gingival&#xD;
      width(KGW) and bleeding on probing(BOP) values were recorded. The Student's t-test used for&#xD;
      between-group comparison.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fifty-one participants and 123 dental implants were evaluated; twenty-three participants and&#xD;
      49 dental implants were excluded because of the different commercial brand dental implant&#xD;
      (AstraTech, Straumann Roxolid, Bilimplant) and declining to participate. Seventy-four TiUnite&#xD;
      dental implants were included in the study, but 8 TiUnite surface implants placed in the&#xD;
      anterior region were excluded. Consequently, 15 male and 13 female patients and 66 dental&#xD;
      implants were included in the study. This randomized retrospective clinical trial was&#xD;
      designed according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement&#xD;
      guidelines. A CONSORT Flow Chart of this study was shown in Figure 118.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assignment was performed according to the dental implant diameters to include cases in&#xD;
      the NPI and RPI which are the test and control groups. All dental implants involved are the&#xD;
      Nobel Biocare Parallel CC brand (Nobel Biocare, Gothenburg, Sweden) with a TiUnite surface,&#xD;
      and it defined a regular diameter of 4.3 mm and narrow diameter of 3.75 mm. Dental implants&#xD;
      divided into two groups according to implant diameter, the NPI group comprised 3.75 mm&#xD;
      diameter (NP, Ø= 3.75 mm) implants, and the RPI group comprised 4.3 mm diameter (RP, Ø=&#xD;
      4.3mm) implants (implant lengths: 10 mm-13 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Measurements The clinical measurements were recorded at follow-up sessions using a&#xD;
      periodontal probe that was calibrated in 1 mm increments. The clinical measurements were as&#xD;
      follows: 1) plaque index (PI); 2) gingival index (GI); 3) probing depth (PD), the distance&#xD;
      between the gingival margin and the bottom of a pocket; 4) clinical attachment level (CAL);&#xD;
      the distance from the neck of the implant and the bottom of the pocket; 5) bleeding on&#xD;
      probing (BOP); 6) keratinized gingival width (KGW), the height of peri-implant keratinized&#xD;
      mucosa; 7) gingival recession (GR), the distance between the neck of the implant and the&#xD;
      gingival margin. The same researcher performed all clinical measurements. A calibration&#xD;
      protocol was applied to the reliability of measurements. PI, GI, PD, CAL, GR, KGW meaurements&#xD;
      on five patients and ten peri-implant values were assessed. Calibration was accepted when&#xD;
      measurements were 90% similar20. All clinical measurements were recorded for four sites&#xD;
      (mesiobuccal, distobuccal, mid-buccal, mesiopalatal, midpalatal, and distopalatal) per&#xD;
      peri-implant region. PD and PI measurements are reliable in peri-implantitis diagnosis21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prosthetic complications of patients were also evaluated clinically. Veneer ceramic chipping,&#xD;
      abutment screw loosening or fracture, implant fracture, loss of retention were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic Measurements The studies have reported that periapical radiographs taken with&#xD;
      the parallel technique are reliable in determining the MBL changes at different follow-ups.&#xD;
      Digital periapical radiographs of the posterior region were obtained using a parallel method&#xD;
      at follow-up sessions. MBL measurements were provided on periapical radiographs by a software&#xD;
      program (Mediadent Software, The Dental Imaging Company, London, England). Ten radiographic&#xD;
      MBL measurements around peri-implant were performed twice with an interval of 3 weeks, and&#xD;
      researcher calibration was accepted when measurements were similar as %90. MBL was measured&#xD;
      separately from the mesial and distal parts and also which the average of the two&#xD;
      measurements. The reference points for the assessments are the implant shoulder and the most&#xD;
      apical end-point of the bone-implant contact point. The vertical length between these two&#xD;
      points is defined as MBL.&#xD;
