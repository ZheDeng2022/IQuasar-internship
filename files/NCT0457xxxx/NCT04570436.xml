    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active controlled, 5&#xD;
      treatment, 10 sequence, 5 period crossover single dose, Williams square design study in&#xD;
      healthy adult, non drug dependent male and female participants with drug abuse experience&#xD;
      with sedative drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes Screening, a Qualification Phase consisting of a Naloxone Challenge and&#xD;
      Discrimination crossover study, a Treatment Phase and Follow-up. Following successful&#xD;
      completion of the Qualification Phase the participants will be enrolled in the Treatment&#xD;
      phase. The Treatment Phase is a randomized, double-blind, double dummy, placebo- and active&#xD;
      controlled, 5 treatment, 10-sequence, 5 period crossover, single-dose, Williams square design&#xD;
      study in healthy male and/or female adult, non drug-dependent recreational users. On Day 1 of&#xD;
      each of the Treatment Phase 5 periods, which will be separated by a washout of at least 14&#xD;
      days, participants will receive an oral dose of either Neurontin 1800 mg, 1200 mg or 600 mg&#xD;
      or 20 mg diazepam, or placebo. Study treatments will be administered under fasted conditions&#xD;
      (overnight fast and no food until 4 hours after dosing). Water will be allowed without&#xD;
      restriction until 1 hour prior to dosing and 1 hour after dosing.&#xD;
