  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate determination of critically ill patient of being febrile or not is an essential part&#xD;
      of management critically ill patients as it prompt investigating the underlying cause and&#xD;
      initiating therapeutic action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary artery catheter thermistor is considered the gold standard for temperature&#xD;
      measurement . Central non-vascular thermometer such as esophageal, bladder and rectal&#xD;
      thermometer showed excellent correlation and agreement with pulmonary artery catheter&#xD;
      thermistor and has been accepted as alternative methods for core body temperature assessment.&#xD;
      However, those methods are invasive and cannot be tolerated in conscious patients. Peripheral&#xD;
      thermometer such as oral, axillary and tympanic membrane thermometer are either impractical&#xD;
      in unconscious patient and/or carry the risk of trauma and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infrared thermography (IRT) is a non-contact and non-invasive imaging approach that enable&#xD;
      real-time estimation of body temperature by detecting infrared emission. IRT had been used&#xD;
      for screening for mass detection of febrile patients at airport at times of infectious&#xD;
      disease outbreak. In adult population, IRT showed good accuracy in detecting febrile patients&#xD;
      in emergency department; however, those studies used 37.7⁰ C as the fever threshold and the&#xD;
      reference standard was either oral 6 or tympanic membrane thermometer. No studies to the best&#xD;
      of our knowledge had evaluated the IRT accuracy in detecting fever in critically ill patients&#xD;
      using esophageal thermometer as a reference method.&#xD;

      The enrolled patient will be sedated according to the ICU protocol. A calibrated esophageal&#xD;
      thermometer will be inserted by the attending intensivist through the nostril or oral cavity&#xD;
      into the lower third of the esophagus to approximately 10-20 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRT will be performed using FLIR C2 compact thermal camera. The focal length of the thermal&#xD;
      camera will be adjusted at 0.5 meter from the patient head. scanning will conducted over a&#xD;
      period of 10-seconds. The researcher will record the highest reading obtained from medial&#xD;
      canthus. No cold fomentations will be applied to the head nor the axilla of the patient for&#xD;
      30 minutes at least before measuring IRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FLIR C2 thermal camera will be calibrated before use to eliminate the effect of the ambient&#xD;
      room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher of will obtain the IRT temperature will be blinded to the esophageal probe&#xD;
      reading.&#xD;
