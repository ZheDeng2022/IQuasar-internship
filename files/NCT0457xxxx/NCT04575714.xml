  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France the prevalence of low back pain is 70 to 80 %. It's the leading cause of health&#xD;
      expenditure in Europe and costs 900 million euros per year to health insurance in France.&#xD;
      This is the second reason to consult a general practitioner. Acute low back pain is defined&#xD;
      as low back pain lasts less than 6 weeks. It represents 60 to 70 % of low back pain but only&#xD;
      20% of the costs induced by low back pain in general. In fact, acute low back pain often&#xD;
      heals spontaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for acute low back pain and risk factors for chronic low back pain have been the&#xD;
      subject of many publications. They remain very difficult to prevent in practice because of&#xD;
      their multiplicity. Preventing acute low back pain is part of the prevention of chronic low&#xD;
      back pain. Patient care management of low back pain is well codified and consensual in the&#xD;
      various international recommendations. However, their application is sometimes very disparate&#xD;
      and bad habits on both patients and professionals persist. Advices recommended in the case of&#xD;
      low back pain are widely disseminated but their applications are little studied. In 2017, in&#xD;
      France, health insurance started a &quot;back pain&quot; prevention campaign with the objective of&#xD;
      raising awareness of good attitudes in the event of back pain. It made an initial assessment&#xD;
      of the different knowledges concerning spinal pain in the general population but also in the&#xD;
      medical population with the aim of improving them. It appears that number of patients would&#xD;
      not consult physician in this case. The many proposals of care and the diversity of medical&#xD;
      professionals, paramedics and other stakeholders, proposing to cure low back pain form as&#xD;
      many different clinical pathways. Use of alternative or unconventional medicines is poorly&#xD;
      assessed. In this context, it seems relevant to evaluate patient clinical pathways and&#xD;
      patients' attitudes.&#xD;
