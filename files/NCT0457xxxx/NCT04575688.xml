  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the effectiveness and safety of two standard of care&#xD;
      perioperative procedures for controlling pain following ankle and hindfoot osteotomy or&#xD;
      fusion or ankle fracture repair.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled research study of two perioperative standards&#xD;
      of care for managing post operative pain. The first standard of care procedure is the&#xD;
      periarticular injection; the second is the popiteal block.&#xD;
