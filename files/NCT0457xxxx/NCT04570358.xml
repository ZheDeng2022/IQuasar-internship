      The primary aim of this study is to gain knowledge about both the effects of a single bout of&#xD;
      static and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching and the effects of&#xD;
      8-week static and PNF stretching training on the calf muscle-tendon properties in children&#xD;
      with spastic cerebral palsy (SCP). Furthermore, the effects on joint and muscle function,&#xD;
      stretch reflexes, gait, and self-reported gait function and functional performance are&#xD;
      examined to receive a comprehensive picture of potential changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further aims of this study are to identify which stretching technique might be more efficient&#xD;
      by comparing the effects of both stretching interventions, and to gain information about the&#xD;
      influence of foot flexibility on the stretch achieved by the spastic gastrocnemius muscle.&#xD;

      Background: Spastic cerebral palsy (SCP) is a non-progressive neuro-muscular disorder in&#xD;
      children resulting from an injury in the central nervous system. Individuals with SCP present&#xD;
      with impairments such as hyperreflexia, demonstrate impaired motor control and muscle growth.&#xD;
      Manual stretching is an important approach in the physical therapy of individuals with SCP&#xD;
      used to increase muscle extensibility and length, decrease muscle stiffness, and to improve&#xD;
      functional abilities. However, there are only a few studies that have examined its acute and&#xD;
      long-term effects in children with SCP and it is still not clear, if it may lead to the&#xD;
      expected changes, and which method might be the most-effective one. Besides static&#xD;
      stretching, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching has been used to aid&#xD;
      the rehabilitation of, for example, stroke patients by either facilitating muscle elongation&#xD;
      and/or improving muscle strength. Positive effects were found (e.g., increased dorsiflexion,&#xD;
      improved gait function, altered tendon properties), which are also clinically relevant for&#xD;
      individuals with SCP. However, there is no information about the impact of PNF in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The primary aim of this study is to gain knowledge about both the effects of a single&#xD;
      bout of static and PNF stretching and the effects of 8-week static and PNF stretching&#xD;
      training on the calf muscle-tendon properties in children with SCP. Furthermore, the effects&#xD;
      on joint and muscle function, stretch reflexes, gait, and self-reported gait function and&#xD;
      functional performance are examined to receive a comprehensive picture of potential changes.&#xD;
      Further aims of this study are to identify which stretching technique might be more efficient&#xD;
      by comparing the effects of both stretching interventions, and to gain information about the&#xD;
      influence of foot flexibility on the stretch achieved by the spastic gastrocnemius&#xD;
      muscle-tendon unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a cross-over design will be performed. Prior to&#xD;
      the measurements, a familiarization session takes place and both groups will further be&#xD;
      examined in three separate measurement sessions. Based on a power calculation and in order to&#xD;
      account for possible dropouts, 30 individuals with SCP (age range: 6 to 15 years) will be&#xD;
      recruited. The participants will be randomly allocated to either the static stretching or PNF&#xD;
      stretching intervention after the familiarization session. Passive muscle-tendon&#xD;
      morphological properties will be examined. A manually controlled instrumented spasticity&#xD;
      assessment will be performed to test for differences in the reflex responses. Information&#xD;
      about the lengthening behavior of the tissues throughout the dorsiflexion rotations will also&#xD;
      be collected by use of ultrasound. Isometric muscle strength and the active torque-angle&#xD;
      relationship will be investigated using an isokinetic dynamometer. To assess the gait pattern&#xD;
      of the children, a gait analysis will be performed by use of an 8-camera motion capture&#xD;
      system. In addition, we will examine the participants' gait function and functional&#xD;
      performance by use of the Gait Outcomes Assessment List questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>During the static stretching training for the calf muscles, the ankle joint is moved into maximal dorsiflexion until the point of discomfort is reached. The ankle joint is then held in this maximal position for 30 s followed by a rest period of 30 s. Afterwards, the procedure is repeated with the knee in flexed position to stretch the soleus muscle.</description>

    <description>During the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching, the ankle joint is moved into maximal dorsiflexion. While the foot is kept in this position, the child will perform a (sub-) maximal isometric contraction of the plantar flexors against the resistance of their parents. Afterwards, the ankle joint will be moved further into greater dorsiflexion and is held there for the remaining seconds followed by 30 s of rest. Subsequently, the stretch will be applied with the knee flexed.</description>
