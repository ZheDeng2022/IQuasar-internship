  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For this retrospective cohort study, medical records of patients treated between 2005 to 2019&#xD;
      with the UTN PROtect and/or ETN PROtect for tibia fractures or tibia revision cases will be&#xD;
      examined. In comparison to this cohort, patients who received an uncoated tibia nail are&#xD;
      examined as well. Demographics, pre-surgical health status, details on fracture type or on&#xD;
      revision, treatment decision and surgery details, postoperative reoperation and revision,&#xD;
      surgical site infections, time to union, and adverse events will be registered. In a&#xD;
      subgroup, additional information including clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction will be&#xD;
      assessed by clinical exam. Patients who still carry a nail and feel discomfort at the&#xD;
      surgical site or present with a medical condition which demands an imaging will receive an&#xD;
      x-ray of the tibia. The xray is not part of the standard study protocol.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the proportion of patients who experienced a surgical site&#xD;
      infection. Surgical site infection is defined as either deep or superficial. The presence of&#xD;
      tibia infection will be defined by the criteria of CDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients with reoperation (secondary procedures)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone union (until radiographically healed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients with complications / Adverse Events related to implant or surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only Subgroup: WOMAC-Score, AOFAS, SF36, EQ5D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Statistical considerations and estimated enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that with the use of antibiotic coating implants like the ETN/ UTN-PROtect the&#xD;
      risk of implant-associated infections and osteomyelitis is reduced in treatment of Tibia&#xD;
      fractures or in cases of revision surgery in the tibia. In a retrospective manner the&#xD;
      implanted gentamicin-coated and uncoated tibia nail procedures are evaluated. In the subgroup&#xD;
      of patients with a currently implanted gentamicin-coated nail the incidence of surgical site&#xD;
      infection and implant-associated infections will be assessed prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is exploratory in nature. Therefore, there is no formal statistical hypothesis and&#xD;
      no formal sample size calculation. Approximately 620 tibial shaft fractures are expected to&#xD;
      be included in the 12 months enrollment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed with the use of simple summary statistics. Depending on the volume and&#xD;
      quality of the collected data, different statistical analyses will be applied. Exploratory&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted to investigate relationships between the different treatment&#xD;
      options and the outcomes.&#xD;
