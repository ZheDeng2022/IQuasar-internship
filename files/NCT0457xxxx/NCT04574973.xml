  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who experienced a stroke over one year ago will be randomly assigned to receive 1&#xD;
      of 4 different conditions of brain stimulation. All individuals will receive therapy of the&#xD;
      hand and arm following the stimulation. This study will try to determine which brain&#xD;
      stimulation condition leads to the greatest improvement in hand and arm function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the effects of a painless, non-invasive form of brain stimulation,&#xD;
      called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is thought to increase the&#xD;
      brain's ability to change. Participants will be assigned to one of four groups by chance.&#xD;
      Three groups will receive tDCS at a level expected to increase the brain's ability to change,&#xD;
      and will vary by the areas of the brain that are stimulated. The fourth group will receive&#xD;
      tDCS at a level not thought to affect the brain's ability to change. All participants will&#xD;
      receive intensive therapy of their impaired arm and hand, focusing on exercises that will&#xD;
      improve their ability to function in daily life.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately post-intervention, one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This provides a quantitative measure of motor recovery, balance, sensation, coordination, and speed. An increase in score indicates an improvement in function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Action Research Arm Test from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately post-intervention, one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This consists of 4 tests to measure grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movement. An increase in score indicates an improvement in function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Stroke Impact Scale from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately post-intervention, one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-report measure of 64 items that assess 8 domains, including strength, hand function, activities of daily living, mobility, communication, emotion, memory and thinking, and participation. A score increase indicates an improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cortical motor map from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately post-intervention, one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This is performed using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation to determine which parts of the brain control a muscle in the arm.</description>
