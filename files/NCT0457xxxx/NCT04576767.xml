      This study is the first to investigate the relationship between the changes of serum calcium&#xD;
      and orphanin fq and the changes of cognitive function in patients with diabetes.To general&#xD;
      anesthesia surgery of patients with diabetes as research group (group A), and to the&#xD;
      non-general anesthesia surgery of diabetic patients as control group (group B), and then&#xD;
      measured preoperative serum calcium ion concentration in patients with general anesthesia,&#xD;
      inflammatory factor and solitary brown peptide content, intraoperative calcium ion&#xD;
      concentration in serum, inflammatory factor and solitary brown peptide content, and&#xD;
      postoperative serum calcium ion, inflammatory factor and solitary brown peptide&#xD;
      content.Postoperative cognitive function were evaluated in both groups.Finally, the two&#xD;
      groups of patients were screened and the inconsistent medical records were&#xD;
      eliminated.Observation indicators: Endothelin, C-reactive protein, nitric oxide,&#xD;
      interleukin-6, calcium ion concentration, orphanin fq concentration, glycated hemoglobin&#xD;
      value and blood glucose value were observed before, during and after operation.The cognitive&#xD;
      function of diabetic patients after surgery was observed. The cognitive function was&#xD;
      evaluated with the cognitive function assessment scale 24 hours after surgery, respectively,&#xD;
      and scores were obtained.Expected results: The comparison of clinical data between the&#xD;
      control group and the study group showed that the cognitive function of patients in the study&#xD;
      group was lower than that in the control group; the analysis showed that the serum content of&#xD;
      orphanin fq in the study group was higher than that in the control group, the content of&#xD;
      related inflammatory factors was higher than that in the control group, and the content of&#xD;
      calcium ion was lower than that in the control group, and the differences were statistically&#xD;
      significant.The results showed that when the cognitive function decreased, the content of&#xD;
      orphanin fq increased, the corresponding inflammatory factors increased and the content of&#xD;
      calcium decreased, indicating that the change of consciousness state and cognitive function&#xD;
      were correlated with the orphanin fQ system.&#xD;

      Objective: To investigate the changes of cognitive function in diabetic patients under&#xD;
      general anesthesia, and test whether the changes of serum calcium ion, inflammatory factors&#xD;
      and orphanin fQ are correlated. By prospective case study controlled study of diabetes&#xD;
      (research group) general anesthesia surgery and the non-general anesthesia surgery of&#xD;
      diabetes patients (control group), through the assessment of cognitive function and serum&#xD;
      calcium ion, inflammation factors and the change of isolated brown peptide content to watch,&#xD;
      in order to obtain reliable data to explore consciousness change changes of cognitive&#xD;
      function in patients with diabetes and cognitive function in the process of the change of&#xD;
      serum calcium ion concentration, the corresponding inflammation factors and solitary brown&#xD;
      peptide content if there is a corresponding changes.The medical records of the patients were&#xD;
      recorded. General information of the selected patients was recorded: gender, age, relevant&#xD;
      medical history;Test results: blood glucose, hemoglobin , blood pressure;Drug use of&#xD;
      patients: blood pressure drugs, hypoglycemic drugs, insulin, etc.;To observe and compare the&#xD;
      changes of cognitive function between the control group and the study group, to detect the&#xD;
      levels of calcium ion and orphanin fQ, and to conduct correlation analysis.To seek new&#xD;
      theoretical basis and take corresponding treatment measures to improve the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with diabetic cognitive dysfunction and the quality of anesthesia surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the changes of cognitive function and serum levels of calcium,&#xD;
      inflammatory factors and orphanin fQ in diabetic patients under general anesthesia and&#xD;
      non-general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: the general anesthesia surgery of patients with diabetes is set to the team (group&#xD;
      A), and to the general anesthesia surgery of diabetic patients as control group (group B),&#xD;
      and then measured preoperative serum calcium ion concentration in patients with general&#xD;
      anesthesia and solitary brown peptide content, intraoperative blood serum calcium ion&#xD;
      concentration and solitary fei peptide content, and postoperative serum calcium and solitary&#xD;
      brown peptide content. Postoperative cognitive function were evaluated in both&#xD;
      groups.Finally, the two groups of patients were screened and the inconsistent medical records&#xD;
      were eliminated.Observation indicators: Endothelin, C-reactive protein, nitric oxide,&#xD;
      interleukin-6, calcium ion concentration, orphanin fq concentration, glycated hemoglobin&#xD;
      value and blood glucose value were observed before, during and after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive function of diabetic patients after surgery was observed. The cognitive&#xD;
      function was evaluated with the cognitive function assessment scale 24 hours after surgery,&#xD;
      respectively, and scores were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical processing: Statistical Product and Service Solutions （SPSS ）21.0 statistical&#xD;
      software was used for data analysis. Measurement data consistent with normal distribution&#xD;
      were expressed as (mean±SD). Independent sample T-test was used for data comparison between&#xD;
      the two groups.Repeated measurement data were compared by repeated measurement anOVA, and P &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: Compared with the clinical data of the control group and the study group,&#xD;
      the cognitive function of patients in the study group was lower than that in the control&#xD;
      group, the serum levels of orphanin fq in the analysis group were higher than those in the&#xD;
      control group, and the levels of calcium ions in the analysis group were lower than those in&#xD;
      the control group, and the differences were statistically significant.The results showed that&#xD;
      when the cognitive function decreased, the content of orphanin fq increased, the content of&#xD;
      corresponding inflammatory factors increased, and the content of calcium decreased,&#xD;
      indicating that the change of consciousness state and cognitive function were correlated with&#xD;
      the orphanin fQ system.&#xD;
