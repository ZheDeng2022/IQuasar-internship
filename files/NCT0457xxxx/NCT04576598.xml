  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Women present a higher incidence&#xD;
      of this pathology and prevalence of its risk factors. Similarly, after stroke, women have a&#xD;
      poorer functional outcome, higher rates of institutionalization and greater dependence on&#xD;
      activities of daily living. People who have suffered a stroke are at increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, with an estimated one-third of stroke survivors suffering a new event&#xD;
      in the following 5 years. Current scientific literature recommends the promotion of physical&#xD;
      activity (PA) and exercise for the prevention of stroke and its sequelae. However, stroke&#xD;
      survivors are often insufficiently active. Therefore, changing their behavior with respect to&#xD;
      PA and sedentary lifestyle is fundamental. Moreover, gender perspective, should also taken&#xD;
      into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, our aims are to study whether there are differences in women with chronic stroke&#xD;
      sequelae compared to men in: 1) the amount of sitting time and its context, as well as the&#xD;
      time spent in different intensities of PA; 2) the reduction of sitting time and its effect on&#xD;
      health after the completion of the PA self-management program and sedentary lifestyle&#xD;
      developed in this project; 3) the presence of sarcopenia, osteoporosis and the state of&#xD;
      frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these objectives, the lifestyle habits of 128 subjects (64 women) who live in the&#xD;
      community and have chronic sequelae of stroke (≥ 6 months) will be evaluated. In addition,&#xD;
      possible differences in the study variables will be verified with control people without&#xD;
      sequelae of stroke. Moreover, in order to reduce the risks of stroke survivors, a program of&#xD;
      self-management of PA and sedentary lifestyle will be developed. This program will be carried&#xD;
      out through several sessions spread over six months that will incorporate: education, goal&#xD;
      setting, identification of barriers, self-control and feedback. The feasibility of this&#xD;
      intervention will be determined by examining compliance, duration, utility, and safety. At&#xD;
      least 64 of the previously studied subjects will participate in this program, analyzing&#xD;
      whether it favors the reduction of sitting time and its effect on health thanks to the&#xD;
      measurement of different physical capacities. The differences between men and women in&#xD;
      response to the program will be determined. Finally, we will explore whether the effect of&#xD;
      the program is greater when it is implemented in the subacute than in the chronic phase.&#xD;
