  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of eflapegrastim in&#xD;
      pediatric participants with solid tumors or lymphoma and treated with myelosuppressive&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open label, multicenter study of eflapegrastim in pediatric participants&#xD;
      (≥1 month to &lt;17 years) with solid tumors or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 40 participants will be enrolled and assigned to one of 4 age-based cohorts.&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in Cohort 1 will be followed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) prior&#xD;
      to initiating parallel enrollment into Cohorts 2 through 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive chemotherapy as Standard of Care after which a subcutaneous&#xD;
      (SC) dose of eflapegrastim will be administered up to 4 treatment cycles.&#xD;

A TEAE is any AE that occurs from the first dose of the study drug until 35 days after the last dose of study drug, or on the day a new/additional chemotherapy regimen, or on the day another granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is administered.</description>
