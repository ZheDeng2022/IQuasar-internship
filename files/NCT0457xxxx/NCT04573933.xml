  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is a relatively uncommon but serious disease. It ranks 10th for female&#xD;
      cancers, 5th for mortality, and its origin is still imperfectly known. It has a silent&#xD;
      history for a long time, is often diagnosed late, and the prognosis is poor with a high&#xD;
      relapse rate. It is therefore necessary to assess and prevent the risk of relapse, in order&#xD;
      to establish a diagnosis as early as possible, and thus set up the appropriate treatment.&#xD;
      Poly-ADP-Ribose Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors such as OLAPARIB and NIRAPARIB are effective in&#xD;
      maintenance to prevent the risk of relapse in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, as proved by recent data from the medical literature. Nevertheless, there may&#xD;
      be a difference between &quot;real life&quot; and clinical trial data. Thus, the objective of this&#xD;
      cohort is to assess whether the efficacy and safety of PARP inhibitors is the same in&#xD;
      Finistère patients as in the scientific literature.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is a relatively uncommon but serious disease. It ranks 10th for female cancers&#xD;
      and 5th for mortality (4,720 new cases in France in 2017, for 3,111 deaths), and its origin&#xD;
      is still imperfectly known. Several risk factors have been identified, the main ones being&#xD;
      genetic (importance of heredity, BRCA mutations) and environmental (taking hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy based on estrogen at menopause, exposure to tobacco, asbestos…).&#xD;
      Epithelial tumors are the most frequent (85%), with different subtypes: serous (40 to 50%);&#xD;
      endometrioid (20%); mucinous (15%); clear cell (5%); or with transitional, undifferentiated&#xD;
      and mixed cells. The classification used in clinical practice is the TNM classification which&#xD;
      establishes the stage of the disease (FIGO). Initial treatment is based on surgery and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The standard scheme combines CARBOPLATIN and PACLITAXEL for 6 cycles. For&#xD;
      advanced stages, IIIB, IIIC and IV, BEVACIZUMAB can be administered every 3 weeks in&#xD;
      combination with CARBOPLATIN and PACLITAXEL, and is then continued as monotherapy for 15&#xD;
      months The management of recurrences depends on their time of occurrence. Before 6 months, it&#xD;
      is a resistance to platinum, a monochemotherapy without platinum is then indicated,&#xD;
      associated with BEVACIZUMAB, if it was not given initially and in the absence of&#xD;
      contraindication. After 6 months, polychemotherapy with platinum must be administered,&#xD;
      possibly associated with BEVACIZUMAB, again if it was not given initially and in the absence&#xD;
      of a contraindication. This treatment is then continued after stopping chemotherapy, until&#xD;
      progression or toxicity .The arrival of PARP (Poly-ADP-Ribose-Polymerase) inhibitors, such as&#xD;
      OLAPARIB, NIRAPARIB, or even RUCAPARIB, has considerably modified the treatment regimen of&#xD;
      these relapses known as &quot;platinum-sensitive&quot; These molecules act on the DNA repair system, in&#xD;
      synergy with the loss of BRCA function by tumor cells, causing significant genetic&#xD;
      instability leading to cell death. This is the principle of synthetic lethality. These&#xD;
      treatments will also in the very near future modify the management of patients with ovarian&#xD;
      cancer as soon as they are managed. In fact, the SOLO 1 study published in 2018 showed the&#xD;
      benefit of OLAPARIB prescribed as maintenance treatment in BRCA mutated patients, in complete&#xD;
      or partial response after chemotherapy based on platinum The PRIMA and VELIA studies,&#xD;
      published in 2019, have shown the effectiveness of NIRAPARIB and VELIPARIB respectively,&#xD;
      prescribed as maintenance therapy, regardless of the patients' BRCA status.The benefit of the&#xD;
      treatment was greater in the group of patients with a defect in homologous recombination.&#xD;
      Finally, the PAOLA study published in 2019, showed the benefit of OLAPARIB versus placebo, in&#xD;
      combination with BEVACIZUMAB, as maintenance treatment in patients with ovarian cancer in&#xD;
      full or partial response after chemotherapy with PLATINUM-PACLITAXEL-BEVACIZUMAB, regardless&#xD;
      of their BRCA status PARP inhibitors are effective in maintenance to prevent the risk of&#xD;
      relapse, in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer sensitive to platinum (relapse&gt; 6 months&#xD;
      after the last course of platinum), as proved by recent data from the medical literature. On&#xD;
      the one hand, the SOLO 2 study showed an improvement in progression-free survival in patients&#xD;
      with a BRCA constitutional or somatic mutation, in relapse of platinum-sensitive ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, treated with OLAPARIB in maintenance (19.1 months versus 5.5 months) On the other&#xD;
      hand, the NOVA (2016) and ARIEL 3 (2017) studies showed an improvement in progression-free&#xD;
      survival in relapsed patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, treated with&#xD;
      maintenance by NIRAPARIB or by RUCAPARIB respectively, regardless of their mutational status&#xD;
      for BRCA (probable action on other homologous recombination pathways than BRCA, still unknown&#xD;
      to date) All these molecules are now part of our therapeutic arsenal, from the 2nd line of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context of major progress in the management of ovarian cancer, we decided to set up a&#xD;
      Finistère study, aiming to analyze the characteristics and survival data of patients treated&#xD;
      with PARP inhibitor for a recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, as well as their&#xD;
      tolerance to these treatments. This is a retrospective study, using data from Finistère in&#xD;
      comparison with data from the literature. Nevertheless, there may be a difference between&#xD;
      &quot;real life&quot; and clinical trial data. Thus, the objective of this cohort is to assess whether&#xD;
      the efficacy (survival) and safety (side effects) of PARP inhibitors is the same in Finistère&#xD;
      patients as in the scientific literature.&#xD;
