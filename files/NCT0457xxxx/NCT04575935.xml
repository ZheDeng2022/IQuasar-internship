    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares minimally invasive surgery (MIS) to laparotomy in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage IIIC-IV ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who are&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy before and after surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy). MIS is a surgical&#xD;
      procedure that uses small incision(s) and is intended to produce minimal blood loss and pain&#xD;
      for the patient. Laparotomy is a surgical procedure which allows the doctors to remove some&#xD;
      or all of the tumor and check if the disease has spread to other organs in the body. MIS may&#xD;
      work the same or better than standard laparotomy after chemotherapy in prolonging the return&#xD;
      of the disease and/or improving quality of life after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine whether MIS is non-inferior to laparotomy in terms of disease free survival&#xD;
      (DFS) in women with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) that received 3 to 4&#xD;
      cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if there are differences in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in&#xD;
      patients undergoing MIS versus (vs) laparotomy as assessed with the European Organisation for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30),&#xD;
      QLQ-Ovarian Cancer Module (OV28), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General&#xD;
      (FACT-G7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if there are differences between patients undergoing MIS vs laparotomy in&#xD;
      the rate of optimal cytoreduction (defined as residual tumor nodules each measuring 1 cm or&#xD;
      less in maximum diameter) and complete cytoreduction (defined as no evidence of macroscopic&#xD;
      disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine whether MIS is non-inferior to laparotomy in terms of overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      in women with advanced stage EOC that received 3 to 4 cycles of NACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if there are differences between patients undergoing MIS vs laparotomy in&#xD;
      surgical morbidity and mortality, intraoperative injuries, and post-operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the rates of MIS converted to laparotomy and the reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine if there are any difference in costs and cost-effectiveness between patients&#xD;
      undergoing MIS vs laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients undergo MIS within 6 weeks after last cycle of standard of care neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. If during MIS the surgeon thinks complete gross resection can only be&#xD;
      accomplished by performing an open procedure, patients may undergo laparotomy instead. Within&#xD;
      6 weeks after surgery, patients receive standard of care chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients undergo laparotomy within 6 weeks after last cycle of standard of care&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Within 6 weeks after surgery, patients receive standard of care&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 6 weeks of completing post-surgery&#xD;
      chemotherapy, then every 3 months for the first 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

When appropriate, multivariate Cox analyses will be performed, in which a univariate selection procedure will serve to identify eligible explanatory variables with univariate Cox (using Wald test) p-value lower than 0.10 as potential prognostic value.
