  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a phase II, multi-center, single-masked (assessors) dose-ranging study designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the comparative safety and preliminary efficacy of two dosage regimens of the&#xD;
      IBE-814 IVT Dexamethasone Implant in patients with DMO and RVO.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll up to 50 patients (up to 50 eyes) with DMO or RVO across two treatment&#xD;
      groups (Low Dose and High Dose). Patients will be identified and recruited through the clinic&#xD;
      population of ophthalmology centers in Australia and New Zealand, specializing in the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases. All patients will be followed for a planned&#xD;
      evaluation period of 18 months.&#xD;
