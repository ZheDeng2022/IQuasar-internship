  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the growing number of cancer survivors, challenges to deal with comorbidities and&#xD;
      impacted quality of life of cancer survivors by the disease and treatments also surge.&#xD;
      Symptoms and Adverse Events are common and insufficiently monitored in real time / real life,&#xD;
      which leads to increased symptom burden, treatment delays and unplanned hospital admissions.&#xD;
      Remote monitoring apps have been shown to improve quality of life, symptom control and&#xD;
      survival in published clinical trials, but no data with such interventions exists on the&#xD;
      Portuguese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a pilot study to explore the feasibility of a mobile app for remote symptom&#xD;
      monitoring in cancer patients. Patients will be recruited in Portuguese hospitals and will be&#xD;
      invited to test the app for one month. Patient experience and satisfaction will be assessed&#xD;
      via a weekly survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this pilot study will inform subsequent randomized clinical trials to test&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of remote monitoring and lifestyle interventions to improve symptoms&#xD;
      control and quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single cohort study on cancer patients to explore the feasibility of mobile app for&#xD;
      symptom monitoring and inform future randomized clinical trials and implementation. Patients&#xD;
      will be screened at oncology visits for inclusion criteria and will be invited to use a&#xD;
      mobile app to monitor and track treatment side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit a minimum of 10 cancer patients under systemic anti-neoplasic treatment being&#xD;
      followed in medical oncology departments in portuguese hospitals. between February 1st and&#xD;
      March 30th.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to register their treatment side effects and symptoms on a&#xD;
      health app designed for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mentora Health App include a PRO-CTCAEâ„¢ based tool (a patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      measurement system developed by the National Cancer Institute), version 1.1, that includes 80&#xD;
      symptoms (attachment 1) and has been translated and validated to Portuguese (Portugal) by the&#xD;
      authoring entity. These symptoms are graded on a five-point scale from 0 (not present) to 4&#xD;
      (disabling) based on clinical criteria.&#xD;
