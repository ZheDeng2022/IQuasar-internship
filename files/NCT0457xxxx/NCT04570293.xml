  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is characterized by sudden, severe, usually unilateral, transient,&#xD;
      stinging, recurrent electrocute-like shock in one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve,&#xD;
      lasting from a few seconds to less than 2 minutes.Simple daily-life activities, such as&#xD;
      washing the face, brushing the teeth, eating, and talking, or the slight touch of trigger&#xD;
      points may trigger the attack of pain of TN, resulting in a decline in the patient's quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL). Trigger zones predominantly locate in the perioral and nasal region.&#xD;
      Paroxysmal pain is associated with triggers in virtually all patients with TN. TN may be&#xD;
      caused by abnormality of the trigger zone and the blockade of Na+ channel of trigger zone may&#xD;
      be a novel and effective treatment methods for TN. Currently, most patients with TN may not&#xD;
      achieve adequate pain relief with a single therapeutic agent. Multiple analgesics targeting&#xD;
      different mechanisms of the pain pathway are often used.5% lidocaine medicated plaster (LMP)&#xD;
      is a white hydrogel plaster containing adhesive material. LMP was approved for post-herpetic&#xD;
      neuralgia (PHN) treatment by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999.&#xD;
      Tamburin et al reported that 2 patients with primary TN who stopped oral drugs because of&#xD;
      side effects or refused surgical procedures. Both patients were instructed to wear LMP over&#xD;
      the affected area and LMP resulted in reduction of pain intensity and the number of pain&#xD;
      paroxysms without side effects. However, due to limitations of these open-label design&#xD;
      studies, the observed reductions in pain intensity may have been due to treatment effect,&#xD;
      placebo effect, changes in underlying disease state, or a combination of these factors.&#xD;
      Therefore, randomized controlled trials will be need to be performed to draw about the&#xD;
      efficacy of the LMP in TN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PATCH trial is a prospective, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group,&#xD;
      multicenter, enriched enrolment with randomized withdrawal (EERW) trial aimed at estimating&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of LMP in patients with TN. After providing informed consent and&#xD;
      completing a baseline evaluation, patients will participate in an initial open-label&#xD;
      treatment period of LMP (active patches). This openly titrated process is close to clinical&#xD;
      practice and can provide data on the proportion of responders and non-responders, the optimal&#xD;
      dose of the analgesic drug, and the proportion of withdrawal due to adverse effects. A&#xD;
      responder at the end of the open-label treatment phase will be included in the subsequently&#xD;
      double-blind treatment phase.&#xD;
