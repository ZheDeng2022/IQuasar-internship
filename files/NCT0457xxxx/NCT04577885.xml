    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of Rifampin on pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of healthy Chinese adult subjects after oral administration of SHR2554 tablets. The secondary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of single-dose oral administration of&#xD;
      SHR2554 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
