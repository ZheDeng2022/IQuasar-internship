      This study aimed to assess the efficacy of aquatic therapy on pulmonary functions in patients&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of muscle diseases that results in increasing weakening&#xD;
      and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time. The disorders differ in which muscles are&#xD;
      primarily affected, the degree of weakness, how fast they worsen, and when symptoms begin.&#xD;
      Many people will eventually become unable to walk. Some types are also associated with&#xD;
      problems in other organs. The muscular dystrophy group contains thirty different genetic&#xD;
      disorders that are usually classified into nine main categories or types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The signs and symptoms consistent with muscular dystrophy are: progressive muscular wasting,&#xD;
      poor balance, scoliosis (curvature of the spine and the back), progressive inability to walk,&#xD;
      waddling gait, Calf deformation, Limited range of movement,respiratory difficulty,&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and muscle spasms&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Thirty patients with muscular dystrophy were enrolled in this study and were assessed for eligibility. Their age ranged from four and forty years. They were assigned randomly into two equal groups. Group (A) study group received the traditional physical therapy program plus aquatic therapy. And the group (B) control group received traditional physical therapy program only. All patients will receive sessions two times/week for three successive months. Pulmonary function test was used to assess pulmonary functions pre and post-intervention. All patients were assisted before and after three months of intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Forced Expiratory Volume/Forced Vital Capacity Ratio (FEV1/FVC ratio) will be assessed at day 0.</time_frame>
    <description>is a calculated ratio used in the diagnosis of obstructive and restrictive lung disease.[2][3] It represents the proportion of a person's vital capacity that they are able to expire in the first second of forced expiration (FEV1) to the full, forced vital capacity (FVC).[4] The result of this ratio is expressed as FEV1%. Normal values are approximately 75%.[5] Predicted normal values can be calculated online and depend on age, sex, height, and ethnicity as well as the research study that they are based upon. A derived value of FEV1% is FEV1% predicted, which is defined as FEV1% of the patient divided by the average FEV1% in the population for any person of similar age, sex, and body composition.</description>

    <description>Aquatic therapy refers to water-based treatments or exercises of therapeutic intent, in particular for relaxation, fitness, and physical rehabilitation. Treatments and exercises are performed while floating, partially submerged, or fully submerged in water. Many aquatic therapy procedures require constant attendance by a trained therapist and are performed in a specialized temperature-controlled pool. Rehabilitation commonly focuses on improving the physical function associated with illness, injury, or disability</description>
