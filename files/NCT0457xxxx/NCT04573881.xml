    <textblock>
      This trial is a single arm, non-randomized prospective trial. The objective of this trial is&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the HistoSonics System for the treatment of primary or&#xD;
      metastatic tumors located in the liver.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a single arm, non-randomized prospective trial. Following histotripsy treatment&#xD;
      of liver tumor(s), subjects will undergo imaging ≤36 hours post-index procedure to determine&#xD;
      technical success. Subjects will then be followed for 30 days. Data through the 30-day time&#xD;
      point will be used for a Regulatory Submission to the Notified Body. Additionally, subjects&#xD;
      will be followed for one (1) year post-index procedure, with evaluations at the 6-month and&#xD;
      1-year time points to estimate the efficacy and safety profile of the HistoSonics System as&#xD;
      part of post-market clinical follow-up.&#xD;
