  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open (non-blinded), single-arm, clinical trial to assess the efficacy of daily use&#xD;
      of a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) device in patients with moderate to severe COPD, in&#xD;
      addition to standard care, in reducing the amount of COPD exacerbations over a one-year&#xD;
      period. Once enrolled in the study, all subjects will be asked to undergo a baseline walking&#xD;
      test to measure pulmonary function (6MWT), verify their personal and medical history&#xD;
      (demographics), as well as fill in some questionnaires regarding their COPD and its symptoms&#xD;
      (SGRQ-C, CAT). All subjects will then receive their own AIRVO2 device, as well as training&#xD;
      and instructions on how to use the device at home. Subjects will use the MyAIRVO2 device&#xD;
      daily for the following 12 months. Follow-up visits will occur five times over the 12-month&#xD;
      study period and will be similar to the baseline visit. Additional data will be collected by&#xD;
      the study team for each subject from their electronic medical record during the 12-month&#xD;
      study enrollment period. Only information regarding COPD-related medical and/or pharmacy&#xD;
      costs, specifically to measure the amount of COPD exacerbations experienced by each subject,&#xD;
      will be reviewed and recorded.&#xD;
