    <textblock>
      Many women experience severe anal sphincter lacerations during childbirth, which put them at&#xD;
      risk for infection, improper healing, and accidental bowel leakage. This study aims to&#xD;
      determine if oral antibiotics following vaginal delivery in women with severe tears can&#xD;
      prevent wound infection and breakdown, and ultimately, accidental bowel leakage. Women who&#xD;
      suffer a severe vaginal laceration will be randomized to receive 5-days of oral antibiotics&#xD;
      or placebo pills after getting a standard one-time dose of IV antibiotics at the time of&#xD;
      repair. All women will have immediate, intensive follow-up with an Urogynecologist at our&#xD;
      well-established PEAPOD peripartum clinic at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 months postpartum to&#xD;
      monitor wound healing and infection. At these visits, we also will assess women's perception&#xD;
      of their well-being, perineal pain, and bowel symptoms. All participants will be invited to&#xD;
      remain in the study for long-term follow-up. Our goal is to establish whether a five-day&#xD;
      course of oral antibiotics should be a standard part of clinical care for severe postpartum&#xD;
      lacerations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 3,000,000 women have vaginal deliveries each year in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five percent, (i.e., 150,000) of these women will experience an obstetrical anal sphincter&#xD;
      injury (OASIS). OASIS is associated with chronic pain and sexual dysfunction. Moreover, 25%&#xD;
      of women with OASIS will suffer from chronic accidental bowel leakage. In other words, one&#xD;
      new woman every 14 minutes experiences an injury that leads to uncontrollable leakage of&#xD;
      stool and gas. This woman is not only a new mother, but she may also be a teacher, a&#xD;
      construction worker, a nurse, a doctor, or an executive who will have to deal with this&#xD;
      devastating and embarrassing condition for the rest of her life. At age 45, women suffer from&#xD;
      accidental bowel leakage at a rate that is eight times higher than that of men of the same&#xD;
      age (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that accidental bowel leakage is related not only to the structural disruptions&#xD;
      that occur with OASIS, but also from complications, such as infection and poor wound healing.&#xD;
      Women who suffer OASIS are at high risk for infection and poor healing; this is not&#xD;
      surprising given that these lacerations are repaired and then continue to heal in a&#xD;
      contaminated field (near stool). Poor healing and infection in the setting of OASIS make&#xD;
      accidental bowel leakage, chronic pain, and sexual dysfunction even more likely (2-6).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, even those infections that are recognized early and treated can still cause&#xD;
      accidental bowel leakage decades after childbirth (7-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the many women affected by OASIS and its debilitating ramifications through the arc&#xD;
      of a woman's life, there is a lack of evidence-based best practice to guide treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up when it does occur. Even though infection and poor healing compromise outcomes,&#xD;
      there are limited data regarding best practice to prevent of these complications. The use of&#xD;
      antibiotics at the time of OASIS repair has become common based on our division's previous&#xD;
      studies (15-18). However, no studies have been done to determine whether oral antibiotics&#xD;
      immediately postpartum can further decrease the incidence of short and long-term&#xD;
      complications. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends the use of&#xD;
      antibiotics after OASIS repair (10), however, the basis of this recommendation is founded&#xD;
      only on expert opinion. On the other hand, the American College of Obstetricians and&#xD;
      Gynecologists provides no recommendation with regard to whether antibiotics should be used in&#xD;
      the postpartum time. At our institution, almost all women who sustain OASIS during vaginal&#xD;
      delivery receive a single dose of IV antibiotics based on our previously published work at&#xD;
      Prentice, however, that while many physicians chose to administer oral antibiotics based on&#xD;
      expert opinions, it is unknown whether these provide any specific benefit - again as many&#xD;
      physicians chose to administer antibiotics regardless of the evidence to date. Standard care&#xD;
      postpartum both nationally and internationally is highly varied and likely based on physician&#xD;
      training and preference (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a great need for a trial to determine whether the use of supplemental&#xD;
      antibiotics for 5 days postpartum will decrease rates of perineal wound infection and&#xD;
      breakdown and improve maternal health outcomes. Such a trial will guide best practice,&#xD;
      enhance the care of women, and potentially reduce the debilitating consequences of OASIS.&#xD;
