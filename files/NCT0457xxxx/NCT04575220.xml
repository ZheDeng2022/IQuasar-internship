      The goal of this pilot study is to determine if a home based bicycle exercise program can&#xD;
      significantly improve the exercise tolerance and well being of pulmonary outpatients. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a computer based monitoring system to allow us to speak with&#xD;
      participants, view participants, and track patient bicycle activity (speed, duration of&#xD;
      exercise, rate of work) during exercise sessions. The investigators plan to have participants&#xD;
      perform three telemonitored exercise sessions per week for 12 weeks as part of this program.&#xD;
      The investigators will assess exercise performance on the bicycle, called a work rate test,&#xD;
      at the beginning of the program and then again at 6 weeks and 12 weeks into the program to&#xD;
      determine if the program can produce a clinically significant improvement in work rate test&#xD;
      performance (i.e. a greater than 1.15 minute increase in exercise duration at an 80% work&#xD;
      rate). The investigators will also assess participant CRQ, SPPB scores and SF36 scores&#xD;
      (indices of patient well being) at baseline, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks, to determine if the&#xD;
      exercise program elicits an increase in these indices.&#xD;

      Studies have shown that pulmonary rehabilitation, which includes exercise and patient&#xD;
      education, is a valuable therapy for patients with pulmonary diseases. In fact, pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation delivered soon after patient discharge is known to produce a major improvement&#xD;
      in patient outcomes. Specifically, studies have shown this intervention reduces readmission&#xD;
      rates by 30-70% over the next year. In addition, this therapy improves exercise tolerance,&#xD;
      performance of tasks of daily living and sense of patient well being. One study even shows&#xD;
      this therapy is 30 times as effective as bronchodilator therapy in improving patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surprisingly, however, very few pulmonary patients receive pulmonary rehabilitation. Recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that 94-98% of discharged pulmonary patients fail to receive this therapy.&#xD;
      This pattern has been shown to exist across the United States, with no state demonstrating a&#xD;
      much larger use of this therapy. Moreover, use of this therapy is even worse for minorities&#xD;
      (only 1% receive pulmonary rehabilitation) and rural populations, such as patients in&#xD;
      southern and eastern Kentucky. Several factors are responsible for this failure to employ&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation including: (a) very few centers are available and patients cannot&#xD;
      realistically travel to the existing centers because of distance, (b) this form of&#xD;
      rehabilitation is expensive and patients must pay a large copay (30-50 dollars per session,&#xD;
      adding up to a total of 1800 dollars for a typical 12 week program) which many patients&#xD;
      cannot afford, (c) centers are only open for restricted hours and working patients cannot&#xD;
      miss work to go for rehabilitation, and (d) patients are only eligible for 36 treatment&#xD;
      sessions for life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present project is to define a new home based exercise program that should&#xD;
      provide exercise training as good or better than conventional brick and mortar rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs. The investigators will use technological advances in home based exercise equipment&#xD;
      to both precisely measure participant exercise and to assess physiological improvements over&#xD;
      time. This technology will also reduce the expense required to supervise participant&#xD;
      training, dramatically reducing costs compared to conventional center based programs. In&#xD;
      addition, because programs are home based, the investigators can provide access to&#xD;
      participants in rural locations, reduce travel, and easily extend the convenience and&#xD;
      schedule of training sessions to accommodate participant lifestyles. While recently there&#xD;
      have been a few attempts to provide home based pulmonary rehabilitation programs (e.g. by VA&#xD;
      rural health, the Southern Alabama consortium) these other programs do not provide the&#xD;
      intensity of training possible with the new paradigm in the current project, are not proven&#xD;
      to have the same beneficial effects as conventional center based rehabilitation, and have&#xD;
      higher personnel costs making long term financial viability uncertain.&#xD;
