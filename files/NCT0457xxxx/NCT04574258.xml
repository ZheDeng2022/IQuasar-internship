      Sonazoid as a new generation of ultrasound contrast agent. This study based on the features&#xD;
      of Sonazoid specific angiography and high mechanical index, the role of Sonazoid in the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of thyroid benign and malignant tumors was explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sonazoid as a new generation of ultrasound contrast agent, was liver specificity (Kupffer&#xD;
      cells), macrophages at the very stable period, Kupffer imaging contrast enhancement effect&#xD;
      for more than 1 hour, it is mainly used for focal liver lesions of blood vessels and Kupffer&#xD;
      phase of ultrasonic imaging, facilitate early detection of small lesions (&lt; 1 cm). Until now,&#xD;
      Sonazoid has been mainly focused on liver focal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CEUS is an effective imaging method to differentiate thyroid nodules, which can achieve&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of 84~92.5% based on features of low enhancement, uneven enhancement and&#xD;
      circular enhancement. However, studies have shown overlapping findings between CEUS&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative criteria for the evaluation of benign and malignant nodules,&#xD;
      limitations in the interpretation of tumor microvascular distribution, and no single&#xD;
      indicator has sufficient sensitivity or specificity. Therefore, in the evaluation of thyroid&#xD;
      nodules, the existing CEUS interpretation of the results is still limited, the need for a new&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing contrast agents, Sonazoid stability is better, can tolerate relatively high&#xD;
      mechanical index and penetration; The size of the microspheres was uniform, with 99.9% less&#xD;
      than 7 m, most of which were between 2 and 4 m, and the median diameter of the microspheres&#xD;
      was 2.6 m. The imaging was more uniform and clear, and the outstanding advantage was that&#xD;
      high-frequency (7-20m) imaging could be realized, which was conducive to the exploration of&#xD;
      small superficial lesions in patients. However, studies on Sonazoid in superficial organs&#xD;
      such as thyroid were extremely rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Sonazoid microspheres is mononuclear phagocytes specificity contrast agents,&#xD;
      main mononuclear phagocyte system including monocytes, connective tissue, lymph nodes and&#xD;
      spleen macrophages, kupffer cells of the liver, dust cells of the lung, lymphoid tissue in&#xD;
      the crisscross DCS etc. Most researches, both at home and abroad, have confirmed that the&#xD;
      expression of Macrophages has long been Associated with the malignancy and lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis, but negatively correlated with the prognosis. In thyroid carcinoma,&#xD;
      tumor-associated Macrophages was significantly higher than that of benign Tumor and&#xD;
      follicular adenoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, based on the features of Sonazoid specific angiography and high mechanical index,&#xD;
      the role of Sonazoid in the differential diagnosis of thyroid benign and malignant tumors,&#xD;
      the degree of tumor differentiation and the risk assessment of lymph node metastasis was&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
