  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Evidence supports exercise and nutrition as beneficial for enhancing QOL in&#xD;
      earlier stages of lung cancer; however, there is minimal research of either intervention -&#xD;
      and none with combined interventions - in advanced lung cancer patients. In addition to a&#xD;
      multimodal intervention approach that includes nutrition and exercise, consideration of&#xD;
      advanced cancer care symptom management is crucial for optimizing the potential benefits of&#xD;
      either intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Primary outcome measure of this study is feasibility, including recruitment (%&#xD;
      who participate from those eligible), attendance (weekly group class), assessment completion,&#xD;
      safety (adverse event reporting), attrition rates, and qualitative themes generated from&#xD;
      one-on-one participant interviews. The secondary outcome to be measured is the impact of the&#xD;
      intervention on PROs, including QOL, fatigue and symptom burden, as well as self-reported&#xD;
      physical activity levels and physical function assessed in-person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The proposed exercise intervention will include a centre-based group exercise&#xD;
      program plus home-based exercises, and behaviour change support for advanced non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, classified as stage III or IV with self-reported symptom&#xD;
      burden. Eligible participants must be cleared by the health care professionals (HCP) to&#xD;
      engage in mild to moderate levels of physical activity (PA). Using a prospective,&#xD;
      mixed-methods design (supported by the Medical Research Council guidance for the evaluation&#xD;
      of complex interventions), the quantitative component of this pilot study will measure&#xD;
      feasibility and exploratory outcome measures, with an embedded qualitative component to&#xD;
      examine participant perspectives about study tolerability/feasibility of the intervention. A&#xD;
      subset of participants and instructors will be recruited for qualitative interviews using&#xD;
      purposive sampling to achieve maximum variation based on factors that may lead to different&#xD;
      viewpoints (e.g., age, gender, lung cancer type/stage, treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: The proposed work will inform the design of a future pragmatic trial for this&#xD;
      population. The goal is to build a patient-focused model of care that delivers wellness&#xD;
      resources for advanced lung cancer care that will ultimately improve the patients' health and&#xD;
      QOL. This approach is novel, patient-focused, and will build a tailored approach within&#xD;
      existing resources to deliver optimal care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canada, and is the leading cause of&#xD;
      death from cancer.1 Despite this, long-term survival rates for lung cancer are improving,&#xD;
      owing largely to recent advances in treatment. The progression of symptoms of advanced lung&#xD;
      cancer often exacerbate the emotional and psychological distress experienced by patients and&#xD;
      families, which contributes to sedentary behaviour as well as diminished QOL.2 In addition,&#xD;
      the toxicities of traditional chemotherapies, such as the reduction of lean muscle mass3,4,5,&#xD;
      are not adequately addressed in current research or used in clinical practice. The proposed&#xD;
      work will thus assess the feasibility and patient impact of an integrated multimodal&#xD;
      intervention for advanced (stage III and IV) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), inclusive of&#xD;
      tailored exercise programming, nutrition counselling, and behaviour change support, in&#xD;
      addition to palliative symptom management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence shows that physical function and physical independence are among the most important&#xD;
      determinants of QOL for cancer patients with palliative care needs.6 There is strong&#xD;
      empirical evidence to demonstrate the positive impact of each individual modality included in&#xD;
      the proposed intervention - symptom management, nutrition, and exercise - on QOL in advanced&#xD;
      cancer populations, including patients with metastatic NSCLC.7,8 Nutritional status has been&#xD;
      shown to be predictive of QOL in patients with cancer, including in those diagnosed with&#xD;
      inoperable NSCLC.9 Exercise is also supported as beneficial for overall QOL in advanced&#xD;
      cancer populations, with particularly strong effects on physical and mental well-being.10&#xD;
      Exercise promotes the retention and utilization of nutrients and anabolism, while palliative&#xD;
      symptom measures can help improve oral intake by ameliorating symptoms such as nausea,&#xD;
      mucositis, thrush or constipation.11 Palliative symptom measures may also help reduce&#xD;
      obstacles to exercise, such as pain or dyspnea, that are commonly experienced by patients&#xD;
      with advanced lung cancer. Despite the promising evidence, few studies have examined the&#xD;
      effect of combining a nutrition and exercise intervention within palliative care, yet&#xD;
      preliminary data suggests synergistic effects. Results from a recent randomized control trial&#xD;
      suggest that an intervention combining nutrition and exercise components may be feasible in&#xD;
      advanced cancer care (including stage IV NSCLC care), with an attrition rate of only 86%&#xD;
      during the 3-month trial period. 12 While this is promising, there is still limited data on&#xD;
      the feasibility of these interventions, and there have been no RCTs to date that have&#xD;
      combined palliative care with nutrition and exercise interventions (Hall CC, Cook J, Maddocks&#xD;
      M et al. Combined exercise and nutritional rehabilitation in outpatients with incurable&#xD;
      cancer: a systematic review. Support Care Cancer 2019; 27:2371-2384) .13,14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the growing number of NSCLC patients entering long-term survivorship, this work is&#xD;
      critical for ensuring that the healthcare system is addressing their unique supportive and&#xD;
      palliative care needs. Our project is relevant to the present funding opportunity because of&#xD;
      its focus on patient reported outcomes (PROs). We will utilize PROs that are used in AHS&#xD;
      (&quot;Putting Patients First&quot;) and in the cancer population (FACT-G, FACT-lung, and FACIT-F), and&#xD;
      will collect patient feedback (qualitative interviews) on the intervention recruitment and&#xD;
      delivery. This work will also help connect existing palliative resources at the Tom Baker&#xD;
      Cancer Centre (Complex Cancer Care team, physiatry, and nutrition), along with ongoing work&#xD;
      on the University of Calgary's Alberta Cancer Exercise (ACE) program.15 The preliminary&#xD;
      outcome and feasibility data will inform the sample size and characteristics for a future&#xD;
      PCT. By showing proof of concept in advanced lung cancer, a disease with high patient burden,&#xD;
      we hope results from this work will facilitate further adaptation of the proposed multimodal&#xD;
      intervention to support the palliative care needs of other tumour groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will examine a multimodal intervention, including exercise and nutrition in&#xD;
      conjunction with palliative symptom management, on the QOL of advanced NSCLC patients. The&#xD;
      impact of symptom burden on the QOL in NSCLC patients is significant and under-recognized.&#xD;
      Due to improvements in therapies, there is an opportunity to address QOL in this population,&#xD;
      whose members are now, on average, living longer and potentially more able to engage in&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions. This work will address a gap in research and clinical practice&#xD;
      by providing initial data that to examine delivery of supportive and palliative cancer care&#xD;
      to the advanced NSCLC population and provide a starting point for tailoring interventions in&#xD;
      other tumour groups. Given the novel nature of this research, both in terms of the multimodal&#xD;
      intervention as well as the focus on an underserved population, the primary objective is to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of the intervention. Secondary objectives are to obtain preliminary&#xD;
      data on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of QOL (FACT-G and FACT-lung), and patient&#xD;
      functioning measures (symptom measurement, Putting Patients First assessment tool, exercise&#xD;
      levels, and fitness outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will involve a prospective, mixed-methods design. The quantitative component&#xD;
      includes measures of study feasibility and exploratory outcome measures, as described below.&#xD;
      The embedded qualitative component will use semi-structured one-on-one interviews to explore&#xD;
      participant perspectives about intervention tolerability/feasibility, with a focus on&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to participation, perspectives on recruitment, the type and&#xD;
      combination of intervention modalities (exercise type, role of instructor, and content within&#xD;
      the palliative symptom and nutrition intervention), delivery locations, duration of the&#xD;
      intervention and satisfaction with the outcome measures used. The rationale for this study&#xD;
      design follows the Medical Research Council guidelines for the evaluation of complex&#xD;
      interventions16,17 which supports the use of qualitative methods nested within a larger trial&#xD;
      to understand the &quot;active ingredients&quot; and contextual factors that result in certain outcomes&#xD;
      in a complex intervention study. This has been used as a framework for previously published&#xD;
      complex intervention trials in palliative care.18, 19 Research Team: Co-Principal&#xD;
      Investigators (Culos-Reed and Abdul-Razzak) will share responsibility for the research&#xD;
      project. Dr. Culos-Reed will coordinate the overall project, as well as oversee the exercise&#xD;
      component of the intervention. She has 20 years of experience working in cancer and exercise&#xD;
      research and brings a strong background in knowledge translation to the proposed work. Dr.&#xD;
      Culos-Reed will also provide in-kind support through use of her research facility (Health and&#xD;
      Wellness Lab) at the University of Calgary, as well as support from current graduate students&#xD;
      and staff (CEP, CPTs and research coordinators) affiliated with her lab. Dr. Abdul-Razzak&#xD;
      will oversee the clinical implementation of the project at the TBCC, including support of&#xD;
      participant recruitment and delivery of the care by the intervention teams. She has extensive&#xD;
      training in qualitative methodology and in clinical trials research in the palliative&#xD;
      population. Several co-applicants and collaborators have been instrumental in the&#xD;
      conceptualization of this project, and bring extensive clinical expertise in oncology (Bebb),&#xD;
      cancer physiatry and rehabilitation (Francis, Capozzi) and nutrition therapy for patients&#xD;
      with advanced cancer (Dexter, Gillis, Walker, Black). This multidisciplinary team will&#xD;
      continue to be involved in the pilot study design and delivery, as well as subsequent work on&#xD;
      the PCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants: Advanced NSCLCA patients, classified as stage III or IV, with&#xD;
      self-reported symptom burden, and cleared by the health care professionals (HCP) to engage in&#xD;
      mild to moderate levels of physical activity (PA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit n=10-15, and based on current patient numbers, this is a conservative&#xD;
      expectation for the 6 month recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of participants will be invited to participate in one-on-one qualitative interviews&#xD;
      with the aim of understanding their perspectives on engaging in the study, including barriers&#xD;
      and facilitators to participation and the impact of the interventions of quality of life and&#xD;
      symptom control. A thematic analysis approach will be utilized, and although an exact a&#xD;
      priori sample size cannot be calculated, we estimate that 5-10 interviews may be required in&#xD;
      order to achieve an adequate understanding of patient perspectives (i.e., data saturation).&#xD;
      We will use a maximum variation sampling strategy based on age, gender, functional status and&#xD;
      cancer treatments. All participants will be offered interviews, if they consented to be&#xD;
      contacted, and sampling will occur until adequate understanding at each timepoint is achieved&#xD;
      via the patient perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exercise: The proposed exercise intervention (under the direction of Drs. Capozzi,&#xD;
           Culos-Reed and Francis) will include a centre-based group exercise program plus&#xD;
           home-based exercises, along with behaviour change support. The interventionist will be a&#xD;
           CEP who will receive prior training on the health behaviour change support, similar to&#xD;
           that currently used within the ACE program.15 The 12-week group-based exercise program,&#xD;
           consisting of 1 weekly 75 minute session, of which 45 minutes are exercise and 15&#xD;
           minutes of yoga, and the other 15 minutes includes education and facilitating the group&#xD;
           social support, will be delivered in dedicated fitness facilities located at the Holy&#xD;
           Cross Hospital in Calgary and at the University of Calgary. Forty-five minute exercise&#xD;
           circuits will include 6 exercise stations, with modifications made according to the&#xD;
           baseline physical function of each participant. The exercise circuit will be followed by&#xD;
           a 15-minute therapeutic yoga class, based on Dr. Culos-Reed's Yoga Thrive program.20-22&#xD;
           Overall, the 60 minute session will include a light warm up (5-10 minutes), and 6&#xD;
           exercise stations with a range of functional exercises designed to target both aerobic&#xD;
           and strength components of fitness (35-40 minutes), with modifications made according to&#xD;
           physical function at the start of the program. The main focus of the circuit will be on&#xD;
           muscle strength, balance, flexibility and aerobic capacity as associated with beneficial&#xD;
           daily physical function (i.e., for activities of daily living). Most group sessions will&#xD;
           involve a series of circuit-style classes, that allow for adequate group supervision as&#xD;
           well as the ability for individuals to work at their own pace. In addition to the weekly&#xD;
           group-based class, a home-based exercise prescription for an additional 1-2 sessions per&#xD;
           week, facilitated by provision of basic home-based fitness equipment and the Yoga Thrive&#xD;
           class videos, will be provided. A FitBit will also be provided for the duration of the&#xD;
           study to support physical activity behavior change and enhance safety, and returned upon&#xD;
           completion of the exercise program. To reduce burden, participants will not be required&#xD;
           to report objective physical activity from the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Palliative Symptom Management: Palliative symptom management (under the direction of&#xD;
           Drs. Abdul-Razzak and Bebb, and Dr. Lyle Galloway) will focus on symptoms that&#xD;
           contribute to reduced QOL (e.g. pain, fatigue, nausea), limit one's ability to engage in&#xD;
           exercise, or present barriers to oral intake (e.g., pain management, nausea, mucositis,&#xD;
           thrush). These will be delivered by the Complex Cancer Care Management team at the TBCC,&#xD;
           which includes a team of physicians, a nurse practitioner, advanced practice pharmacists&#xD;
           and a nurse coordinator. Clinicians will deliver pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic&#xD;
           therapies based on their clinical judgement. Participant assessments will occur in&#xD;
           conjunction with scheduled lung cancer clinic visits, cancer therapy treatment visits,&#xD;
           or as separate dedicated research visits when necessary. The initial assessment will&#xD;
           occur within two weeks of the exercise program initiation. After the initial assessment,&#xD;
           follow-up consultations can occur at the discretion of the palliative care clinicians&#xD;
           and participants and may occur either in person or by phone. Clinical case report forms&#xD;
           will be used to track the type of treatments provided during these visits for&#xD;
           descriptive purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nutrition: The nutrition component of the intervention is designed to meet individual&#xD;
           nutrient needs and lifestyle of participants, as well as work synergistically with the&#xD;
           previously described exercise component. The study coordinator will ask participants to&#xD;
           complete a self-administered online 24-hr dietary food recall. Participants will be&#xD;
           asked to record one weekday and one weekend day. The Automated Self-Administered 24-hour&#xD;
           (ASA24®) dietary assessment tool was created by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and&#xD;
           is a free web-based tool that enables multiple, automatically coded, self-administered&#xD;
           24-hour recalls (http://asa24.ca/ ). Participants will be provided with instructions on&#xD;
           how to use this technology. Chelsia Gillis (PhD Candidate, RD on the research team) will&#xD;
           consult with the TBCC Registered Dietitian (RD) team to develop a relevant feedback form&#xD;
           and tailored nutrition advice based on a pre-study food recall evaluation (&quot;what do you&#xD;
           typically eat in a day?&quot;).This evaluation will assess micro- and macronutrient intake,&#xD;
           as well as individual client needs. Data from this evaluation will be analyzed and&#xD;
           managed under the leadership of Gillis, who will also direct TBCC staff nutritionist on&#xD;
           the nutrition intervention delivery within 2 weeks of study enrollment. RDs involved in&#xD;
           the study will also have the ability to recommend interventions based on the nutrition&#xD;
           assessment feedback form, such as oral nutritional supplementation or target daily&#xD;
           protein and caloric intake. The number of follow-up dietitian visits will be determined&#xD;
           based on individual need for each participant, and post-study food recall evaluation&#xD;
           data will be collected and analyzed by Gillis (with support from appropriate members of&#xD;
           the research team) to assess changes in food intake behaviours, and possible&#xD;
           correlations to levels of exercise participation and patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: We will collect demographic data and details of tumour type (e.g.,&#xD;
      histology, biomarkers) and treatments received prior to and during the trial (e.g.,&#xD;
      chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation therapy). Primary outcome measures will assess&#xD;
      study feasibility both quantitatively and qualitatively, including recruitment (% who&#xD;
      participate from those eligible), attendance (weekly group class), assessment completion,&#xD;
      safety (adverse event reporting), attrition rates, and qualitative themes generated from&#xD;
      one-on-one participant interviews (conducted at the end of the intervention). We will recruit&#xD;
      a subset of participants for the interviews, using purposive sampling to achieve maximum&#xD;
      variation based on factors that may lead to different viewpoints (e.g., age, gender,&#xD;
      lifestyle factors, cancer stage, treatment). It is hypothesized that a weekly group-based PA&#xD;
      intervention will be feasible for advanced NSCLC patients, (predicted as 30% recruitment of&#xD;
      patients approached for participation and 60% attendance at weekly group class and 70%&#xD;
      assessment completion), and safe (zero reported adverse events related to the exercise&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include exploratory analysis of the intervention's impact on PROs,&#xD;
      including QOL, including fatigue and symptom burden. QOL will be measured with the&#xD;
      FACT-general and FACT-lung, and fatigue will be measured with the FACIT-fatigue. The symptom&#xD;
      burden inventory (ESAS) that is part of the Putting Patients First (PPF) assessment is&#xD;
      collected for all patients at TBCC and will be collected from chart review. It will also be&#xD;
      collected before and after each exercise session. Nutrition will be assessed from the food&#xD;
      recall evaluation data collected pre and post intervention. Physical performance (modified&#xD;
      senior's fitness test: resting heart rate, resting blood pressure, height, weight, waist/hip&#xD;
      circumference, sit-and-reach, shoulder range of motion, 30-second sit to stand, handgrip&#xD;
      strength, 6-minute walk test, single-leg balance), activity levels (self-reported, Godin&#xD;
      Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire) and opioid/other drug use (chart review) will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline (pre-intervention) and post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRO measures will be collected through questionnaires administered at baseline&#xD;
      (pre-intervention) and post-intervention and completed either online (survey monkey) or in&#xD;
      person during the clinic or exercise assessment using a hard copy of the online survey.&#xD;
      Exercise assessments will be completed at the Health and Wellness Lab (Culos-Reed) by a CEP&#xD;
      not involved in the delivery of the exercise intervention. Relevant medical or symptom&#xD;
      management information will be obtained from chart review and from the case report forms&#xD;
      collected over the duration of the 12-week intervention, and stored in a secure offline&#xD;
      database. To reduce burden in this feasibility study, participants will not be required to&#xD;
      report objective physical activity from the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Quantitative analysis will include descriptive statistics (means/medians, standard&#xD;
      deviations) and dependent t-tests to measure change over time within the participants. The&#xD;
      qualitative analysis of the interviews will include verbatim transcription and input into&#xD;
      NVivo for thematic analysis. Results of both data sources analyses will be examined to&#xD;
      provide a richer understanding of the feasibility and tolerability of the described&#xD;
      multimodal intervention in the advanced NSCLC population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work will inform the feasibility of providing a multimodal complex care&#xD;
      intervention to promote QOL in advanced NSCLC patients. Specifically, by evaluating&#xD;
      feasibility of this intervention, we aim to develop a larger trial (PCT) aimed at measuring&#xD;
      the impact of a multimodal cancer rehabilitation service on QOL in numerous advanced tumour&#xD;
      group populations.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise: The exercise intervention is a 12-week group-based program, with 1 weekly 75 minute session focused on strength, balance, flexibility and aerobic capacity.&#xD;
Palliative Symptom Management: Palliative symptom management will focus on symptoms that contribute to reduced QOL, limit ability to engage in exercise, or present barriers to oral intake.&#xD;
Nutrition: A Registered Dietitian (RD) team will provide feedback and tailored nutrition advice based on a pre-study food recall evaluation, recommending interventions based on the nutrition assessment feedback form, such as oral nutritional supplementation or target daily protein and caloric intake.</description>
