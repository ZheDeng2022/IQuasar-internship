    <textblock>
      Malnutrition among children, especially stunting is a public health problem in Cameroon. This&#xD;
      study assesses the impact of zinc supplementation of children and nutrition education of&#xD;
      mothers on the nutritional status of the children in the rural community. Dietary surveys,&#xD;
      nutritional status, zinc supplementation of children and nutrition education of mothers were&#xD;
      carried out. After nutrition education and zinc supplementation, the study showed positive&#xD;
      impact of both intervention on the nutritional status of children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A questionnaire was developed, tested and adjusted prior the field survey. During the study,&#xD;
      the knowledge of mothers on child nutrition, the eating habits of children, the estimated&#xD;
      consumption of energy, nutrients of children and food availability on the market during&#xD;
      harvesting and sowing seasons were evaluated. Moreover, data on zinc supplementation and&#xD;
      nutrition education sessions conducted with mothers of these children were collected. The&#xD;
      impact of zinc supplementation and maternal education was evaluated by measuring height/age,&#xD;
      weight/age and weight/height indices, and levels of serum albumin, calcium, zinc, iron,&#xD;
      magnesium and phosphorus before and after interventions.&#xD;
