  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants with congenital gastrointestinal anomalies (CGIA) experience multiple physiologic&#xD;
      stressors, including neonatal surgery, early in life during an essential time of growth and&#xD;
      development. Early physiologic stressors such as inadequate nutrition have been linked to&#xD;
      altered growth patterns and neurodevelopmental delays later in life. In other groups of&#xD;
      at-risk infants, early body composition measurements can be used as predictors of long-term&#xD;
      health outcomes more so than weight and length alone. The primary objective of this study is&#xD;
      to determine if body composition changes in early life are predictive of neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes among infants with CGIA. The secondary objective is to determine if infants with&#xD;
      CGIA have altered body composition over time when compared with healthy infants. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a prospective, observational study of infants with CGIA, including&#xD;
      detailed chart review, body composition measurements, and neurodevelopmental testing at&#xD;
      follow-up. If a correlation between body composition measurements and neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes is established in this population, the addition of body composition measurement to&#xD;
      standard of care in the neonatal intensive care unit and in follow-up care could allow for&#xD;
      further optimization of overall health and development of this vulnerable pediatric&#xD;
      population through earlier detection of growth alterations and informed interventions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Infants with congenital gastrointestinal anomalies (CGIA) including gastroschisis,&#xD;
      omphalocele, esophageal and bowel atresias, tracheoesophageal fistulas, Hirschsprung's&#xD;
      disease, and congenital diaphragmatic hernias, account for ~7 in 10,000 live births. Early in&#xD;
      life, these infants undergo major surgery under general anesthesia followed by a prolonged&#xD;
      period of inadequate nutrition, exposure to post-operative pain medications and antibiotics,&#xD;
      and parental separation. Despite exposure to these risk factors for future growth failure and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental delay, growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes have not been well described&#xD;
      in this group of at-risk infants. Preliminary findings in preschool-age children with CGIA&#xD;
      suggest that these children have slower speed of processing compared to healthy children and&#xD;
      that increased fat-free mass (FFM) at preschool age is associated with higher cognitive test&#xD;
      scores. However, no studies to date have described the longitudinal relationship between&#xD;
      growth, body composition, nutrition, inflammation, and neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants&#xD;
      with CGIA. To address this research gap, the investigators propose to conduct a prospective&#xD;
      cohort study enrolling infants with CGIA to measure their growth and development over time.&#xD;
      Infant growth and body composition will be measured at or near term and at 4 months corrected&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that infants with CGIA will undergo a period of rapid catch-up&#xD;
      growth early in life, and infants who demonstrate better catch-up growth will have better&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes compared to infants that do not experience catch-up growth. At 4&#xD;
      months corrected age, early neurologic outcomes will be measured using event related&#xD;
      potentials (ERP). Clinical information including nutrient intake, inflammatory markers, and&#xD;
      medications received will be gathered throughout the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)&#xD;
      hospitalization to assess the impact physiologic stressors have on changes in body&#xD;
      composition and cognitive outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the impact of early nutrition, inflammation,&#xD;
      physiologic stress, growth, and body composition on later neurodevelopmental outcomes in&#xD;
      infants requiring neonatal surgery for CGIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To determine if infants with CGIA requiring neonatal surgery have altered body&#xD;
      composition growth patterns compared to healthy infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a. To determine if early physiologic stress and/or malnutrition are associated with&#xD;
      altered body composition in infants with CGIA compared to healthy infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: CGIA infants with increased early nutritional intake and decreased inflammation&#xD;
      will have greater FFM gains and more appropriately mimic the growth of healthy comparison&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To determine if FFM gains in infancy are associated with improved neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes among infants with CGIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Greater FFM gains from birth to 4 months corrected age will be associated with&#xD;
      faster speed of processing and better recognition memory among infants with CGIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that early exposure to physiologic stressors impact the&#xD;
      framework of the developing brain leading to long-lasting changes in development and that FFM&#xD;
      accretion is an important biomarker of long-term outcomes for this population. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to discover methods to better identify those infants at risk for poor&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes and provide improved recommendations regarding nutritional and&#xD;
      educational interventions that will ensure these infants achieve their full potential. These&#xD;
      findings could also be used to encourage local and national NICU follow-up programs to expand&#xD;
      beyond the follow-up of preterm infants to include high-risk populations such as infants born&#xD;
      with CGIA. In addition, this proposed study could greatly impact community population health&#xD;
      by optimizing growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children previously hospitalized in&#xD;
      NICUs.&#xD;
