      An open label trial to assess the safety and efficacy of transcranial photobiomodulation&#xD;
      (tPBM) in improving symptoms of depression in youth.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric depression is a prevalent and morbid disorder estimated to affect up to 12% of&#xD;
      youth in the United States by the time they reach adolescence. Recent research has documented&#xD;
      that even minor symptoms of depression as captured through the Child Behavior Checklist&#xD;
      (CBCL) Anxiety/Depression scale are strongly associated with the subsequent development of&#xD;
      major depression. While treatments with antidepressants and psychotherapy are available,&#xD;
      antidepressants can be associated with adverse effects including manic activation and&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions are costly and not wide available. This state of affairs supports&#xD;
      the search for safe and effective alternative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such opportunity is transcranial LED therapy, also known as transcranial&#xD;
      photobiomodulation (tPBM). The treatment consists of exposing the frontal brain to the tPBM&#xD;
      bilaterally, which is hypothesized to enhance adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in&#xD;
      depressed subjects. tPBM is a non-ionizing electromagnetic wave. It is invisible, penetrates&#xD;
      the skin and skull into brain tissue, is non-invasive, is minimally dissipated as thermal&#xD;
      energy, and is mainly absorbed by specific chromophores. The benefits of tPBM are wavelength&#xD;
      specific. A mitochondrial enzyme, the cytochrome c oxidase, is the primary chromophore for&#xD;
      the tPBM, with a wavelength around 830 nm. The energy absorbed by the cytochrome c oxidase&#xD;
      leads to increased ATP production through the respiratory chain. Ultimately, the increased&#xD;
      ATP is thought to lead to increased energy metabolism for the cell, and it is hypothesized&#xD;
      that a signaling cascade is activated promoting cellular plasticity and cytoprotection. These&#xD;
      properties of the tPBM have led to novel therapeutic applications in psychiatry. A&#xD;
      preliminary open label study in 10 depressed subjects has shown that the tPBM was safe,&#xD;
      effective and well tolerated in depressed adults. Further research confirmed these findings&#xD;
      and shown tPBM therapy to be a promising intervention for adults with MDD. However, whether&#xD;
      this non-invasive intervention may be safe and effective in pediatric depression remains&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end the investigators propose a pilot study is to evaluate whether tPBM is safe and&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of pediatric depression. This study will enroll 30 youth of both&#xD;
      sexes 6-17 years with active symptoms of depression as assessed through elevated scores on&#xD;
      the CBCL Anxiety/depression scale. Based on the adult literature, investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that it will be safe and effective in this population.&#xD;
