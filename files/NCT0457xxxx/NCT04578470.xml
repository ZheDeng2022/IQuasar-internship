  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo in older&#xD;
      adults (Parham &amp; Kuchel, 2016). It is caused by dislodged otoconia, which fall from the&#xD;
      utricular macula into the semicircular canals causing them to move through the canals with&#xD;
      the effect of gravity (Parnes et al., 2003). Treatment of BPPV is primarily with Canalith&#xD;
      Repositioning Procedure (CRP) with more than 80% success rates. However, BPPV can recur in&#xD;
      10-20% of the time and in some long-term follow-up studies reporting up to 50% recurrence&#xD;
      rates (Fife et al., 2008). Despite BPPV being considered a benign self-limiting condition, it&#xD;
      has far reaching physical and psychosocial consequences for the geriatric population such as&#xD;
      injuries from falls precipitated by vertiginous attacks and fear of unexpected vertigo&#xD;
      leading to restriction of daily activities and functional decline (Balatsouras et al., 2018;&#xD;
      Kao et al., 2009). Studies have shown that the 1-year prevalence of individuals with BPPV&#xD;
      attacks rises steeply with age, with the cumulative (lifetime) incidence of BPPV reaching&#xD;
      almost 10% by the age of 80 (Parham &amp; Kuchel, 2016). Aging has also been shown to be a&#xD;
      primary risk factor for idiopathic BPPV, with events such as prolonged bed rest postulated&#xD;
      for being a trigger for BPPV (Parham &amp; Kuchel, 2016). BPPV is also noted to be underreported&#xD;
      in the elderly mainly due to the different manifestations such as less rotatory vertigo and&#xD;
      more nonspecific dizziness and instability, with consecutive examinations in geriatric&#xD;
      population revealing that 9% of elderly have unrecognized BPPV (Oghalai et al., 2000). Given&#xD;
      the increased prevalence and severe implications of BPPV on there is a strong impetus for&#xD;
      this study to lower the recurrence of BPPV in this vulnerable older population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate whether Vitamin D supplementation with diet, or diet alone&#xD;
      combined with CRP (standard clinical care) can reduce recurrence of BPPV and if there is any&#xD;
      improvement in the patient's functional ability, postural stability and prevalence of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A will be prescribed Vitamin D supplementation in the form of daily 2000 IU&#xD;
           cholecalciferol (two tablets) for 13 weeks, and daily 1000 IU cholecalciferol(1 tablet)&#xD;
           for another 13 weeks and then treatment will be discontinued but dietary interventions&#xD;
           will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B will be prescribed placebo of Vitamin D with two tablets daily for 13 weeks then&#xD;
           1 tablet daily for 13 weeks then no treatment for 26 weeks but dietary interventions&#xD;
           will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C will not receive any Vitamin D intervention for the entire 12- month study&#xD;
           period but will receive dietary interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same day, patients will be grouped according to their Vitamin D status. Patients who are&#xD;
      Vitamin D deplete (&lt;30ng/ml) will be randomised into groups A or B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be undertaken by the unblinded team, who will allocate randomly generated&#xD;
      treatment using sealed opaque envelopes. The unblinded team will open the sealed envelope and&#xD;
      the patient will be allocated to a group. The patient will not be informed of the treatment&#xD;
      regime. Patients with replete Vitamin D levels (≥30ng/ml) will be serving as a control in&#xD;
      group C. All clinical investigators will be blinded to the group assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinding can be undertaken for urgent clinical need, for example, fall with hip fracture&#xD;
      requiring surgical intervention and high dose replacement of Vitamin D prior to initiation of&#xD;
      bisphosphonate or other osteoporosis treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All request for unblinding will be made to the unblinded team investigator to determine the&#xD;
      need for unblinding prior to release of unblinded information. However, the dosing chosen for&#xD;
      the study would permit the patient to have treatment with clinically needed high doses of&#xD;
      vitamin D and continue on the study treatment without risk of hypervitaminosis D. The&#xD;
      anonymous google survey undertaken indicated that some clinicians will use high dose&#xD;
      replacement at the same time as maintenance dosing. Any cases that require unblinding will be&#xD;
      discussed with the unblinded Investigator before the unblinding takes place but the outcome&#xD;
      of the unblinding will not be communicated to the clinical team to allow the study&#xD;
      assessments to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Groups (A, B, C) will receive dietary interventions across the 12- month study period and&#xD;
      will be scheduled dietitian clinics to attend. Before their clinics, all patients will be&#xD;
      issued instructions by the dietitian to record their dietary habits via a 3-day food record&#xD;
      (3DFR- Appendix 4) and to send their 3DFR to the dietitian through mail or email, at least 5&#xD;
      days prior to their scheduled dietitian review. Patients will be provided a unique patient&#xD;
      identification number in the study and will be asked to use this number in place of personal&#xD;
      particulars when sending in their 3DFR. In the event that patients are unable to send in&#xD;
      their 3DFR before their appointment, they will be asked to bring it on the day of the review&#xD;
      itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-2 weeks appointment All Groups (A, B, C) will be scheduled an ENT review in 1-2 weeks as&#xD;
      routine clinical care for patients following CRP. Alongside this ENT review, they will also&#xD;
      receive a referral to the dietitian clinic at this routine clinical visit for assessment of&#xD;
      their dietary habits. ENT clinic will test all patients for efficacy of CRP treatment.&#xD;
      Dietitian's clinic will provide assessment of patients' dietary habits from their 3DFR,&#xD;
      provide counselling on dietary habits as well as take anthropometric measurements such as&#xD;
      height, weight and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3rd month tele- consult All Groups (A, B, C) will receive a call from the audiologist who&#xD;
      will check on BPPV recurrence with specific questions from the Shortened Dizziness Handicap&#xD;
      Inventory Questionnaire (SDHIQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6th month appointment All Groups (A, B, C) will return for an audiologist review and&#xD;
      dietitian review. At the audiologist review, patients will answer questions relating to BPPV&#xD;
      recurrence, undergo Dix Hallpike test to check for recurrence of BPPV and balance and&#xD;
      functional assessment in the form of Gans SOP, SPPB, BI and CFS. Patients from Group A and B&#xD;
      will also be required to bring in their prescribed medications for a final pill count in&#xD;
      order to check for compliance (performed by unblinded team). At the dietitian review, there&#xD;
      will be assessment of the patient's dietary habits from their 3DFR (which is to be submitted&#xD;
      5 days prior to visit), counselling on dietary habits and taking of anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements such as height, weight and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9th month tele- consult All Groups (A, B, C) will receive a call from the audiologist who&#xD;
      will check on BPPV recurrence with specific questions from the SDHIQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12th month appointment All Groups (A, B, C) will return for the final audiologist review and&#xD;
      dietician review. At the audiologist review, all patients will answer questions relating to&#xD;
      BPPV recurrence and undertake a Dix Hallpike test to check for recurrence of BPPV. The&#xD;
      audiologist will also administer balance and functional assessment in the form of Gans SOP,&#xD;
      SPPB, BI and CFS for comparison with start of study. All groups will undertake a final serum&#xD;
      vitamin D3 test and corrected calcium measurements. At the dietitian review, there will be&#xD;
      assessment of the patient's dietary habits from their 3DFR (which is to be submitted 5 days&#xD;
      prior to visit), counselling on dietary habits and taking of anthropometric measurements such&#xD;
      as height, weight and BMI.&#xD;
