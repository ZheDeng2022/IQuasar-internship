      The objectives of the present study are: 1) to identify the intestinal and salivary&#xD;
      microbiota associated with the presence and severity of hepatic steatosis in children (Study&#xD;
      I: case-control study), and 2) to develop a personalized 12-week intervention program based&#xD;
      on diet and exercise to examine its effects on the diversity and composition of the&#xD;
      microbiota in children with hepatic steatosis (Study II: intervention study)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MicroKid project will acts first as a case-control study (Study I) in order to identify&#xD;
      the hepatic steatosis and intestinal and salivary microbiota in children grouped as&#xD;
      non-overweight, obese-non-hepatic steatosis, and obese-hepatic steatosis. Then, an&#xD;
      intervention study (Study II) will be developed for those children with obesity (i.e.,&#xD;
      obese-non-hepatic steatosis, and obese-hepatic steatosis groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A total of 60 children, 8-12 years-old, will be assigned to control&#xD;
      (non-overweight children, N= 20), obese-non-hepatic steatosis (children with obesity, but&#xD;
      without hepatic steatosis, N=20), and obese-hepatic steatosis (children with obesity and&#xD;
      hepatic steatosis, N= 20) groups (Study I: case-control study). The obesity and obesity +&#xD;
      hepatic steatosis groups will attend to a 12-weeks healthy lifestyle education program (2&#xD;
      days/month) and home-based exercise program (minimum 3 days/week) (Study II: intervention&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined intervention program for the Study II will include: i) healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      education program focused on dietary and lifestyle guidelines for both children and parents&#xD;
      (2 days/month, 60 min), and ii) exercise program based on high-intensity interval training&#xD;
      which combines aerobic and resistance training (at least 3 days/week, from 38 to 44 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: In the Study I (i.e., case-control study), all participants will be evaluated&#xD;
      at baseline. For the Study II (i.e., intervention study), only those participants that&#xD;
      belongs to obese-non-hepatic steatosis and obese-hepatic steatosis groups, will be&#xD;
      additionally evaluated after the intervention program (12-week). The following outcomes will&#xD;
      be measured: hepatic fat fraction and abdominal adiposity (magnetic resonance imaging),&#xD;
      intestinal and salivary microbiota, body composition (bioimpedance), cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      factors, liver enzymes, physical fitness (field-fitness tests), physical activity&#xD;
      (accelerometry), sleep (accelerometry), dietary habits (24h recalls, and food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaires), and pubertal development and sociodemographic characteristics will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
