  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out whether the study drug Retifanlimab, a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody against the PD-1 protein, combined with gemcitabine and docetaxel, is a safe and&#xD;
      effective treatment for your disease. Gemcitabine and docetaxel are chemotherapy drugs that&#xD;
      are commonly used to treat soft tissue sarcoma. Retifanlimab is an experimental drug that&#xD;
      boosts the immune system's ability to fight cancer cells. The study researchers think that&#xD;
      Retifanlimab may help gemcitabine and docetaxel work better against soft tissue sarcoma that&#xD;
      is either locally advanced or has spread beyond its original location (metastasized), and it&#xD;
      cannot be removed with surgery (unresectable).&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of the phase II portion of this study is to determine the proportion of patients that are progression-free at 24 weeks by RECIST v1.1. Progressive disease is declared when there is an increase in sum of target disease ≥ 20%, stable disease when the change is &gt; -30% and ≤ 20%, partial response when there is a decrease in sum of target disease ≥ 30%, and complete response when all lesions have disappeared or all lesions have disappeared and all nodal disease is &lt; 10 mm each.</description>

    <description>A safety run-in (dose level 0 in Table 1, below) will be performed and enroll 6 patients with advanced high-grade sarcoma who are treatment naïve. Cycle one will consist of gemcitabine plus docetaxel at the institution's standard dose and schedule: 900 mg/m2 of gemcitabine on days 1 and 8, and 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel on day 8. Intravenous Retifanlimab at a flat dose of 210 mg will be administered every 3 weeks starting on C2D1 for a total of two cycles (cycles 2 and 3).</description>
