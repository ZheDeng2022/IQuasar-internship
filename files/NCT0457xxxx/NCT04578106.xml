      This is a prospective, single arm, open-label, unicenter, exploratory study in women with&#xD;
      primary operable HER2-positive, HER2-enriched/ERBB2-high breast cancer according to PAM50&#xD;
      intrinsic subtype and a ERBB2 pre-defined cutoff (high vs low ERBB2 expression), to evaluate&#xD;
      the omission of surgery and sentinel lymph node dissection in patients with HER2-E and ERBB2&#xD;
      high breast cancer who achieving a complete response following standard anti-HER2-based&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy with paclitaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab. The primary trial objective is to&#xD;
      estimate the loco-regional invasive disease-free survival at 3-year of patients who achieve a&#xD;
      complete response based on imaging (i.e. Magnetic resonance imaging) and a&#xD;
      stereotactic-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and omit loco-regional surgery.&#xD;

Adjuvant period: If no invasive tumor cells and no in situ disease are identified in the stereotactic-guided VAB,patients will be eligible to omit loco-regional surgery. Whole breast radiotherapy without nodal radiotherapy will then be performed. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab FDC will be continued to complete 1 year of treatment and adjuvant endocrine therapy will be indicated according to hormonal receptor status by IHC.</description>

Surgery: If invasive tumor cells and/or in situ disease are identified, patients will undergo surgery.

    <description>After 13 weeks of neoadjuvant treatment, a breast MRI will be performed. If a complete response is observed on breast MRI, patients will undergo a stereotactic-guided VAB of the marker area to obtain 12 cylinders of breast parenchyma, which is equivalent to 2 grams of tissue. If no invasive tumor cells and no in situ disease are identified in the stereotactic-guided VAB, patients will be eligible to omit loco-regional surgery.</description>
