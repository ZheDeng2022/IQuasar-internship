  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to incorporate behavioral economics approaches to determine&#xD;
      whether 3 novel interventions of varying intensity improve the frequency of parent-child&#xD;
      reading behaviors among low-income families. Participants will be randomized to comparative&#xD;
      groups to test the effects of automated hovering approaches on frequency of parent-child&#xD;
      shared reading. Investigators long-term goal is to test the effects of these approaches to&#xD;
      promote child language and socio-emotional development.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early childhood is a sensitive period in which young children develop language and&#xD;
      socio-emotional skills foundational for school readiness. Unfortunately, poor vulnerable&#xD;
      children experience disparities in these critical areas of development. Parent-child shared&#xD;
      reading can help ameliorate these disparities, yet low-income parents do not consistently&#xD;
      engage in this activity. Behavioral economics approaches utilizing automated hovering (AH)&#xD;
      have the potential to increase parent-child shared reading through text messages and&#xD;
      financial inducements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective, randomized comparative group trial to test the effects of&#xD;
      AH approaches to increase parent-child shared reading. A total of 45 eligible children and&#xD;
      their parents will be recruited from participating practices to achieve a diverse sample of&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-five participants in will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive one of the 3 AH interventions:&#xD;
      1) daily text message reminders, 2) daily text message reminders with coaching/social&#xD;
      comparisons or 3) daily text message reminders with coaching/social comparisons and weekly&#xD;
      lottery entries. All interventions are related to principles of behavioral economics in order&#xD;
      to provide external motivation. There will be 15 participants per group to adequately assess&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability, the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics for demographic, home reading environment, and parenting stress&#xD;
      measured at baseline will be examined across the three groups to assess the success of the&#xD;
      randomization. To assess feasibility and acceptability, Investigators will assess the&#xD;
      proportion of participants who receive and report a daily reading behavior each week across&#xD;
      all groups, the proportion of participants who access coaching content in group 2 &amp; 3, and&#xD;
      the proportion of participants who participate in the weekly lottery in group 3, and&#xD;
      satisfaction scores in all groups. Secondary outcomes including differences between groups in&#xD;
      weekly reading frequency, home reading environment, and child socio-emotional scores between&#xD;
      groups will be assessed using standard inferential statistics and intention-to-treat&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study may assist health care providers and researchers in testing the&#xD;
      feasibility of AH approaches to improve parent-child shared reading and prepare for a larger&#xD;
      efficacy trial.&#xD;

To obtain this data set, other investigators will need to contact the study Principal Investigator (PI) who will provide a data sharing agreement. The data sharing agreement will permit a deidentified data set to be shared once an Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol has been approved at the investigators' home institution and the investigators have signed a pledge to not attempt to identify individual study subjects. The data set will be made available on a Compact Disc Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) or through a secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site.</ipd_description>
