  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NTX-001 is a single use surgical product intended for use in conjunction with standard suture&#xD;
      neurorrhaphy of a severed nerves in patients between 16 and 65 years of age.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NTX-001 (Product) is a surgical product that consists of an active solution (drug), a&#xD;
      isolation chamber medical device (chamber or device) and two (2) other sterile solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTX-001 has been developed as surgical product to be used in conjunction with standard suture&#xD;
      neurorrhaphy of a severed nerve. Use of NTX-001 is intended to safely accelerate the often&#xD;
      slow and diminished return of function in repaired nerves. It often takes months and/or years&#xD;
      to determine if function will be restored. By that point, restoration is often incomplete and&#xD;
      can result in lifelong motor and/or sensory deficits. By reconnecting (PEG-fusion) a&#xD;
      substantial number of axons within a severed nerve, the degeneration-regeneration cycle and&#xD;
      subsequent atrophy may be reduced or even prevented for those axons and their targets,&#xD;
      respectively. NTX-001 (PEG-fusion) has the potential to avoid the consequences of protracted&#xD;
      denervation of distal target tissues by eliminating the period of total denervation thus&#xD;
      reducing the time to stable recovery and providing greater innervation to affected tissues.&#xD;
