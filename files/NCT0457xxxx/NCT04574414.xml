  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Background: Recent studies have linked exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) to&#xD;
           neurodevelopmental outcomes but the findings are mixed and mechanisms are unclear. We&#xD;
           aim to determine the impact of PM on the developing brain of schoolchildren in Poland, a&#xD;
           European country characterized by very high levels of air pollution. The investigators&#xD;
           aim to determine the impact of PM on the developing brain of schoolchildren in Poland, a&#xD;
           European country characterized by very high levels of air pollution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study area: 19 towns in three voivodeships (Lesser Poland, Silesian, Opole) in the&#xD;
           southern Poland. To reduce confounding by urbanicity and at the same time, to achieve&#xD;
           sufficient contrasts in PM levels without too high logistic costs, towns were selected&#xD;
           by size (big and small) and by PM levels (high, medium and low).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design: Case-control study with 800 children recruited over two school years, with two&#xD;
           population controls per one ADHD case. Suspected cases will be recruited in specialized&#xD;
           facilities and presumably ADHD-free children will be recruited in primary schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exposure assessment: Poland-wide PM and other air pollutants' grids will be created for&#xD;
           the years 2006 to 2021 using statistical models to incorporate land use data, estimates&#xD;
           from transport models, satellite observations and air pollution measurements from Polish&#xD;
           monitoring network. Prenatal, early-life, lifelong and concurrent exposures will be&#xD;
           calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological testing: Every child and their parents will complete a series of&#xD;
           psychological tests and interviews that will be conducted during their three visits to&#xD;
           the recruitment facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuroimaging: Each participant will undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning&#xD;
           session that will be performed accordingly to the Human Connectome Adolescent Brain&#xD;
           Cognitive Development project recommendations. Scanning will be performed on a single&#xD;
           scanner in Krakow.&#xD;
