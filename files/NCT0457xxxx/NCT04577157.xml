    <textblock>
      It is a parallel-design, two-arm, randomized controlled trial designed to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of mHealth application using 7- items, multifaceted educational and reminder&#xD;
      module intervention( written message, voice message, multimedia picture, Graphic based&#xD;
      Messages(GBM), video, hypertension at a glance, and doctor support) to improve adherence to&#xD;
      medication in hypertensive patients and clinical outcome systolic blood pressure in Lahore,&#xD;
      Pakistan. Cost-effectiveness of this study will also be done.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is indeed a significant public health concern in Pakistan. Hypertension&#xD;
      drastically affects 18.9% of adolescents of age greater than 15 and 33% of adults of age&#xD;
      above 45. Uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) is a leading risk factor for major hypertensive&#xD;
      complications. In Pakistan, suboptimal adherence to medication remains a stumbling block to&#xD;
      the success of antihypertensive treatment. A majority of the population in Pakistan on&#xD;
      treatment is found to be non-adherent. mHealth is quite an apt tool positioned to counter&#xD;
      these challenges of poor adherence in resource limit settings like Pakistan. What is&#xD;
      available is too little to establish any causal relationship. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of mHealth intervention by using a reminder module in improving&#xD;
      patient medication adherence in hypertensive patients. The intervention was designed to&#xD;
      improve the hypertension-related adherence in participants in the intervention group. The&#xD;
      module will be developed and undergone via the process of consultations from a group of&#xD;
      experts. These will include professors of epidemiology, one expert in behavioral&#xD;
      intervention, two professors of health education, and one cardiologist specialist in&#xD;
      hypertension management. For the intervention group, a &quot;multifaceted educational reminder&#xD;
      module&quot; will be developed and delivered through &quot;WhatsApp&quot; (written message, voice message,&#xD;
      and Graphic-based Reminder (GBR)) by an Information and Technology (IT) facilitator. This&#xD;
      will be included daily notes for medication reminders, voice messages,s and Graphic-based&#xD;
      Reminders (GBR), Twice-weekly Graphic based Messages(GBM), Lifestyle changing video,&#xD;
      hypertension at a glance, and doctor support in addition to the standard care (as per being&#xD;
      practiced routinely in the hospitals). WhatsApp is used in this study because of its feature&#xD;
      of ticks, which turns out to blue after seeing the message and it is an indication to the&#xD;
      sender if the receiver has seen the message, so, the participants no longer need to respond&#xD;
      to calls or messages. If the intervention is found effective, it can help in developing&#xD;
      educational guidelines for patients to improve their medication adherence and reduce related&#xD;
      complications at the same time. This study will give a new line of research for coming&#xD;
      researchers in the long run. Moreover, its cost-effectiveness will be assessed to predict one&#xD;
      dollar bring about improvement per mmHg.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>It is a parallel-design, intention-to-treat, two-arm, randomized controlled trial, six months of duration with intervention module intervention pre-test and post-test evaluations to assess the effectiveness of mHealth application using Multi-aid-package intervention(voice, written message, and multimedia picture) to improve adherence to medication in hypertensive patients in Lahore, Pakistan. Participants will be assigned to the two groups in a parallel fashion in a ratio of 1:1. The intervention group will be given a reminder module intervention and control group with standard care (as per being practiced routinely in the hospitals).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to medication (Medication Adherence Score)- Self Reported Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6- month from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is (change) medication adherence to antihypertensive treatment (AHT) at 6 months. This will be assessed by self-reporting using a Standardized questionnaire, Self-efficacy for Appropriate Medication Adherence Scale (SEAMS) at 0, 3, and 6 months. It is a 13-item scale with a three-point response questionnaire, with (1 _ not confident, 2 _ somewhat confident and 3 _ very confident). The potential score for the 13-item scale ranged from 13 to 39. Higher scores indicated higher levels of self-efficacy for medication adherence and vice versa. Besides SEAMS, adherence rates will be also be calculated by 'pills taken over a specific period of time, divided by pills prescribed for that specific period of time. The cut-off value of 80% is set. Less than 80% will be considered non-adherent while &gt;80% will be adherent. It will be self-reporting.</description>

This will be assessed on measuring blood pressure at the hospital by a blinded staff nurse at 0, 3, and 6 months at the hospital by a blinded staff nurse using the calibrated upper-arm electronic sphygmomanometer (OMRON HEM-7200, OMRON Corporation, Dalian) with standard guidelines.</description>
