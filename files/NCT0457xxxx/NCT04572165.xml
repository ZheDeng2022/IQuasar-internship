  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether exposure to semaglutide influences the risk of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. This is achieved by estimating the risk&#xD;
      of pancreatic cancer associated with semaglutide use as compared to use of other non-incretin&#xD;
      antidiabetic drugs used at a similar stage as Ozempic® or Rybelsus® in the treatment of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes. A multi-national, non-interventional study based on health care data from&#xD;
      Denmark, Sweden, and Norway is conducted covering the period 2018-2023. A cohort study design&#xD;
      is used comparing new users of semaglutide with new users of other antidiabetic drugs used at&#xD;
      a similar stage as Ozempic® or Rybelsus® in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (active&#xD;
      comparators). Active comparators will include the following non-incretin antidiabetic agents:&#xD;
      sulphonylureas, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, and insulin subdivided into i)&#xD;
      basal insulin only and ii) basal + bolus insulin or premix insulin. Propensity scores are&#xD;
      used to match new users of semaglutide with new users of active comparators. National&#xD;
      prescription-, cancer- and patient registries are used to identify exposure to antidiabetic&#xD;
      agents, pancreatic cancer cases, and covariates to be used in propensity score matching. This&#xD;
      study is a post-authorisation safety study (PASS).&#xD;

        The risk of pancreatic cancer is compared in a cohort of first-time ever users of&#xD;
        semaglutide relative to a cohort of first-time ever users of the other antidiabetic drugs&#xD;
        used at a similar stage as Ozempic® or Rybelsus® in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of semaglutide or initiation of active comparators from when the first subject is&#xD;
             dispensed semaglutide in the respective country (2018) until December 31, 2022.&#xD;
             Initiation is defined as no previous prescription of a drug with the same active&#xD;
             ingredient in the past 10 years as recorded in the national prescription registries.&#xD;
             Previous use of the same class of drug is however accepted. Further, a patient who&#xD;
             shift from Ozempic® to Rybelsus® or vice versa will be considered a continued user in&#xD;
             the semaglutide group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least two prescriptions of either semaglutide or active comparators (at the level&#xD;
             of the active ingredient) with the second prescription filled less than one year after&#xD;
             the initial prescription. Two prescriptions filled at first day of treatment will,&#xD;
             however, only be counted as one prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years or older at the cohort entry date. The cohort entry date is defined as the&#xD;
             dispensing date of the initial prescription (i.e. treatment initiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ten years or more of continuous residency in the country of residence before&#xD;
             initiation of semaglutide or active comparators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with rare but strong risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer are excluded.&#xD;
        Therefore, patients with any history of the following conditions (identified according to&#xD;
        10th version of International Classification of Diseases [ICD-10]) before cohort entry date&#xD;
        (based on the last 10 years of data or more) are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of any cancer except non-melanoma skin cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other chronic pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cystic fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other phacomatoses, not elsewhere classified (including Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and Von&#xD;
             Hippel-Lindau syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurofibromatosis (non-malignant, Von Recklinghausen disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, the following patients are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of pancreatic cancer as these patients are no longer at risk&#xD;
             for an incident pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who initially started insulin as first-line antidiabetic treatment and who&#xD;
             did not add on or switch to non-insulin treatment within 3 months. Those initiating&#xD;
             insulin as first-line treatment during the study period is disregarded in terms of&#xD;
             study inclusion, although they may be included upon initiating additional therapy,&#xD;
             provided it is started within three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with gestational diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who meet one of the conditions used as exclusion criteria listed above&#xD;
             (except acute and chronic pancreatitis) after cohort entry date but before start of&#xD;
             follow-up (i.e. during the first year after treatment initiation)&#xD;
