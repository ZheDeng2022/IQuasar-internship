  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efﬁcacy and safety of treating rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) using&#xD;
      foldable capsular buckle (FCB). It is a multi-center clinical ,randomized, controlled, and&#xD;
      single-blind clinical study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, effectiveness, and operability of FCB&#xD;
      scleral buckling and silicone scleral buckling in the treatment of RRD. It is a multi-center&#xD;
      clinical study and is designed according to a randomized, controlled, and single-blind&#xD;
      clinical research protocol. Before surgery, the retinal tear in the FCB group and the control&#xD;
      group of RRD patients should be examined and precise positioned by fundus photography, and&#xD;
      the relevant results will be determined by the third-party reading center to confirm that the&#xD;
      patients can accept such surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key instrument required by the FCB group is FCB. During FCB implantation, 1 ml of basic&#xD;
      Ringer's solution will be injected as FCB, and then the balloon filled, so that the outer&#xD;
      surface of the balloon is in close contact with the sclera, and the top The function of&#xD;
      scleral compression helps to close the hiatus. The key surgical instrument used in the&#xD;
      control group is silicone, but it does not require ring surgery. Silicone is also fixed to&#xD;
      the outer surface of the sclera. After the conjunctiva and Tenon 's sac separated, the&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be evaluated three months after surgery, and both groups will be&#xD;
      followed up to one year after surgery. Relevant data will be collected and kept by full-time&#xD;
      personnel, and then the statistical analysis of the data will be used to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      effectiveness, and operability of FCB implantation, and compare the treatment effect with the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

    <description>Intraoperatively, the location and size of the fissure hole is located under the microscope to determine the location and extent of the conjunctival incision. Once local infiltration anesthesia is complete, a 2 ml needle is inserted into the outer surface of the sclera &gt;10 mm behind the corneoscleral rim, and a cotton swab is used to apply light pressure on the side of the wound to help drain the fluid. Under the microscope, the emptied and folded FCB was inserted vertically into the external scleral channel and the drainage valve was sutured with 5.0 non-absorbable sutures 8-10 mm behind the angular scleral rim. The balloon was then filled with 1 ml of alkaline Ringer's solution using a 1 ml syringe through the drainage valve. Subconjunctival injection of tobramycin and dexamethasone was followed by gentle pressure and bandaging of the eye.</description>

    <description>Intraoperatively, the location and size of the fissure is located under the microscope to determine the location and extent of the incision of the bulbar conjunctiva. When the fissure hole is located microscopically, a retrobulbar block anesthesia is performed and fluid is released according to the degree of retinal detachment. Silicone was then implanted on the scleral surface as an external cushion and intraocular pressure was applied, and the opening was finally sutured, with laser closure performed within a week after surgery. After the surgery, subconjunctival injection of tobramycin and dexamethasone was routinely performed, and the operated eye was bandaged, with observation of the fundus and closure of the aperture.</description>
