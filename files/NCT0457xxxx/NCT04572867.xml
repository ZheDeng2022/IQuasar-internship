  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this research the Investigators hope to learn if early aquapheresis in an outpatient&#xD;
      setting will improve congestive heart failure symptoms in outpatients with decompensated&#xD;
      heart failure who have been refractory to high dose diuretics. In previous trials in&#xD;
      inpatient settings, aquapheresis has been demonstrated to improve quality of life and reduce&#xD;
      hospital visits for those who have undergone the treatment. This study is one of the first to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of aquapheresis in veterans with congestive heart failure in an&#xD;
      outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aquapheresis device, Aquadex FlexFlow® System, manufactured by CHF Solutions™,&#xD;
      Minneapolis, MN, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for removing&#xD;
      excess sodium and fluid from patients suffering from volume overload, like in congestive&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) affects nearly 2% of the U.S. population, with almost 1&#xD;
      million hospital admissions for acute decompensated CHF annually. Congestive heart failure is&#xD;
      the most frequent cause of hospitalization in patients over the age of 65. Patients admitted&#xD;
      for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) have a high 6-month readmission rate for acute&#xD;
      CHF, ranging from 23% to 40% in different studies. It is estimated that 25 to 30% of these&#xD;
      patients are diuretic resistant with 50% of patients losing less than 5 lbs. from admission&#xD;
      weight and 20% actually gaining weight during the hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although loop diuretics have not been shown to improve survival in patients with CHF, they&#xD;
      effectively alleviate symptoms of congestion. Diuretics have been part of standard CHF&#xD;
      therapy in all recent survival trials of β-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Loop diuretics have been shown to be the&#xD;
      most effective diuretics as single agents in moderate to severe heart failure. However, loop&#xD;
      diuretics may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality attributable to&#xD;
      deleterious effects on neurohormonal activation, electrolyte balance, and cardiac and renal&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of excessive fluid in patients with CHF is usually achieved by a combination of fluid&#xD;
      and salt restriction and loop diuretics, but in some cases volume overload persists. Diuretic&#xD;
      resistance is common, especially after chronic exposure to loop diuretics; patients require&#xD;
      escalating doses (PO or IV to bypass delayed absorption in gut due to bowel edema), addition&#xD;
      of another diuretic that works on different part of renal tubules (i.e. Thiazides) +/-&#xD;
      diuretic drip and, if still refractory, ultimately Aquapheresis (a form of ultrafiltration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aquapheresis (AQ) compared to IV diuretics in the UNLOAD Trial (10), AQ safely produced&#xD;
      greater weight loss, fluid removal, and reduction in 90-day readmission rate compared to IV&#xD;
      diuretic. A meta-analysis of 10 randomized control trials (RCTs) showed AQ not only to be&#xD;
      effective but safe. These observations suggest that a strategy of early ultrafiltration may&#xD;
      improve responsiveness to diuretics, quicker weight loss, decrease hospitalization,&#xD;
      readmission to hospital, ER or doctor visits with minimal risks. As result of these trials,&#xD;
      American Hospital Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure&#xD;
      Society of American (HFSA) guidelines state it is reasonable to start Aquapheresis in&#xD;
      patients with obvious volume overload or patients who are refractory to high dose diuretics&#xD;
      (IIa, LOE B). Moreover, while this therapy is part of standard of care in an inpatient&#xD;
      setting, many hospitals as a result of Affordable Care Act (ACA), have taken to AQ on an&#xD;
      outpatient setting to further decrease the burden and attended cost associated with&#xD;
      management of CHF. But the Investigators are unaware of any other prospective outpatient&#xD;
      studies that have looked at the outcomes and cost effectiveness of aquapheresis.&#xD;

    <description>The Aquadex FlexFlow® Fluid Removal System (from CHF Solutions™, Minneapolis, MN) is an FDA approved device that provides mechanical isosmotic fluid removal in volume-overloaded CHF patients via veno-venous ultrafiltration, and has been used in patients with congestive heart failure refractory to diuretics, it should be considered standard of care also. This study is using it in a randomized, controlled study in the Outpatient setting. The Aquadex FlexFlow® Fluid Removal System is a dual rotary pump device used with a sterile, single-use UF 500 Blood Circuit Set. Blood withdrawal is usually from a peripheral arm vein (such as the antecubital vein), using a 16 or 18- gauge, 3.5 cm catheter (similar to a standard IV catheter). A similar IV catheter is used for blood return via a second peripheral vein (typically in the forearm).</description>
