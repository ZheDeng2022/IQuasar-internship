  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will test if a mobile device based intervention program, called &quot;Happy,&#xD;
      Healthy, Loved (HHL)&quot;, will impact breast feeding rates and breastfeeding self-efficacy when&#xD;
      compared to care as usual. Primiparous women and their partners will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the HHL program or usual care.&#xD;

    <description>Index of breastfeeding status - Women will be asked to identify the level that accurately described their breastfeeding behaviors within the previous 24 hours. Four levels will be reported: exclusive breastfeeding (breast milk only), partial breastfeeding (breast milk and at least 1 bottle of formula per day), token breastfeeding (breast given to comfort baby not for nutrition), and no breastfeeding. Higher values represent more exclusive breastfeeding.</description>

    <measure>Hair Cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>0-2 days postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>A small amount (15-30 mg) of hair from the posterior vertex of the head will be collected. Hair strands will then be cut into 3 cm segments, which based on human scalp hair grows at approximately 1 cm per month, so each of the 3 cm samples will index cortisol output during the three trimesters of pregnancy. If hair is less than 9 cm long, the analysis will include only the number of 3 cm segments available. The wash procedure and steroid extraction will be undertaken using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, mothers will be asked about their hair histories to use as covariates in analysis along with hair sample. Hair histories include questions related to hair color, salon treatments, sunlight exposure, use of hair products, medications, creams, and hair pieces, style and indoor tanning habits.</description>

    <description>Both parents will complete surveys on a tablet during the postpartum hospital stay. Surveys cover three topic areas related to breast-feeding; modeling and feedback, partner support, and stress coping. For the next 6 weeks participants' will receive 4 personalized text messages per week based on their tablet survey responses. Participants will be asked one yes/no question each week (&quot;still breastfeeding? Text Y for yes, N for no&quot;). Once a &quot;no&quot; response has been received from a participant, all remaining text messages will emphasize coping and partner support rather than breastfeeding.</description>
