  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylalgia is a common musculoskeletal condition that approximately affects 1-3%&#xD;
      of the general population. Several authors have found greater mechanical pain sensitivity in&#xD;
      the radial nerve when compared with healthy subjects. Radial tunnel syndrome exhibits a&#xD;
      similar clinical presentation to lateral epicondylalgia. Percutaneous electrical stimulation&#xD;
      has shown reduce pain in several conditions. Percutaneous electrical stimulation on the&#xD;
      radial nerve could cause an important relief in lateral epicondylalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Percutaneous electrical stimulation on radial nerve plus in patients with lateral&#xD;
      epicondylalgia is better than sham percutaneous electrical stimulation&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, using Percutaneous Electrical&#xD;
      Nerve Stimulation (PENS). PENS is technique to provide a transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation current throughout needling filaments place close to the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: The primary aim of the study is to compare the immediate effect of a single session&#xD;
      of PENS on pressure pain sensitivity as measured by pressure pain threshold in patients with&#xD;
      lateral epicondylalgia with random assignment to two treatments: PENS or Sham PENS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: The secondary aim of the study is to compare the immediate effect on pain free grip&#xD;
      strength, on intensity of pain as measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), extent of pain and&#xD;
      global rating of change in patients with lateral epicondylalgia with random assignment to two&#xD;
      treatments: PENS or Sham PENS.&#xD;

    <description>The technique will be performed ultrasound-guided on the radial nerve, the places of the needle's insertions will be the following:&#xD;
Needle will be placed at under the lateral intermuscular septum between the triceps brachii and brachialis, approximately 10cm superior to the lateral epicondyle Needle will be placed at the upper third of the forearm on the posterior interosseous nerve after passing the arcade of Frohse's&#xD;
The percutaneous electrical stimulation will be realized with a transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) current:&#xD;
TENS Frequency 2 Hz TENS Pulse width - 250 microseconds Duration - 30 minutes. TENS Intensity - Increased at an intensity of visible motor response of the innervated musculature and maximal tolerable intensity.&#xD;
Administration - One single session.</description>
