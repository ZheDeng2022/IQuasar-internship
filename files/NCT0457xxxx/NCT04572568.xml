      This study is a multi-center, prospective, registry study. All patients are divided into&#xD;
      experimental group and control group according to treatment modalities. Patients of&#xD;
      experimental group is strictly in accordance with standardized multi-disciplinary treatment&#xD;
      protocols and meet the following criteria: 1. A multi-disciplinary conference discussion; 2.&#xD;
      Detailed preoperative evaluation based on CT, MRI, fMRI and DSA. 3. Treatment modalities meet&#xD;
      the following treatment criteria（craniotomy，embolization and Stereotactic radiosurgery）. The&#xD;
      control group was patients who had not been treated according to a multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient baseline data, AVM angioarchitectural features, surgical information, and follow-up&#xD;
      information were registered. All patients were evaluated for neurofunction at baseline, 24&#xD;
      hours after surgery, and 6 months (For neurosurgery and endovascular therapy) or 3 years (For&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery). Main observation endpoints: 1. Overall cure rate of AVM in&#xD;
      experimental group and control group; 2. Overall complication rate and clinical outcome in&#xD;
      experimental group and control group; 3. AVM bleeding rate and rebleeding rate in&#xD;
      experimental group and control group. Secondary observation endpoint: improvement of clinical&#xD;
      symptoms (epilepsy, headache, neurological dysfunction) at discharge and at last follow-up.&#xD;

      This study is a multi-center, prospective registry study led by Beijing Tiantan Hospital, and&#xD;
      a number of comprehensive hospitals in China, aiming to uncover the treatment result of AVM&#xD;
      in Real-World in China and discover a standard diagnosis and treatment process for the&#xD;
      comprehensive treatment of arteriovenous malformations. This study lasted for 5 years and was&#xD;
      an observational study. All patients were enrolled prospectively, and the study will not&#xD;
      influence the choice of treatment modalities. All the patients clinical baseline data and&#xD;
      imaging data were stored through a cloud server to facilitate the input work at different&#xD;
      locations and at different times. According to different treatment modalities, patients&#xD;
      receive corresponding follow-up procedures. Through the final follow-up data, the differences&#xD;
      in the prognosis of patients under different treatment modalities are compared, and the best&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment modality for arteriovenous malformations is obtained. Patients of&#xD;
      experimental group is discussed at multi-disciplinary conference and must meet the following&#xD;
      standard treatment criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment criteria for craniotomy: 1. For patients with a history of rupture and bleeding: a.&#xD;
      If the lesion is not located in the deep functional area, surgical treatment is recommended;&#xD;
      b. If the lesion is multi-system blood supply or high blood flow, the volume is large, and&#xD;
      with a deep blood supply, hybrid surgery (embolization + resection) can be performed; c. If&#xD;
      the lesion is located in the deep functional area, craniotomy is not recommended. 2. For&#xD;
      patients with unruptured hemorrhage: a. If the lesion is not located in the deep brain&#xD;
      tissue, and is not located in an important functional area or the fiber bundle is more than&#xD;
      5mm away from the lesion, then surgery or combined surgery can be performed; b. If the lesion&#xD;
      is located in the deep brain tissue, important functional areas or fiber bundles are less&#xD;
      than 5mm away from the lesion, craniotomy is not recommended; c. If the lesion does not have&#xD;
      the above characteristics, surgical resection alone can be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional embolization treatment standards: 1. Ruptured bAVM should be actively treated.&#xD;
      If there is no need for craniotomy to clear the hematoma in the acute phase, DSA should be&#xD;
      performed 2-6 weeks after hemorrhage, and individualized treatment plans should be developed&#xD;
      and actively treated. 2. Unruptured bAVM, if there are bleeding-related risk factors&#xD;
      (aneurysm or high-flow fistula), relevant risk factors should be actively treated; When&#xD;
      stereotactic radiation is planned, active treatment is required for volume reduction(10cm3)&#xD;
      when craniotomy was planned, preoperative embolization for flow reduction is recommended; 3.&#xD;
      Unruptured bAVM, without the above risk factors, conservative treatment was suggested if&#xD;
      symptoms could be well controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiosurgery standard treatment: 1. No history of bleeding: Patients with no&#xD;
      indications for craniotomy and with appropriate volume for radiosurgery, and poor symptom&#xD;
      controlled. Pre-treatment imaging assessment DSA (required) and enhanced MRI was required to&#xD;
      clarify the structure of the malformation; 2. There is a history of bleeding: the period&#xD;
      between bleeding time and the time of consultation is less than 3 months, it is recommended&#xD;
      to wait head-enhanced MRI and DSA were performed after the hemorrhage was absorbed (3 months)&#xD;
      to confirm the vascular architecture.&#xD;
