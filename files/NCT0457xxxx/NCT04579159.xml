  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will develop and evaluate pathways to identify participants with&#xD;
      wearable-detected absoulute Arrhythmia (AA) and to enable local study teams to contact them&#xD;
      regarding participation in a controlled trial of oral anticoagulation in this population,&#xD;
      which will be conducted after the feasibility study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the feasibility of evaluating the efficacy of a cloud based analytic service&#xD;
      in combination with a PPG-wearable in detecting AA will be assessed and the number of cases&#xD;
      found. The design aims to provide simple, low-threshold access to this screening technology&#xD;
      targeting at-risk populations. This study will not cause any restrictions on the usual care&#xD;
      of the study participants. Access to the screening will be provided close to home and free of&#xD;
      charge. The app will also be used to validate and enhance the clinical information about the&#xD;
      participants captured during the study. This information will be used to define and refine&#xD;
      target groups with highest screening efficiency and, in the long-term, outcome benefits. The&#xD;
      study will describe the prevalence of AA in an unselected population that can be reached by a&#xD;
      low-threshold screening procedure. The study will also generate important information on the&#xD;
      different possible screening environments in different countries (e.g. pharmacies, GP&#xD;
      practices, etc). Structures of work-up and continuous patient management in screen-positive&#xD;
      individuals will be described and may help to design screening pathways in the main trial. By&#xD;
      verifying the wearable-diagnoses by ECG in all screen-positive and a random selection of&#xD;
      screen-negative participants, the diagnostic accuracy of the wearable in combination of cloud&#xD;
      based analytic service can be estimated. Cost effectiveness assessment will evaluate the cost&#xD;
      of low-threshold remote screening per patient identified and help guide to target high risk&#xD;
      groups with optimal screening yield in the future. The collected data will provide the sound&#xD;
      basis for the design and conduct of a large outcome trial.&#xD;
