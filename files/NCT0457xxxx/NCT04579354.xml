  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and apprehension are common among patients prior to surgery. This anxiety can lead to&#xD;
      additional discomfort, increased pain sensation and increased stress symptoms. Virtual&#xD;
      exposure has proven to be successful in exposure therapy for the treatment of the narrowest&#xD;
      patients. Patients are not confronted with the real stimuli or situations that trigger the&#xD;
      branches, but with virtual representations of them. Virtual reality (VR) makes it possible to&#xD;
      create scenarios that would not be possible in reality because of the organisational, time or&#xD;
      financial expenditure involved.The effectiveness of virtual stimulus exposure is well&#xD;
      documented, especially in the case of object or situation-related fears in the context of&#xD;
      specific phobias. It is therefore obvious that virtual stimulus exposure could also be&#xD;
      suitable for minimising operation-associated fears.The research project described is designed&#xD;
      to investigate the effect of virtual stimulus exposure on perioperative anxiety. For this&#xD;
      purpose, a virtual tour of the operating setting has been created, which enables patients to&#xD;
      explore the surroundings in detail by means of VR glasses.&#xD;
