  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the MAST trial is to define best practice in the use of anti-epileptic&#xD;
      drugs (AEDs) for patients following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The trial will consist of&#xD;
      two parts. The first part aims to answer whether a shorter or a longer course of AEDs is&#xD;
      better to prevent further seizures in patients who have started having seizures following TBI&#xD;
      (MAST - duration). The second part aims to answer whether a 7-day course of either Phenytoin&#xD;
      or Levetiracetam should be used for patients with a serious TBI to prevent seizures from&#xD;
      starting (MAST- prophylaxis).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients who suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) do not need to stay in&#xD;
      hospital overnight. However, some require admission to a specialist hospital, as their injury&#xD;
      is more serious. Seizures can be harmful or even fatal, if not treated appropriately.&#xD;
      Medications that reduce the risk of seizures are called antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). However,&#xD;
      AEDs have side effects, which can affect patients' quality of life, memory, concentration and&#xD;
      general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with seizures after TBI are typically prescribed an AED to prevent further seizures,&#xD;
      most commonly Phenytoin or Levetiracetam. Some doctors favour a short course, whereas others&#xD;
      favour a longer course. The first part of the trial aims to answer if one approach is better&#xD;
      than the other (MAST-duration). The second part of the trial aims to answer if a 7-day course&#xD;
      of either Phenytoin or Levetiracetam should be used for patients with a serious TBI to&#xD;
      prevent seizures from happening (MAST- prophylaxis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted to a neurosurgical unit (NSU) within the UK, with a serious TBI, will&#xD;
      be considered for the trial. Patients who have been started on either Phenytoin or&#xD;
      Levetiracteam by their clinical team due to seizures will be randomised to either up to 3&#xD;
      months or at least 6 months of treatment. In an independent, parallel trial, TBI patients who&#xD;
      have not had a seizure will be randomised to phenytoin, levetiracetam or no treatment. All&#xD;
      patients will be managed as per usual NHS practice and followed up for 24 months.&#xD;
