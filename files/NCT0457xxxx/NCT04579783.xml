      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most prevalent peripheral nerve entrapment of upper limb.&#xD;
      Typical symptoms comprise pain, numbness or tingling of the thumb and index, middle or ring&#xD;
      fingers. Thumb weakness and decreased grip strength can occur in the later stage. Currently&#xD;
      treatments included physical modalities (low power laser, transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation, ultrasound), medication, splinting, injection and surgery. Ultrasound guided&#xD;
      intracarpal hydro-dissection of median nerve had been proposed based on its accurate&#xD;
      localization, while the injectates were diverse. Corticosteroid has been widely used for CTS&#xD;
      for decades. However, growing evidences suggested that 5% dextrose, normal saline, platelet&#xD;
      rich plasma injection also have therapeutic effects on alleviating CTS symptoms. Among the&#xD;
      injectates, a single 5% dextrose injection could be considered as a substitute of&#xD;
      corticosteroid based on its long term effect up to six months. However, the clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of 5% dextrose injection has not validated by the further study. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      compare the therapeutic effect of 5% dextrose injection with corticosteroid injection in&#xD;
      patients with CTS, up to 12 weeks follow up.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most prevalent peripheral nerve entrapment of upper limb.&#xD;
      Typical symptoms comprise pain, numbness or tingling of the thumb and index, middle or ring&#xD;
      fingers. Thumb weakness and decreased grip strength can occur in the later stage. Currently&#xD;
      treatments included physical modalities (low power laser, transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation, ultrasound), medication, splinting, injection and surgery. Ultrasound guided&#xD;
      intracarpal hydro-dissection of median nerve had been proposed based on its accurate&#xD;
      localization, while the injectates were diverse. Corticosteroid has been widely used for CTS&#xD;
      for decades. However, growing evidences suggested that 5% dextrose, normal saline, platelet&#xD;
      rich plasma injection also have therapeutic effects on alleviating CTS symptoms. Among the&#xD;
      injectates, a single 5% dextrose injection could be considered as a substitute of&#xD;
      corticosteroid based on its long term effect up to six months. However, the clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of 5% dextrose injection has not validated by the further study. Whether repeated injection&#xD;
      could expand the treatment effect was undetermined. The investigators aim to compare the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect repeated 5% dextrose injection with corticosteroid injection in patients&#xD;
      with CTS, up to 12 weeks follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 60 adult patients (&gt;20 year olds) with carpal tunnel syndrome, recruited from&#xD;
      outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Presenting with CTS symptoms, including nocturnal, postural, or&#xD;
      motion-associated paresthesias +/- pain of the median nerve distribution area in the&#xD;
      subjective hand. Confirmed Electrophysiological confirmed median neuropathy at the wrist with&#xD;
      mild to moderate degree. Persistent symptoms for more than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Patients cervical radiculopathy, polyneuropathy, brachial plexopathy,&#xD;
      thoracic outlet syndrome. Recent corticosteroid injection to the carpal tunnel within 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thenar muscle atrophy. Previous history of carpal tunnel surgical release. History of wrist&#xD;
      trauma. Regular use of systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids or&#xD;
      diuretics. Pregnancy. Cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the treatment effect of repeated 5 mL 5% dextrose with&#xD;
      5mL triamcinolone acetonide injection in patients with CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detail of the intervention The study is designated as randomized, double blinded, and&#xD;
      parallel experiment. The randomization was decided by random table in block of 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated ultrasound guided injection intracarpal median nerve hydro-dissection with 5 mL 5%&#xD;
      dextrose (Group B) or 5mL triamcinolone acetonide injection (Group A) in patients with CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regimen was shown as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: 1st injection (0 week): 40mg triamcinolone acetonide (40mg/mL) with 4mL normal&#xD;
      saline, 2nd injection (6 week): 5 mL normal saline Group B: 1st injection (0 week): 5 mL 5%&#xD;
      dextrose, 2nd injection (6 week): 5 mL 5% dextrose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin infiltration with local anesthetic (lidocaine cream) at the needle insertion site was&#xD;
      performed before the injection. Then injection was performed after sterilization. The&#xD;
      equipment for ultrasound-guided injection will be high-resolution ultrasound machine with the&#xD;
      linear probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) and Visual analogue scale (VAS) before 1st&#xD;
      injection, before 2nd injection (6-week) and 12-week after first injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrophysiological evaluation (amplitude and distal latency of median nerve compound motor&#xD;
      action potential and sensory nerve action potential); cross-sectional area of median nerve at&#xD;
      carpal tunnel inlet, were evaluated before and 12-week after 1st injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global assessment of treatment was evaluated at before 2nd injection (6-week) and 12-week&#xD;
      after first injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables Student's t test: fit assumption of normal distribution Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      test: does not fit the assumption of normal distribution Categorical variables (1) Chi-square&#xD;
      test (2) Fisher exact test: sparse data (3)Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was&#xD;
      used to evaluate the effect of injection with post-hoc Bonferroni test to evaluate&#xD;
      intra-group data at different time-frame&#xD;
