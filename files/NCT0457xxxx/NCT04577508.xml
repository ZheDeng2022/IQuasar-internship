  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade several evidences show that cognitive impairment is a major feature of&#xD;
      bipolar disorder (BD), that is strongly associated with patients' functional outcome. The&#xD;
      most affected cognitive domains in BD are attention, memory and executive functions. BD&#xD;
      represents a mental illness of considerable therapeutic complexity and the fight against&#xD;
      cognitive and functional deterioration have contributed to increase the interest in the&#xD;
      development of specific therapeutic strategies.There is the need of new non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions in BD in order to improve not only affective symptoms, but also cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunctions, with the final goal to achieve full functional recovery. The present study is&#xD;
      focused on Functional Remediation (FR), a novel group intervention created by the Bipolar&#xD;
      Disorder Unit of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona and designed specifically for bipolar&#xD;
      patients, based on a neuro-cognitive-behavioural approach. It involves neurocognitive and&#xD;
      psychoeducation techniques (21 weekly sessions). The present study aims to assess FR efficacy&#xD;
      in improving cognitive deficits and psychosocial functioning in a sample of euthymic patients&#xD;
      with BD, compared to standard treatment (TAU). This is a randomized and rater-blind trial,&#xD;
      involving 54 adult out-patients diagnosed with BD I or II (DSM-5 criteria) and clinically&#xD;
      stable for at least two months. Patients will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment and&#xD;
      6-months follow-up, on validated cognitive, clinical and functional rating scales. The main&#xD;
      result expected is that patients receiving FR will show better cognitive and psychosocial&#xD;
      performance, further confirming the preliminary evidence on the utility of FR as an element&#xD;
      of standard care for BD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this randomized, rater-blind controlled trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of Functional Remediation (FR) in improving functional, clinical and cognitive&#xD;
      outcomes in euthymic and clinically stable patients with Bipolar Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FR is a novel group-based intervention, based on a neurocognitive-behavioural approach,&#xD;
      making use of ecological techniques, specifically developed for patients with Bipolar&#xD;
      Disorder and aimed at restoring psychosocial functioning in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve subjects recruited from outpatient clinics (residential or&#xD;
      semi-residential care) within the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services of ASST&#xD;
      Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be assigned via central randomization to either FR or treatment as&#xD;
      usual, the latter consisting of evidence-based drug treatment and case management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatment will be maintained stable during the course of the trial, but no&#xD;
      restriction will be applied in terms of access to evidence-based non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of the study intervention (lasting 6 months) will be assessed at post-treatment, and&#xD;
      later investigated at 6-months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. It will take place within an experimental project&#xD;
      related to the &quot;PhD Course in Biomedical Sciences and Translational Medicine&quot;, curriculum&#xD;
      &quot;Neuroscience&quot; of the University of Brescia, Italy.&#xD;

    <description>Functional Remediation is a manualized, group-based psychosocial intervention built on a neurocognitive-behavioural approach, involving modeling techniques, role-playing tasks, self-instruction, positive reinforcement and metacognitive cues (Vieta E et al, Cambridge University Press, 2014). It consists of 21 90-min weekly sessions, in which a trained therapist and co-therapist work with 10-12 patients: the first 3 sessions are dedicated to psychoeducation on neurocognitive deficits; then 13 sessions of neurocognitive training sequentially target attention, memory and executive functions domains, comprising exercises carried out individually, in pairs or in small groups; the last 5 sessions focus on skills training (communication, interpersonal relationships, autonomy, stress management). Content of the sessions involves ecological tasks adapted to real-world situations, and to-be-performed in two contexts (clinical and daily). Homework is assigned, collected and discussed each time.</description>
