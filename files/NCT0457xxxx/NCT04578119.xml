    <textblock>
      In the case of tracheal intubation using a video laryngoscope, both techniques, one is&#xD;
      'conventional technique' in which intubation is performed by placing the blade tip on the&#xD;
      vallecula and the other is 'sliding technique' performed by sliding the blade under the&#xD;
      epiglottis, are commonly conducted by anesthesiologists. Investigators would like to compare&#xD;
      if the sliding technique can improve the condition of tracheal intubation in patients wearing&#xD;
      semi-rigid neck collars in cervical spine surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients who need to limit the movement of the cervical spine, the tracheal intubation&#xD;
      becomes difficult because the head must be positioned in the neutral position. Most of all,&#xD;
      with a semi-rigid neck collar that maintains the neutral position of the head and neck,&#xD;
      movement is limited and the mouth is not well-opened make the environment of tracheal&#xD;
      intubation worse, which result in hypoxia or throat complications related to general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Fortunately, it is possible that the development of video laryngoscope assists&#xD;
      tracheal intubation easier for patients who have the limited movement of the cervical spine.&#xD;
      However, the preferred intubation style and instrument selection for each operator are&#xD;
      varied; the established method is required. In the case of tracheal intubation using a video&#xD;
      laryngoscope, both techniques, one is 'conventional technique' in which intubation is&#xD;
      performed by placing the blade tip on the vallecula and the other is 'sliding technique'&#xD;
      performed by sliding the blade under the epiglottis, are commonly conducted by&#xD;
      anesthesiologists. Investigators would like to compare if the sliding technique can improve&#xD;
      the condition of tracheal intubation in patients wearing semi-rigid neck collars in cervical&#xD;
      spine surgery.&#xD;
