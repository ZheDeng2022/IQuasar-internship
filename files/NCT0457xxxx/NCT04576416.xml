      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The worldwide incidence of skin cancer has been rising for 50 years, in particular the&#xD;
      incidence of malignant melanoma has increased approx. 2-7% annually and is the most common&#xD;
      cancer amongst Danes aged 15-34. Currently there is a significant amount of misdiagnosis of&#xD;
      skin cancer and mole cancer. Our aim is to improve general practitioners' diagnostic skills&#xD;
      and accuracy of skin and mole cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a population of Danish General Practitioners (GPs) what is the dose/response effect of&#xD;
      hours spent with an educational platform that offers AI augmented training and clinical&#xD;
      feedback on their diagnostic accuracy and accurate clinical management (treatment, dismissal,&#xD;
      referral)? Does access to an educational platform that offers AI augmented training and&#xD;
      clinical feedback increase the number of malignant skin lesions referred by Danish GPs&#xD;
      without simultaneously increasing the number of incorrect benign referrals? Can the&#xD;
      participating GPs clinical accuracy be predicted from the MCQ-score by comparing their quiz&#xD;
      answers and diagnostic accuracy on their registered lesions with their score on the MCQ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      90 Danish GPs will at baseline, 1 month and end of trial answer a Multiple Choice&#xD;
      Questionnaire (MCQ). There is no change to current clinical practice, but all participating&#xD;
      doctors will be asked to register a clinical picture and a dermoscopic image as well as basic&#xD;
      information about the lesion and patient (age, gender, location and diagnosis) of all skin&#xD;
      lesions examined due to a suspicion for non-melanoma or melanoma skin cancer, raised by the&#xD;
      GP or patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs in the intervention group are besides the registration application (R-app) given access&#xD;
      to an AI augmented training and clinical feedback through an educational smartphone app&#xD;
      (E-app). Within the E-app the doctor can access quizzes on a library of 10,000+ skin lesions,&#xD;
      written articles about the 40 most common skin lesions, and a clinical feedback module that&#xD;
      gives the GP feedback on their registered skin lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback on skin lesions with the registered clinical management of referred/excised/biopsied&#xD;
      will be provided continuously by independent experts in skin cancer diagnostics (&gt;10 years of&#xD;
      experience) through a web-based review system developed by our group. Feedback on the&#xD;
      remaining registered cases are withheld until the end of the study period. This is done to&#xD;
      simulate a realistic clinical setting during the study.&#xD;

      Statistics and Results Using data from the E-app, scores on the MCQs and the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of the GP's a dose/response relationship is calculated, in order to answer the&#xD;
      research questions posed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of this project is to investigate the dose/response effect on GPs' proficiency&#xD;
      from AI augmented training and clinical feedback in skin cancer diagnostics. This project&#xD;
      will examine how much training is needed before the GPs' ability to diagnose and correctly&#xD;
      refer skin cancer is affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions In a population of Danish GPs what is the dose/response effect of hours&#xD;
      spent with an educational platform that offers AI augmented training and clinical feedback on&#xD;
      their diagnostic accuracy and accurate clinical management (treatment, dismissal, referral)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does access to an educational platform that offers AI augmented training and clinical&#xD;
      feedback increase the number of malignant skin lesions referred by Danish general&#xD;
      practitioners without simultaneously increasing the number of incorrect benign referrals? Can&#xD;
      the participating GPs clinical accuracy be predicted from the MCQ-score by comparing their&#xD;
      quiz answers and diagnostic accuracy on their registered lesions with their score on the MCQ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This stratified superiority RCT will include 90 GPs in Denmark. The study period is&#xD;
      five months. Three months of active intervention, then two months of post intervention&#xD;
      observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating GPs must give signed consent before receiving a short introductory course&#xD;
      regarding the use of hard- and software. They are then asked to complete a short&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding the use of the platform as well as completing a proficiency test&#xD;
      using a multiple choice questionnaire (MCQ) at baseline and again after 1 and 3. The MCQ&#xD;
      consists of 12 skin lesion cases randomly sampled from a test library developed and validated&#xD;
      by our research group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification and randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be stratified based on gender, results on the pre-test, age, type&#xD;
      of clinic and self-reported years of experience diagnosing skin lesions, before being&#xD;
      randomized (allocation ratio 3:1) into either the intervention or control group. Intervention&#xD;
      All participating doctors will be asked to register all skin lesions examined due to a&#xD;
      suspicion for non-melanoma or melanoma skin cancer, raised by the GP or patient, throughout&#xD;
      the study period (Figure 2). Skin lesions will be registered using the R-app that enables&#xD;
      photo acquisition and registration of: patient social security number (CPR), location of&#xD;
      lesion, tentative diagnosis and chosen clinical action (referral, excision, monitoring, none)&#xD;
      ect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of AI augmented training and clinical feedback through an&#xD;
      educational smartphone app (E-app), whilst the control group registers the lesions but&#xD;
      otherwise continues its standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The E-app has two modules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training module includes AI enhanced case training on a library of 10,000+ benign and&#xD;
      malignant skin lesion cases each coupled to written learning modules. Clinical feedback&#xD;
      module gives the user diagnostic feedback on all cases registered in the registration module.&#xD;
      Feedback during the trial will be based on either histopathology or the consensus agreement&#xD;
      of domain experts (if no biopsy is taken). Feedback on referred or dismissed skin lesions&#xD;
      will be provided by independent experts in skin cancer diagnostics ( &gt;10 years of experience)&#xD;
      through a web-based review system developed by our group. Statistics The mean improvement in&#xD;
      clinical and MCQ-tested diagnostic accuracy measured will be compared between intervention&#xD;
      and control groups using independent t-tests. Clinical accuracy will be determined using&#xD;
      histopathology and/or expert consensus as gold standard. Both per-protocol and Intention To&#xD;
      Treat analysis will be calculated in order to elucidate potentially missed differences and to&#xD;
      allow readers to interpret the effect of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and Sample Size To our knowledge there is no data within the literature that describes&#xD;
      the typical number of skin lesions seen by a Danish GP. Based on estimates from clinical&#xD;
      experience roughly eight patients are seen by each GP per week with skin lesions suspected of&#xD;
      skin cancer. With 90 GPs registering 90% of all lesions this amounts to 8.417 skin lesions&#xD;
      registered during the three months. However, the ratio of benign to malignant skin lesions&#xD;
      (BMR) referred or removed by GPs is typically somewhere between 10-29:1. Specialised centers&#xD;
      in the UK have reported that it is possible to achieve accurate melanoma diagnostics with a&#xD;
      BMR of 1.74-6.3:1, based on clinical evaluation aided by dermatoscopy alone. Based on these&#xD;
      numbers an effect size of Cohen's d = 0.5-0.8 is realistic. This would require around 25-40&#xD;
      GPs in each group to achieve a minimum 80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Patient participation contains no immediate strain or discomfort for&#xD;
      the patient, and no change to current clinical practise, as dermoscopic evaluation is part of&#xD;
      the clinical examination of skin lesions. The images captured are stored safely and&#xD;
      anonymously with no risk for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients receive current standard of practice or an additional&#xD;
      teledermatological evaluation of their skin lesions, giving them an expert opinion rather&#xD;
      than only the opinion of their GP, in cases where patients are not referred to a&#xD;
      dermatologist. A setup with minimal discomfort for the patient and the evaluation of their&#xD;
      skin lesions by an expert justifies the participation of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the current low diagnostic accuracy of GP's the educational nature of the intervention&#xD;
      justifies the study for the sake of all future patients with skin lesions that are less&#xD;
      likely to be misdiagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational interventions on doctors do not require approval by The National Committee on&#xD;
      Health Research Ethics in Denmark. However, a waiver has been obtained from the The Committee&#xD;
      on Health Research Ethics in the Capital Region of Denmark (case number H-20059977) and&#xD;
      ethical considerations have been made and the project is in concordance with the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration II.&#xD;
