  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle stiffness is associated with a variety of variables that affect health, however there&#xD;
      is limited research on the effect of massage on muscle stiffness, and existing research does&#xD;
      not quantify the intensity of massage. Thus trial will determine the effect of roller massage&#xD;
      on quadriceps muscle stiffness and passive range of motion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following screening for eligibility and consent, subjects will be assigned randomly to one of&#xD;
      three groups: a placebo control group and two roller massage groups (treatment groups). The&#xD;
      treatment groups will each receive a single bout of roller massage. One treatment group will&#xD;
      receive a massage at medium intensity (25 newtons of force directed perpendicular to surface&#xD;
      of thigh), the other treatment group at high intensity (45 newtons of force directed&#xD;
      perpendicular to surface of thigh). The placebo group will receive a single bout of sham&#xD;
      ultrasound. Both placebo and treatments will be delivered to the anterior thigh with the&#xD;
      participant in a supine position. Each procedure will last for 10 minutes. In all groups,&#xD;
      muscle stiffness, natural oscillation frequency, elasticity, relaxation time, and creep at&#xD;
      the vastus lateralis will be measured using a myotonometer. PROM for knee flexion will also&#xD;
      be measured in both groups using goniometry. All measurements will be taken at 3 different&#xD;
      times: immediately before treatment or placebo, immediately after treatment or placebo, and&#xD;
      30 minutes after treatment or placebo. Myotonometric measurements of the vastus lateralis&#xD;
      will be taken 2/3 of the way down between the anterior superior iliac spine and lateral&#xD;
      aspect of the patella, in accordance with guidelines for the Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the&#xD;
      Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles. For goniometric measurement, participants will be in&#xD;
      supine position on an examination table. The investigator will flex the participant's hip to&#xD;
      90 degrees and then, using a dynamometer (to ensure consistent applied force for all&#xD;
      participants), flex the participant's knee. To measure knee flexion PROM, the goniometer will&#xD;
      be positioned with the axis at the lateral epicondyle of the femur, the stationary arm in&#xD;
      line with the lateral midline of the femur toward the greater trochanter, and the moving arm&#xD;
      in line with the fibular head and lateral malleolus. During the time between the second and&#xD;
      third measurements, subjects will be asked to sit quietly.&#xD;
