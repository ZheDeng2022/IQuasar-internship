  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thymoma is the most common primary tumor of the anterior mediastinum. Complete surgical&#xD;
      resection is the mainstay of treatment of these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The staging and histological classification of thymoma is still a matter of discussion.&#xD;
      Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan parameters that correlate with histology, stage&#xD;
      and prognosis also still have to be completely assessed. The aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the potential association between clinical, radiologic and pathologic characteristics in&#xD;
      patients submitted to surgical treatment for thymoma, assessing their prognostic value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of patients submitted to surgical resection for pathologically proven thymoma at our&#xD;
      Department of Thoracic Surgery between January 2005 and December 2015 will be retrospectively&#xD;
      reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation of preoperative CT scan features, histological and pathological&#xD;
      characteristics of thymomas will be evaluated, assessing the prognostic role of these&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Rationale: Even though the World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification&#xD;
           and Masaoka-Koga staging system are currently the most widely used, some studies have&#xD;
           validated alternative pathologic classifications, as the one proposed by Suster and&#xD;
           Moran. Following the proposals of a working group of the International Thymic&#xD;
           Malignancies Interest Group (ITMIG) and the International Association for the Study of&#xD;
           Lung Cancer (IASLC), a new staging system for thymic epithelial tumors has been included&#xD;
           in the last Tumor Node Metastases (TNM) cancer staging system revision. TNM staging has&#xD;
           been shown to have a stronger correlation with disease-free survival (DFS) analysis in&#xD;
           comparison with the Masaoka-Koga staging system. Moreover, many studies sustained the&#xD;
           role of preoperative CT-scan in predicting the pathologic features of thymic tumors. In&#xD;
           this context, the potential association between clinical-radiological features and&#xD;
           histo-pathological appearance may therefore provide a more accurate prognostic&#xD;
           stratification in patients with thymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Targets: The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential association between&#xD;
           clinical, radiologic and pathologic characteristics in patients submitted to surgical&#xD;
           treatment for thymoma, and their prognostic value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design of the study and parameters: Data about the patients submitted to surgical&#xD;
           resection for pathologically proven thymoma at our Department of Thoracic Surgery&#xD;
           between January 2005 and December 2015 will be retrospectively reviewed. Patients&#xD;
           enrolled in the study will undergo a follow up until the date of death, and not later&#xD;
           than March 31th, 2020. The following data will be entered in a prospective database:&#xD;
           age, gender, presence of myasthenia gravis, neoadjuvant therapy, date of operation,&#xD;
           surgical access (median sternotomy, thoracotomy or VATS), tumor histology according to&#xD;
           WHO classification revised in 2015, Masaoka-Koga staging, adjuvant chemotherapy or&#xD;
           radiotherapy, recurrence-free and overall survival, and cause of death. All&#xD;
           histopathologic reports will be reviewed. Histology of each case will be reclassified&#xD;
           according to the proposed Suster and Moran classification . Moreover, Masaoka stages&#xD;
           will be reclassified according to the newly proposed IASLC/ITMIG TNM staging system.&#xD;
           Preoperative CT scans will be reviewed. The following features will be evaluated using a&#xD;
           dedicated software (Philips Intellispace): location, 2-axes diameters, volume, shape,&#xD;
           presence of necrosis, calcifications, or lymphoadenopathy, presence and length of&#xD;
           pleural contact, presence of pleural effusion or dissemination, pericardial effusion,&#xD;
           invasion of mediastinal fat, great mediastinal vessels, pericardium or lung, and&#xD;
           contrast-enhancement pattern. The association between clinical, radiological and&#xD;
           pathologic features and survival will be analyzed to identify possible prognostic&#xD;
           factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histopathological and staging review: all histopathological reports will be reviewed.&#xD;
           Histology of each tumor will be classified according to the 2015 WHO classification and&#xD;
           re-classified according to the classification proposed by Suster and Moran as follows:&#xD;
           A, AB, B1 and B2 thymomas will be re-classified as well-differentiated thymic neoplasms&#xD;
           (or typical thymoma); B3 tumors will be re-classified as moderately-differentiated&#xD;
           thymic neoplasms (or atypical thymoma). Tumors will be staged according both to the&#xD;
           Masaoka-Koga and the 8th edition of the IASLC/ITMIG TNM staging system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan features and image interpretation: All patients will be sumbitted to chest CT&#xD;
           scan before surgery. CT scans will be reviewed by two radiologists, expert in thoracic&#xD;
           oncology. Differences will be resolved by consensus. The following features will be&#xD;
           evaluated using a dedicated software (Philips Intellispace): location of the tumor,&#xD;
           2-axes diameters, volume, shape, presence of necrosis, calcifications, pathological&#xD;
           lymph nodes, presence and length of pleural contact, presence of pleural effusion or&#xD;
           dissemination, pericardial effusion, invasion of mediastinal fat, great vessels,&#xD;
           pericardium or lung, and contrast-enhancement pattern. Location of the tumor will be&#xD;
           classified as right, left, or median according to the site of the intersection of the&#xD;
           two main diameters of the lesion. The size of the lesion will be defined as the length&#xD;
           of the largest of the three lesion diameters. Tumor volume will be calculated with the&#xD;
           dedicated software after the identification of the borders of the lesion. Shape and&#xD;
           contours will be defined as regular or irregular. A contrast-enhancement pattern will be&#xD;
           assessed in the images obtained 30 seconds after contrast medium injection, and&#xD;
           described as homogeneous or heterogeneous. Necrosis will be defined as an area without&#xD;
           contrast-enhancement or low-density value comparable to water. A short-axis diameter of&#xD;
           ≥ 1 cm will be used as the threshold for pathological lymph-nodes. Length of pleural&#xD;
           contact will be measured with multiple lines along all the borders of the lesion in&#xD;
           contact with the mediastinal pleura. Invasion of the mediastinal fat will be established&#xD;
           in case of disomogeneity, ill-definition and hypodensity. Contact with great vessels&#xD;
           will be reported whenever clear distinction of margins was not possible. Lung invasion&#xD;
           will be documented when the border between the tumor and the lung was markedly irregular&#xD;
           and/or the lung was compressed and pinched by the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data management: The authorized staff of the Thoracic Surgery Department will acquire&#xD;
           data from the institutional electronic dossier at IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele. All data&#xD;
           will be protected from unauthorized access. Data will be archived in an electronic&#xD;
           database (Microsoft Excel) in pseudo-anonymous form, and patients enrolled in the study&#xD;
           will be identified with a progressive number code.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size: We identified 50 patients who can potentially be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures: The patients enrolled in the study gave a&#xD;
           standard informed consent, and underwent routine preoperative workup (contrast enhanced&#xD;
           chest CT-scan, FDG-PET scan, pulmonary function tests, blood tests) and surgical&#xD;
           treatment for thymoma following international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethic evaluation: The study will be conducted following ethical principles of the&#xD;
           Declaration of Helsinki and the current legislation on observational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Declaration on the management of patient's consent: All the patients who will be&#xD;
           considered for this study have been staged and surgically treated following&#xD;
           international guidelines. In addition, all patients provided standard informed consent&#xD;
           to the planned therapy prior to surgery. In accordance with the Privacy Regulation, we&#xD;
           wrote a specific informed consent form for the enrollment in this study, and all&#xD;
           patients will be required to fill it out. However, considering the long follow-up (up to&#xD;
           over 10 years), it is likely that some subjects have already died. The collection and&#xD;
           analysis of data for this retrospective observational study does not involve physical,&#xD;
           psychic and social risks towards enrolled patients. Nevertheless, reasonable efforts&#xD;
           will be made to re-contact patients who are still alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Internal organization and statistical analysis: This research will be carried out by the&#xD;
           authorized staff of the Department of Thoracic Surgery involved in the study. The final&#xD;
           analysis will be responsibility of the PI. Analysis was performed with the SPSS, v. 18&#xD;
           software (Chicago, IL, USA). In order to evaluate the association between clinical&#xD;
           variables, histopathology and radiologic features, and their prognostic value,&#xD;
           continuous variables will be dichotomized according to their median value. Comparisons&#xD;
           of categorical variables among the groups of patients will be performed by means of&#xD;
           either Chi-square test or Fisher Exact test as appropriate. Survival curves will be&#xD;
           estimated by the Kaplan and Meier method. Cox regression analysis will be used to assess&#xD;
           the risks of the variables. Survival rates of patients grouped according to selected&#xD;
           variables will be compared by means of the log-rank test. On the univariate analysis&#xD;
           basis, in order to evaluate the independent contribution of the variables on&#xD;
           recurrence-free and overall survival, a multivariate analysis will be performed using&#xD;
           the Cox regression method. The analysis of the retrospective data will be based on the&#xD;
           consultation of the institutional electronic archive (Galileo). The visualization of the&#xD;
           images (CT scan) will take place using using a dedicated software (Philips Intellispace)&#xD;
           available on the workstations of the Radiology Department. A duration of approximately&#xD;
           30 days for the completion of the study is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Privacy: The PI and Ospedale San Raffaele own the data and results of the study, which&#xD;
           will constitute the material for scientific publications. In these works data will be&#xD;
           reported anonymously.&#xD;
