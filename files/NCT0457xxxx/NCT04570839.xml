      This is a phase 1/2 open label sequential dose escalation and cohort expansion study&#xD;
      evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary antitumor activity of COM701 in&#xD;
      combination with BMS-986207 and nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1/2 study evaluates the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary&#xD;
      antitumor activity of COM701 an inhibitor of poliovirus receptor related immunoglobulin&#xD;
      domain containing (PVRIG) in combination with BMS-986207 (an inhibitor of TIGIT) and&#xD;
      nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study will consist of 2 parts (part 1 -&#xD;
      dose escalation and part 2 - dose expansion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: escalating doses of COM701 will be combined with fixed doses of BMS-986207 and&#xD;
      nivolumab. Upon completion of dose escalation a recommended dose of COM701 in combination&#xD;
      with BMS-986207 and nivolumab (3-drug combination) will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: subjects will be administered the recommended dose of COM701 in combination with&#xD;
      BMS-986207 and nivolumab. Subjects will be enrolled into one of three cohorts based on their&#xD;
      cancer type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: subjects with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancer will receive study treatment with the 3-drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: subjects with MSS- endometrial cancer will receive study treatment with the 3-drug&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3 (Basket cohort): subjects with tumors that have high expression of a biomarker&#xD;
      (PVRL2) will receive study treatment with the 3-drug combination. Subjects with tumor types&#xD;
      in cohorts 1, 2 and 4 will not be enrolled into this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 4: subjects with HNSCC. This cohort will enroll subjects who have received treatment&#xD;
      with an immune checkpoint inhibitor or subjects who have received treatment with chemotherapy&#xD;
      but not an immune checkpoint inhibitor. All subjects enrolled in this cohort will receive&#xD;
      study treatment with the 3-drug combination.&#xD;
