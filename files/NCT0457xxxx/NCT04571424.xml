  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) dose of dapirolizumab pegol (DZP) in Japanese healthy study participants&#xD;
      compared with those of Caucasian healthy study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) of a single&#xD;
      IV dose of DZP in Japanese and Caucasian healthy study participants, to evaluate ethnic&#xD;
      sensitivity on the PK of DZP between body weight- and gender-matched Japanese and Caucasian&#xD;
      healthy study participants and to evaluate the immunogenicity of a single IV dose of DZP in&#xD;
      Japanese and Caucasian healthy study participants.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, places the participant at immediate risk of death, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a birth defect.</description>
