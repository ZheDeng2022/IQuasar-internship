  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is among the most common of all chronic liver diseases. HCV&#xD;
      predominantly affects liver cells and causes the liver to become inflamed and damaged. This&#xD;
      can lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver cancer or the need for liver transplant.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate how effective glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) is in participants&#xD;
      with chronic HCV infection. Effectiveness will be assessed as the achievement of sustained&#xD;
      virologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLE/PIB is an approved drug for the treatment of HCV. Participants 12 years or older with&#xD;
      chronic HCV infection will be enrolled. This is a prospective (conducted in future) study in&#xD;
      therapy of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment-experienced participants with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C genotype 1. Around 67 participants will be enrolled at multiple sites in Russian&#xD;
      Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive oral GLE/PIB tablets as prescribed by the physician in accordance&#xD;
      with local clinical practice, international guidelines and/or label. Prescription is&#xD;
      independent from this study and is decided before providing opportunity to the participate in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is expected to be no additional burden for participants in this trial. All study visits&#xD;
      will occur during routine clinical practice and participants will be followed for 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>SVR12 is defined as hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; 50 IU/ml or lower limit of quantification/detection (LLoQ/D) available at the site at Week 12 after the last actual dose.</description>

    <description>SVR12 is defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLoQ/D 12 weeks after the last actual dose of GLE/PIB with a sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) available in the clinical site in the settings of the Russian Federation in subgroups of interest.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 12 after the end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study drug overall and in subgroups of interest. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.</description>
