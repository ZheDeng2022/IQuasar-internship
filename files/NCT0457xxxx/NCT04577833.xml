  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relative bioavailability (rBA; Period 1) and&#xD;
      bioequivalence (BE; Period 2 and 3) of various strengths and formulations of niraparib and&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate (AA) at steady state under modified fasted conditions in participants&#xD;
      with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Niraparib is an orally available, highly selective poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose)&#xD;
      polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, with potent activity against PARP-1 and PARP-2 deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA)-repair polymerases. AA is a pro-drug of abiraterone which selectively inhibits the&#xD;
      enzyme 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17), that is found in the testes and adrenals&#xD;
      (leading to systemic inhibition of testosterone production), as well as in prostate tissues&#xD;
      and tumors. The rationale of the study is to investigate the various strengths and&#xD;
      formulations of niraparib and AA plus prednisone or prednisolone (P) in metastatic castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) participants with and without homologous recombination&#xD;
      repair (HRR) gene alterations. In participants with metastatic prostate cancer, DNA-repair&#xD;
      anomalies are found in approximately 15 percent (%) to 20% of tumors. This study consists 4&#xD;
      periods: screening phase (up to 21 days); treatment phase (up to 22 days); extension phase&#xD;
      (from day 23 until discontinuation); and post-treatment follow up phase (end of treatment&#xD;
      [EoT] visit within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment). Total duration of study&#xD;
      is up to 1.4 years. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biomarkers will be assessed&#xD;
      at specified time points during this study. Participants safety will be monitored throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
