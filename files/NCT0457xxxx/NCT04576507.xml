  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a significant public health concern in the U.S., for which prescription&#xD;
      opioids have historically been the standard treatment. This has resulted in striking rates of&#xD;
      opioid use disorders and fatal overdoses. Identifying non-opioid medications for the&#xD;
      management of chronic pain with minimal abuse liability is a public health necessity, and&#xD;
      cannabinoids are a promising drug class for this purpose. More than 80% of medicinal cannabis&#xD;
      users report pain as their primary medical indication. These patients tend to seek products&#xD;
      that are low in delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; the primary psychoactive, and thus&#xD;
      intoxicating, component of cannabis), and high in cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid that&#xD;
      purportedly has therapeutic benefit for pain but does not produce intoxicating effects [1].&#xD;
      However, there are few well-controlled human laboratory studies assessing the efficacy of&#xD;
      high-CBD cannabis for pain in the context of abuse, and even less is known regarding the&#xD;
      effects of daily repeated use of cannabis on pain and its relationship to abuse liability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed randomized, within-subjects, placebo-controlled 16-day crossover inpatient human&#xD;
      laboratory pilot study (N = 16 healthy cannabis users; 8 men, 8 women) will address important&#xD;
      gaps in our understanding of the potential therapeutic utility of cannabis for pain: 1) If&#xD;
      repeated cannabis use can result in hyperalgesia; 2) If tolerance to the analgesic and&#xD;
      abuse-related effects of cannabis develops and is reversible. Two distinct modalities of&#xD;
      experimental pain will be assessed: The Cold Pressor Test (CPT) and Quantitative Sensory&#xD;
      Testing Thermal Temporal Summation (QST-TTS), and participants will smoke cannabis 3x/day.&#xD;
      Throughout the study, experimental pain and abuse-related effects will be assessed, as will&#xD;
      sleep and subjective mood assessments.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study comprises a 16-day inpatient stay. On the first full inpatient day (Day 1), participants will smoke one specified strength (Dose A) of cannabis. Days 2-8 will comprise Phase 1, in which a second strength (Dose B) of cannabis will be administered 3x/day. The next 7 days (Day 9-15) will be Phase 2, in which cannabis Dose A will be administered once again, at the same 3 daily time points.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Cold Pressor Test (CPT) latency</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The CPT apparatus consists of two refrigerated circulators, filled with warm (36.5-37.5°C). participants will complete the CPT 30 minutes before the 1000h cannabis administration (baseline), and 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes post-cannabis administration. and cold (3.5 - 4.5°C) water. Participants will insert their non-dominant hand into the warm water and remove it after 3 minutes; skin temperature of the thumb pad will be measured. Participants will then insert their hand in the cold water and will be instructed to report when they first experience pain (pain threshold) and remove their hand when the cold water can no longer be tolerated (pain tolerance). Maximum immersion time will be 3 minutes.&#xD;
Repeats at days 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 15,</description>

    <measure>Change in Quantitative Sensory Testing-Thermal Temporal Summation (QST-TTS) ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The QST-TTS apparatus is a thermal testing analyzer with a 30 x 30 mm Peltier thermode, which will use repetitive nociceptive heat stimulation of a fixed frequency and intensity. At the beginning of the procedure, a research assistant (same gender as the participant) will read a script describing the procedure to the participant. Tonic noxious heat stimulation will be applied to the palm using a ramp-and-hold method, in which the baseline temperature will be set at 32.0°C, and will increase at a rate of 1°C/s up to 46.5°C, remaining constant for 120 sec. During the total duration of stimulation (135 seconds), participants will continuously rate the magnitude of perceived pain using a visual analog scale. participants will complete the CPT 30 minutes before the 1000h cannabis administration (baseline), and 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes post-cannabis administration.&#xD;
