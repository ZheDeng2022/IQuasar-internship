  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a preliminary investigation of a new behavioral speech and language treatment&#xD;
      for emotional prosody recognition and production deficits in right hemisphere stroke and&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phrase, &quot;it's not what you say, but how you say it&quot; neatly sums up prosody - the changes&#xD;
      to one's tone of voice that transmit meaning. Changes to speech rate, rhythm, volume, and&#xD;
      pitch to convey emotion fall into the category of affective, or emotional, prosody. That is,&#xD;
      the changes made to the voice to express feelings, such as happy or sad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following damage to the right side of the brain, such as in stroke and in some types of&#xD;
      dementia, difficulties in affective prosody understanding and use have been observed. These&#xD;
      findings have led researchers to view the right hemisphere as playing a critical role for&#xD;
      emotional prosody. Affective prosody difficulties do not always spontaneously improve after&#xD;
      acute right hemisphere stroke, and only a few evidenced-based treatments are available for&#xD;
      these individuals as well as individuals living with dementia. It is also understood that&#xD;
      affective prosody difficulties can negatively impact social interactions and relationships,&#xD;
      including those who care for individuals with emotional prosody difficulties. With&#xD;
      miscommunication frequently occurring between those living with affective prosody disorders&#xD;
      and those with whom these people interact, the risk of reduced quality of life and social&#xD;
      isolation is possible and could be related to poorer health outcomes. Not only might there be&#xD;
      personal burdens associated with poor management of communication difficulties in right&#xD;
      hemisphere stroke and dementia, but there might also be economic burdens as well. In addition&#xD;
      to counseling caregivers, family, and friends about the communication changes of loved ones,&#xD;
      more evidenced-based speech and language treatment options are needed for those living with&#xD;
      affective prosody disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to investigate a new treatment for individuals with emotional prosody&#xD;
      impairments due to right hemisphere stroke or dementia. After informed consent is received,&#xD;
      multiple screening assessments will be completed to determine if the study is a good fit for&#xD;
      the participant. If the participant qualifies for the study, additional assessments will be&#xD;
      completed to gather baseline cognitive-linguistic performance. Pre-treatment assessments will&#xD;
      occur for about 1-2 weeks (Visits 1-4). Emotional prosody treatment will occur for 4 weeks&#xD;
      (Visits 5-16) and will focus on production (2 weeks) and recognition (2 weeks) of emotional&#xD;
      prosody. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment order (production-recognition,&#xD;
      recognition-production), and all participants will complete all components of the treatment.&#xD;
      After completion of treatment, participants will be asked to come in for follow-up visits one&#xD;
      week (Visit 17) and one month (Visit 18) after completion of treatment to assess changes in&#xD;
      cognitive-linguistic performance. Emotional prosody recognition and production will also be&#xD;
      tracked during treatment. Participation in all study-related activities lasts about 2.5&#xD;
      months (10 weeks).&#xD;
