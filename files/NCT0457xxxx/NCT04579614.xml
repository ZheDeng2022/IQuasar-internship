  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Southeast Permanente Medical Group (TSPMG) at Kaiser Permanente Georgia provides&#xD;
      performance feedback to its providers. The performance feedback designs can vary and change&#xD;
      over time in terms of targets, summary statistics, included measures, and frequency of&#xD;
      delivery. The TSPMG health services research group seek to compare different performance&#xD;
      feedback designs to identify which are most effective at contributing to performance&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will randomly assign providers into different performance feedback&#xD;
      conditions, as specified in the protocol. Providers will receive performance feedback through&#xD;
      the standard mechanism in which it is conveyed by their supervisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to investigate how to design performance feedback for providers to best&#xD;
      motivate and support them in improving performance along with existing strategic priorities&#xD;
      for care delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reserach team will test alternative designs of performance feedback that vary on the&#xD;
      following dimension:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) targets for comparison of one's own performance&#xD;

      The Southeast Permanente Medical Group (TSPMG) provides performance feedback to its&#xD;
      providers. The performance feedback designs can vary and change over time in terms of&#xD;
      targets, summary statistics, included measures, and frequency of delivery. The TSPMG health&#xD;
      services research team will seek to compare different performance feedback designs to&#xD;
      identify which are most effective at contributing to performance improvement. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will randomly assign providers into different performance feedback&#xD;
      conditions, as specified in the protocol. Providers will receive performance feedback through&#xD;
      the standard mechanism in which it is conveyed by their supervisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to investigate how to design performance feedback for providers to best&#xD;
      motivate and support them in improving performance along with existing strategic priorities&#xD;
      for care delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will test alternative designs of performance feedback that vary on the&#xD;
      following dimension:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) targets for comparison of one's own performance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will provide feedback on performance by measures that the organization&#xD;
      already tracks internally and uses for performance improvement. These include a provider's&#xD;
      utilization of opportunities to provide flu vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will randomly assign different designs of feedback to providers. In order to&#xD;
      understand which designs of feedback have the best effects on performance, the research team&#xD;
      will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Displaying the next-highest quartile will motivate improvement more than display of all&#xD;
           quartiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Theory: The next-highest quartile will serve as an injunctive norm, or suggested target,&#xD;
           to repeatedly lift an individual's performance to the suggested level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The positive effect of displaying the next-highest quartile, relative to displaying all&#xD;
           quartiles, will be most pronounced for initially low performers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Theory: The next highest quartile averts upward social comparison to a much higher level&#xD;
           of peer performance, which can be discouraging and so negatively affect performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The positive effect of displaying the next-highest quartile, relative to displaying all&#xD;
           quartiles, will diminish over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Theory: Individuals may become worn out as they see a target ratchet higher when their&#xD;
           performance improves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Displaying team relative performance along with individual relative performance will be&#xD;
           more effective than displaying either type of information alone.&#xD;
