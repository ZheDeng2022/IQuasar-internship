      Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted. The control group was a patient&#xD;
      who underwent coronary angiography at the same time and was definitely diagnosed as coronary&#xD;
      heart disease but not diabetes. The study group was coronary heart disease complicated with&#xD;
      diabetes, which was divided into group A (≤5 years), group B (5-10 years) and group C (10-20&#xD;
      years) according to the course of diabetes. (1) Review the electronic medical records and&#xD;
      record the general information of the selected patients: age, sex, history of hypertension,&#xD;
      history of myocardial infarction, family history of coronary heart disease, smoking history,&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease; ② laboratory findings: HbA1C (glycosylated hemoglobin), SBP (systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure), DBP (diastolic blood pressure), total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride,&#xD;
      BMI, creatinine and glomerular passing rate (EGFR); ③ Drug use: oral hypoglycemic agents,&#xD;
      insulin, aspirin, statins, hypertension drugs, ACEI or ARB, β-blockers, CCB and diuretics.&#xD;
      (ii) Taking coronary angiography as the gold standard, the grading index of severity of&#xD;
      coronary heart disease was made, and the severity of coronary heart disease was evaluated by&#xD;
      Gensini score.&#xD;
