      60 healthy subjects were randomly allocated to one of three groups: (a) 20-min of&#xD;
      High-Definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) with an intensity of 2 mA&#xD;
      (HD-tDCS 2 mA); (2) 20-min of HD-tDCS with an intensity of 1.5 mA (HD-tDCS 1.5 mA); and (3)&#xD;
      20-min of sham HD-tDCS (HD-tDCS sham). The stimulation was administered noninvasively using&#xD;
      an M x N 9-channel high definition transcranial electrical current stimulator from Soterix&#xD;
      Medical (New York, NY). The anodal stimulation targeted the right Brodmann area 4 (primary&#xD;
      motor cortex) based on HD-Targets brain modelling software (Soterix Medical, New York, NY).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests: The non-dominant left arm was tested. The subjects performed a sequential&#xD;
      point-to-point movement task on the graphics tablet. Initially, the participants were&#xD;
      required to perform 3 sequences without errors to familiarize themselves with the setup, the&#xD;
      task and the sequence. Then, they performed the pre-test which consisted of two blocks of 6&#xD;
      sequences, i.e. 12 sequences, with a 30 s break between blocks. Two min after starting the&#xD;
      appropriate stimulation, they performed 2 blocks of 6 sequences (identical to the pre-test).&#xD;
      After finishing the tDCS stimulation, the participants performed a post-test, which was also&#xD;
      identical to the pre-test. The participants returned after 24 hours to perform a retention&#xD;
      test, which was equivalent to the pre- and post-tests. Two outcome measures were used:&#xD;
      movement time (s) and the reaction time (s) of the reaching movements.&#xD;
