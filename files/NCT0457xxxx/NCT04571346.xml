  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In trans-obturator tape (TOT), tension and location of the tape in mid urethral zone are&#xD;
      directly related to the postoperative clinical outcome. Recurrence of symptoms of stress&#xD;
      urinary incontinence has been related to tape migration in previous studies. The study aimed&#xD;
      to increase the success rate of TOT procedure through a new surgical technique using a 2&#xD;
      paramedian vaginal incisions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the investigator innovated a new technique that involves a 2 paramedian vaginal incisions&#xD;
      that allow more tape stabilization with sparing the dissection along the whole urethra&#xD;
      ensuring intact overlying tissues and to create a tunnel in between the 2 incisions to pass&#xD;
      the tape, making it supported proximally and distally with normal undissected tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the study aims to assess the success rate of TOT and tape migration using a new surgical&#xD;
      technique versus the standard procedure using vertical incision.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Female patients complaining of stress urinary incontinence will be selected for our study, at the urology department, Ain-shams University hospitals. Those patients will be randomized into 2 equal groups with a 1:1 ratio using sealed envelopes that will be prepared by the department's ethical committee, group 1 represents the classical TOT procedure while group 2 represents the 2 paramedian vertical incisions technique. Patients will be blinded to the type of intervention. Informed consent will be obtained for all patients before the surgery, Careful evaluation will be done including history taking, examination with a stress test and urodynamic study. Patients with neurological disease, pelvic organ prolapse, previous urethral or pelvic floor surgery will be excluded from our study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>TOT procedure will be done using silicon-coated polypropylene tape that will be inserted at the mid-urethral portion. In group 1, a classical vertical vaginal incision will be done proximal to the external urethral meatus with dissection along the axis of the urethra till the mid-urethral zone that is identified by palpating the urethral catheter balloon through the vaginal at the bladder neck, while in group 2, two paramedian incisions will be done 1cm long in the anterior vaginal wall 2 cm apart parallel to the urethra till identification of the mid-urethral portion, communication will be done between the two incisions 1 cm wide in this area creating a tunnel where the tape will be placed, this technique provides healthy tissues proximal and distal to the tape that allows more stabilization and less migration. The rest of the procedure is the same as the standard procedure of Trans-obturator outside-in tension-free technique.</description>
