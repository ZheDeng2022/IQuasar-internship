  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of implementing an integrated clinical&#xD;
      care pathway for the diagnosis, referral, evaluation and treatment of large complex&#xD;
      colorectal polyps on clinical outcomes&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our project will create a system that links community hospitals and ambulatory endoscopy&#xD;
      centers throughout the province of Ontario, directly to the expert endoscopists at our&#xD;
      tertiary referral center, to facilitate the timely assessment of polyps based on an&#xD;
      electronic referral containing endoscopic video recordings or high-resolution images rather&#xD;
      than a paper report through a centralized referral pathway. This polyp adjudication will&#xD;
      happen in a timely fashion without involving in-person patient consultation, and will&#xD;
      streamline the management of these patients to either referral for surgery or booking for&#xD;
      endoscopic polyp removal by therapeutic colonoscopy at our center. Specific endoscopy time&#xD;
      slots will be reserved for these patients to ensure they have efficient access to their&#xD;
      treatment. This system represents a new care model for managing patients with concerning&#xD;
      pre-cancerous lesions diagnosed in disparate local hospitals through a centralized process of&#xD;
      referral, diagnostic evaluation and treatment at an expert tertiary referral centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of our study will be to track the outcomes of the new standard-of-care&#xD;
      clinical pathway. Clinical objectives of the project include a reduction in wait times for&#xD;
      expert assessment after diagnosis of a large or otherwise concerning polyp combined with&#xD;
      reduced wait times for therapeutic removal of these polyps, minimizing unnecessary surgery&#xD;
      for benign lesions, and facilitating early recommendation for surgery in those patients who&#xD;
      truly require surgical resection. Additional objectives include the achievement of excellent&#xD;
      rates of clinical success, complication rates similar to those reported in the literature,&#xD;
      and high levels of satisfaction from referring doctors at participating centers. A final,&#xD;
      major goal is to assess whether this pilot program could serve as a model to be expanded to&#xD;
      other academic, tertiary referral centers throughout the province of Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary research question seeks to compare the diagnostic accuracy of expert polyp&#xD;
      adjudication between the different modes of referral (video clip, color photograph, faxed&#xD;
      images) against the real-time endoscopic diagnosis during therapeutic colonoscopy and the&#xD;
      final pathologic result. The secondary research question is to follow the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of all patients who undergo endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of a large or complex&#xD;
      colorectal polyp to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this procedure at our expert tertiary&#xD;
      referral center.&#xD;

    <description>The referring doctor will use a standardized template to send the referral along with its associated video or high-resolution photographs.&#xD;
Referrals will be reviewed in a consensus fashion by at least 2 expert physicians at St. Michael's Hospital (SMH) on a bi-weekly basis. Polyps will be scored using a standardized evaluation form that documents relevant polyp features to assist the determination of whether a lesion is amenable to curative endoscopic resection.&#xD;
Cases will be triaged as being: (1) a standard polyp suitable for local removal in the community; (2) a complex polyp requiring expert removal at SMH with priority assigned based on the suspected risk of invasive disease; (3) a polyp that is not amenable to endoscopic resection or that is suspicious for cancer will that be recommended for surgical resection.</description>
