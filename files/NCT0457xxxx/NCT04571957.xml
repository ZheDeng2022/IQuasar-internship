  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Live donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is the treatment of choice for end-stage liver&#xD;
      disease, predominantly in the East, where deceased donor liver transplantation is sparse. In&#xD;
      LDLT, donor selection has to be stringent; as the donor safety is thepriority. Live liver&#xD;
      donors (LLD) with complex biliary and vascular anatomy are increasingly being accepted for&#xD;
      donation with the betterment of technical expertise. One of the commonest reasons for LLD&#xD;
      rejection is the hepatic parenchymal abnormality because ofsteatosis and steatohepatitis,&#xD;
      which can increase the donor risk. Retrospective analysis of donors with non-alcoholic&#xD;
      steatohepatitis(NASH) who were optimized and taken up for major hepatectomy from June 2011 to&#xD;
      January 2018will be performed.&#xD;

      Study Design Aim and Objective -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effect of donor optimization protocol in donors with biopsy proven NASH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study thebiochemical (LFTSs &amp; INR) recovery in donors with NASH after major&#xD;
           hepatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare their biochemical recovery parameters (LFTs &amp; INR) with that of non NASH&#xD;
           donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study incidence of NASH among live liver donors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study their respective recipients' outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the morbidity among LLDs with NASH after major hepatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population:Patients underwentLDLT from June 2011 to January 2019 at Institute of&#xD;
           Liver &amp; Biliary Sciences, New Delhi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design:Retrospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study period:from June 2011 to January 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size with justification:All consecutive LLDs with at least one year of follow up&#xD;
           post-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention: none&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring and assessment:none Statistical Analysis:Categorical variables were presented&#xD;
           as number (percentage) and were compared using the Chi-square test. Continuous variables&#xD;
           were presented as mean (standard deviation, SD) and were compared using Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
           Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Effects: None Stopping Rule of Study: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcome of the Project: Adherence to a strict dietary and lifestyle modifications&#xD;
      plan will cause histological reversal of NASH and fibrosis in LLDs. Their clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical recovery following the major hepatectomy will be similar to that of non-NASH&#xD;
      LLDs.&#xD;
