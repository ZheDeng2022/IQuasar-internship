      This pilot study will examine facilitators and barriers that impact staff uptake for&#xD;
      implementation of practice change involving ipsilateral IV insertion in patients with&#xD;
      axillary lymphadenectomy/dissection in a single radiology center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective single arm study will be conducted within DUH Department of Radiology CT&#xD;
      Imaging. The study team will enroll 50 patients with a history of axillary SLNP presenting&#xD;
      for routine radiographic scan to undergo ipsilateral IV insertion. Patients will complete&#xD;
      baseline bilateral arm volumetric measurements and self-reported symptom assessments.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed every 3 months for 1-year duration for development of lymphedema.&#xD;
      Patient acceptance or reluctance to ipsilateral IV access will be categorized at time of&#xD;
      screening. Staff uptake on practice change will be assessed through medical record&#xD;
      documentation for number, location, and factors affecting IV attempts and their perceptions&#xD;
      of practice change and acceptance at the end of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete baseline measures: bilateral volumetric measurements and&#xD;
      self-reported symptoms. Per DUH policy, participants will undergo SOC contralateral arm&#xD;
      intravenous access attempt. After one failed attempt, ipsilateral intravenous access instead&#xD;
      of pedal or neck access will be offered per research protocol. Nursing documentation will&#xD;
      reflect the failed venipuncture and categorize a reason for the failed attempt. At the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating radiologist, a participant who has a history of multiple failed IV&#xD;
      placement attempts in the contralateral arm may proceed to IV placement in the ipsilateral&#xD;
      arm on the first attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with successful ipsilateral intravenous access will be provided a patient education&#xD;
      sheet describing signs and symptoms that should be reported to the study team. All&#xD;
      participants will be contacted by the study team at twelve week intervals for 12 months after&#xD;
      their radiology encounter for completion of symptom assessments. If a subject reports new&#xD;
      signs or symptoms of lymphedema during follow-up, a clinic appointment for volumetric&#xD;
      measurements and thorough evaluation will occur within 2 weeks; findings will be discussed&#xD;
      with their physician. Participants will undergo bilateral volumetric measurements, symptom&#xD;
      assessments, and perceptions of the ipsilateral IV access protocol at the end of one year.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptions of barriers and facilitators by staff will be collected at study end using a qualitative format. Modeled after Melnyk, Fineout-Overholt, and Mays (2008) EBP surveys, open-ended questions will be asked during a focus group to ascertain their perceptions of the impact of the ipsilateral IV access protocol. Staff will be asked what worked well, what barriers did they experience, and what do they recommend for protocol adoption. Constant comparative analysis will be used to categorize themes from their responses</description>

    <measure>Volumetric measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 12 months post ipsilateral IV insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Volumetric measurements will be obtained using a tape measure to assess limb girth circumference at five anatomic points. A difference of 2 centimeters or more in arm circumference at a corresponding point between ipsilateral and contralateral arms is considered a common criterion for a diagnosis of lymphedema.(Armer et al 2003)</description>

    <measure>Lymphedema symptoms; patient reported outcomes (PRO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 3 months after intervention for 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Lymphedema Breast Cancer Questionnaire (LBCQ) uses 3 items to assess 19 symptoms most commonly associated with lymphedema (Radina et al., 2007). The LBCQ shows an acceptable measure of internal consistency (r=.785) for all 19 items. Test-retest reliability was evaluated using a sample of healthy women without breast cancer or lymphedema (n=35) over a 2-hour test-retest interval. The findings show a high degree of reliability (r =.98).</description>

    <description>The Lymphedema Scale uses 2 items for self-reported changes in wrist, elbow, and upper arm sizes. Scale sensitivity ranged from 0.86-0.92 in women with circumferential arm differences &gt;2 cm indicating presence of moderate lymphedema (Norman et al., 2001).</description>

    <description>Potential participants who decline to enroll at time of phone screening: the study team will ask if they would be willing to share a reason for their reluctance. The reasons will be categorized as qualitative responses at the end of study, for example: &quot;I must ask my oncologist permission, I've been told to never allow a procedure in my affected arm&quot;.&#xD;
b) For those enrolled: their perceptions regarding the ipsilateral access will be ascertained at the time of quarterly phone follow-up and at the end of study. Qualitative data will be analysed thematically.&#xD;
Patient perceptions of acceptance will be assessed in those who opt to or not to participate in thestudy:</description>
