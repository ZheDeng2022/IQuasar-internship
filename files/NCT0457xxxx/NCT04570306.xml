  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to perform RNA-sequencing of the whole blood initially, in a cohort&#xD;
      of 80 SLE patients who will receive belimumab as part of standard clinical practice, in order&#xD;
      to assess intra-patient longitudinal (baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months) transcriptome changes and&#xD;
      examine whether treatment can ameliorate the activity/flare, severity and major organ disease&#xD;
      gene signatures. The investigators will also obtain preliminary information on molecular&#xD;
      signatures predicting clinical responses and the impact of belimumab on gene signatures of&#xD;
      host defense against viral and bacterial (including mycobacterial) pathogens. Using modules&#xD;
      of cell type-specific genes and co-expression gene networks, The investigators will&#xD;
      deconvolute our data to define pertinent molecular alterations in specific immune cell types.&#xD;
      Results will be validated and functionally characterized by single-cell mass cytometry&#xD;
      (performed at the aforementioned time points), which enables investigation of the cell&#xD;
      identity (including subsets of B-cells and myeloid cells of particular relevance to the&#xD;
      disease) and activation status at protein level (e.g. phosphorylation) through&#xD;
      next-generation, high-dimensional flow cytometry. Through a focused analysis followed by&#xD;
      targeted gene expression and function studies in purified monocytes, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine whether belimumab can restore &quot;SLE-primed&quot; monocytes thus, alleviating their&#xD;
      inflammatory and pro-atherogenic phenotype and enhancing their bactericidal activity.&#xD;
      Collectively, these studies will provide novel mechanistic insights on the beneficial&#xD;
      efficacy/toxicity ratio of belimumab therapy in SLE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      B-cell activating factor (BAFF) excess causes lupus disease by exerting costimulatory effects&#xD;
      on the B-cell compartment but also on a variety of non-B-cell subsets such as T-helper cells&#xD;
      and monocytes/dendritic cells. The 2019 updated European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)&#xD;
      recommendations for SLE recommend usage of belimumab (anti-BAFF mAb) in persistently active&#xD;
      or flaring disease based upon evidence for efficacy, reduction of flares and organ damage&#xD;
      accrual without increasing the risk of infections. Still, belimumab is usually reserved for&#xD;
      established, refractory cases. It is conceivable that earlier usage may halt the progression&#xD;
      of the disease, especially prevent flares and dysfunction in major organs. The investigators&#xD;
      have completed a combined genetic and transcriptomic analysis in the peripheral blood of SLE&#xD;
      patients and have characterized distinct gene signatures for disease activity/flare and&#xD;
      severity. Using machine learning techniques, the investigators can predict SLE patients&#xD;
      likely to develop major organ involvement. In vitro and gene profiling studies in purified&#xD;
      lupus monocytes indicate that these cells exist - under the effect of type I interferon - in&#xD;
      a &quot;high alert&quot; autoreactive and metabolic state (reminiscent of 'trained immunity'), which&#xD;
      may contribute to risk of flares, tissue injury but also major comorbidities seen in SLE,&#xD;
      particularly accelerated atherosclerosis and infections. Based upon the clinical experience&#xD;
      accumulated thus far, it is likely that belimumab may neutralize these molecular signatures&#xD;
      for flares and disease progression without interfering with host defense immune pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to perform RNA-sequencing of the whole blood initially, in a cohort&#xD;
      of 80 SLE patients who will receive belimumab as part of standard clinical practice, in order&#xD;
      to assess intra-patient longitudinal (baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months) transcriptome changes and&#xD;
      examine whether treatment can ameliorate the identified activity/flare, severity and major&#xD;
      organ disease signatures. The investigators will also obtain preliminary information on&#xD;
      molecular signatures predicting clinical responses and the impact of belimumab on gene&#xD;
      signatures of host defense against viral and bacterial (including mycobacterial) pathogens.&#xD;
      Using modules of cell type-specific genes and co-expression gene networks, the investigators&#xD;
      will deconvolute our data to define pertinent molecular alterations in specific immune cell&#xD;
      types. Results will be validated and functionally characterized by single-cell mass cytometry&#xD;

      deconvoluted RNA-seq and mass cytometry data followed by targeted gene expression and&#xD;
      function studies in purified monocytes, the investigators will determine whether belimumab&#xD;
      can restore &quot;SLE-primed&quot; monocytes thus, alleviating their inflammatory and pro-atherogenic&#xD;
      phenotype and enhancing their bactericidal activity. Collectively, these studies will provide&#xD;
      novel mechanistic insights on the beneficial efficacy/toxicity ratio of belimumab therapy in&#xD;
      SLE, while supporting the early use of the drug.&#xD;
