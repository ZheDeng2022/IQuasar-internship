      The main aim of this study is to determine the effect of awareness campaigns by school&#xD;
      children targeting their communities on knowledge, attitudes, and practices in malaria&#xD;
      control in the Mbandjock health district. A two-arm, open-label, randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial will be adopted with the Mbandjock Health District as the test district and&#xD;
      Sa'a Health District as control Health District. This will last from January 2017 to December&#xD;
      2020. The Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) method was used. The health area was selected&#xD;
      in the ratio 2:1. A total of 209 pupils and 209 adults shall be enrolled from households&#xD;
      located in Mbandjock. Similarly, 114 pupils and 114 adults will be recruited in Sa'a. In&#xD;
      addition, 57 teachers shall be enrolled in the District of Mbandjock only. A total of 703&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  To describe the socio-demographic characteristics of households in the health districts&#xD;
           of Mbandjock and Sa'a at the time of the survey;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the change due the intervention on knowledge of malaria transmission,&#xD;
           diagnosis, treatment and prevention in the health district of Mbandjock;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the change due the intervention on attitudes towards malaria diagnosis,&#xD;
           treatment and prevention in the Mbandjock health district;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the change due the intervention on practices in the diagnosis, treatment and&#xD;
           prevention of malaria in the Mbandjock health district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Study design A two-arm, open label, randomized controlled clinical trial will be&#xD;
      adopted with Mbandjock health district as the test district and Sa'a Health District a&#xD;
      Control Health District.&#xD;

      each district were considered as supervision areas. The health area was selected in the ratio&#xD;
      2:1. In the test district 11 health areas were used and 6 health district in the control&#xD;
      district. 19 households were selected for each health area as required by the LQAS method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size A total of 209 pupils and 209 adults shall be enrolled from households in&#xD;
      Mbandjock. Similarly, 114 pupils and 114 adults will be recruited in Sa'a. In addition, 57&#xD;
      teachers shall be enrolled in the District of Mbandjock only. A total of 703 participants&#xD;
      shall be enrolled during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
