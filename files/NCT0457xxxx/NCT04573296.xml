  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized clinical study is to evaluate the impact of a&#xD;
      six-month digitally administered behavioral change programme on weight, metabolic parameters&#xD;
      and adherence to healthy lifestyle in obese adults with insulin resistance, prediabetes or&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes as compared to conventional high-intensity lifestyle intervention programme&#xD;
      administered at a sports medicine clinic of university hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitadio Health is a 6-month digitally administered behavioral change programme focused on&#xD;
      lifestyle change, weight loss and metabolic health and promoting self-management and&#xD;
      long-term self-sufficiency. The programme includes personalised nutrition/lifestyle&#xD;
      education, remote dietitian's one-on-one coaching, weekly goals, diet and activity monitoring&#xD;
      tools, recipes and support member community. Personalization and semi-automation of the&#xD;
      intervention are achieved by analysis of participant's interactions with the interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective randomized clinical study, obese adults with insulin resistance,&#xD;
      prediabetes or diabetes mellitus type 2, patients of a sports medicine clinic of university&#xD;
      hospital, are randomized to receive either Vitadio Health or a conventional 6-month&#xD;
      high-intensity lifestyle intervention programme at the clinic, consisting of face-to-face&#xD;
      nutrition/lifestyle education (at baseline, months 1 to 3 and month 6) and diet&#xD;
      self-monitoring. In addition, all participants undergo a regular medical assessment at the&#xD;
      clinic (baseline, month 3, month 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess feasibility and efficacy of digitally administered&#xD;
      intervention by comparing evolution of weight, physical fitness, laboratory measures of&#xD;
      metabolic health, blood pressure, adherence to recommended lifestyle measures and other&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
