  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amplification is a well-established, evidence-based front-line treatment for those with&#xD;
      impaired communication secondary to Age Related Hearing Loss (ARHL). ARHL is the most&#xD;
      prevalent cause of communication impairment among older adults. The challenge in treating&#xD;
      ARHL is identifying a care model that effectively promotes adherence to&#xD;
      individualized-treatment recommendations allowing the end-user to self-manage hearing loss&#xD;
      with appropriate support. This proposal compares the two most common models of care for ARHL&#xD;
      provided to adults in assisted living/personal care communities. The Consult Model (i.e.,&#xD;
      usual care) is an acute care strategy, relying on a monthly Audiologist visit to the&#xD;
      facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Engage Model is a chronic care approach to support hearing loss self-management of ARHL.&#xD;
      Engage includes (a) hearing screening for all residents, (b) an individualized communication&#xD;
      plan for those with an identified hearing loss (e.g., one-to-one, group, telephone,&#xD;
      television plans, hearing aid trouble shooting, communication strategies, etc.), (c)&#xD;
      provision of simple, non-custom amplifiers, (d) referral to audiology if needed, and (e)&#xD;
      ongoing support provided by trained personnel (Communication Facilitator) under the&#xD;
      supervision of the audiologist.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is employing an open cohort stepped-wedge cluster randomized design with a phased,&#xD;
      randomized roll out. The stepped wedge design is a useful design for the evaluation of&#xD;
      complex health care interventions particularly when the intervention is believed to be&#xD;
      beneficial with minimal risk. This design is increasingly being used to evaluate&#xD;
      interventions involving health care delivery and has several advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. allowing the clinical teams to roll out the intervention in a small number of facilities&#xD;
           in a timely, systematic manner (interventions are not part of the research protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. possibly increasing participation and buy-in since all facilities will eventually&#xD;
           implement the intervention during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. possible increase in statistical power compared to a cluster randomized trial due to&#xD;
           increase in data collection and within cluster comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our intervention is applied at the facility level (cluster) but the primary outcomes are&#xD;
      obtained at the resident level. In this open cohort design, all residents in a facility are&#xD;
      identified to participate but some may leave the facility and others will move into the&#xD;
      facility over the course of the study. The interventions are standard care at UPMC and are at&#xD;
      the facility and individual level regardless of participation in the research project by any&#xD;
      individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8 facilities participating in the study all currently receive the Consult Model of care.&#xD;
      These same facilities are targeted to receive the Engage Model of care over the next three&#xD;
      years as part of the standard care in these facilities. Residents enrolled in the study&#xD;
      during any time period will be followed until the end of the study or until they are no&#xD;
      longer a resident of the facility, whichever comes first. This implies that crossover to the&#xD;
      intervention is not only at the facility level but also the resident level. Once the&#xD;
      intervention is available at a facility, residents will be exposed to the intervention&#xD;
      continuously regardless of enrollment for the study measures. The resident level outcomes of&#xD;
      satisfaction with social participation and hearing-specific HRQoL will be measured every 5&#xD;
      months for the duration of the study. In addition, staff satisfaction and family burden will&#xD;
      be surveyed every 5 months.&#xD;
