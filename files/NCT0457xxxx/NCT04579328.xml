  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized control trial testing whether exposure to a wall hanging (growth mat) enabling&#xD;
      parents to physically compare their children's height against the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) standards for height-for-age in combination with normal messaging on stunting increases&#xD;
      parents' understanding and retention of those messages. Both intervention and control groups&#xD;
      will receive messages about stunting over a 3-month period, but the intervention group will&#xD;
      also be exposed to the growth mats during the 3-month intervention period. Parents in both&#xD;
      groups will be tested post intervention on the messages about stunting and scores will be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;

      This study is embedded within a development program implemented by a consortium led by&#xD;
      Catholic Relief Services. The program aims to improve child nutrition, in part, through&#xD;
      behavior change messaging. Parents have difficulty understanding that stunting is a problem&#xD;
      because the high prevalence (57%) means the entire population curve has shifted to the left -&#xD;
      a stunted child appears normal when compared to others in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through previous work, we have designed a wall-hanging like a life-size, color coded growth&#xD;
      chart. Using 2 stage sampling, with parents clustered in neighbor groups, neighbor groups&#xD;
      have been randomly assigned to intervention or control. Both groups will receive standard&#xD;
      lessons on stunting while only the intervention group will have the growth mats incorporated&#xD;
      into the lessons. After 3 months of exposure to the lessons, parents will be tested on their&#xD;
      understanding of the key lesson points. Scores between groups will be tested for statistical&#xD;
      differences. Qualitative focus groups throughout the intervention period will collect&#xD;
      information on perception of the message delivery and the utility of the growth mats.&#xD;
