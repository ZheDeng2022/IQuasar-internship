      The study aim at comparing outcomes from the implementation of various endoscopic closure&#xD;
      techniques including stenting and suturing on the healing and resolution of esophageal wall&#xD;
      defects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Esophageal wall defects are a rare but potentially life-threatening subset of luminal&#xD;
      pathology which usually require timely intervention in order to reduce the known associated&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality. These defects can be due to surgical and endoscopic procedures,&#xD;
      such as post-operative leaks and fistulas and perforations complicating endoscopic dilation.&#xD;
      In addition, defects can occur spontaneously due to Boerhaave's syndrome or following&#xD;
      chemoradiation treatments of esophageal or other chest malignancies. Surgical management was&#xD;
      historically the mainstay of therapy for these defects with conservative management remaining&#xD;
      an alternative in poor surgical candidates. Over the last several years however,&#xD;
      interventional endoscopy has played an increasing role in treatment of esophageal wall&#xD;
      defects, with endoscopic stenting quickly becoming a viable alternative. Temporary stents&#xD;
      including the fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FC-SEMS), partially covered&#xD;
      self-expandable metal stents (P-SEMS) and self-expandable plastic stents (SEPS) have all been&#xD;
      successfully used and have become increasingly regarded as the new standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indiana University is a tertiary referral center is a destination for complex thoracic&#xD;
      surgery, oncology and esophageal disease referrals. The innovative luminal endoscopy team&#xD;
      started employing a several modalities including flexible endoscopic suturing and stenting to&#xD;
      close esophageal defects. To our knowledge, there is a dearth of data on outcomes associated&#xD;
      with multi-modality esophageal defect closure techniques and little to no data comparing this&#xD;
      approach to the current standard of care of stenting alone or surgery.&#xD;
