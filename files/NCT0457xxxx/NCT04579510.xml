  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized clinical trial that will compare immune responses among&#xD;
      infants who receive either novel monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) alone,&#xD;
      bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) alone, or co-administered nOPV2 and bOPV.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is expected that nOPV2 would replace mOPV2 for responding to type 2 outbreaks. Outbreak&#xD;
      response for cVDPV2 also offers the opportunity to close immunity gaps to polioviruses types&#xD;
      1 and 3. Furthermore, GPEI might have to respond to two poliovirus outbreaks in the same&#xD;
      geography. For either scenario, it would be important to get data on the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      co-administered nOPV2 and bOPV, compared to either vaccine given alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial assesses and compares the immunogenicity of nOPV2 given with or without&#xD;
      bOPV. Healthy infants 6 weeks of age will be enrolled in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and randomized to&#xD;
      one of three study arms â &quot; Arm A: nOPV2 only, Arm B: nOPV2 and bOPV, or Arm C: bOPV only.&#xD;
      Infants will be followed-up until 18 weeks of age through clinic and household visits. Blood&#xD;
      specimens will be collected to test for immunological response. Stool specimens will be&#xD;
      collected from infant vaccine recipients and one sibling household contact each to assess&#xD;
      viral recombinants and nOPV2 household transmission.&#xD;

    <description>nOPV2 candidate 1 (S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3) is a live-attenuated serotype-2 poliovirus that was derived from a modified Sabin type-2 infectious cDNA clone and propagated in Vero cells. To improve genetic stability, nucleotide sequence modifications were made in the major determinant for attenuation in the Sabin 5'-untranslated region. Additionally, two modifications in the polymerase 3D were made to further improve stability of the attenuation, and a key replication element from the 2C coding region was relocated to the 5'-untranslated region to inhibit recombination.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy infants 6 weeks of age (range: 42-48 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents that consent for participation in the full length of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents that can understand and comply with planned study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infant has at least one sibling aged &lt;10 years living in the same household that is&#xD;
             eligible for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents and infants who are unable to participate in the full length of the study&#xD;
             (e.g., plan to move away from the study area during the study period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis or suspicion of immunodeficiency disorder either in the infant or in an&#xD;
             immediate family member.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis or suspicion of bleeding disorder that would contraindicate administration&#xD;
             of bOPV or nOPV2 or collection of blood by venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute diarrhoea, infection or illness at the time of enrolment (6 weeks of age) that&#xD;
             would require infant's admission to a hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute vomiting and intolerance to liquids within 24 hours before the enrolment visit&#xD;
             (6 weeks of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of a chronic medical condition identified by a study medical officer during&#xD;
             physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any polio vaccine (OPV or IPV) before enrolment based upon documentation or&#xD;
             parental recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy/sensitivity or reaction to polio vaccine, or its contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants from multiple births. Infants from multiple births will be excluded because&#xD;
             the infant(s) who is/are not enrolled would likely receive OPV through routine&#xD;
             immunization and transmit vaccine poliovirus to the enrolled infant. Even if all&#xD;
             births from a multiple birth could be enrolled in the study, we will exclude multiple&#xD;
             births as discontinuation of one may lead to discontinuation of multiple participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants from premature births (&lt;37 weeks of gestation).&#xD;
