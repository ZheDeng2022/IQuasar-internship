  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, nonrandomized observational study to investigate the&#xD;
      utility of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) as a test to identify individuals at very low risk&#xD;
      for having a sputum culture positive for Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM). The study is&#xD;
      designed to evaluate if a urine test can eliminate the need for obtaining a sputum specimen&#xD;
      to screen for NTM in individuals with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The participants will be asked to&#xD;
      provide 3 urine samples either in person or by mail over approximately 3 years. The 3 urine&#xD;
      sample requests will be timed to coincide with their usual clinical care and routine sputum&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
