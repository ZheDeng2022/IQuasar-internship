  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to explore whether different temperatures of warm water footbaths have different&#xD;
      effects on the cardiovascular system, the autonomic nervous system and the general well-being&#xD;
      of healthy women.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a blinded, four-arm randomized controlled trial with crossover design to explore the&#xD;
      effects of warm water footbaths with different water temperatures on cardiovascular stress,&#xD;
      reaction of the autonomic nervous system and a feeling of comfort and warmth in healthy&#xD;
      female volunteers. Cardiovascular and ANS measurements are performed continuously throughout&#xD;
      the interventions and the participants rate their feelings of warmth, general well-being and&#xD;
      the footbath-related comfort with questionnaires.&#xD;
