    <textblock>
      This prospective study was planned to carried out among the patients with grade II and III&#xD;
      (Kellgren Lawrence classification) osteoarthritis of the knee attending outpatients clinic to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of viscosupplementation with intra-articular hyaluronic&#xD;
      acid injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-label, observational&#xD;
      study. The patients with grade II and III (Kellgren Lawrence classification) osteoarthritis&#xD;
      of the knee attending outpatients were planned to enroll the study. Patients between the age&#xD;
      18-80 years who did not achieve remission of pain despite receiving the first-line treatment&#xD;
      for gonarthrosis including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs medication, activity&#xD;
      modification and ice, were planned to included in the study. A single dose of HA will be&#xD;
      injected into the target knee joint. Clinical evaluation will be done using the Western&#xD;
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and the short form-36&#xD;
      questionnaires (SF-36 v2) at baseline, 3 months and 6 months by a clinical secretariat.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months and 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC is health status measure questionnaire of twenty-four questions comprising 3 subscales (pain, stiffness and physical function). WOMAC was measured on a scale of 0-100 mm, where lower score represents lower pain and higher score represents higher pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE could be any unfavorable and unintended symptom, sign, disease or condition, or test abnormality whether or not considered related to the investigational product. A serious adverse event (SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAE): AEs that developed/worsened during the 'on treatment period' (from first dose of study device until the end of study period). Category &quot;AE&quot; included participant with both serious and non-serious AE.</description>

    <description>36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures.each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively.
