  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, representing 20,55% and 14% of&#xD;
      cancer deaths in Spain and the United States, respectively. Currently, pulmonary resection is&#xD;
      the treatment of choice for lung cancer. However, this surgery is associated with significant&#xD;
      complications in almost 50% of the cases, possibly delaying patient recovery and consequently&#xD;
      increasing hospitalisation costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Professor Henrik Kehlet described ERAS programs at the end of the last century. His ideas&#xD;
      were that the application of specific measures based on scientific evidence during the&#xD;
      perioperative period of the patient could decrease the stress produced by surgical&#xD;
      aggression. Thus, in recent years, ERAS programs have proven effective in reducing surgical&#xD;
      complications, length of stay and hospital costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last years, specific ERAS surgical approaches have been described for thoracic&#xD;
      surgery. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of evidence to support ERAS programs for&#xD;
      pulmonary resection surgery, particularly in terms of clinical results combined with&#xD;
      minimally invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to analyze the effects of the implementation of an ERAS program in patients&#xD;
      undergoing pulmonary resection in a tertiary university hospital on the rates of&#xD;
      complications and readmission and the length of stay.&#xD;

      This study analyzes the implementation of an ERAS program in a thoracic service of a third&#xD;
      level hospital (Hospital Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Madrid, Spain). To this end, the&#xD;
      investigators designed an ambispective cohort study, with a prospective arm of patients&#xD;
      undergoing thoracic surgery within an ERAS program versus a retrospective arm of patients&#xD;
      before the implementation of the protocol. Our centre's ethics committee approved our study&#xD;
      before the start of patient recruitment, January 2018 Ref: EO071-18_FJD. This study followed&#xD;
      the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting&#xD;
      guideline for cohort studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, the investigators included patients consecutively since the&#xD;
      implementation, except those who refused the inclusion in the study or were under 18 years&#xD;
      old. The investigators also asked for informed consent from the patients who were part of the&#xD;
      retrospective cohort. For the calculation of the required sample size, the investigators&#xD;
      assumed that the ERAS program would result in a 25% reduction in the absolute risk of&#xD;
      suffering a surgical complication. Since the surgical complication rate for our patients in&#xD;
      2016 was 40%, a type-I error of 5% and a power of 80% would require 47 patients per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures The investigators recruited 50 patients throughout 2018 and 2019 and compared them&#xD;
      with data from the last 50 patients in 2016, the year in which the investigators knew the&#xD;
      surgical complication rate. The investigators followed up each patient for 30 days after&#xD;
      surgery through hospital and primary care medical records. Demographic and comorbidity data&#xD;
      were collected from all patients, from which the investigators calculated Charlson's&#xD;
      comorbidity index14 for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed our centre's ERAS program through different measures during the&#xD;
      preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative period. During the preoperative period, the&#xD;
      patients and their families received comprehensive multidisciplinary information about the&#xD;
      protocol, as well as their daily goals and expected discharge date. Also, a team specialized&#xD;
      in therapy against lung diseases taught patients pulmonary expansion exercises to be carried&#xD;
      out until surgery was performed. Smoking cessation and nutritional screening of the patient&#xD;
      were also part of this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), whenever possible,&#xD;
      leaving a chest tube at the end of the surgery. All subjects received antibiotic and&#xD;
      antithrombotic prophylaxis. Intraoperative management of patients was performed under general&#xD;
      anaesthesia combined with regional techniques for pain control, avoiding the use of&#xD;
      benzodiazepines and opioids. Those patients in whom thoracic epidural catheter was&#xD;
      implemented during surgery continued its use through a patient-controlled analgesia system.&#xD;
      Besides, a hot air system warmed the patients during surgery to maintain normothermia.&#xD;
      Extubation was performed as soon as possible after the end of the surgery, and encouraged&#xD;
      early removal of the urinary catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the time of extubation, the patients began oral tolerance and respiratory physiotherapy&#xD;
      exercises. Also, the patients were allowed to walk around early. The patients were discharged&#xD;
      when they were free of complications, without severe pain, urinary catheter or chest tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome was the number of patients with 30-day surgical complications.&#xD;
      The investigators defined air leakage, bleeding, infection, and reintervention as surgical&#xD;
      complications. Secondary outcome included ERAS adherence, no-surgical complications,&#xD;
      mortality, readmission, reintervention rates, pain (defined as any level of pain that&#xD;
      prevents early ambulation) and hospital lenght of stay. To evaluate ERAS adherence, the&#xD;
      investigators defined seven items: VATS approach, regional analgesia, oral tolerance within 6&#xD;
      hours, urinary catheter removal within 24 hours, ambulation within 24 hours, respiratory&#xD;
      physiotherapy within 24 hours and chest tube removal within 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The investigators analyzed outcomes depending on whether the patient&#xD;
      belonged to the ERAS program or the retrospective standard cohort. The discrete and&#xD;
      continuous variables were described as number and percentage and median (interquartile range&#xD;
      [IQR]) and their differences analyzed using the Pearson test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.&#xD;
      Subsequently, according to the adherence rate to ERAS items (regardless of whether the&#xD;
      patients belonged to the ERAS or the retrospective standard cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators performed a multivariate logistic analysis to study the association of&#xD;
      complication rates, readmission or pain with ERAS adherence, clinical and demographic data,&#xD;
      presenting the results in forest plots as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Similarly,&#xD;
      the investigators used Cox regression for multivariate analysis of length of stay, presenting&#xD;
      the results in forest plot as hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval. To avoid errors by&#xD;
      multiple comparisons, the investigators calculated the respective q-value for each p-value to&#xD;
      maintain a false discovery rate below 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators considered comparisons in which p-value and q-value were below .05 as being&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
