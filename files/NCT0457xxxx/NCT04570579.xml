  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses (PC-IOLs) has provided cataract&#xD;
      and refractive surgeons the ability to provide patients with a wider range of visual success&#xD;
      and spectacle independence post-cataract surgery.Multifocal (MFIOL) IOLs have the ability to&#xD;
      provide near and distance vision, and in the case of trifocal IOLs, near, intermediate and&#xD;
      distance. Despite the significant technological evolution of MFIOL's, the potential for&#xD;
      visual disturbances, such as glare, halos and starbursts still exists-and in much greater&#xD;
      frequency compared to their monofocal counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended depth of focus (EDOF) IOLs aim to provide patients with a functional range of&#xD;
      vision, with a similar visual disturbance profile to a monofocal lens. In this way, this&#xD;
      subset of PC-IOL's can offer patients some degree of spectacle independence, with a&#xD;
      significantly lower incidence of visual disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vivity Extended Vision IOL is the first of its kind to offer Wavefront Stretching&#xD;
      technology, providing patients with an excellent extended range of vision from intermediate&#xD;
      to distance, as well as some functional near vision. Prior studies have demonstrated very&#xD;
      good vision in both bright and dim lighting conditions, as well as a high degree of spectacle&#xD;
      independence with the Vivity IOL, as compared to a monofocal IOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies evaluating the ability of the Vivity IOL to provide a significant impact on patient&#xD;
      lifestyle (e.g. patient independence from spectacles for most activities with a low rate of&#xD;
      visual disturbances) in the United States in a 'real-world' setting have yet to be performed.&#xD;
      In addition, influence of pre-and-perioperative variables such as sex, age, prior refractive&#xD;
      surgery, IOL formula used, axial length, astigmatism, use of intraoperative aberrometry,&#xD;
      femtosecond laser and pupillary expansion devices has yet to be evaluated on the&#xD;
      postoperative success of this IOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be comprised of patients with visually significant cataracts who will undergo&#xD;
      cataract extraction with implantation of the spherical and/or toric models of the Vivity&#xD;
      Extended Vision (Alcon, Fort Worth TX) intraocular lens. Upon decision of the patient and&#xD;
      surgeon to undergo surgery, patients will be offered the option to enroll in this&#xD;
      observational study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses (PC-IOLs) provide cataract and refractive surgeons&#xD;
      with an effective treatment option for presbyopia, allowing patients increased spectacle&#xD;
      independence post-cataract surgery. Different IOL designs have been developed based on&#xD;
      differing optical principals, such as diffractive, refractive and extended depth of focus&#xD;
      (EDOF) design. Most commercially available MFIOLs have two optical zones, one that provides&#xD;
      distance vision, and the second that provides near vision (i.e. &quot;bifocal IOLs&quot;). Most&#xD;
      recently, trifocal IOLs have been released, with the aim of providing a third (intermediate)&#xD;
      focal point, and hence an extended range of vision in pseudophakic patients. While being able&#xD;
      to provide patients with near, intermediate and distance vision, most MFIOL's carry the risk&#xD;
      of increased visual disturbances, such as glare, starbursts, and halos, which for a small&#xD;
      percentage of patients may become quite bothersome or even debilitating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended depth of focus (EDOF) IOLs aim to provide an extended range of vision from&#xD;
      intermediate to distance, with a similar visual disturbance profile to their monofocal&#xD;
      counterparts. Prior to recent FDA approval, there was only one other EDOF IOL on the market&#xD;
      in the US, which, although provides an extended visual range, still had a significant&#xD;
      incidence of starbursts and visual disturbances in some patients. FDA approved in February&#xD;
      2020, the Vivity Extended Vision Lens has demonstrated the ability to provide patients with&#xD;
      an extended range of vision, excellent contrast sensitivity and visual disturbance profile&#xD;
      comparable to a monofocal IOL, as well as high rates of spectacle independence for most&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vivity Extended Vision IOL (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth TX) is an EDOF IOL made of&#xD;
      hydrophobic acrylic. This non-diffractive lens was designed to mitigate the effect of&#xD;
      presbyopia by providing an extended depth of focus through patented Wavefront Shaping&#xD;
      technology. In clinical trials, Vivity has demonstrated significantly better intermediate and&#xD;
      near vision as compared to a monofocal IOL, as well as superior spectacle independence&#xD;
      scores. Additionally, a validated questionnaire regarding visual disturbances showed the&#xD;
      Vivity to have comparable rates of starburst, glare and halos to its monofocal counterpart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an era where intermediate vision has become very important (e.g. using laptops, tablets,&#xD;
      seeing the dashboard in a car), many patients express desire for visual correction at all&#xD;
      possible focal points. Vivity appears to deliver this with minimal visual side effects-even&#xD;
      less so as compared to other MFIOL's. This is a valuable aspect of Vivity; spectacle&#xD;
      independence is an important factor for many patients-however if this is coupled with&#xD;
      debilitating glare, haloes or other visual disturbances, dissatisfaction will ultimately&#xD;
      result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have explored variables that may influence postoperative success of these&#xD;
      MFIOLs, including the impact of dry eye, prior corneal refractive surgery, and proper&#xD;
      preoperative consent/expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study has yet to be performed evaluating not only preoperative factors, such as&#xD;
      astigmatism, and prior corneal refractive surgery, but also perioperative and intraoperative&#xD;
      factors that may also play a role in success of the Vivity IOL implant. In this prospective,&#xD;
      nonrandomized &quot;real-world&quot; study, the impact of perioperative factors, such as IOL formulae&#xD;
      used, use of femtosecond laser, use of intraoperative aberrometry, as well use of pupillary&#xD;
      expansion devices on surgical success will be evaluated. Surgical success will be defined as&#xD;
      uncorrected distance, intermediate and near visual acuity (UDVA, UIVA and UNVA, respectively)&#xD;
      of 20/40 or better (both monocular and binocular) as well as high levels of patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, which will be recorded with a Visual Disturbance Questionnaire, Spectacle&#xD;
      Independence Questionnaire, and Visual Quality Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will provide never-before-published data on important preoperative as well as&#xD;
      perioperative factors that may influence success and patient satisfaction with Vivity IOL&#xD;
      implantation&#xD;

    <description>This is a prospective, nonrandomized study of patients undergoing bilateral cataract surgery with implantation of the spherical Vivity and/or Vivity toric IOL. Preoperative patient data such as age, sex, prior ocular history, medical history, and intraocular lens calculations/formulae used will be recorded. Uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity will be measured at distance (4m), intermediate (60cm) and near (40cm). All 3 surveys will be administered prior to surgery (at baseline) and at 3 months postoperative, regarding spectacle independence, visual disturbances, and visual quality. A proper perioperative record will be maintained, documenting planned IOL implantation, actual IOL implant used, use of femtosecond laser, use of intraoperative aberrometry, and use of pupillary expansion devices. Patients will be examined 1 day (&quot;postoperative day 1)&quot;, 1 week (&quot;postoperative week 1&quot;), 1 month (&quot;postoperative month 1&quot;) and 3 months (&quot;postoperative month 3&quot;) following surgery.</description>
