      This is an intermediate-size Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) for use of zanidatamab (ZW25) in&#xD;
      patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      who are not eligible for other zanidatamab clinical trials, and who in the opinion of the&#xD;
      treating oncologist, would potentially benefit from treatment with zanidatamab.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic cancer that has&#xD;
             progressed after receipt of available therapies known to confer clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate cardiac left ventricular function, as defined by left ventricular ejection&#xD;
             fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ineligible to participate or has no access to an ongoing zanidatamab or other&#xD;
             Zymeworks clinical study (e.g., ZW49 clinical study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential and non-sterile males must agree to practice highly&#xD;
             effective methods of birth control for the duration of the study and for 12 months&#xD;
             after the last dose of study drug. In addition, non-sterile males must avoid sperm&#xD;
             donation for the duration of the study and for 12 months after the last dose of study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participating in other studies involving investigational drug(s) ≤ 3 weeks before the&#xD;
             first dose of zanidatamab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic anti-cancer therapy ≤ 3 weeks before the first dose of zanidatamab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy ≤ 2 weeks of the first dose of zanidatamab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following central nervous system (CNS) brain lesions are excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Untreated or unstable brain lesions requiring immediate local therapy or&#xD;
                  symptomatic CNS metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiation treatment for CNS metastases within 4 weeks before the first dose of&#xD;
                  zanidatamab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known history of or ongoing leptomeningeal disease (LMD). If LMD has been&#xD;
                  reported radiographically, but is not suspected clinically by the investigator,&#xD;
                  the patient must be free of neurological symptoms of LMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The following CNS brain lesions are permitted:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Stable brain lesions are permitted if stable, as defined by patients who are&#xD;
                       off steroids and anticonvulsants and are neurologically stable with no&#xD;
                       evidence of radiographic progression for at least 4 weeks at the time of&#xD;
                       screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent uncontrolled or active hepatobiliary disorders or untreated or ongoing&#xD;
             complications after laparoscopic procedures or stent placement, including but not&#xD;
             limited to active cholangitis, unresolved biliary obstruction, biloma or abscess. Any&#xD;
             complications should be resolved within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             zanidatamab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active hepatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with uncontrolled disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant, and females and males planning a pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment, congestive heart failure (NYHA Class 3 or 4), or clinically significant&#xD;
             cardiac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc Fridericia (QTcF) &gt; 470 ms assessed within 30 days of screening&#xD;
