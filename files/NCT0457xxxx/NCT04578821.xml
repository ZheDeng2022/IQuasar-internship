      Advocacy is an effort to correct or change situations that affect people, society and&#xD;
      systems.The origin of advocacy is to provide active support in the Latin &quot;Advocates&quot;&#xD;
      dictionary. It is defined as &quot;defense work&quot; in Turkish dictionary advocacy is an ethical&#xD;
      dimension of nursing practices in nursing science that shows how nursing care is needed and&#xD;
      how the nurse will approach the individual, group and society in need.Social justice advocacy&#xD;
      has an increasing importance as people are affected by pressure from the social&#xD;
      system.Disease, weakness and early deaths are more common in ethnic and diverse races, poor&#xD;
      people and societies that do not receive services.Within the scope of advocacy, the duties&#xD;
      and responsibilities of individuals, families and society have been determined by laws and&#xD;
      regulations in order to protect and improve the health of the society. Advocacy is the&#xD;
      nurse's professional role and ethical responsibility.Total 80 students (İntervention and&#xD;
      control group)was selected randomly from 112 4 th grade student. Students were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the experimental group(n=40) and the control group(n=40). The experimental group&#xD;
      students will take advocacy intervention courses The control group students will the routine&#xD;
      curriculum. In this study, effect size will be determined with 5% error margin by using&#xD;
      sample size power analysis Gpower 3.1.9.2 program. Accordingly, it was calculated that 35&#xD;
      students were included in the intervention and control groups with 5% error margin and 80%&#xD;
      power. İt was decided to include at least 40 people in each working group with 20% surplus,&#xD;
      considering that they might be lost in data collection. Theoretical education, film and video&#xD;
      screening, case study, Social Security Institution (SSİ) Study, WEB based work, The student&#xD;
      will preparation of advocacy action plan, students prepared poster and advocacy awareness&#xD;
      activity, poster were exhibited at the campus. Data Collection Tools: Student Information&#xD;
      Form, Social Justice Advocacy Scale , Moral-Ethical Sensitivity Scale. Statistical&#xD;
      Analysis:Similarity of experimental and control groups; number, percentage, average and&#xD;
      standard deviation, pre-test, post test; scale scores difference in dependent groups t-test.&#xD;
