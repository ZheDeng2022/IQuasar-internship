  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test if coaching can improve program adherence to an online mental health&#xD;
      program in college students if delivered by undergraduate peers. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either receive phone coaching, text message coaching, or no coaching. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that participants who receive phone coaching will exhibit greater adherence&#xD;
      to the provided online mental health program than participants who receive text message&#xD;
      coaching or no coaching.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of an innovative peer&#xD;
      support coaching model for college students. The primary aim of the coaching model is to&#xD;
      increase participants' adherence to ACT Guide, an online mental health program. To test the&#xD;
      effects of peer-support coaching on ACT Guide adherence rates and outcomes, the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a randomized controlled trial with three conditions (peer-support phone&#xD;
      coaching, peer-support text message coaching, and a no support control group) using a sample&#xD;
      of 300 Utah State University undergraduate students. Individuals who indicate interest in&#xD;
      participating will complete an automated online workflow through Qualtrics which will include&#xD;
      informed consent, baseline assessment, ACT Guide registration, and randomization into one of&#xD;
      the three conditions. Participants will then gain access to a research version of ACT Guide,&#xD;
      either with no additional support, with concurrent peer-support coaching, or with concurrent&#xD;
      peer-support text messaging based on their randomly assigned condition. Coaching will take&#xD;
      place over 10 weeks, with the post assessment being administered 10 weeks after baseline&#xD;
      assessment. The investigators hypothesize that participants will adhere to coaching (80%&#xD;
      completing ≥ 6 coaching calls; 80% responding to texts &gt; 6 weeks), be satisfied with coaching&#xD;
      (M = 5 &quot;agree&quot; on a 6-point self-reported coaching satisfaction scale), and that coaching&#xD;
      fidelity will be maintained (80% of audited coaching calls/texts meeting criteria for&#xD;
      fidelity). The investigators also hypothesize that participants who receive peer-support&#xD;
      phone coaching will complete more ACT Guide modules and will report greater improvements in&#xD;
      mental health relative to both the text messaging and no support conditions, and that the&#xD;
      text messaging condition will perform greater in this regard than the no support condition.&#xD;

    <description>Participants assigned to the text messaging condition will receive weekly text messages from their peer-support coach throughout the 10 weeks that they use ACT Guide, an online program for general mental health. These text messages will reflect content delivered in the phone coaching group, but through a briefer protocol that accounts for the abbreviated, asynchronous nature of texting. Text messages will similarly focus on reinforcing adherence, problem solving non-adherence, strengthening ACT skills, and using ACT to increase program adherence. However, these areas will be covered in short messages and with limited exchanges between participants and coaches due to the asynchronous nature of texting.</description>
