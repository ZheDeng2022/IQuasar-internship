  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A post-market, prospective study to evaluate the reoperation rate of displaced and&#xD;
      nondisplaced femoral neck fractures treated with the Femoral Neck System (FNS)™&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the re-operation rate for any reason of displaced and non-displaced femoral neck&#xD;
      fractures treated with the Femoral Neck System (FNS)™ at one year post-operation. The Femoral&#xD;
      Neck System (FNS)™ represents a new generation of implants designed to improve outcomes in&#xD;
      the treatment of femoral neck fractures. These implants offer a fixed angle construct and all&#xD;
      of its mechanical advantages with regards to neutralizing shear and providing stability while&#xD;
      not exerting a rotational malreduction force on the fracture. The FNS system has been shown&#xD;
      to compare favorably to traditional fixed angle constructs in a cadaveric model&#xD;

    <time_frame>6-weeks, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go Test assesses mobility, balance, walking ability, and fall risk in adults by measuring time, in seconds, that it takes the individual to stand from a chair, walk a distance of 10 feet, walk back to the chair, and sit down. The subject will perform the test in their everyday footwear with their walking aid (cane, walker), if applicable.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6-weeks, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measurement of health outcome. It consists of a descriptive system with 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), which are each assigned five levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems) The first part (descriptive system with 5 dimensions) is scored using the Health state index scores. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is the value of a health state equivalent to dead; negative values representing values as worse than dead) to 1 (the value of full health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility.</description>

    <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measurement of health outcome. It consists of a descriptive system with 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), which are each assigned five levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems), as well as, a Visual Analogue Scale where subjects indicate a numerical value from 0-100 where 0 is the worst imaginable health state and 100 is the best imaginable health state.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6-weeks, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale is simply a line of fixed length, on which the subject marks their experience of pain with a single stroke of a pen - The subject will record their level of pain on a 100 mm visual analog scale - the scale will be marked 'no pain' on the left side of the scale and 'severe pain' at the right end of the scale</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Quality of Fracture Reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6-weeks, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits</time_frame>
    <description>Appropriate reduction will be defined as the principal compressive trabeculae measuring &gt;160° in the AP view and &lt;5° of posterior angulation in the lateral view. If reduction is acceptable in both views, it will be classified as grade I. Grade II will be indicative of one plane of malreduction, and grade III will be indicative of malreduction in both radiographic views.&#xD;
Pre-operative radiographs will be reviewed and classified as displaced (e.g. Garden III &amp; IV) or non-displaced (e.g. Garden I &amp; II) femoral neck fractures by the Investigator at each site Pauwel Classification (Type I - 30 degrees, Type II - 50 degrees, Type III - 70 degrees)</description>

    <measure>Active Straight Leg Raise (ASLR) Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6-weeks, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits</time_frame>
    <description>The ALSR assessment provides information about the ability of load transfer and motor control strategies in the lumbo/pelvic/hip complex. ASLR will be performed with the subject in a relaxed supine position with legs straight and feet apart. Subjects will be instructed to raise their operated leg 20cm above the examination table without bending the knee and without pelvic movement relative to the trunk. A score will be provided by the subject for the operated limb on a six-point Likert scale (0 = not difficult at all, 1 = minimally difficult; 2 = somewhat able to do, 3 = fairly difficult, 4 = very difficult, 5 = unable to do) -Lower score denotes better outcome</description>
