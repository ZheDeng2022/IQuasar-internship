&#xD;
          -  Subject is scheduled to undergo robotic prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node&#xD;
             dissection (ePLND) using an da Vinci® X/Xi Surgical System with Firefly® Fluorescent&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject must be treatment naïve (not having received neo-adjuvant therapy, radiation&#xD;
             therapy, hormonal therapy, androgen deprivation therapy within the last 4 months&#xD;
             excluding Finasteride, Dutasteride, or other 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, or focal&#xD;
             ablation techniques)&#xD;
