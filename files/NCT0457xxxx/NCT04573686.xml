      The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders&#xD;
      characterized by progressive peripheral cytopenia due to ineffective hematopoiesis and a&#xD;
      variable risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, they can range from variable grade of cytopenia to forms not different from AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) MDS classifications from 2002:&#xD;
&#xD;
      included refractory anemia (RA), refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), refractory&#xD;
      cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), RCMD and ring sideroblasts (RCMDRS), refractory&#xD;
      anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), and MDS associated with isolated del(5q) The most recent&#xD;
      2016 WHO MDS classifications are slightly different and include MDS with single lineage or&#xD;
      multilineage dysplasia, MDS with ring sideroblasts and single or multilineage dysplasia, MDS&#xD;
      with excess blasts, and MDS with isolated del(5q) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key first-line treatment option for many patients with symptomatic anemia associated with&#xD;
      lower-risk MDS is erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) (e.g., epoetin alpha&#xD;
      ordarbepoetinalpha),whichmayalsobecombinedwithgranulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF At&#xD;
      least, four mechanisms are recognized to underlie pancytopenia in myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;
      Based on ferrokinetic studies two distinct mechanisms can be distinguished: (1)&#xD;
      hypoproliferative suppressed erythropoiesis and (2) hypoproliferative/ineffective&#xD;
      erythropoiesis,The predictive variables for ESAs response in MDS should be divided into&#xD;
      biological and clinical variables. Biological variables include: endogenous erythropoietin&#xD;
      levels &lt; 500 U/L and marrow blasts &lt; 10%, IPSS low INT-1, diagnosis of refractory anemia, and&#xD;
      normal karyotype. On clinical plane, transfusion independence and short duration of disease&#xD;
      are positive prognostic factors of response to ESAS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      sEPO levels have not only been correlated with response to ESAs. Various studies have also&#xD;
      examined whether sEPO levels affect duration of response and overall survival among patients&#xD;
      treated with ESAs. Other studies have examined whether sEPO levels can affect response to&#xD;
      non-ESA treatments According to International Working Group criteria, erythroid response is&#xD;
      considered an increase in hemoglobin level to at least 115 g/L without transfusion need. An&#xD;
      increase in hemoglobin level of 15 g/L for patients with non-transfused anemia, or an&#xD;
      abolished transfusion need, defines the criteria for partial response. To date, there is only&#xD;
      a study assessing that Binocrit (Biosimilar epoetin alfa) is promising for the treatment of&#xD;
      anemia of MDS patients. ER positively correlates with improvements in patients' cognitive&#xD;
      status and positive changes in QOL after a median time of 2 years, 50% of patients may lose&#xD;
      responsivenes to ESAs. Many factors, including depletion of iron, progression to acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia, may be the underlying cause of loss responsiveness to ESAs. The first study&#xD;
      evaluating the duration of response to erythropoietin in MDS patients Serum ferritin (SF)&#xD;
      level represents a well-known indicator of the body's iron stores and inflammation. SF is&#xD;
      commonly used as a marker of iron overload (defined as SF1000 ng/ mL) but this role has been&#xD;
      often questioned, as SF value can be affected by acute infections, inflammations, and even&#xD;
      malignant conditions, so that it is also considered as an acute phase protein. Several&#xD;
      studies have evaluated tests other than the evaluation of SF level to estimate iron overload,&#xD;
      such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Superconducting Quantum Interference Device&#xD;
      (SQUID) biomagnetic liver susceptometry Elevated SF levels represent a common condition among&#xD;
      patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and appears to be largely related to red blood&#xD;
      cell (RBC) transfusion-dependence. However, iron overload is also present among many patients&#xD;
      after MDS diagnosis and before RBC transfusion Fibrinogen is a protein produced following&#xD;
      inflammation,and hyperfibrinogenemia is known as a poor prognostic factor in various tumors.&#xD;
      In recent years, it has also been reported that hyperfibrinogenemia is a poor prognostic&#xD;
      factor in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, whether hyperfibrinogenemia is a prognostic factor in patients with lower-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remains unclear&#xD;
