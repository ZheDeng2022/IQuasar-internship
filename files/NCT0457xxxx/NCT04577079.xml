  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital health technologies (DHT) are increasingly developed to support healthcare systems&#xD;
      around the world. However, they are frequently lacking evidence-based medicine and medical&#xD;
      validation. There is considerable need in the western countries to allocate healthcare&#xD;
      resources accurately and give the population detailed and reliable health information&#xD;
      enabling to take greater responsibility for their health. Intelligent patient flow management&#xD;
      system (IPFM, product name Klinik Frontline) is developed to meet these needs. In practice,&#xD;
      IPFM is used for decision support in the triaging and diagnostic processes as well as&#xD;
      automatizing the management of inflow of the patients. The core of the IPFM is a clinical&#xD;
      artificial intelligence (AI), which utilizes a comprehensive medical database of clinical&#xD;
      correlations generated by medical doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population of this research consists of patients from the Emergency Department of&#xD;
      Kuopio University Hospital (KUH). Data will be gathered during 2 weeks of piloting, after&#xD;
      which the results will be analysed. Anticipated number of patients to the study is minimum of&#xD;
      246 patients, with objective to be several hundreds. When attending to the hospital, patients&#xD;
      will report their demographics, background information and symptoms using structured IPFM&#xD;
      online form. Patients entering the unit in an ambulance or with need of immediate care of&#xD;
      healthcare professionals due to severe and acute conditions are referred similar to normal&#xD;
      process to ensure the patient safety. Results obtained from IPFM are blinded from the&#xD;
      healthcare professional and IPFM does not affect professional's clinical decision making in&#xD;
      any way. The data obtained from IPFM online form and clinical data from the emergency&#xD;
      department and KUH will be analysed after the data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the research is to validate the use of IPFM by evaluating the association of&#xD;
      IPFM output with 1) urgency and severity of the conditions (using Emergency Severity Index&#xD;
      [ESI], an international triaging protocol for emergency units, and an assessment by triage&#xD;
      nurse); and 2) actual diagnoses diagnosed by medical doctors. The main hypotheses of the&#xD;
      research are that 1) IPFM is safe and sensitive in evaluating the urgency of the conditions&#xD;
      of arriving patients at the emergency department and that 2) IPFM has sufficient correlation&#xD;
      of differential diagnosis with actual diagnosis made by medical doctor.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Continuous development of digital technology provides new opportunities also in&#xD;
           healthcare area. As healthcare costs are constantly growing both worldwide and in&#xD;
           Finland (1), innovations are needed to enhance allocation of limited healthcare&#xD;
           resources and to reduce economic burden. Digital health technologies (DHT) have the&#xD;
           potential to reduce these costs. They are increasingly developed to support healthcare&#xD;
           systems around the world. DHT are, however, often lacking evidence-based medicine (2)&#xD;
           and both the importance and the lack of their validation has been acknowledged widely&#xD;
           (3, 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Work in triage and urgent care centers is highly demanding, with considerable time&#xD;
           pressure. When operating with high patient volumes, acute conditions and severe stress,&#xD;
           human errors are likely to result at least at some extent. Physicians have been found to&#xD;
           have a ~5 % diagnostic error rate (5) with half of these potentially harmful (6). DHT&#xD;
           have been suggested to have a significant role helping both patient management and&#xD;
           triage (7), and thus, reducing also potential human errors. For instance, crude online&#xD;
           clinical decision support tool has been found to reliably demonstrate emergency triage&#xD;
           severity in experimental setting (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The validation of DHT and decision support tools is highly crucial. Tools with false&#xD;
           negative rates could have serious consequences when ignoring severe conditions such as&#xD;
           cardiac ischaemia (4). DHT should be thorough and optimal in the medical field and their&#xD;
           internal and external validity should have been evaluated. Recently, guidelines for&#xD;
           evaluating DHT have been published (4). According to guidelines, the first step in the&#xD;
           assessment is to show the results in an early observational study in clinical setting.&#xD;
           In addition to safety, also efficacy and effectiveness of DHT should be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To meet these needs, Intelligent Patient Flow Management system (IPFM) has been&#xD;
           developed to help the user (i.e. patient) and the healthcare professionals to evaluate&#xD;
           user's condition and its severity. IPFM enables semi-automated triaging of patients and&#xD;
           enhances the management of patient inflow and demand. In addition, IPFM provides written&#xD;
           and precise information for the healthcare professionals communicated by the patients&#xD;
           themselves of their conditions and symptoms. The core of IPFM is a broad medical&#xD;
           database generated by medical doctors, combined with artificial intelligence (AI) and&#xD;
           feedback loops for accuracy improvement. In other words, IPFM is an AI-induced triage&#xD;
           and decision support tool developed and monitored by medical doctors to help healthcare&#xD;
           professionals to evaluate the urgency of the patients. It evaluates user's condition and&#xD;
           infers the urgency using user demographics, background information and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The IPFM is developed by a healthcare technology company Klinik Healthcare Solutions Oy&#xD;
           and it has already been implemented in over 400 primary care and dental facilities in&#xD;
           the Nordics and was recently launched in the United Kingdom and Portugal. It has been&#xD;
           previously shown to reduce the costs in primary care by 14 % in overall total service&#xD;
           costs of the patients by streamlining the patient flow (8). IPFM is currently classified&#xD;
           and registered as a CE class 1 medical device, which requires continuous scientific&#xD;
           validation research and systematic development and quality management processes. The&#xD;
           system is used according to its intended use in this study and therefore the study does&#xD;
           not require permission or registration for FIMEA's clinical device study register.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Klinik's IPFM (product names Klinik Access, Klinik Frontline) provides a full-stack&#xD;
           solution, with interface for patient input, backend for database and algorithm&#xD;
           calculations and interface for handling of case outputs for triaging and combined&#xD;
           statistics for healthcare staff. IPFM uses medically golden standard Bayesian&#xD;
           methodology for inferring the effect of clinical features on the probabilities of the&#xD;
           conditions. The severity and the urgency of the condition is inferred using specific&#xD;
           severity symptoms and by setting a threshold for the probabilities of relevant&#xD;
           conditions. All inflow of data is dynamically gathered and analysed ensemble and&#xD;
           visualised, which can be used by (management) staff to monitor and optimally meet demand&#xD;
           ad hoc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aims and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main aim of this study is to validate the use of IPFM in a hospital setting by&#xD;
           evaluating the association of IPFM output with 1) clinical urgency and severity of the&#xD;
           conditions (using Emergency Severity Index [ESI], an international triaging protocol for&#xD;
           emergency units, and an assessment by triage nurse); and 2) actual diagnoses made by the&#xD;
           hospital doctors. The objective is also to assess the correlation of IPFM output with&#xD;
           redirection or referral to various specialties (e.g. internist or surgeon).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Main hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IPFM is safe (&lt; 1 % emergency cases missed) and accurate (&gt; 80 % agreement with&#xD;
                triaging nurse) in evaluating the urgency of the conditions of arriving patients at&#xD;
                the emergency department&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IPFM has sufficient correlation (&gt; 60 % overlap) of differential diagnosis with&#xD;
                actual diagnosis diagnosed by medical doctor&#xD;
&#xD;
           Validating IPFM, an AI-induced triage support and decision support tool, in real-life&#xD;
           environment and in hospital setting is essential for its use in hospitals and clinical&#xD;
           work in the future to support evidence-based medicine. An accurate and efficient tool&#xD;
           will decrease delays of treatment of urgent conditions and has the potential to decrease&#xD;
           human errors that are inevitable in environment with high patient volumes, acute&#xD;
           conditions and severe stress. When in full implementation, it can also help to optimize&#xD;
           emergency department resources and to target them more accurately. In addition, this&#xD;
           study provides important information on patient history and symptoms provided by&#xD;
           patients themselves when entering emergency department compared to clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study population consists of patients entering the emergency department of Kuopio&#xD;
           University Hospital (KUH) during a 2-week research period. The calculated needed sample&#xD;
           size is a minimum of 246 patients (confidence level 95%, margin of error 5%, study&#xD;
           population proportion 80%). The data consists of registry data from the electronic&#xD;
           health records, other quantitative data (such as extracts from KUH emergency department&#xD;
           reporting software) and qualitative data acquired through observation. Both qualitative&#xD;
           and statistical methods will be applied to the data to infer outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Case-specific information in the IPFM (demographics, background information, symptoms)&#xD;
           provided by the patient will be analyzed with clinical data (Emergency Severity Class&#xD;
           index (ESI), triage category, diagnoses) collected from the electronic patient records&#xD;
           of the hospital (emergency and other possible departments) and IPFM professional&#xD;
           dashboard, and the safety, specificity and sensitivity of IPFM output are analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The urgency of the condition is evaluated by IPFM and the analyses with clinical data&#xD;
           and validation will be performed after the data collection. They urgency is evaluated by&#xD;
           IPFM as: 1. suitable for self-care if no prescription medication or other treatment is&#xD;
           suggested (i.e. doesn't require doctor's evaluation, however might benefit from nurse&#xD;
           check-up and advice); 2. non-urgent if ailment is prolonged or chronic, but benefits&#xD;
           from doctor's evaluation and would more efficiently be managed through non-urgent&#xD;
           appointment (&gt; 3 days); 3. urgent if ailment is (semi-)acute and benefits from doctor's&#xD;
           evaluation within 1-3 days; and 4. emergency if ailment requires evaluation and&#xD;
           treatment within the same day (or immediately) to avoid risk of serious health hazard.&#xD;
           This output is correlated with the ESI classification used by KUH emergency and other&#xD;
           data collected from electronic health records regarding urgency of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When attending to the hospital, patients will report their demographics, background&#xD;
           information, symptoms, other case specific data and satisfaction using structured IPFM&#xD;
           online form. Patients entering the unit in an ambulance or with need of immediate care&#xD;
           due to severe and acute conditions are managed through traditional process: they do not&#xD;
           fill the form and, hence, are out of scope of the pre-evaluation process and this study.&#xD;
           All information gathered is transferred to the IPFM dashboard, where the patient&#xD;
           reported clinical information, AI-induced suggestions on the urgency of the care needed&#xD;
           and potential diagnosis (a differential of 3-10 probable diagnosis) is demonstrated.&#xD;
           However, in this study design, healthcare professionals cannot see any clinical&#xD;
           information in the IPFM dashboard, i.e. the output of IPFM is blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient data will be saved to the registry from IPFM: 1) age; 2) gender; 3) duration of&#xD;
           the symptoms; 4) body location of the symptoms; 5) symptoms chosen from the symptom&#xD;
           cloud(s) by the patient (symptom cloud is dynamic, consist of 430 potential symptoms,&#xD;
           symptom selection varies depending on the previous actions of the patient); 6) severity&#xD;
           symptoms chosen from the severity symptom cloud (severity symptom cloud is dynamic,&#xD;
           consist of 100 potential severity symptoms, selection varies depending on the previous&#xD;
           actions of the patient); 7) free text fields regarding the selected symptoms; 8) answers&#xD;
           (yes/no) to the questions: a) have you used any medication or other treatment for your&#xD;
           ailment, b) has someone (e.g. a physician or a physiotherapist) already examined or&#xD;
           treated your ailment; 9) identification number of the form; 10) unique case id number;&#xD;
           11) name; 12) social security number; and 13) telephone number.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the primary IPFM data collection stage at the beginning of each ER visit, a&#xD;
           secondary stage of data retrieval is initiated after the study period. During this only&#xD;
           critical information required to assess the validity of the IPFM system outcomes will be&#xD;
           fetched from the electronic health care system: 1) ESI classification; 2)&#xD;
           diagnosis/diagnoses of the patient; 3) speciality &amp; care path chosen in the urgency&#xD;
           care; 4) traditional non-ESI urgency assessment comparable to our urgency scale (if&#xD;
           stored). The final data points will be equivalent to these, but might due to changes in&#xD;
           ER practices and/or data systems vary. The data points are chosen to optimally allow&#xD;
           comparative analysis of results. This information is only used after data collection&#xD;
           when evaluating the validity of IPFM.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite excluding patients with need of acute immediate care of healthcare professionals&#xD;
           (arriving with an ambulance), also children/adolescents and patients with otherwise&#xD;
           restricted capabilities or developmental disorders are excluded from the study. Adult&#xD;
           patients with mild mental disorders can be included, excluding the patients with&#xD;
           guardian. Additionally, pregnant or breastfeeding patients are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ethical aspects of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participation to the study is voluntary for the patients. After receiving oral and&#xD;
           written information on location at KUH emergency department, patients will sign an&#xD;
           informed consent form. As described in the chapter 5, the study protocol will not harm&#xD;
           any study subjects and will not interfere negatively in their treatment. The patients&#xD;
           participate in the study only once, on location when arriving to the emergency&#xD;
           department, and thus no further activity nor financial burden is generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An independent research data registry will be generated for this study. When creating&#xD;
           the registry, social security number or telephone number is used to merge the data from&#xD;
           electronic health records and IPFM. After the data has been merged and the combined&#xD;
           registry is created, randomly generated case ids are used as research subject&#xD;
           identifiers and information that allows for identification of single patients is not&#xD;
           available. The merging of the data is done by the KYS staff prior to access into&#xD;
           research registry being granted for the research group. The combined research registry&#xD;
           will be stored in a digital format, on a computer owned only by the research group&#xD;
           members. There will be a password protection for a user to enter a) the computer and b)&#xD;
           the registry file itself. The file will be stored on a local folder not accessed online&#xD;
           (i.e. not a cloud storage folder). The registry file will be stored for five (5) years&#xD;
           after the research has deemed finished and will be deleted after the period according to&#xD;
           the required handling standards. The administrator of the case ids is the person&#xD;
           responsible of the project and Klinik Healthcare Solutions Oy is responsible for storing&#xD;
           the registry file. The study will be registered into international &quot;ClinicalTrials.gov&quot;&#xD;
           research register. The results of this project will be reported in a group level and,&#xD;
           thus, no individual information can be recognized.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The application for the ethical committee will be submitted in May 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Risk assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           The healthcare professionals are evaluating the patients by their own clinical judgement&#xD;
           and they do not utilize output of IPFM in their decision making. IPFM data is only&#xD;
           assessed after the data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is a potential risk of acquiring volunteers below the intended volume for the&#xD;
           study. This will be addressed by extending the study period or overlap of daily working&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is a hypothetical risk of causing undesired delay in the registration process of&#xD;
           the patients that would cause critical cases to be missed due to increased waiting times&#xD;
           for the registration. Our previous user studies have shown that filling out the IPFM&#xD;
           form takes circa 3-5 minutes, which would not be a life threatening delay for walk-in&#xD;
           patients. This risk will be monitored and if noticed, managed in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Time schedule and funding plans&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is initially planned to be executed between 1.7.2020 and 30.6.2023. Duration&#xD;
           of the data collection is approximately 2 weeks and is designed to complete during fall&#xD;
           2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The project is anticipated to have a small scale economic effect for the parties. The&#xD;
           patients in this study will not experience any economic harm. The service provider&#xD;
           Klinik Healthcare Solutions Oy will cover for the costs of it's researchers and&#xD;
           assisting staff in the form of a moderate hourly pay. The service provider will also&#xD;
           provide the digital equipment used in the research in collecting the information from&#xD;
           the patients. In the approval of the equipment it will work closely with the ICT&#xD;
           department of Kuopio University Hospital District. The hospital or the emergency&#xD;
           department will not have any additional costs regarding the research project. There are&#xD;
           no additional economical compensations to the researchers or to the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Research group, resources and conflicts of interest&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research group consists of MD, PhD Juhani Määttä (Medical Research Center Oulu,&#xD;
           University of Oulu), MD, PhD candidate Petteri Hirvonen (University of Helsinki), MD&#xD;
           Rony Lindell (University of Helsinki) and PhD Tero Martikainen, chief doctor of Kuopio&#xD;
           University Hospital A&amp;E department.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Juhani Määttä, Petteri Hirvonen and Rony Lindell have financial and business interests&#xD;
           in Klinik Healthcare Solutions Oy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Expected results and scientific impact&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to validate high accuracy (i.e. safe and reliable usability) of IPFM&#xD;
      tool in KUH hospital context. The results are generalizable to other hospital emergency&#xD;
      departments, however with caution by doing contextual analysis and process comparisons prior&#xD;
      to implementation considerations. Through assessing IPFM output with data from patient's&#xD;
      electronic health records, the study is expected to show: 1) strong correlation of the&#xD;
      urgency category; and 2) good correlation between calculated differential diagnosis and the&#xD;
      diagnoses of ED or ward doctors. The purpose is to publish the results in internationally&#xD;
      recognized medical journals with high quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our review of the literature on this subject, an AI-supported automation of the&#xD;
      inbound patient traffic in an emergency department setting has not been studied previously,&#xD;
      especially not in this scale and patient variation. An increasing public and professional&#xD;
      interest is arising regarding AI-based solutions to support professionals in their work and&#xD;
      decision making. To meet these needs, this study provides and scientifically validates a&#xD;
      solution which works semi-independently, taking up initial tasks normally reserved for&#xD;
      healthcare professionals. The research group anticipates this being of great interest to the&#xD;
      scientific community - and will add to the discussion of the possibilities of the DHT to&#xD;
      provide marked cost-effectiveness while not compromising on patient safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of the use of professional resources.&#xD;

    <description>The main aim of this study is to validate the use of IPFM in a hospital setting by evaluating the association of IPFM output with 1) clinical urgency and severity of the conditions (using Emergency Severity Index [ESI], an international triaging protocol for emergency units, and an assessment by triage nurse); and 2) actual diagnoses made by the hospital doctors. The objective is also to assess the correlation of IPFM output with redirection or referral to various specialties</description>
