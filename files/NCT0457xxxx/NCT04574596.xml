      This is a prospective, observational, multicenter, case-control study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational cohort study. A total of 300 subjects will be enrolled. Cases are&#xD;
      defined as unique subjects who have a monomicrobial blood culture positive for growth of 3rd&#xD;
      Generation Cephalosporin Resistant Escherichia coli (3GCR-Ec), defined as resistance to&#xD;
      ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, during hospitalization. For each case, the next available unique&#xD;
      subject from the same study site, with a monomicrobial blood culture positive for growth of&#xD;
      3rd Generation Cephalosporin Sensitive Escherichia coli (3GCS-Ec) during hospitalization will&#xD;
      be included as a control. A waiver of informed consent and HIPAA will be requested. This is a&#xD;
      minimal risk study without any direct subject contact. In addition, no subject information&#xD;
      will be collected that is not part of routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trigger for enrollment in the study will be the identification in a participating local&#xD;
      microbiology laboratory of a 3GCR-Ec in a monomicrobial blood culture. These will be reported&#xD;
      to study personnel at the study site, who will evaluate eligibility. If the subject is deemed&#xD;
      eligible, the 3GCR-Ec isolate will be saved for shipping to the Laboratory Center, and the&#xD;
      isolate also saved at the local laboratory. Sites will be advised to destroy any samples&#xD;
      saved at the local laboratory as part of this study at the end of the study. The local&#xD;
      microbiology laboratory, or designee, will then identify the next subject available with a&#xD;
      3GCS-Ec in a blood culture. These will also be reported to study personnel for evaluation of&#xD;
      eligibility as a control. If the control subject is eligible, the corresponding 3GCS-Ec&#xD;
      isolate will be saved for shipping to the Laboratory Center, and the isolate will also be&#xD;
      saved at the local laboratory . Sites will be advised to destroy any samples saved at the&#xD;
      local laboratory as part of this study at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cases and controls, clinical data will be collected from the electronic health records&#xD;
      (EHR) for up to 30 days after the index blood culture. Data collection will be performed by&#xD;
      study personnel at the site into a central, secure, research database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One E. coli isolate per study subject will be collected from the index blood culture. No&#xD;
      other biologic samples will be collected. Data will be entered at or after the 30-day time&#xD;
      point. There will be no long-term follow-up for subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the use of oral step down therapy in subjects with 3GCR-Ec and 3GCS-Ec&#xD;
      bacteremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the treatment regimens used in subjects with 3GCR-Ec and 3GCS-Ec bacteremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the association between duration of intravenous antibiotics and Inverse&#xD;
           Probability Weighting (IPW)-adjusted Desirability Of Outcome Ranking (DOOR) outcomes at&#xD;
           30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the association between total duration of antibiotics and IPW-adjusted DOOR&#xD;
           outcomes at 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine risk factors on days 0, 3, 5, and 7 after first positive blood culture for&#xD;
           poor outcomes (either DOOR composite score or individual outcomes) at 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To describe phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of bacterial isolates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is minimal risk to study participants, and has no data safety monitoring board.&#xD;
