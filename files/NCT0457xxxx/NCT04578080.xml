    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of anodal- and cathodal tDCS combined with&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy for 5 consecutive sessions on motor functions and brain&#xD;
      activity in acute stroke patients at immediate and 1-month follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke or cerebrovascular accident is a leading cause of disabilities. Physical therapy is a&#xD;
      standard treatment to help motor recovery after stroke. However, disabilities remained in&#xD;
      some stroke patients despite intensive training. After stroke, there are changes of cortical&#xD;
      excitability and brain activity in both hemispheres. Lesioned hemisphere decreases cortical&#xD;
      excitability and increases number of low-frequency brain activity, while non-lesioned&#xD;
      hemisphere increases cortical excitability and increases number of high-frequency brain&#xD;
      activity. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique which delivers weak&#xD;
      direct current through scalp and can be used as an adjunctive treatment. Anodal tDCS can&#xD;
      increase cortical excitability and amount of high-frequency brain activity while cathodal&#xD;
      tDCS can decrease cortical excitability and increase amount of high-frequency brain activity.&#xD;
      Increase amount of high-frequency brain activity in the lesioned hemisphere can indicate&#xD;
      better recovery of stroke. Meta-analysis has reported benefits of both anodal and cathodal&#xD;
      tDCS for motor recovery in stroke patients. However, only few studies have investigated tDCS&#xD;
      effects in acute phase of stroke which is a crucial time for enhancing motor recovery. This&#xD;
      study aims to investigate the effects of anodal- and cathodal tDCS combined with conventional&#xD;
      physical therapy for 5 consecutive sessions on motor functions and brain activity in acute&#xD;
      stroke patients at immediate and 1-month follow-up. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      into 3 groups (sham-, anodal- and cathodal tDCS). Participants in the anodal and cathodal&#xD;
      groups will receive 1.5 mA tDCS for 20 minutes before physical therapy programs for 5&#xD;
      consecutive sessions, while sham group will receive sham tDCS with physical therapy. Brain&#xD;
      activity by electroencephalography and motor performances by Fugl-Meyer Assessment and Wolf&#xD;
      Motor Function Test will be evaluated at baseline, post-intervention (day 5) and follow-up at&#xD;
      1 month. We hypothesize that anodal- and cathodal tDCS combined with physical therapy for 5&#xD;
      consecutive days can immediately increase number of high-frequency brain activity and improve&#xD;
      motor functions and this effect will last for a month compared to sham group.&#xD;
