  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 300,000 U.S. children experience injuries that require them to be hospitalized this&#xD;
      year. These children, and their caregivers, are at high risk for emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      problems, as well as poor quality of life. Trauma centers in the US have good outcomes for&#xD;
      survival and physical recovery, but they typically do not have programs to address the&#xD;
      emotional and behavioral needs of families. The purpose of this project is to develop a&#xD;
      service that achieves this and that can serve as a good model for trauma centers to use. This&#xD;
      project will develop, evaluate, and test CAARE (Caregivers' Aid to Accelerate Recovery after&#xD;
      pediatric Emergencies) to address the behavioral and emotional needs of caregivers and&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project consists of three main study aims. The first aim is to finalize the CAARE model&#xD;
      and research protocol in preparation for the open trial (Aim 2). To complete this study Aim,&#xD;
      CAARE will first be refined guided by preliminary work led by the PI with caregivers after&#xD;
      pediatric traumatic injury (PTI). Then, we will conduct usability testing and refine the&#xD;
      mHealth components of CAARE with about 10 caregivers in preparation for the open trial (Aim&#xD;
      2). Finally, we will debug the research protocol via implementation of the full CAARE&#xD;
      intervention with approximately 5 families prior to conducting the open trial. Aim 2, the&#xD;
      open trial, is described in more detail in the Arms/Intervention section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 is to assess CAARE implementation feasibility with families, trauma center leaders, and&#xD;
      program managers. This will be conducted through qualitative interviews with (1) ~20&#xD;
      caregivers who participated in the open trial - diverse with respect to race, child age, and&#xD;
      mental health status - to assess their reactions to CAARE; (2) ~15 pediatric trauma center&#xD;
      directors and ~15 pediatric trauma program managers to identify perceived barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators associated with implementing CAARE in pediatric trauma centers.&#xD;

    <description>Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale (PEDS; caregiver proxy report ages 2-11); 21-item parent-report measure was designed to assess and screen for elevated symptomatology in children following exposure to a stressful and/or traumatic event; The measure yields scores on the following scales: 1) Anxious/Withdrawn, 2) Fearful, and 3) Acting Out.</description>

    <description>PROMIS General Life Satisfaction (Caregiver QOL) consists of 10 items that assess general domains of health and functioning including overall physical health, mental health, social health, pain, fatigue, and overall perceived quality of life. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PEDSQL) consists of 23 items in that comprise four Generic Core Scales: Physical Functioning (8 items), Emotional Functioning (5 items), Social Functioning (5 items), and School Functioning (5 items). Items on the PedsQL are reverse scored and transformed to a 0-100 scale. Higher scores indicate better health related quality of life.</description>

    <description>The intervention, CAARE (Caregivers' Aid to Accelerate Recovery after pediatric Emergencies), consists of four components: First, all caregivers of PTI patients (ages 0-11) will be given brief education in the hospital related to children's and caregivers' emotional recovery. Second, all families will receive an in-hospital risk-reduction session. These sessions will address avoidance and trauma triggers; scheduling of pleasurable activities; and coping strategies. Third, all caregivers will receive the CAARE app-based components before discharge. The app will engage caregivers for 30 days via an automated SMS system. MHealth components of care will reinforce risk-reduction strategies. Fourth, 30 days post-discharge, a brief behavioral health screen will be completed by caregiver and child to assess need for more intensive screening by a mental health provider. Caregivers/children reporting elevated symptom levels will receive a comprehensive screening and referral process.</description>
