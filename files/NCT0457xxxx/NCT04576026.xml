  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      15 healthy trained males will volunteer to participate in this study. there will be 2&#xD;
      treatments: Ketone esters supplementation and iso-caloric carbohydrate. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effect of ketone esters on cognitive function during exercise after&#xD;
      induced mental fatigue&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      mental fatigue is often seen in sports of moderate to long duration. its onset is associated&#xD;
      with detriments in cognitive function which leads to poor decision making and detriments in&#xD;
      specific sport skills. Ketones can serve as a powerful brain fuel source so they may have the&#xD;
      potential to delay/ revert the onset of mental fatigue. in this experiment, we will induce&#xD;
      mental fatigue in individuals who will be performing 45 minutes of intermittent exercise&#xD;
      right after. During exercise cognitive function will be measured under 2 condition, Ketone&#xD;
      supplementation and placebo. The purpose of this study is to see if ketones can play a role&#xD;
      in reverting that initial mental fatigue during exercise, compared to placebo.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a double blind repeated measures cross over study. There will be two treatments involved: Ketone esters supplements and iso-caloric carbohydrates (placebo). Participants will complete the protocol twice and the treatment order will be systematically rotated to avoid any order effect. Design of the study is composed of a mental fatiguing task, followed by a 45 minute simulated soccer game (second half). Cognitive function will be assessed during the 45 minutes of exercise. All participants will perform the protocol in a fed state (4 h after consumption of their last meal)</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants and investigators will be blinded as an individual not involved in the project will assemble and distribute the treatment (drinks) according to a coding system that is kept confidential until the study is completed. Participants will complete the protocol twice and the treatment order will be systematically rotated to avoid any order effect. taste and texture of treatments will be matched and will be distribute in opaque bottles to keep participant blinded</masking_description>
