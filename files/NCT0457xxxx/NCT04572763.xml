    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the combination of two drugs, copanlisib and venetoclax, as&#xD;
      a possible treatment for trelapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Copanlisib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multi-center, non-randomized phase I/II study of the combination&#xD;
      treatment copanlisib + venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I clinical trials test the safety of investigational drugs, and also try to define the&#xD;
      appropriate dose of the investigational drugs to use for further studies. Phase II clinical&#xD;
      trials test the safety and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs&#xD;
      work in treating a specific disease.&quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copanlisib is an IV medication that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received&#xD;
      at least two prior therapies. Venetoclax is an oral medication that is approved by the U.S.&#xD;
      FDA for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and certain patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The FDA&#xD;
      has not approved copablisib or venetoclax for the treatment of DLBCL or the combination of&#xD;
      copanlisib and venetoclax as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I portion of this study, the investigators are looking to determine the dose of&#xD;
      venetoclax that is safe to give with copanlisib and to see what the side effects are of this&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase II trial, the investigators will be determining how effective venetoclax and&#xD;
      copanlisib are for the treatment of R/R DLBCL. Data from laboratory suggest that some subsets&#xD;
      of DLBCL are enriched for mutations that make them sensitive to the combination of copanlisib&#xD;
      plus venetoclax. This study will look at genetic changes in your cancer and determine if&#xD;
      abnormalities in specific genes make these drugs more or less effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 48 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bayer, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing the study&#xD;
      drug copanlisib and funding for this study. Abbvie, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting&#xD;
      this research study by providing the study drug venetoclax and funding for this study.&#xD;

             of the informed consent form and 6 months for WOCBP and for men after the last&#xD;
             administration of study treatment. A woman is considered of childbearing potential,&#xD;
             i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently&#xD;
             sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include but are not limited to hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined&#xD;
             as no menses for continuous 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high&#xD;
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to&#xD;
             confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal&#xD;
             replacement therapy. The investigator or a designated associate is requested to advise&#xD;

             (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion,&#xD;
             vasectomized partner, use of two forms of birth control, and sexual abstinence. The&#xD;
             use of condoms by male patients is required unless the female partner is permanently&#xD;
             sterile.&#xD;
