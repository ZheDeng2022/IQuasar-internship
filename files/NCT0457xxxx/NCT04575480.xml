  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no consensus about the required time intervals between repeated SWL sessions applied&#xD;
      for renal stones with some centers waiting for 3 days, others for one week and others up to&#xD;
      one month to repeat lithotripsy. In the 2019 EUA guidelines stated that &quot;There are no&#xD;
      conclusive data on the intervals required between repeated SWL sessions. However, clinical&#xD;
      experience indicates that repeat sessions are feasible (within 1 day for ureteral stones).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intense use of ESWL currently, the lack of knowledge about acute lesions caused by&#xD;
      re-treatment within a short time interval and the empirical way by which treatment is&#xD;
      conducted, stimulated us to search for a precise answers to the question What the ideal time&#xD;
      interval between SWL sessions in the treatment of renal stone patients should be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will be conducted at Urology and Nephrology Center in&#xD;
      Mansoura, Egypt. Patients more than 18 years old with single primary renal stone fulfilling&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to 3 groups (50 patients each).Group 1 will&#xD;
      undergo SWL with 3 days between each session. Group 2 will undergo SWL with 7 days between&#xD;
      each session and Group 3 will undergo SWL with 14 days between each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study parameters will be renal damage including the following items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tubular damage will be assessed through estimation of changes in urinary excretion of&#xD;
           renal tubular enzyme kidney injury molecule 1(KIM-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glomerular damage will be assessed by estimation of proteinuria and changes in GFR&#xD;
           calculated by renal isotope scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal morphological and haemodynamic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment success is defined as clinically insignificant residual fragments less than 4&#xD;
           mm size.&#xD;
