  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a condition where scar tissue (called fibrosis) builds&#xD;
      up in the lungs. It usually gets worse over time. Fibrosis causes the lungs to become stiff,&#xD;
      and reduces the amount of oxygen that the lungs can take up. People with IPF complain of&#xD;
      worsening breathlessness, which limits their day to day activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function tests are breathing tests that measure how well your lungs are working, and are&#xD;
      used by doctors to decide whether to start or stop medicines in people with IPF. However,&#xD;
      people with IPF tell us that lung function tests require a lot of effort, can make them cough&#xD;
      and feel very short of breath. About 1 in 5 people with IPF are unable to perform lung&#xD;
      function results accurately. This might unfairly lead to some people with IPF not receiving&#xD;
      the right medications or for their medications to be stopped too soon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impulse oscillometry (iOS) uses sound waves to measure the stiffness of the lung, and has&#xD;
      been used successfully in children who are unable to perform normal lung function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the research is to see whether changes in iOS measures can give useful&#xD;
      information about the lungs in patients with IPF; for example, by judging the overall impact&#xD;
      of the disease on the lungs, or predicting future deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will look at how iOS changes over time in patients with IPF, and to see whether these&#xD;
      measurements can tell us about whether IPF is getting worse or predict important health&#xD;
      events, such as hospital admission. We will compare change in iOS with changes in other tests&#xD;
      used to monitor IPF and with patient reported ratings of change in their condition. This will&#xD;
      help decide the amount of iOS change that is noticed and considered meaningful by people with&#xD;
      IPF.&#xD;
