  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a technical feasibility of MR-guided SBRT fraction&#xD;
      dose adaptation for low-risk, intermediate-risk and low-volume metastatic prostate cancer. .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypofractionated SBRT to 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions (fraction dose 7.25 Gy) for low- and&#xD;
      intermediate risk prostate cancer is standard of care. Using higher fraction doses that might&#xD;
      be beneficial for disease control is not safe in all patients, unless adaptive treatment is&#xD;
      performed. In this clinical trial the feasibility of online MR-guided SBRT fraction dose&#xD;
      adaptation (between 7 and 8 Gy) for prostate cancer will be investigated. A fraction dose to&#xD;
      the planning target volume (PTV) will be adapted to organs-at-risk (OAR) geometry (position,&#xD;
      shape and volume) on online planning MRI scans of the treatment day (&quot;geometry-of-the-day&quot;).&#xD;
      Thus the investigators hope to maximize treatment individualization.&#xD;
