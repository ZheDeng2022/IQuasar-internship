  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, single arm, multicenter efficacy study, consisting of 60 subjects&#xD;
      who will complete the study (note: if any patients are lost to follow-up or withdrawn,&#xD;
      enrollment will increase to compensate for loss of these subjects). The subjects will receive&#xD;
      up to 16 RD1 applications. In case of complete healing, subject will be called for one&#xD;
      confirmatory visit two weeks later or before discharge from the SNF (the earlier of the two).&#xD;
      Subject data will be kept in each site's records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All diabetic subjects' glycemic management will be performed by a qualified physician. All&#xD;
      subjects will have wound care specialist or wound surgeon or dermatologist involved in their&#xD;
      wound care&#xD;

The anticoagulant allows the clot to form later in a controlled fashion-citrate is a widely used anticoagulant. The blood is then placed in the clotting tray (within few minutes) and the coagulation is facilitated by adding calcium and kaolin (insoluble aluminum silicate). The forming clot assumes the shape of the tray containing it, and can then be applied to the wound, and then covered with primary and secondary dressings.</description>
