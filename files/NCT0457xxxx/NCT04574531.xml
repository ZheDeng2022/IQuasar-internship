      The aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic performance of grey scale US , US&#xD;
      elastography &amp; color Doppler US in differentiating breast masses comparable with&#xD;
      histopathology as a gold standard.&#xD;

      Breast cancer is the most fre¬quently diagnosed cancer and the chief cause of cancer death&#xD;
      among women worldwide, with an es¬timated 1.7 million cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer alone accounts for 25% of all cancer cases and 15% of all cancer deaths among&#xD;
      females .so, Its high incidence has led to research on new diagnostic imaging techniques for&#xD;
      early diagnosis and to improve patient's mortality rate[1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of imaging techniques together with other investigation would help clinical&#xD;
      decision making. the most important factor in reducing mortality of certain cancers is an&#xD;
      early diagnosis of cancer via screening based on imaging[2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      US is an accurate method for detection of breast masses ; however, US has a low accuracy in&#xD;
      differentiating between benign from malignant breast masses . US could suggest a malignancy&#xD;
      likelihood criteria of a breast mass, such as hypoechogenicity, irregular margins,&#xD;
      microcalcifications, increased vascularity by Doppler and us elastography [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound elastography provides a non-invasive evaluation of the &quot;stiffness&quot; of a lesion.&#xD;
      Recent studies show that ultrasonographic elastogra¬phy (USE) provides higher diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy together with Doppler application compared with conventional B-mode ultrasonography&#xD;
      during breast cancer diagnosis, which eventually helps to reduce false-positive results (ie,&#xD;
      increased specificity) and therefore is useful in avoiding breast biopsy[4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      US elastography has been used to detect the nature of breast lesions , by measuring the&#xD;
      tissue stiffness non invasively. It depends on tissue deformation strain that is caused by&#xD;
      external compression. it is complementary to gray scale findings particularly in lesions with&#xD;
      indeterminate US findings, also US elastography could be used to guide the follow up of&#xD;
      leisons diagnosed as benign at ( FNA) fine needle aspiration.[5][6]&#xD;

        All patients will subjected to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        Full history taking, clinical examination by referring physician . Then the patient will be&#xD;
        examined by Gray scale US , doppler and elastography at Radiology department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        On Gray scale:Echogenicity of the mass with respect to normal breast parenchyma, diameter&#xD;
        A/T ,margins and calcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        While on Color Doppler, to describe the vascular patterns. Masses and axillary lymph nodes&#xD;
        (if detected) will be identified as nonvascular or vascular (peripheral, central, or mix).&#xD;
&#xD;
        (A) Strain elastography Color coding is classified into 5 groups according to the Ueno&#xD;
        classification, score one (softest component) and score five (hardest component) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        (B) Shear wave elastography A ROI rectangular box was adjusted on the observed target&#xD;
        lesion including sufficient amount of surrounding healthy breast tissue.&#xD;
