  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2017, it is estimated that nearly 60,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in&#xD;
      France. Although several treatments are indicated in this context, chemotherapy remains a&#xD;
      curability option whose place today extends to small tumors to support its increasingly&#xD;
      approved administration contributing to a continuous increase in survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, diagnostic procedures and anti-cancer treatments are frequently responsible for&#xD;
      toxicity that can reach high levels of severity and even generate sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These physical and psychological after-effects of breast cancer treatment have a short and&#xD;
      medium-term impact on the quality of life of the patients treated: anxiety, fear, pain, job&#xD;
      loss, and the onset of precariousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, surgical procedures such as PAC and pic-line surgery are often associated with&#xD;
      anxiety and pain. Chemotherapy is particularly associated with anxiety, stress, fatigue,&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some immediate, delayed or even anticipated side effects are not always effectively&#xD;
      controlled by the medication available to us. Anti-nausea medications can lead to drug&#xD;
      interactions and/or other adverse effects. The interest of a non-drug approach is to get rid&#xD;
      of these adverse effects. However, it is underestimated and therefore currently not&#xD;
      integrated into current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its benefits must therefore be explored within the framework of in-depth research protocols&#xD;
      that justify our study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of virtual reality (VR) technology as a non-pharmacological tool has developed public&#xD;
      interest in improving the control of certain adverse effects induced by chemotherapy. A few&#xD;
      small studies suggest that the use of VR during chemotherapy helps reduce anxiety, fatigue&#xD;
      and nausea and vomiting. Schneider showed improvement in stress-related symptoms such as&#xD;
      anxiety in children aged 10 years and older receiving chemotherapy treatment during a VR&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar study showed a reduction in anxiety in patients receiving chemotherapy for breast&#xD;
      cancer treatment coupled with VR. Dr. Hoffman is recognized as a pioneer in the use of VR,&#xD;
      which he has proven to be effective in the care of burn patients, coupled with a technique&#xD;
      that some have called VR analgesia. He has demonstrated that this technology used in this&#xD;
      setting is a novel non-pharmacological approach to improving pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project involves the use of a VR module associated with an application delivering&#xD;
      hypnotherapy combined with cognitive behavioral therapy that could help improve the adverse&#xD;
      effects attributable to chemotherapy. The hypnotherapy that has been shown to be medically&#xD;
      effective since its discovery by Mesmer is Ericksonian hypnosis. It usually involves an&#xD;
      exchange between the therapist and the patient over a period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      marked (suggestion, induction, fascination, dissociation, amplification) which has evolved in&#xD;
      our institution in a less elaborate form called &quot;conversational hypnosis&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, VR hypnotherapy appears to be a promising alternative. To date, there are a&#xD;
      few studies that demonstrate the reduction of anxiety through the use of this tool during the&#xD;
      application of PACs and pick-lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The innovation of this study is to report the effects of a combination of hypnotherapy using&#xD;
      VR through a program aimed at modifying the experience of adverse effects due to PAC and&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the care pathway of breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also be compared to what is called in our institution and practiced routinely:&#xD;
      conversational hypnosis which is not Ericksonian hypnosis strictly speaking but because of&#xD;
      the parameters mentioned above: time, human resources load has become a simple benevolent&#xD;
      conversation that welcomes the patient in every step of his care.&#xD;
