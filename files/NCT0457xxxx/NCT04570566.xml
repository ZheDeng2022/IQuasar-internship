      zone, from histological, radiographical and clinical aspects in comparison with titanium mish&#xD;
      for the subsequent placement of dental implants Reconstruction of alveolar bone defect can be&#xD;
      achieved through many regenerative surgical .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients will be selected from the outpatient clinic of the department of, Oral medicine&#xD;
      and Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient grouping and treatment protocol The purpose of this study is to evaluate the results&#xD;
      of alveolar ridge augmentation using two types of guided membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly divided into two groups according to the type of membrane will used&#xD;
      in alveolar ridge augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patient's records will be coded, known only by the researcher for the purpose of&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient participating in this study will sign an informed consent demonstrating the&#xD;
      purpose of this study, surgical procedure, probable risks and benefits from this surgical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of failure, the patient will be compensated with the suitable ordinary either fixed&#xD;
      or removable prosthesis. Every patient could quit at anytime without penalty or loss of any&#xD;
      benefits. The faculty research ethics committee will review the proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into two groups; (Group I) included 10&#xD;
      patients and (Group II) included 10 patients. The computer-generated randomization assignment&#xD;
      (blocks of 4) and allocation concealment will be performed by sealed envelopes containing the&#xD;
      randomization number prepared by non involved member and sent to principle investigator to&#xD;
      assign the interventions to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will include 10 patients and alveolar ridge augmentation will be performed using intraoral&#xD;
      autogenous block bone graft in addition to particulate xenograft to fill discrepancies&#xD;
      covered by titanium mesh .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 Will include 10 patients and alveolar ridge augmentation will be performed using&#xD;
      intraoral autogenous block bone grafting addition to particulate xenograft to fill&#xD;
      discrepancies covered by pericardial membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may suffer postoperatively from pain, edema, infection which will be controlled by&#xD;
      antibiotics and anti-inflammatory and proper oral hygiene measures with chlorhexidine mouth&#xD;
      wash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of failure will be minimized as much as possible by proper patient selection, properly&#xD;
      prepared surgical protocol, and rapid placement of the graft after harvesting to avoid viable&#xD;
      cells death, short surgeries as much as possible, strict aseptic techniques, proper infection&#xD;
      control measures, proper home oral hygiene measures and regular follow ups for maintenance of&#xD;
      the oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and evaluation of edentulous ridge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative evaluation will be performed for all patients at baseline. This evaluation&#xD;
           will include Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) using standardized and clinical&#xD;
           photographs using UNC periodontal probe .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two different techniques will be used to measure the alveolar ridge labiolingual width&#xD;
           before and after ridge augmentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be carried out at 2 intervals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline CBCT will be performed before the first surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second CBCT will be performed before the second surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ridge measurement technique will standardized by using vacuum form acetate stent (0.4 mm&#xD;
      base plate thermoforming material). references points placed on palatine surface using&#xD;
      gutta-percha point .t this point sagittal section of the ridge has taken on CBCT software&#xD;
      ,same stent used during 2nd cone beam after 4 months and take a sagittal section cut at level&#xD;
      of same gutta percha point : at same sagittal cut which taken at pre and post operative cone&#xD;
      beam measuring a horizontal Bucco -lingual line width on 3 points occlusal-apical .&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-UNC 15-color coded probe&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. at first surgery; done on the bony ridge directly after mucoperiosteal flap elevation&#xD;
           before bone graft placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the second surgery (re-entry surgery for implant placement) after 4 months; it&#xD;
           will be done on the bony ridge with the mucoperiosteal flap elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation of the Augmented Bone Quality:&#xD;
&#xD;
           After 4 month re-entry for implant placement and histological evaluation of the grafted&#xD;
           bone should be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preoperative preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The surgical procedures were performed under local anesthesia of&#xD;
           Articainchlorhydrate1:100000.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pre-operative rinsing of the oral cavity with a 0.2% chlorhexidine and a perioral skin&#xD;
           disinfection with Betadine antiseptic solution. An antibiotic therapy 1 h before surgery&#xD;
           will administrated to the patient, with 2 g of amoxicillin clavulanate (Augmentin)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Incision and preparation of recipient site:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A mid-crestal horizontal incision will be made with oblique releasing incisions where&#xD;
           needed in order to mobilize a full-thickness flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The flap will carefully be elevated from the palatal and buccal aspect of the alveolar&#xD;
           ridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All the granulation tissue will be removed from the cortical bone. The intra-surgical&#xD;
           evaluation confirmed a narrow alveolar ridge with insufficient crest width for ideal&#xD;
           dental implant placement gauged by using UNC 15-color coded periodontal probe or bone&#xD;
           caliber caliper to identify and measure the greatest horizontal alveolar ridge defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intra-surgical evaluation confirmed a narrow alveolar ridge with insufficient crest&#xD;
           width for ideal dental implant placement&#xD;
&#xD;
           Perforations into the marrow space will performed using small round surgical burs to&#xD;
           facilitate vascularization of the graft and cell colonization from the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bone graft From Donor site:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sub-marginal attached gingival incision will be used for papilla preservation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The intraoral autogenous block graft will be harvested from the mandible symphyses&#xD;
                using trephine burs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The donor site will be examined clinically and radiographically, it should be&#xD;
                easily accessible, with no apparent infection or anatomical abnormality .&#xD;
&#xD;
           In cases Guided Bone Regeneration with Titanium mesh ( Ti-mesh):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A 0.2 mm thickness Ti-mesh will be trimmed and adapted to the surgical defect to&#xD;
                create a proper bone contour.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Ti-mesh should be shaped avoiding sharp edges in order to prevent soft tissue&#xD;
                dehiscence or exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The minimum distance from the periodontium of the neighboring teeth was 1.5 mm in&#xD;
                order to prevent possible infiltrations through the gingival sulcus&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The defects will be filled with autogenous bone block, bone chips mixed with&#xD;
                xenograft , so that the deficiencies completely filled, this will recreate the&#xD;
                ideal amount of bone for subsequent implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Ti-mesh then placed over the graft and fixed to the palatal and buccal bony&#xD;
                walls using cortical screws on each side to prevent any micro movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Periosteal incisions on the flaps will be performed in order to promote a&#xD;
                tension-free closure and to mobilize the buccal flap and obtain the passive closure&#xD;
                essential to prevent dehiscence and Ti-mesh exposure.The releasing incisions should&#xD;
                be placed 3 to 4 mm in length at the apical extent of the vertical releasing&#xD;
                incision (in the buccal vestibule), which directed away from the vertical incisions&#xD;
                created a split-thickness flap past the mucogingival line as they proceeded&#xD;
                apically to release the flap&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Double layer suture should be applied with horizontal mattress and circumferential&#xD;
                interrupted suture using a suture 5-0 polypropylene suture, to seal the overlapping&#xD;
                periosteal portion of the palatal and buccal flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In cases of Guided Bone Regeneration using pericardium membrane with tenting screw:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The augmentation technique will used in both treatment groups is the same, with the&#xD;
                exception of the membrane material.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1.4-mm-diameter titanium reference screw will be placed perpendicular to the&#xD;
                alveolar ridge, extending laterally to the desired amount of horizontal&#xD;
                augmentation and fixed the autologous bone block which act as tenting with titanium&#xD;
                screw.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The attempted horizontal gain will be measured, from the screw head to the bone&#xD;
                using a UNC-15 periodontal probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The particulate graft consisted of a combination of xenograft and particulate autogenous&#xD;
           bone then applied to the recipient site using a bilayer technique with the autogenous&#xD;
           particles placed against the native bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The particulate bone graft will be placed around supporting tenting screws to the&#xD;
                level of the screw heads and covered with a pericardium membrane, which will be&#xD;
                fixed to the bone with titanium tacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary closure should be obtained by using a combination of interrupted and&#xD;
                horizontal mattress sutures using 5-0 polypropylene sutures, to seal the&#xD;
                overlapping periosteal portion of the palatal and buccal flaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post-operative Medication and follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 g of Augmentin twice a day for 7 days, 500mg metronidazole twice a day for 7&#xD;
                days, a 0.2% Chlorhexidine gluconate (mouthwash rinse solution 1min three times a&#xD;
                day for the same period of time, starting the day after the surgery and Brufen 600&#xD;
                mg 3 times daily for 7 days as analgesic and anti inflammatory&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The sutures will be removed after 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Follow up phase: 7 days after 1st surgery, fourteen days after the sutures will be&#xD;
                removed then the patient will be instructed to return for follow-up visits every 2&#xD;
                weeks for the first month then once monthly until re-entry surgery. At the follow&#xD;
                up visits both recipient and donor sites will be clinically examined for soft&#xD;
                tissue healing .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After 4 months The second radiographic evaluation of alveolar ridge width by Cone&#xD;
                Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) will be performed before the second surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                2nd surgical stage&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fixation and tenting screws which had been used to stabilize the graft during&#xD;
                healing will be removed and retrieve the Titanium mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A bone biopsy will be harvesting from the grafted area using trephine bur will&#xD;
                obtained prior to implant placement for histological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All the patients will receive supra-structure prosthetic part .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All the clinical, Radiographical , Histomorphometric data will be tabulated and the&#xD;
           result will be subjected to statistical analysis.&#xD;
