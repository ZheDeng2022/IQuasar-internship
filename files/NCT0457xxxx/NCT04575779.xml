      This study focuses on the basis for current immunosuppressive strategies in patients&#xD;
      undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation unit in Ain Shams university hospitals. It discusses whether there is room&#xD;
      for improving both the monitoring and the delivery of pharmacologically mediated&#xD;
      immunosuppression in this population of patients. Our study will try to determine whether CsA&#xD;
      administration at a daily dose of 3 mg/kg/day intravenously (IV) in 2 hrs (short infusion)&#xD;
      twice-daily will achieve C2 blood levels of at least 800 mg/l and whether it will be feasible&#xD;
      and safe or not.&#xD;

      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is considered as a curative&#xD;
      treatment for patients with haematological malignancies like leukaemia, myelodysplasia,&#xD;
      lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. However, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) both in its acute&#xD;
      and chronic forms, has limited the benefits of allogeneic HSCT by significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological suppression of the donor-derived alloreactive immune response has played a&#xD;
      central role in reducing the morbidity and mortality of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD),&#xD;
      which remains the major cause of toxicity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft versus host disease (GvHD) is a condition that might occur after an allogenic&#xD;
      transplant, In GvHD, the donated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells view the&#xD;
      recipient's body as foreign, and the donated cells/bone marrow attack the body. There are two&#xD;
      forms of GvHD: Acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) and Chronic graft versus host disease&#xD;
      (cGvHD). As an allogeneic transplant recipient, the patient might experience either form of&#xD;
      GvHD, both forms, or neither.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute GvHD, which results from an interaction of donor T lymphocytes with the recipient's&#xD;
      antigens, occurs in approximately 30%-60% of patients after allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem&#xD;
      Cell Transplantation (HSCT). At the same time, it has become clear that the intensity of&#xD;
      post-transplant immunosuppression is one of the most important determinants of relapse risk&#xD;
      through its impact on the potency of an immunologically mediated graft-versus leukaemia (GVL)&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the variety of immunosuppressants available, cyclosporin A (CsA) has been the most&#xD;
      extensively used drug to prevent or treat graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, since its introduction in the 1970s. It has been&#xD;
      shown that CsA is effective in preventing and controlling acute and chronic GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent, a metabolite extracted from the fungus&#xD;
      Tolypocladium. It is a potent suppressor of the immune system, particularly T-lymphocytes.&#xD;
      Cyclosporine binds to the intracellular receptor cyclophilin, subsequently inhibiting&#xD;
      cytokine production, including interleukin-2 and 4, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and&#xD;
      interferon-gamma, which leads to impairment of normal lymphoid cell activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other mechanisms may contribute to immunosuppression. Cyclosporine is cell cycle&#xD;
      phase-specific; lymphocytes in the G0 or G1 phase of the cell cycle are specifically and&#xD;
      reversibly inhibited. Direct cytotoxic effects on T- and B-lymphocytes have also been&#xD;
      demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cyclosporine (CsA) acts in a concentration-dependent rather than a time-dependent&#xD;
      fashion. It has been shown that the most significant pharmacodynamic effect occurs within the&#xD;
      first two h of exposure (C2) at peak CsA levels of 800-2285 mg/l which result in 70-96%&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibition and maximum suppression of IL-2 release from T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine (CsA) is highly complex and affected by many factors like&#xD;
      demographics, concurrent medications and type of primary disease for which transplantation&#xD;
      was indicated. Moreover, the complexity of CsA pharmacokinetics is increasing in critically&#xD;
      ill patients in acute post-transplantation phase due to the presence of additional several&#xD;
      clinical factors simultaneously affecting the in-vivo behaviour of CsA. This made very little&#xD;
      research investigating the pharmacokinetic behaviour of CsA in acute post-transplantation&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on the basis for current immunosuppressive strategies in patients&#xD;
      undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation unit in Ain Shams university hospitals and discuss whether there is room for&#xD;
      improving both the monitoring and the delivery of pharmacologically mediated&#xD;
      immunosuppression in this population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it has already been known that the clinical effect of the cyclosporine (CsA) depends&#xD;
      on the reached concentration levels in the blood, the best way of therapeutic monitoring of&#xD;
      this drug is not universally accepted. The measurement of the drug concentration. level in&#xD;
      the blood prior to the administration of the next successive dose (C0) and dosing of the drug&#xD;
      on the basis of this drug concentration, represents the more common way of CsA therapeutic&#xD;
      monitoring. Recently, it has been shown that C0 does not correlate well with the episodes of&#xD;
      acute rejection, and undesirable drug effects as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies showed that the absorption, but not the elimination phase, is primarily&#xD;
      significant for the cyclosporine (CsA) effectiveness and that the area under the&#xD;
      concentration-time curve in the first 4 hours after the drug administration (AUC0-4)&#xD;
      adequately reflects the exposure of the organism to the drug and correlates well with&#xD;
      clinical events. It was also shown that out of all drug concentration levels separately&#xD;
      measured at some points of time during the absorption phase; the drug concentration level&#xD;
      determined 2 hours after the administration (C2) correlates the best with the area under the&#xD;
      concentration-time curve in the first 4 hours after the drug administration (AUC0-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past few years, considerable refinement has occurred in the pharmacologically mediated&#xD;
      immunosuppressive strategies utilized in recipients of solid organ transplants. This has&#xD;
      occurred through the use of more precise methods of monitoring established agents,&#xD;
      principally cyclosporin (CsA), which have been shown to reduce the risk of graft rejection in&#xD;
      the setting of both kidney and liver transplantation. This experience suggests that there may&#xD;
      be scope for translating the advances that have been made in the field of solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation to recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug concentration level determined 2 hours after the administration (C2) monitoring has&#xD;
      been adopted for renal, liver and heart transplant recipients as the two h peak concentration&#xD;
      correlates well with the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 4 h after&#xD;
      giving the drug and that this predicts the occurrence of acute rejection and nephrotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug concentration level determined 2 hours after the administration (C2) monitoring is&#xD;
      also associated with clinical benefits as a reduction in graft rejections after solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation. Amazingly, data on pharmacokinetics and target C2 levels are lacking in&#xD;
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) patients. Moreover, there is no consensus&#xD;
      about how cyclosporin (CsA) should be administered with some centres giving 1 or 2&#xD;
      intermittent infusions and others continuous 24 h infusion. Hence, our study will try to&#xD;
      determine whether administering CsA at a daily dose of 3 mg/kg/day intravenously(i.v.) in 2&#xD;
      hrs (short infusion) twice-daily will achieve C2 blood levels of at least 800 mg/l and&#xD;
      whether it will be feasible and safe or not.&#xD;
