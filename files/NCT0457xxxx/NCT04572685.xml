      The primary objectives of the study are to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of&#xD;
      paliperidone in LY03010 P1 and P2 following a single IM injection in schizophrenia patients&#xD;
      and to compare the PK of LY03010 P1 and P2 with that of INVEGA SUSTENNA® following a single&#xD;
      IM injection of 156 mg dosage level.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study. Patients will undergo&#xD;
      screening evaluations to determine eligibility within 28 days prior to study drug&#xD;
      administration. About 36 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment&#xD;
      groups. Patients will be admitted to the clinical facility the day before dosing (Day 0) and&#xD;
      will be receiving an IM injection of study drug and completing the assigned study activity&#xD;
      including PK sample collection on Day 1. Patients will be discharged on Day 2 after PK&#xD;
      collection. All patients will return to the clinical site at designated study days for PK&#xD;
      sample collections and assigned clinical procedures. End of study evaluation will be&#xD;
      completed on Day 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics of the study medication will be assessed as primary outcome. Participants'&#xD;
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
