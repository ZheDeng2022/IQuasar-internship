  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of social incentives relative to&#xD;
      traditional incentives in promoting walking behavior among college students (N=200).&#xD;
      Participants who are rewarded for walking together will be compared to those who are rewarded&#xD;
      for walking even when alone. Research participants will download activity tracking apps&#xD;
      (Fitbit app and AWARE app) that provide activity and location data. Participants will be&#xD;
      consented and then randomized to one of two incentive schemes for walking. Over a 2-week&#xD;
      intervention period, the standard incentive group will earn $2 per day when they meet their&#xD;
      walking goal regardless of whether they walk alone or with others. The social incentive group&#xD;
      will earn $1 per day when they reach their walking goal plus an additional $1 when they walk&#xD;
      at least 2000 steps with their walking partner. The incentive scheme will be in place for&#xD;
      2-weeks, preceded by a 1-week baseline period and followed by a 2-week follow-up period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to test whether social incentives that encourage physical&#xD;
      activity with another person are more effective than incentives for individual exercise.&#xD;
      Physical inactivity and social isolation are growing epidemics linked to increased morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality particularly among aging Americans. This research aims to address both problems&#xD;
      by encouraging co-productive physical activities among college students. Co-productive&#xD;
      physical activity mean anything involving physical activity that two people can do together,&#xD;
      e.g., walking their dogs or shopping together. Additionally, in light of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, walking together in this study means either walking while communicating digitally&#xD;
      or over the phone, or by physically walking together while wearing a mask, staying 6 feet&#xD;
      apart, and following the recommendations from health professionals. A small randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will test the effectiveness of social incentives relative to traditional&#xD;
      incentives in promoting walking behavior. Participants who are rewarded for walking together&#xD;
      will be compared to those who are rewarded for walking even when alone. The results will&#xD;
      indicate whether social incentives are more motivating than traditional incentives for&#xD;
      walking behavior.&#xD;
