  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's research is devoted to studying the causes of tremor, and especially essential&#xD;
      tremor (ET), which is the most common type of tremor. Previous studies have revealed a link&#xD;
      between harmane [HA], a dietary neurotoxin, and ET; these studies now also suggest a link&#xD;
      between this toxin and Parkinson's disease (PD), a related tremor disorder. Yet these links&#xD;
      are tentative rather than conclusively established; therefore, in this new patient-based&#xD;
      proposal, which incorporates investigations spanning two continents (North America and&#xD;
      Europe), utilizes several complementary study designs (prospective cohort, case control), and&#xD;
      draws on several types of tissue (blood, brain), the investigator's goal is to nail down the&#xD;
      links between HA and ET and to further solidify the emerging links between HA and PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is devoted to studying the causes of tremor, and especially essential tremor&#xD;
      (ET), which is the most common type of tremor. Since 2000, this lab has been investigating&#xD;
      whether several environmental neurotoxins are associated with ET. A link between harmane (HA)&#xD;
      (1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole) and ET has been emerging from these studies, which show&#xD;
      that blood and brain HA concentration ([HA]) is elevated in ET cases (esp. familial ET) vs.&#xD;
      control subjects. HA is a neurotoxin present in the diet (esp. in meat). Administration of HA&#xD;
      to laboratory animals produces severe action tremor resembling ET. Yet the link between HA&#xD;
      and ET has not been convincingly established. All epidemiological studies have been&#xD;
      case-control studies; thus, it is not clear whether high blood [HA] precedes the onset of ET.&#xD;
      Aim 1 of this proposal will address this issue. The HA story has also become more complex and&#xD;
      multi-dimensional. Thus, the investigators were recently intrigued to find that blood [HA]&#xD;
      was higher in Parkinson's disease (PD) cases than controls in New York. HA is structurally&#xD;
      similar to MPTP, a neurotoxin closely linked with PD. ET and PD are both tremor disorders;&#xD;
      some patients develop both disorders (ET+PD; i.e., they are comorbid for the two conditions).&#xD;
      Whether the HA - PD link is reproducible, whether it tracks with the subtype of PD in which&#xD;
      tremor rather than bradykinesia/rigidity is the predominant feature, and whether biomarker&#xD;
      findings from blood also occur in the target organ of interest (i.e., the brain) in PD is not&#xD;
      known. Aim 2 of this proposal will address this myriad of issues. Finally, whether&#xD;
      individuals who are comorbid for both ET and PD have the highest blood [HA] is not known. Aim&#xD;
      3 of this proposal will address this issue. To close these gaps in knowledge, in this&#xD;
      application, the investigators propose a 5-year study with 3 inter-related aims that draw on&#xD;
      several types of human tissue (blood, brain): AIM 1: To nail down the links between HA and ET&#xD;
      by studying the association between baseline blood [HA] and the development of incident ET in&#xD;
      a cohort study. AIM 2: To further solidify the emerging links between HA and PD by extending&#xD;
      our observations to another country (Spain). AIM 3: To assess blood levels of HA in patients&#xD;
      who have both ET and PD (ET+PD). This would be the only study heading in this direction -&#xD;
      exploring the etiological role of environmental factors, and more specifically toxins, in ET.&#xD;
      It would thus complement the many ongoing studies searching for ET genes. The study could&#xD;
      lead to the clear identification of the first modifiable risk factor for ET (i.e., dietary&#xD;
      HA).This would also be the only study assessing the possible etiological role and tissue&#xD;
      concentrations of this toxin, HA, which is structurally similar to MPTP, in patients with PD.&#xD;

Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. Most people engage in those activities at least occasionally, although not necessarily every day. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime sleepiness'.</description>

    <ipd_description>We are committed to making the resources of this study widely available not only to scientists studying ET but to those studying other neurological and neurodegenerative diseases as well, and especially to those who are studying PD. Thus, sharing data generated by this project is an important part of our proposed activities and will be carried out in a number of different ways. Our Data Sharing plan will adhere to the general principles outlined in the NIH Data Sharing Policy and Implementation Guidance.&#xD;
The aims of the present proposal not only include clinical data but also data from measurement of harmane in blood and brain tissue samples. Data/tissue will be shared for all study participants that have consented to data sharing. Participants who did not give consent for data sharing will be excluded.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data will become available after the recruitment is complete and the biological samples have been analyzed.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>The results and conclusions of our analysis will be shared at global scientific meetings and in the scientific literature (during publication in peer-reviewed journals). An additional mechanism of sharing data will be in the form of supplements to the additional data, which, for most journals, is on-line.&#xD;
The data will be entered into SPSS data files. Original data files for individual runs will be shared with colleagues who possess the means and knowledge to utilize them, under collaborative agreement. To strengthen data confidentiality and safeguard the privacy of study participants, we will make data available to approved researchers under a data-sharing agreement that provides for (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_access_criteria>
