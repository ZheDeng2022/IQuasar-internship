      This study is designed to determine if a postnatal lifestyle intervention will lead to weight&#xD;
      reduction over a 12 month period post-delivery in women who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus and who have a BMI greater that 25 compared to women who&#xD;
      receive routine care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes during pregnancy (Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is defined as high blood&#xD;
      sugars during pregnancy and it is becoming increasingly common which affects around 18% of&#xD;
      pregnant women. GDM is usually diagnosed by an oral glucose tolerance test around 28 weeks&#xD;
      gestation. Women with previous GDM have a 50% risk of developing it again in any future&#xD;
      pregnancy, and are 7 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes within the future compared&#xD;
      to women without GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that lifestyle changes (diet and physical activity), can reduce the&#xD;
      development of type 2 diabetes in people at high risk, such as women with previous GDM. The&#xD;
      postnatal period (shortly after pregnancy) is an ideal time for women to make these changes&#xD;
      to help prevent weight gain between pregnancies and generally reduce their risk of future&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. This study is designed to determine if a postnatal lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      will lead to weight reduction over a 12 month period post-delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who have been diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy (GDM) and had a body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) &gt;25 kg/m2 at the start of pregnancy, will be invited to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their routine appointment at 32-36 weeks gestation women will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      either to the intervention program or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the intervention group, will receive a 1-hour educational session during their&#xD;
      routine diabetes antenatal clinic visit. In addition, they will be offered an activity&#xD;
      tracker (following consent) to help monitor their daily step count and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in both the intervention and control groups will have a fasting glucose blood sample&#xD;
      taken the morning after delivery. Those women with normal or borderline fasting glucose&#xD;
      levels are eligible to remain in the study, but those with type 2 diabetes will be excluded&#xD;
      and referred to their local diabetes team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6-8 weeks postnatally, both groups will complete some questionnaires, give a blood sample,&#xD;
      have weight and blood pressure measurements recorded. Women will be offered free referral to&#xD;
      a commercial weight management organization for 12 weeks, with a possible extension for&#xD;
      another 12 weeks). Over the 12 months of the study, the PAIGE2 team will contact participants&#xD;
      intermittently by text and telephone to encourage them to eat healthily and increase their&#xD;
      physical activity. If the participants' partner is also willing to take part, the partner&#xD;
      will be sent an activity tracker to monitor physical activity and the research team will keep&#xD;
      in intermittent contact with the partner by text and telephone during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women allocated to the control group will be offered a free 12-week referral to a commercial&#xD;
      weight management organization at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be asked to attend 2 further study visits at 6 and 12 months after delivery.&#xD;
      This will involve completion of some questionnaires, a blood test, weight and blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
