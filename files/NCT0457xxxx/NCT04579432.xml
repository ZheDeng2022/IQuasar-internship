  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the concept of reproductive health as &quot;not only&#xD;
      the absence of disease or disability, but a state of complete physical, mental and social&#xD;
      welfare in all matters related to the reproductive system, functions and processes&quot;. However,&#xD;
      it also emphasizes that people have free will in the timing of having a satisfying and safe&#xD;
      sexual life and using their reproductive abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexual and reproductive health and rights are essential for the health and survival of&#xD;
      people, economic development and prosperity. In the United Nations 2030 Sustainable&#xD;
      Development Goals, the third article named &quot;Health and Quality Life&quot; includes the targets&#xD;
      covering reproductive health and sexual health. Some of these goals are; universal access to&#xD;
      sexual and reproductive health services, creation of national education and information&#xD;
      strategies for reproductive health, preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs), access&#xD;
      to information about family planning, and reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. People&#xD;
      can lead a complete healthy and quality life only when these goals are achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is observed that the knowledge of men and women about general reproductive health and the&#xD;
      organs and functions of the female and male reproductive systems is significantly lacking. In&#xD;
      addition to these, it has been reported that they have insufficient knowledge on other issues&#xD;
      such as sexual health, STIs and family planning methods. There are studies showing that lack&#xD;
      of knowledge brings about reproductive health problems in young individuals. Problems such as&#xD;
      exposure to STIs, early pregnancy, and risky sexual behaviors arise due to lack of&#xD;
      information. Since all these health problems can cause permanent damage, the individual's&#xD;
      future reproductive health is also at risk. However, it is possible to come across studies&#xD;
      showing that reproductive health education is a tool to prevent these adverse health&#xD;
      conditions. In a study conducted with university students, even if students' basic sexual&#xD;
      education knowledge levels were good; It has been reported that there is a positive&#xD;
      relationship between receiving sexual education and protective sexual behaviors, knowledge,&#xD;
      motivation and skills. At the same time, it has been reported in many studies that believing&#xD;
      in sexual myths, which are considered as false beliefs and have no scientific value, is more&#xD;
      common in students with high levels of knowledge. While sexual myths cause behavioral changes&#xD;
      with believed mistakes, sexual dysfunctions, decrease in sexual satisfaction and negative&#xD;
      attitude towards contraceptive methods can also be brought about. Considering that people who&#xD;
      know more about sexually transmitted HIV/AIDS have a low rate of believing in myths, an&#xD;
      important reproductive health problem such as STI should be considered to be related to&#xD;
      myths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, training on reproductive health and sexual health is important. Preparation&#xD;
      and implementation of trainings on reproductive and sexual health by health professionals; It&#xD;
      is important as it is known that young people have access to conflicting or incorrect&#xD;
      information from various sources. Therefore, health professionals should be involved in these&#xD;
      training processes. While planning the trainings, many platforms can be used, and nowadays,&#xD;
      web-based trainings increase their importance with the introduction of the internet in all&#xD;
      areas of our lives. The biggest advantages of web-based education are that it can be accessed&#xD;
      anytime, anywhere and by anyone. In various studies conducted with university students, it is&#xD;
      seen that web-based education increases the level of knowledge and is effective in behavior&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this period when technological education emerged, many instructional design models&#xD;
      developed were used in web-based education. Among these models, the most widely used ADDIE&#xD;
      model. ADDIE is a model that provides a systematic and comprehensive definition and&#xD;
      implementation of design principles. The web-based training in the research will be given&#xD;
      based on the ADDIE Model approach. Basic elements of the instructional design process in the&#xD;
      model; It is in the form of Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation. The&#xD;
      use of a model in web-designed education ensures that the educational content is prepared&#xD;
      according to the needs, the training steps are not skipped and systematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature review and web researches, a web-based education was not encountered in&#xD;
      national and international publications where university students could reach the correct and&#xD;
      scientific information about reproductive health. In this context, the investigators believe&#xD;
      that web-based education to be provided with the ADDIE Model approach will reduce the sexual&#xD;
      myths and risky behaviors that young people believe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was planned to examine the effect of web-based reproductive health education given&#xD;
      to university students on belief in sexual myths and risky behaviors.&#xD;

The total score for the scale is obtained by adding the scores given to each item. The minimum score obtained from the scale is 28 and the maximum score is 140. The scale does not have a cut-off point. The higher the score, the higher the sexual myths.</description>

The questions in each item will be answered as &quot;True, False, No Idea&quot;. The questions in the form will be submitted for expert opinion. A pre-test will be conducted to detect the presence of incomprehensible expressions. The score of the form will be calculated by giving 1 point to each correct answer and the highest score will be 47.</description>
