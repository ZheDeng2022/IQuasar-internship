  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b clinical trial examining the&#xD;
      effects of CHI-554 (CBD) on Fear (F-01)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the potential of a novel formulation of hemp-derived CBD (CHI-554) to&#xD;
      reduce fear elicited via a safe, well-established, controlled, laboratory-based carbon&#xD;
      dioxide (CO2)-enriched air biological challenge that causes abrupt increases in bodily&#xD;
      arousal.&#xD;
