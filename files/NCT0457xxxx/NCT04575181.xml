  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at the efficacy and safety of NNC0268-0965 (referred to as insulin 965).&#xD;
      The study aims to show that insulin 965 has positive effects on the blood vessels.&#xD;
      Participants will get either the new insulin 965 or insulin glargine - a medicine that&#xD;
      doctors already can prescribe (LantusÂ®). Which treatment participants get is decided by&#xD;
      chance. Participants will self-administer 2 injections per day under the skin of the thighs&#xD;
      for 26 weeks. Study participation will last for about 32 weeks. Participants will have 15&#xD;
      clinic visits, 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visits and 14 phone calls with the study&#xD;
      doctor. There will be a number of in-house assessments to study the effect of the new&#xD;
      insulin. The assessments will be explained later in detail. The treatment of disease is not&#xD;
      an aim of this study. Participants cannot be in the study if the study doctor thinks that&#xD;
      there are risks for their health. Women can only take part in the study if they are not able&#xD;
      to become pregnant.&#xD;

          -  Treatment with any medication for the indication of diabetes or obesity other than&#xD;
             stated in the inclusion criteria within the past 30 days or 5 times the half-life of&#xD;
