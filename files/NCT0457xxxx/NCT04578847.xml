  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to evaluate the stability of molecular response (major and&#xD;
      deep molecular response( MMR and DMR)) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with&#xD;
      stable DMR after two-stage dose reduction phase and discontinuation treatment TKI: imatinib,&#xD;
      nilotinib, dasatinib and bosutinib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of the dose reduction phase will be 12 months. This phase will have two stage of&#xD;
      6 months, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib or bosutinib will be reduced by 25-50% on the&#xD;
      first stage, and by another 25% on the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial dose of imatinib will be 400 mg daily. The dose will be reduced by 300 mg&#xD;
           daily on the first stage, by 200 mg daily - on the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial dose of nilotinib will be 300 or 400 mg twice daily. The dose will be&#xD;
           reduced by 400 mg daily on the first stage, by 200 mg daily - on the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial dose of dasatinib will be 100 or 140 mg daily. The dose will be reduced by&#xD;
           50 mg daily on the first stage, by 25 mg daily - on the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial dose of bosutinib will be 500 mg daily. The dose will be reduced by 300 mg&#xD;
           daily on the first stage, by 200 mg daily - on the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with stable deep molecular response (at least 2 years) will be included in&#xD;
      treatment free remission phase (TFR-phase). The duration of TFR-phase will be 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CML patients can enter the study already on reduced doses TKI, if they will meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to include patients, who have already received therapy with reduced doses of&#xD;
      TKI. The duration of TKI therapy with reduced doses of 1 stage should be at least 6 months,&#xD;
      if TKI doses meet of stage 1. The duration of TKI therapy with reduced doses of 2 stage&#xD;
      should be for at least 6 months and the general duration of TKI therapy with reduced doses&#xD;
      should be for at least 12 months, if TKI doses meet of stage 2.&#xD;
