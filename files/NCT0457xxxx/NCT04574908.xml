  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team will collect data for this study from participants who are having surgery and&#xD;
      recovering postoperatively on 2 pre-designated hospital units. The study team will use vital&#xD;
      signs data from a portable device that participants wear on their wrists as well as&#xD;
      conventional vital signs data that is collected when a health care provider comes into their&#xD;
      room and collect this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substudy is also being performed with the distribution of surveys to the nursing staff on&#xD;
      the floors who are utilizing the ViSi hemodynamic monitors within our institution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study will provide the necessary preliminary data for a National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Research Grant Project (NIH R01) application that will test the utility of continuous&#xD;
      portable hemodynamic monitoring in a large-scale randomized trial. Two separate post surgical&#xD;
      hospital units will be randomized to utilize the Sotera ViSi monitoring system or to not&#xD;
      utilize the Sotera ViSi monitoring system for a 4 week period of time alternating over the&#xD;
      period of 1 year. The study team will assess the effect of unblinded continuous monitoring&#xD;
      and the associated alerts on the cumulative duration (min/hour) of each of hypotension,&#xD;
      tachycardia, and desaturation. The study team will assess the effect of continuous monitoring&#xD;
      and associated alerts on the ordinal clinical intervention outcome which measures the single&#xD;
      most extreme/elevated clinical intervention incurred by a patient for any of the 3 outcome&#xD;
      variables of interest (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia) during the study period with&#xD;
      response by staff. The study team will assess the treatment effect on myocardial injury after&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery (MINS) during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substudy involving the the medical center nursing staffs' impressions of the device as well&#xD;
      as their confidence in its utilization in keeping their assigned patient's safe will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The 2 wards will alternate every 4 weeks as to blinded/unblinded allocations. Blinded will be continuous ward monitoring with alarms silenced and screens covered; unblinded will be continuous monitoring accessible to clinicians with pre-specified alerts at MAP &lt;65 mmHg, heart rate &gt;110 b/m, and SpO2 &lt;90%. Of note, to ensure patient safety and no risk in either arm, factory alarm limits (see table under human subjects protection) at extremes of physiological vital signs will stay on in the blinded/silenced arm, and both arms will have every 4 hourly checks by nursing teams.</masking_description>

    <description>Continuous ward monitoring with hallway monitor screens covered. When an alarm goes off (limits based on the stratification of that month) the nursing staff will still be notified via their Ascom phone as per standard of care. Nursing staff will log in to WakeOne to verify the vital sign and/or go to the patient room to check on the patient. To ensure patient safety, factory alarm limits at extremes of physiological vital signs will stay on in the blinded arm. Every 4 hourly checks by nursing teams unless otherwise ordered.</description>
