      This study collects blood samples to determine if the DNA of HPV that causes cervical cancer&#xD;
      can be detected in patients with cervical cancer that is new (primary), has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent), or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and are undergoing&#xD;
      treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. Researchers may use&#xD;
      this information to predict response (good or bad) of the cervical cancer to treatment and&#xD;
      detect recurrent cancer sooner.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the ctDNA detection rate in cervix cancer patients undergoing surgery,&#xD;
      radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy in the setting of primary, recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Association of ctDNA baseline levels and clearance kinetics with clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the association of detectable ctDNA at each time point with invasive&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the use of ctDNA for surveillance and detection of disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To create a repository for future exploratory studies including analyzing changes in T&#xD;
      cell and other immune cell subpopulations during and following therapy for cervix cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1: Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline prior to surgery, at 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery, every 6 months during year 2, and at the time of&#xD;
      recurrence (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 2: Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline prior to the first&#xD;
      fraction of radiation, during week 4 of radiotherapy, at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      post-radiotherapy, every 6 months during year 2, and at the time of recurrence (if&#xD;
      applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 3: Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline prior to the first&#xD;
      fraction of radiation, during week 4 of radiotherapy, on the day of the final fraction of&#xD;
      radiotherapy, at 3 months post-radiotherapy, every 3 months during years 1 and 2, and at the&#xD;
      time of recurrence (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 4: Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline prior to initiation of&#xD;
      chemotherapy or immunotherapy, at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy or&#xD;
      immunotherapy, every 3 months during years 1 and 2, and at the time of recurrence (if&#xD;
      applicable).&#xD;
