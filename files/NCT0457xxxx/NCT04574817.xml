  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no target therapies approved for treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer&#xD;
      (ATC), leading to a clear need for improving therapy for ATC. This is a single-arm,&#xD;
      multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HX008 injection in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic or locally advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer.&#xD;
