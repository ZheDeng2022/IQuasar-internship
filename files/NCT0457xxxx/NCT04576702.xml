  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, active controlled clinical study is evaluating the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of the investigational MF59-Adjuvanted Quadrivalent Subunit&#xD;
      Inactivated Influenza Vaccine. Approximately 480 subjects are to be randomized into 1 of 4&#xD;
      possible treatment groups (investigational Influenza Vaccine or licensed Quadrivalent&#xD;
      Influenza Vaccine comparators) at 120 participants per group. Every participant will receive&#xD;
      an influenza vaccine injection on Day 1 and will be followed up for approximately 6 months&#xD;
      following injection. The primary immunogenicity analysis is based on Day 29 serum.&#xD;
