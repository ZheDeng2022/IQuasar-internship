  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), especially after having maintenance dialysis&#xD;
      are among the highest risk of heart failure (HF), which is the most important cause that&#xD;
      affects survival rate and quality of life. Sacubitril/Valsartan is recommended as a&#xD;
      first-line option for treating symptomatic chronic heart failure, especially HF with reduced&#xD;
      ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sacubitril/Valsartan was reported the different effectiveness in&#xD;
      HFrEF and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and the clinical trials' results are&#xD;
      controversial in HFpEF patients. So far, there have been seven clinical trials (or subgroups&#xD;
      of trials) that used sacubitril/valsartan in heart failure patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease, only one retrospective study to evaluate the improvement of cardiovascular&#xD;
      biomarkers and LVEF in hemodialysis patients who have HFrEF. In addition, there is no article&#xD;
      predicting the outcomes of Sacubitril/Valsartan, the inclusion criteria of LVEF value are not&#xD;
      consistent. Investigators will perform a prospective, cohort study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Sacubitril/Valsartan on Cardiovascular Events Outcome in Maintenance&#xD;
      hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients with Heart Failure, and use secondary analysis&#xD;
      to find out the range of baseline LVEF Value to predict the therapeutic effects.&#xD;

      The trial will examine the effect of Sacubitril/Valsartan on cardiovascular events in HF&#xD;
      patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Subjects will be divided&#xD;
      into two groups (1:1 matching will be achieved after a screening of propensity score) to&#xD;
      receive one of two interventions in addition to standard HF management: Sacubitril/Valsartan&#xD;
      group or RAAS inhibitor group. All subjects can have a beta-blocker, CCB, and/or&#xD;
      alpha-blockers to control BP. Dialysis treatment: patients normally complete hemodialysis or&#xD;
      peritoneal dialysis, need to ensure adequate dialysis requirements, no obvious overload,&#xD;
      patients achieve dry weight after dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated and follow-up for at least 18 months.&#xD;

It is an important prognostic variable in cardiovascular disease.</description>
