    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, open-label clinical study to determine the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of secukinumab in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris in skin of color&#xD;
      (SOC) (FST IV-VI). This study will also evaluate the degree of erythema versus&#xD;
      hyperpigmentation in psoriasis plaques in SOC (and its change with secukinumab treatment) as&#xD;
      well as the effect of secukinumab on post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and quality of life&#xD;
      in SOC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the skin and joints that&#xD;
      occurs in diverse ethnic groups worldwide. There is paucity of data on the use of topical and&#xD;
      systemic medications in dark-skinned individuals. Unique issues in skin of color (SOC)&#xD;
      populations, including increased risk of dyspigmentation (hyperpigmentation and&#xD;
      hypopigmentation), make studies dedicated to darker skin types essential for treatment of&#xD;
      psoriasis in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-center, open-label clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of secukinumab in adults with skin types IV-VI with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A&#xD;
      total of 20 subjects (ages 18+, male and female, BSA ≥10%, PASI Score ≥ 12, IGA mod 2011&#xD;
      score ≥ 3) are expected to complete this study, which will run for a total of up to 28 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two periods: Screening (from 0 to 4 weeks) and open-label treatment&#xD;
      period (24 weeks). During the second period, a total of 20 subjects will receive secukinumab&#xD;
      300mg subcutaneously. Those who meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and are enrolled&#xD;
      in the study will receive study drug for the entire treatment period.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Secukinumab is a recombinant, high-affinity, fully human immunoglobulin G1κ monoclonal antibody targeting IL-17A. Phase III studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of secukinumab in the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis when dosed as 300mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by 300mg every 4 weeks.12 Secukinumab is FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients 18 years of age and older.&#xD;
The study treatment consists of secukinumab 300mg by subcutaneous injection. Each 300mg dose is given as two subcutaneous injections of secukinumab 150mg, 1mg liquid formulation in a pre-filled syringe. Secukinumab pre-filled syringes 150 mg will be supplied by Novartis.</intervention_model_description>
