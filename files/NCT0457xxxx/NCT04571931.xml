      health of their children in relation to caries experience.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary teeth are important as much as permanent teeth. Dental plaque is considered the major&#xD;
      cause of dental diseases, it begins to adhere to the teeth after eruption. Therefore, regular&#xD;
      dental care for children becomes essential. Children at preschool age lack the awareness of&#xD;
      primary teeth importance, the knowledge in dental health care and the ability to maintain&#xD;
      adequate oral health. Hence, it is the parents' responsibility to take care of their&#xD;
      children's teeth in collaboration with dentists and their advices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A good understanding of the parental knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and awareness regarding&#xD;
      oral health is essential for the effectiveness of oral health promotion efforts aim at&#xD;
      improving the dental health of young children. It has been found that the more positive the&#xD;
      attitude of parents is towards dentistry; the better their children's dental health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children from low-income and underprivileged families have been found to have high caries&#xD;
      prevalence and poor oral health. Therefore, it is important to assess the knowledge and&#xD;
      attitude of parents, as their behaviour towards their children oral health is of a huge&#xD;
      impact. This may also have implications on early dental visits aimed for prevention rather&#xD;
      than restorative treatment. So, parents' knowledge and attitude have a significant influence&#xD;
      on the children's dental and gingival health. Lack of parental knowledge and positive&#xD;
      attitudes regarding primary teeth create barriers to early preventive dental care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, studying and understanding parental dental knowledge and attitude would be of a&#xD;
      good help in effective planning for well-targeted dental health promotional campaigns by&#xD;
      shedding the light on the knowledge gaps and negative attitudes of the parents regarding&#xD;
      dental health&#xD;
