  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II, pilot study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of apremilast involving 21 patients with PPP. The screening period was up&#xD;
      to 4 weeks and treatment took place over 20 weeks per patient. No follow up period took&#xD;
      place. No extension was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment period was 4 months; hence study duration from first patient in to last patient&#xD;
      out was approximately 9 months. About 4-6 patients per center were recruited, assuming&#xD;
      enrolment of both genders with distribution according to prevalence of condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment took place at 5 centers in Germany. The investigators had relevant&#xD;
      expertise in diagnosing and treating PPP or were specialized in dermatology. Patients were&#xD;
      enrolled until approximately 20 patients were included into the study. One drop-out was&#xD;
      replaced during the recruitment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five visits per patient were performed including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 at week -4 to -1 (screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 at week 0 (baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3 at week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4 at week 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5 at week 20 (end of study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of study participation the investigator ensured that the patient received a&#xD;
      suitable therapy appropriate to patient's condition.&#xD;

    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Visit 2 (Baseline), Visit 4 (Week 12) and Visit 5 (Week 20).</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life instrument designed to assess the impact of a disease on the patient's daily life which is also validated for PPP. It is a 10-item questionnaire and can be used to assess 6 different aspects: symptoms and feelings, leisure, daily activities, work or school performance, personal relationship and treatment. The DLQI was calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life was impaired.&#xD;
Meaning of DLQI scores:&#xD;
0 to 1 = No effect at all on patient's life&#xD;
2 to 5 = Small effect on patient's life&#xD;
6 to 10 = Moderate effect on patient's life&#xD;
11 to 20 = Very large effect on patient's life&#xD;
21 to 30 = Extremely large effect on patient's life</description>

    <time_frame>At Visit 2 (Baseline), Visit 3 (Week 4), Visit 4 (Week 12) and Visit 5 (End of Study - Week 20).</time_frame>
    <description>VAS was used to assess discomfort/pain. The patient was asked to place a vertical stroke on a 100 mm VAS on which the left-hand boundary represented no discomfort/pain (at 0 mm), and the right-hand boundary (at 100 mm) represented discomfort/pain as severe as can be imagined. The distance from the mark to the left-hand boundary was recorded, with higher values indicating more discomfort/pain (worse conditions).</description>

    <time_frame>At Visit 2 (Baseline), Visit 3 (Week 4), Visit 4 (Week 12) and Visit 5 (End of Study - Week 20).</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score.</description>

    <description>Apremilast was taken orally twice daily (except Day 1). Patients received tablets in blister/bottles sufficient for one month. To mitigate potential gastrointestinal side effects (primarily mild-to-moderate nausea and diarrhoea), dose titration was implemented in this study in accordance with the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). A titration pack included tablets of 10, 20 and 30 mg for a period of one month. During the first 5 days, the dosage was up-titrated. The initial dose on day 1 was 10 mg in the morning; this was increased to 10 mg in the morning and evening on day 2. The evening dose was further increased by 10 mg (to 20 mg) on day 3. On day 4, the morning dose was increased to 20 mg, so that 20 mg was taken twice daily, and on day 5 the evening dose was increased to 30 mg. From Day 6 onwards, patients received the 30 mg dose twice a day. Subsequent packs included only tablets of 30 mg strength.</description>

          <description>The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.&#xD;
Apremilast was taken orally twice daily (except Day 1). During the first 5 days, the dosage was up-titrated. The initial dose on day 1 was 10 mg in the morning; this was increased to 10 mg in the morning and evening on day 2. The evening dose was further increased by 10 mg (to 20 mg) on day 3. On day 4, the morning dose was increased to 20 mg, so that 20 mg was taken twice daily, and on day 5 the evening dose was increased to 30 mg. From Day 6 onwards, patients received the 30 mg dose twice a day.</description>

        <title>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life instrument designed to assess the impact of a disease on the patient's daily life which is also validated for PPP. It is a 10-item questionnaire and can be used to assess 6 different aspects: symptoms and feelings, leisure, daily activities, work or school performance, personal relationship and treatment. The DLQI was calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life was impaired.&#xD;
Meaning of DLQI scores:&#xD;
0 to 1 = No effect at all on patient's life&#xD;
2 to 5 = Small effect on patient's life&#xD;
6 to 10 = Moderate effect on patient's life&#xD;
11 to 20 = Very large effect on patient's life&#xD;

        <title>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)</title>
        <description>The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score.</description>

Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score.</description>
