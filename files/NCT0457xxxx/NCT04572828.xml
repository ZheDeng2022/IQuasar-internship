  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Office-based endometrial procedures are preferred over diagnostic dilation and curettage,&#xD;
      nowadays. Paracervical block is single-shot nerve block that involve a one-time injection of&#xD;
      local anesthetic adjacent to the utero-vaginal nerve plexus. Block provides analgesia during&#xD;
      cervical pass of sampling device or manipulation of cervix. The paracervical block seems to&#xD;
      work within few minutes after injection, but the optimal waiting time between injection and&#xD;
      procedure is not known. In this randomized controlled study, it was aimed to determine the&#xD;
      effect of waiting time of 1 minute and 3 minutes after paracervical block in endometrial&#xD;
      sampling procedures using Pipelle cannula in terms of pain during and after the endometrial&#xD;
      sampling and to compare with NSAIDs taken before the procedure.&#xD;

      120 participants who will undergo endometrial biopsy due to abnormal uterine bleeding will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. The research will be conducted in 4 branches. These branches are Group&#xD;
      1: Waiting 1 Minute After Paracervical Block, Group 2: Waiting 3 Minute After Paracervical&#xD;
      Block, Group 3: Control Group and Group 4: Waiting 60 Minute After Taking Oral NSAIDs. Thirty&#xD;
      patients will be included in each group using power analysis of clinical studies in which&#xD;
      endometrial biopsy techniques and pain comparisons were performed before [Mody SK, Farala JP,&#xD;
      Jimenez B, Nishikawa M, Ngo LL. Paracervical Block for Intrauterine Device Placement Among&#xD;
      Nulliparous Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Obstet Gynecol. 2018;132(3):575-582.].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy, pelvic infections, heavy bleeding disorders and NSAID allergy are the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, the success of analgesic methods to be used for endometrial biopsy during and&#xD;
      30 minutes after the procedure will be compared. These methods include waiting 1 minute after&#xD;
      the paracervical block is performed, waiting 3 minutes after the paracervical block is&#xD;
      performed, and taking oral NSAIDs one hour before the procedure. All arms will be included 30&#xD;
      participants and control group with 30 participants is formed. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NPRS) system will be used for each case for pain during the procedure and 30 minutes after&#xD;
      the procedure. According to this system, the fact that the participant have no pain will be&#xD;
      evaluated as &quot;0&quot; point and having the most severe pain she can experience is &quot;10&quot; points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before procedure the cervix and vaginal vault will be prepared with povidone iodine. A&#xD;
      vaginal speculum will be used for optimal exposure and manipulation of cervix. All procedures&#xD;
      will be performed without grasping the cervix with a tenaculum. Two-point (at 4 and 8 o'clock&#xD;
      only) technique will be used for paracervical block for Group 1: Waiting 1 Minute After&#xD;
      Paracervical Block and Group 2: Waiting 3 Minute After Paracervical Block. For these groups&#xD;
      10 ml 2% Prilocaine (VEM İlac, Tekirdag, Turkey) will be injected for each side approximately&#xD;
      10 mm into the cervical stroma at the cervico-vaginal junction with a 22- gauge hypodermic&#xD;
      needle. The capped needle model will be employed for Group 3: Control Group. After cervical&#xD;
      and vaginal preparation with povidone iodine a capped needle will be touched the&#xD;
      cervico-vaginal junction at 4 and 8 o'clock. 550 mg Naproxen Sodium (Abdi Ibrahim, Turkey)&#xD;
      will be given to participants in the Group 4, 60 minutes before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all procedures, low pressure sampling device (Pipelle Cannula, Medbar Medical Equipment&#xD;
      Inc.)will be inserted to the cavity and endometrial samples will be obtained using a&#xD;
      corkscrew rotation combined with a repeating cephalic-caudal motion. The procedure will be&#xD;
      repeated twice in each case to ensure standardization. All endometrial biopsies will be&#xD;
      performed by the same operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NPRS system will be explained to all groups after the procedure and the pain during the&#xD;
      procedure will be requested to be graded. Thirty minutes after the procedure, the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to rate current pain according to the NPRS system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by institutional ethics committee. Written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all participants.&#xD;
