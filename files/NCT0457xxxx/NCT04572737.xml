  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intermittent claudication is the most common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease, a&#xD;
      common cardiovascular disease that causes blocked blood vessels (arteries) in the leg.&#xD;
      Symptoms consist of persistent pain in one or both legs during exercise that is relieved with&#xD;
      rest. Evidence suggests that high levels of uninterrupted sitting and sedentary behaviour are&#xD;
      associated with cardiovascular disease risk, mortality and all-cause mortality. One of the&#xD;
      main goals for treating people with intermittent claudication, is increased participation in&#xD;
      physical activity. Supervised Exercise Programmes are recommended however these are not well&#xD;
      tolerated and compliance is low. Alternative exercise, including short bouts of physical&#xD;
      activity to break up sedentary time, has been suggested to help improve physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate whether alternative exercise, in the form of breaking up&#xD;
      prolonged sitting time, will improve physical function in patients with intermittent&#xD;
      claudication. A suite of multi-modal activities will be developed offering a variety of&#xD;
      exercise activities which will inform a personalised activity plan for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened during their routine clinic appointment at Glenfield Hospital. All&#xD;
      other study activity will take place in a laboratory within the Leicester Diabetes Centre at&#xD;
      the Leicester General Hospital (LGH). Patients will be expected to attend LGH for up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 4 visits where study data will be collected from performing physical measurements&#xD;
      and assessments, and the completion of various questionnaires. Additional data will be&#xD;
      collected from activity monitors which will be worn for up to 8 days at baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up, measuring step count and time, inactivity, activity time and intensity, and sleep&#xD;
      duration. Participants will also be expected to wear activity monitors for the duration of&#xD;
      the 8-week intervention to measure steps. Participants will be in the study for approximately&#xD;
      18 weeks in total.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to further COVID-19 restrictions, amendments to the methodology of the study will be&#xD;
      necessary. In this situation the BREAK UP study will be conducted as an 8-week home-based&#xD;
      before and after intervention study with the aim to improve physical function measured via&#xD;
      the WIQ; and to reduce sitting time by up to 60 minutes per day, seven days a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to make contact with members of the research team twice to&#xD;
      complete assessments remotely, once to complete a coaching consultation, and once per week&#xD;
      during the 8-week activity plan to discuss their performance. Organisation of these, and any&#xD;
      contact associated with recruitment may require more frequent contact with the research team&#xD;
      via telephone or email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact 1 (Recruitment/ eligibility):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expression of interest to participate will be sought by the treating clinician at Glenfield&#xD;
      hospital (listed on the delegation log), who will offer the patient a Participant Information&#xD;
      Sheet and consent form. If the participant is happy for a member of the research team to&#xD;
      contact them within two weeks participants will complete a contact details slip during this&#xD;
      visit and a member of the research team will telephone and/or email the participant to&#xD;
      discuss the study in more detail and determine if they wish to participate or not. Should the&#xD;
      patient choose to participate in the study they will be asked to complete the consent form&#xD;
      and post this back to the research team. Once the signed and dated consent form has been&#xD;
      received, the researcher can organise for the baseline data to be collected. In the situation&#xD;
      whereby discrepancies are found with the completion of the informed consent form which has&#xD;
      been returned via post, a member of the research team will contact the participant via&#xD;
      telephone to help the participant complete a new consent form which will be sent and returned&#xD;
      via post.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact 2 (Baseline assessments):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2 weeks participants will be required to complete baseline assessments which includes&#xD;
      information on their date of birth/age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption,&#xD;
      medical history (co-morbidities) and the questionnaires outlined in 8.3 to assess their&#xD;
      quality of life, breathlessness, anxiety and depression, fatigue and physical function. These&#xD;
      will be completed over the telephone with the researcher or the researcher will post the&#xD;
      questionnaires to the participants which will need to be completed and returned by post.&#xD;
      These assessments will take approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be posted two activity monitors (monitor 1 and 2) one of which will be&#xD;
      wrist worn and the other thigh worn, as well as information on how to fit these. Participants&#xD;
      will wear these for a period of up to 8 days to collect habitual physical activity data. A&#xD;
      daily sleep-wake log will be used to collect data on participants sleep and wake-time, which&#xD;
      will be posted, along with instructions on how to complete these, and returned via post along&#xD;
      with the activity monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact 3 (Coaching consultation):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2 weeks participants will receive a telephone or video call which will be termed a&#xD;
      &quot;coaching consult&quot;, during which sixteen 2-minute activities to break sitting time will be&#xD;
      discussed with a member of the research team. These two-minute activities are outlined in&#xD;
      Figure 1. Video tutorials and/or instruction cards of these activities will be sent via post&#xD;
      prior to the coaching consult. These activities and data from the habitual physical activity&#xD;
      measure will be used to inform personalised activity plans whereby participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged, using Bandura's social cognitive theory, to use these activities to reduce&#xD;
      sitting time by up to 60 minutes per day for 8-weeks. This contact will take approximately&#xD;
      1-hour. The 8-week activity plan will be prescribed, to complete at home and will begin&#xD;
      within 2 weeks of this contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear a wrist-worn activity monitor for the duration of the home-based&#xD;
      8-week intervention (monitor 3). They will be instructed on how to use these during the&#xD;
      coaching consultation and how to complete daily diaries for monitor wear and activity&#xD;
      completion for the 8-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 8-week intervention participants will be contacted once a week via telephone or&#xD;
      video to discuss their performance on the activity plan and completion of the daily diary.&#xD;
      This will take approximately one hour a week. A member of the research team will organise&#xD;
      this over email or telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second 8-day habitual physical activity measurement period will take place during week 8 of&#xD;
      the intervention. Activity monitors 1 and 2 will be posted to participants in good time along&#xD;
      with instructions on how to fit these. During this second habitual physical activity&#xD;
      measurement period participants will continue to wear wrist-worn activity monitor 3 as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact 4 (Follow-up):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be contacted for their final assessments within one week of the end of&#xD;
      the 8-week intervention. The follow-up assessments will include the same assessments as at&#xD;
      baseline, except for the Sarc-F questionnaire, and will be completed via telephone with a&#xD;
      member of the research team, or a researcher will be post these out to the participant for&#xD;
      completion. The assessments will take approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
