      This is a nationwide cohort study to assess maternal and fetal outcomes following vaccination&#xD;
      with a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) during pregnancy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Korean National Immunization Program (NIP) first introduced quadrivalent influenza&#xD;
      immunization for all pregnant women in the 2020-2021 season. This nationwide cohort study is&#xD;
      proposed to assess the risks of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes following vaccination&#xD;
      with a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) during pregnancy. We will use the national health&#xD;
      insurance database from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) linked with the national&#xD;
      immunization program registry data from the Korea Centers for Diseases Control &amp; Prevention&#xD;
      (KCDC).&#xD;
