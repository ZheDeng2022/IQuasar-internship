  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to identify and characterize features derived from digital data (e.g.&#xD;
      social media, online search, mobile media) which are associated with coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (CHD) and related risk factors, and develop models that use digital data and conventional&#xD;
      predictive models to predict CHD risk and health care utilization.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US. While secondary prevention&#xD;
      approaches have improved longevity of patients, risk factors and adverse health behaviors&#xD;
      (e.g., physical inactivity, smoking) are highly prevalent, and in most contemporary series,&#xD;
      less than 1% of adults meet all factors of ideal CV health. The logistics and practicalities&#xD;
      of meeting the goal of ideal CV health have not been clearly elucidated. Practice guidelines&#xD;
      recommend using the Framingham risk score (FRS) or other risk prediction tools to classify&#xD;
      patients' risk of CV disease. These models however are imprecise and there is increasing&#xD;
      focus on identifying markers that provide better measures of risk. As digital platforms are&#xD;
      increasingly used to document lifestyle and health behaviors, data from digital sources may&#xD;
      provide a window into manifestations of novel risk factors and potentially a better&#xD;
      characterization of existing risk factors. While it seems like a cliche to mention the&#xD;
      profound impact of digital data on everyday lives, there is indeed great substance in the&#xD;
      opportunities these new media provide for understanding behavioral, social, and environmental&#xD;
      determinants of health. This project seeks to identify and characterize features derived from&#xD;
      digital data (e.g. social media, online search, mobile media) which are associated with&#xD;
      coronary heart disease (CHD) and related risk factors, and develop models that use digital&#xD;
      data and conventional predictive models to predict CHD risk and health care utilization.&#xD;

    <description>Reliability in predicting CHD related event in patient as measured by Framingham Risk Score.&#xD;
The Framingham Risk Score (FRS) is a validated means of predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Input variables include age, cigarette smoking, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure measurement and treatment for hypertension. Point values are calculated based on each of these risks. A 10-year risk score can be derived as a percentage. Risk scores range from 0-20%.&#xD;
Low Risk: Less than 10% risk that you will develop a heart attack or die from coronary disease in the next 10 years.&#xD;
Intermediate risk: A 10 to 20% risk that you will develop a heart attack or die from coronary disease in the next 10 years.&#xD;
High Risk: A greater than 20% risk that you will develop a heart attack or die from coronary disease in the next 10 years.</description>
