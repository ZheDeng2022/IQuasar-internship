  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dual task training (DTT) have been showed that have satisfying effects on older adults. The&#xD;
      aim of this study was to compare the effect of motor-cognitive DTT (mCdtt) and motor-motor&#xD;
      DTT (mMdtt) on balance, fear of falling, walking functionality and muscle strength in older&#xD;
      adults. The participants were divided into two groups; who received mCdtt (Group 1) and who&#xD;
      received mMdtt (Group 2). The intervention program had lasted for 8 weeks.&#xD;

      Dual task training (DTT) have been showed that have satisfying effects on older adults. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is comparing the effect of motor-cognitive DTT (mCdtt) and motor-motor DTT&#xD;
      (mMdtt) on balance, fear of falling, walking functionality and muscle strength in older&#xD;
      adults. A total of 50 participants aged 60 and over (mean age: 67.72±7.33 years), having a&#xD;
      score ≥ 24 on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), being in category of walking ability ≥ 4&#xD;
      according to the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), having no problem in visual ability&#xD;
      and hearing were included for this study. The participants who received mCdtt (Group 1)&#xD;
      counted back from the two-digit number and the participants who received mMdtt (Group 2) held&#xD;
      half-filled glasses with 90o flexion elbow with both hand while performing exercises. The&#xD;
      intervention program had lasted for 8 weeks. To assess balance, fear of falling, walking&#xD;
      functionality and muscle strength of participants, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Falls Efficacy&#xD;
      Scale International (FES-I), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Hand-held dynamometer were used,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (first assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>BBS is a widely used, reliable and valid scale, which was developed to measure balance in older adults with functional postures and movements. It consists of 14 items scoring from 0 (unable/unsafe) to 4 (independent/safe). The highest score was 56 and means the best ability of balance. Score of 0-20, 21-40 and 41-56 mean bad, fair and good ability of balance, respectively</description>

    <measure>Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (first assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>FES-I evaluates concerns about falling with 16 items consisting of social and physical activities. Each item can be replied as 1=not all concerned, 2=somewhat concerned 3=fairly concerned and 4=very concerned. Total score is in a range between 16 and 64, a higher score means higher concern about falling.</description>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (first assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>(TUG) test is a common, simple and quick test for the function, balance, gait and risk of fall assessment. The TUG was showed to be the most evidence-supported functional measure to evaluate risk of falls in older adults. To perform the test, the participants were asked to seat armchair with back support which was 46 cm above from the floor. The participants were instructed to stand up, walk a distance of 3 meters away from the seat as fast as possible, turn, walk back to seat and sit down. The time passed during this maneuver was recorded as seconds with a chronometer.</description>

    <measure>Muscle Testing (MT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (first assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>MT was performed with Hand-held dynamometer (Lafeyette Instrument®, Lafeyette, IN) to assess power and ability for stability, in this study. Antigravity muscles (m. gluteus maximus, m. quadriceps femoris, m. gastrocnemius and m. tibialis anterior) were assessed while performing maximal volunteer isometric contraction (MVIC) and values were recorded as kg. N-1.</description>

    <description>CCI was used to measure the comorbidity status of participants. It investigates existence of 17 comorbidities. The final score indicates disease burden and is a good estimator of mortality.</description>
