    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to evaluate the impact of virtual reality therapy on&#xD;
      mitigating cancer pain in hospitalized patients with cancer and compare this impact to that&#xD;
      of 2-dimensional guided imagery distraction therapy. The purpose is also to evaluate&#xD;
      acceptability of and satisfaction with virtual reality therapy and to examine racial and&#xD;
      cultural preferences related to virtual reality and guided imagery thematic content.&#xD;

      Subjects hospitalized at MedStar Washington Hospital Center will be considered for enrollment&#xD;
      in this study if able to provide consent, at least 18 years old, and report moderate-severe&#xD;
      pain (at least 4 out of 10 where pain is rated on a Likert scale between zero and 10) in the&#xD;
      previous 24 hours. Subjects will be excluded if they already use VR for personal use, have&#xD;
      intractable nausea/vomiting, history of motion sickness, history of seizures or epilepsy,&#xD;
      have cranial structure abnormalities that prevent use of VR headset, are currently enrolled&#xD;
      in a palliative care or pain management study, and/or are on contact isolation. Institutional&#xD;
      review board approval will be sought and informed consent will be conducted before enrolling&#xD;
      every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consenting to participate, in addition to usual pharmacologic pain management, 128&#xD;
      patients will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio to receive either one 10-minute VR session, or&#xD;
      one 10-minute 2-dimensional guided-imagery session. The investigators believe this sample&#xD;
      size is easily achievable given current palliative consult volumes for patients with cancer&#xD;
      at the study institution (see above); this sample size accounts for estimates that only&#xD;
      approximately half of eligible subjects are interested in trying VR therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR sessions will be administered using the Facebook (Facebook Inc., Menlo Park, CA) Oculus&#xD;
      Quest VR and Touch controllers. This equipment was selected because it is portable and can be&#xD;
      set up at the bedside in private or shared patient rooms. The hand controllers facilitate&#xD;
      immersive, interactive VR experiences for patients who may be bedbound or have limited&#xD;
      mobility in the inpatient setting. The VR software, Forest of Serenity (Holosphere VR Â®,&#xD;
      Birmingham, UK) is a free application that features seven non-violent mini-games in a&#xD;
      carnival environment that can be played in a seated or fixed position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guided-imagery session depicts a peaceful walk through a forest with instrumental&#xD;
      background music and 2-dimensional imagery. Subjects will watch the guided imagery video on a&#xD;
      portable tablet for 10 minutes, the same duration as the VR intervention. Subjects in both&#xD;
      arms will continue to receive standard pharmacologic pain management. Because of the nature&#xD;
      of the compared interventions, subjects and researchers cannot be blinded to intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will determine the impact of distraction therapy (either VR&#xD;
      therapy or 2-dimensional guided imagery) on self-reported pain experience. Self-reported pain&#xD;
      experience remains the standard for clinical pain research. Secondary outcomes will measure&#xD;
      impact of each distraction therapy on general distress level, general quality of life, and&#xD;
      satisfaction with pain management. For patients receiving opioid therapies for pain in the&#xD;
      preceding 24 hours, the investigators will also evaluate &quot;as needed&quot; opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent and randomization, subjects will complete surveys on electronic tablets to&#xD;
      provide baseline data on pain scores, general distress, general quality of life, and&#xD;
      satisfaction with pain management. Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short&#xD;
      Form (BPI-SF, modified to assess symptoms in the last 24 hours) that includes a 0-10 Likert&#xD;
      scale for self-reported pain as well as information about pain location, quality, and&#xD;
      interference of pain on daily living. General distress will be measured using the Distress&#xD;
      Thermometer (a Likert scale measuring from No Distress to Extreme Distress, where &quot;distress&quot;&#xD;
      is defined by the patient). General quality of life will be measured using the Functional&#xD;
      Assessment in Chronic Illness-Therapy in Palliative Care 14-item (FACIT-Pal 14) scale that&#xD;
      measures non-pain symptoms and general well-being. Subjects will also be surveyed regarding&#xD;
      comfort with technology and self-directed use of passive and active distraction therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of baseline surveys, subjects will be administered either VR therapy for 10&#xD;
      minutes or 2-dimensional guided imagery for 10 minutes. For both arms, a member of the&#xD;
      research team will educate the subject on the technology and assure comfort with use,&#xD;
      remaining outside the room but nearby during the actual 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the distraction therapy, subjects will be re-surveyed BPI-SF, FACIT-Pal 14, and&#xD;
      Distress Thermometer. Both groups will also be surveyed and given semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      regarding acceptance of and satisfaction with the distraction therapy intervention itself and&#xD;
      its thematic content. Subjects randomized to VR therapy will be surveyed regarding level of&#xD;
      immersion of the VR experience (Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire,&#xD;
      http://w3.uqo.ca/cyberpsy/docs/qaires/immersion/ITQ_va.pdf).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate any residual effects of the distraction therapy, enrollees will be&#xD;
      re-surveyed BPI-SF, FACIT-Pal 14, Distress Thermometer, and pain management satisfaction&#xD;
      questions on the following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will reach 80% power to detect a difference of 1 unit in the pain score measure&#xD;
      between the 2 groups using a two-sample t-test with equal variance at a two-sided alpha=0.05&#xD;
      and assuming a within-group standard deviation of 2 for each group. Sample size calculations&#xD;
      were conducted in PASS.&#xD;
