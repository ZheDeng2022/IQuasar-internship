    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) is one of the widely recognised and leading treatments for&#xD;
      end-stage liver disease. Nutrition impacts its success. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is&#xD;
      usually prescribed for patients recommended prolonged fasting after LT. The supplement of&#xD;
      SMOFlipid (soybean oil, MCT oil, olive oil, and fish oil) is easily metabolised to produce&#xD;
      energy, and it possesses anti-inflammatory effects; however, SMOFlipid emulsion use raises&#xD;
      concerns regarding coagulopathy after LT. This study investigated the postoperative&#xD;
      correlation between SMOFlipid and coagulation in LT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Liver failure is characterised by the loss of liver function and is complicated with hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy and coagulopathy. Liver transplantation (LT) is one of the widely recognised&#xD;
      and leading treatments for end-stage liver disease. Malnutrition is one of the common&#xD;
      manifestations of this critical condition and is also an independent predictor of mortality.&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that malnutrition is a poor prognostic factor for LT, which&#xD;
      indicates that nutritional support may reduce LT complications and improve survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is usually prescribed for patients recommended prolonged&#xD;
      fasting after LT. The supplement of SMOFlipid (soybean oil, MCT oil, olive oil, and fish oil)&#xD;
      has the advantage of being easily metabolised to produce energy, and it has anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects. The major therapeutic mechanism of fish oil is the attenuation of systematic&#xD;
      inflammation, which may decrease the mortality risk in patients with severe injury and&#xD;
      sepsis. SMOFlipid has been proven to be safe and well tolerated in a wide range of clinical&#xD;
      conditions, and it is used as the standard lipid emulsion. Moreover, the short-term&#xD;
      application of parenteral fish oil with soybean oil not only significantly reduces the&#xD;
      parameters of liver damage in the postoperative period but also leads to a more balanced&#xD;
      immune response, which may result in the faster resolution of inflammation and recovery.&#xD;
      However, SMOFlipid emulsion use may be associated with coagulopathy after LT. Early studies&#xD;
      have shown that the dietary intake of n-3 fatty acids, which is a component of fat, is&#xD;
      associated with antithrombotic effects but increases the risk of bleeding. A detailed&#xD;
      analysis is lacking, and these observations have yet to be proven; this concern persists.&#xD;
      Hence, the investigators should pay attention to the bleeding tendency when using fish oil&#xD;
      fat emulsion because it may aggravate the risk of bleeding. Therefore, the use of fish&#xD;
      oil-containing fat emulsion and its related risks is a clinically important issue in early LT&#xD;
      that should be investigated, because liver function is not restored immediately after&#xD;
      transplantation, and there is a tendency of coagulopathy. Thus, classical haemostasis&#xD;
      parameters such as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and platelet count are&#xD;
      measured prior to surgery and before the start of TPN. However, many questions remain&#xD;
      unanswered regarding nutritional assessment and support for these seriously ill,&#xD;
      nutritionally, and metabolically complex patients. This study evaluated the effect of the&#xD;
      SMOFlipid supplement in TPN in LT patients.&#xD;

    <description>TPN and SMOFlipid support were indicated for patients who received NPO for more than 3 days, such as those with repeated laparotomy, staged biliary reconstruction, massive nasogastric (NG) drainage (&gt;500 mL/day), ileus, diarrhoea, poor digestion (NG extraction &gt;50 mL/time), and chylous ascites.&#xD;
Furthermore, SMOFlipid was discontinued when the platelet count decreased to 40,000/μL or less. In all cases, heparinisation was prescribed to maintain the aPTT level between 1.5 and 2 times the normal controlled level at least for 10-14 days, with daily blood examination conducted. Oral administration of dipyridamole (75 mg, QID) for 3 months was indicated for stimulation of antiplatelet activity when the platelet count increased to 40,000/μL or more.</description>

Patients with well-tolerated oral intake and those in whom the TPN supplement was discontinued within 10 days were excluded from this study.</description>
