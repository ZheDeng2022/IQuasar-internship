    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to investigate in high burden caregivers the effects of a&#xD;
      face-to-face meditation program during four weeks (16 hours) on physiological parameters,&#xD;
      psychological state and vagal nerve activity comparing with a control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A non-randomized repeated-measures controlled clinical trial was conducted with convenience&#xD;
      allocation of participants into intervention (n = 18) or control group (n = 17). Due to&#xD;
      ethical reasons, it was not possible to randomize the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators invited from different associations in Granada city and its province&#xD;
      through word and mouth or by telephone to 45 volunteer informal caregivers. 40 of them&#xD;
      enrolled in this study but only 37 finalized the program, 24.3% male and 75.7% female with a&#xD;
      mean (SD) age of 44.03 (7.30) years. The people that have previous experience in mind body&#xD;
      practices or cardiovascular diseases were excluded. All the caregivers received information&#xD;
      about the study and informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study was&#xD;
      approved by the CEI-GR (C-9) ethics committee and followed the principles of the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki. Convenience sampling was used to assign caregivers to the control or&#xD;
      experimental groups.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Happiness on the Lima happiness questionnaire after 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Lima happiness questionnaire: Validated self-administered questionnaire consisting of 27 items, integrated into 4 subscales (Positive sense of life, Satisfaction with life, Personal fulfillment and Joy of life), which refer to the level of happiness or satisfaction that the person has with respect to his life.&#xD;
The respondent may be: (1) Strongly agree, (2) Agree, (3) Neither agree nor disagree, (4) Disagree or (5) Strongly disagree, with any question that arises. According to the total score there are 5 levels of happiness: from 27-87: very low happiness, 88-95: low, 96-110: medium, 111-118: high, 119-135: very high.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Anxiety and Depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) after 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Validated self-administered instrument for outpatients that advises on the possible presence of anxiety and depression in any non-psychiatric medical consultation. Describe how the patient feels affective and emotionally during the last week.&#xD;
It has 14 items, 7 for each subscale with a scale similar to four points (from 0 to 3). Lower scores reflect better outcomes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Heart rate and Heart rate variability after 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>We measured short-term HRV using an accepted method in order to assess the cardiovascular balance (Kappussami 2020). We asked participants to lie in a supine position for 10 min of rest with normal breathing (following a metronome at 0.2 Hz) and no external stimulation in a quiet room with a temperature of 22-25 °C.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Blood pressure/heart rate after 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>We measured blood pressure and heart rate before and after the treatment session using an Omron HEM-7320-Z validated automatic oscillometer.</description>

    <description>The caregivers received eight sessions lasting each one two hours with the following sequence: before each practical exercises they always received 15 minutes about scientific theoretical evidence explaining the importance of doing them: to get a comfortable posture they received 25 minutes of mobility, flexibility, balance, strength and endurance exercises. To increase lung capacity, 25 minutes of costal, diaphragmatic and clavicular breathing exercises. Finally, to have an open attitude without distractions or judging they practiced 25 minutes of body awareness exercise observing sensations, thoughts and perceptions with gratitude and compassion.</description>
