  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) associated with lymphadenectomy is the only curative option for&#xD;
      patients affected by pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In 2014, the International&#xD;
      Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) defined the &quot;standard lymphadenectomy&quot;, that is&#xD;
      mandatory during PD for PDAC. Lymphadenectomy should include the removal of the&#xD;
      hepatoduodenal ligament nodes (stations 5, 6, 12b1, 12b2, 12c according the classification of&#xD;
      Japanese Pancreas Society), nodes along the hepatic artery (station 8a), the posterior&#xD;
      surface of the pancreatic head (station 13a and 13b), the superior mesenteric artery (14a&#xD;
      right lateral side, 14b right lateral side) and nodes of the anterior surface of the&#xD;
      pancreatic head (stations 17a and 17b). The inclusion of para-aortic lymphnodes (PALN)&#xD;
      (station 16) in standard lymphadenectomy is still matter of debate. Moreover, some&#xD;
      retrospectives or prospective studies reported that the presence of PALN metastases has a&#xD;
      significant negative prognostic impact. Until now, no randomized studies comparing PD&#xD;
      associated with standard lymphadenectomy with or without removal of PALN have been published.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if the removal of station 16 should be routinely&#xD;
      included in standard lymphadenectomy during PD for PDAC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with lymphadenectomy is the current treatment of pancreatic&#xD;
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The optimal lymphadenectomy during PD (standard versus&#xD;
      extended) has been largely debated during the last two decades. Four randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) published afterward reported no survival benefit, and no arguments could be&#xD;
      presented based on the evidence of these studies to support the role of extended&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy during PD. A similar conclusion was underlined also in two meta-analyses, the&#xD;
      first from Michalski et al., in which 3 RCTs were analyzed, and the second from Iqbal et al.,&#xD;
      in which both RCTs and cohort studies were included, both of which showed no benefit of&#xD;
      extended lymphadenectomy. However, the definition of lymphadenectomy varied considerably&#xD;
      between the RCTs. For this reason, in 2014, the International Study Group on Pancreatic&#xD;
      Surgery (ISGPS) defined the &quot;standard lymphadenectomy&quot; during PD for PDAC. Lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      should include the removal of the hepatoduodenal ligament nodes (stations 5, 6, 12b1, 12b2,&#xD;
      12c according the classification of Japanese Pancreas Society), nodes along the hepatic&#xD;
      artery (station 8a), the posterior surface of the pancreatic head (station 13a and 13b), the&#xD;
      superior mesenteric artery (14a right lateral side, 14b left lateral side) and nodes of the&#xD;
      anterior surface of the pancreatic head (stations 17a and 17b). Para-aortic lymph nodes&#xD;
      (PALN; station 16) are considered as &quot;extra-regional&quot; lymph nodes. Some questions about PALN&#xD;
      still remain open: a) should the removal of station 16 be routinely included in the standard&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy during PD for PDAC? b) in case of removal of station 16 and intraoperative&#xD;
      demonstration of PALN metastases at frozen section, should PD be avoided ? Several&#xD;
      retrospective reports described that the prognosis of patients with metastatic PALN is&#xD;
      significantly worse if compared with patients with negative PALN. Two recent-metaanalyses&#xD;
      have been published on this topic, confirming that PALN metastases correlated with poor&#xD;
      prognosis in patients with PDAC. However, these meta-analyses concluded that, due to the&#xD;
      presence of some long survivors even in cases of PALN metastases, the definitive avoidance of&#xD;
      PD in these cases needs further investigation. Until now, no consensus in case of&#xD;
      intraoperative metastatic PALN has been reached. Moreover, it's not still clear if the&#xD;
      removal of PALN during PD should be routinely performed. Until now, no randomized studies&#xD;
      comparing PD with or without removal of PALN have been published. In 2014, during the&#xD;
      consensus meeting of ISGPS, there was extensive discussion about PALN removal: no strong&#xD;
      recommendation was formulated on dissecting station 16 routinely and it was not included in&#xD;
      standard lymphadenectomy. For this reason, we decided to plan this multicentric RCT that&#xD;
      compares upfront PD with and without the removal of PALN, in order to evaluate if their&#xD;
      removal should be routinely included in standard lymphadenectomy during PD for PDAC.&#xD;
