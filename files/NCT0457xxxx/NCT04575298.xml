      To evaluate the acceptability (including gastrointestinal tolerance and compliance) of a&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an acceptability study to evaluate the gastrointestinal tolerance and compliance over&#xD;
      a 7-day period, of Amino acid formula with HMOs, which is a hypoallergenic amino acid for&#xD;
      infant formula for the dietary management of cows' milk allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acceptability data from a minimum of 15 participants will be collected in order to submit&#xD;
      an application to the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS) and the HSE for the&#xD;
      Ireland to be reimbursed under the GMS and community drug schemes&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients well established and stable on Alfamino (or another amino acid formula dependent&#xD;
        on feasibility of reaching required numbers) for the dietary management of presumed CMA (no&#xD;
        gastrointestinal intolerances on current formula).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Full term infants less than 12 months of age where the amino acid formula is still the sole&#xD;
        source of nutrition. Full term infants less than 12 months of age where the amino acid&#xD;
        formula is required for 1 week to measure GI tolerance and 1 week of exclusive HMO amino&#xD;
        acid formula intake. Thereafter formula intake data will be collected for the remaining 3&#xD;
        weeks and the child can be weaned at this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;

        opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previously not tolerated Alfamino without HMOs. More than 12 months old Need an amino acid&#xD;
        formula as supplementary use Patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment Change&#xD;
        in current medication or use of additional macro/micronutrient supplements during the study&#xD;
        period, unless clinically indicated and prescribed by the investigator e.g. thickener, PPIs&#xD;
        etc (must be recorded in patient case record file).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation in another interventional study within 2 weeks of this study. Introduction of&#xD;
        complementary feeding during the study period Caregiver unable to read and write in English&#xD;
