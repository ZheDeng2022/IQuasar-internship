  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-dose CT Screening has been shown in two large trials in the United States (NLST) and&#xD;
      Europe (NELSON) to increase overall survival in subjects 55 years of age and older with a&#xD;
      strong smoking history. Unfortunately, in both North Carolina (NC) and South Carolina (SC),&#xD;
      subjects are found to have the above referenced smoking history prior to reaching the minimum&#xD;
      age in these studies. This study is aimed at decreasing the minimum age of screening in a&#xD;
      high-risk population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the lung cancer diagnosis rate in&#xD;
      individuals 40-54 years of age at their first screening (T0) with mobile low-dose CT.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include evaluating the lung cancer diagnosis rate in individuals 40-54&#xD;
      years of age at subsequent screening visits (T1 and T2); evaluating the positive screening&#xD;
      rate at T0, T1, and T2; evaluating the impact of baseline demographic (including insurance&#xD;
      status), socioeconomic, and healthcare-related factors on lung cancer rates and positive&#xD;
      screening rates; and summarizing the incidence rate of all types of cancer found with&#xD;
      low-dose lung CT during lung cancer screening. Enrollment will continue until 174 subjects&#xD;
      are identified in the evaluable population with a total of 1160 subjects anticipated to be&#xD;
      enrolled and screened.&#xD;
