      Population studies estimate that patients who have episodic migraine transition to chronic&#xD;
      migraine at a rate of about 2.5% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CM is a devastating disorder associated to severe disability. Patients with CM frequently&#xD;
      overuse symptomatic medications in the attempt to control their disease, which adds up to the&#xD;
      high costs associated to the disorder In this frame, it seems of the outmost importance to&#xD;
      strive at preventing the transition from EM to CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment Onabotulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) represents the only drug specifically approved&#xD;
      for CM prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of BoNT-A in reducing the number of&#xD;
      migraine days in a population of migraineurs with a high frequency of migraine attacks over a&#xD;
      12-month period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Episodic migraine (EM) is a common type of disabling headache that affects up to 15% of the&#xD;
      general population. In a minority of patients, migraine progressively increase in frequency,&#xD;
      until it becomes chronic. According to the criteria of the International Headache Society&#xD;
      chronic migraine (CM) is characterized by a headache that is present on at least 15 days per&#xD;
      month over at least three months period, with migraine characteristics on at least 8&#xD;
      days/month. Population studies estimate that patients who have episodic migraine transition&#xD;
      to chronic migraine at a rate of about 2.5% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CM is a devastating disorder associated to severe disability. Patients with CM frequently&#xD;
      overuse symptomatic medications in the attempt to control their disease, which adds up to the&#xD;
      high costs associated to the disorder In this frame, it seems of the outmost importance to&#xD;
      strive at preventing the transition from EM to CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transition to CM rarely is a rapid phenomenon. Most often it occurs over several months or&#xD;
      years during which the frequency of attacks progressively increases as does the intake of&#xD;
      acute medications. High monthly headache frequency is a risk factor for the progression of&#xD;
      episodic migraine to chronic migraine. Compelling evidence from clinical and pre-clinical&#xD;
      studies suggests that the transformation into CM is associated to, and probably brought about&#xD;
      by, plastic changes in the peripheral and central nervous system induced by the repetitive&#xD;
      occurrence of pain attacks. These changes configure a condition of chronic sensitization,&#xD;
      usually associated to a reduced response to treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this frame, it is noteworthy that the investigators previously showed that patients with&#xD;
      CM overusing acute medications bear a condition of enhanced facilitation of spinal cord pain&#xD;
      processing that is detectable with specific neurophysiological evaluations. The situation&#xD;
      normalizes, i.e. pain facilitation is reduced, 60 days after successful treatment. Similarly,&#xD;
      the Danish group showed that patients with chronic headache associated to medication overuse&#xD;
      (most of whom were suffering from CM) are sensitized to pain, and pain perception continues&#xD;
      to normalise over a period of at least 12 months when patients are successfully treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment Onabotulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) represents the only drug specifically approved&#xD;
      for CM prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven different subtypes of botulinum toxin (A-G) are known. A highly-diluted preparation of&#xD;
      botulinum toxin type A was introduced in clinical practice in the 1970s and 1980s to treat&#xD;
      squint and blepharospasm. Since then, it has found uses in other areas of medicine including&#xD;
      dystonia (including writer's cramp), post-stroke spasticity, and hyperhidrosis but in the&#xD;
      mid-1990s a number of people reported improvement in headaches in patients receiving&#xD;
      botulinum toxin for other reasons. Finally, in the first decade of 2000 two trials, the Phase&#xD;
      3 Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) recruited 1384 patients with&#xD;
      chronic migraine, and randomised them to treatment with BoNT-A (Botox® by Allergan&#xD;
      Industries) or placebo. These patients were suffering on average 20 days of headache each&#xD;
      month, of which 18 were moderate or severe. Those randomised to Botox®® received fixed-site,&#xD;
      fixed dose injections every 12 weeks over 56 weeks. These injections covered seven specific&#xD;
      areas of the head and neck, with a total dose of between 155-195 units. At six months, after&#xD;
      two cycles of treatment, those treated with Botox® had on average eight less days of headache&#xD;
      each month. After 12 months, 70% of those treated had ≤50% the number of headaches that they&#xD;
      had done originally. Botox® was well-tolerated, the commonest side effects being neck pain&#xD;
      (6.7%), muscular weakness (5.5%), and drooping of the eyelid (3.3%). No serious irreversible&#xD;
      side effects have ever been reported in trials of Botox® in headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies led in 2013 to the approval by AIFA of Botox® as a drug form CM prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing body of evidence suggests that BoNT-A acts on peripheral trigeminal endings by&#xD;
      inhibiting the release of nociceptive neuropeptides - such as calcitonin gene-related peptide&#xD;
      (CGRP) - and glutamate, as well as the expression of the transient receptor potential&#xD;
      vanilloid 1, thereby reducing directly peripheral sensitization, and, indirectly, central&#xD;
      sensitization. It is noteworthy that preclinical data also suggest a central antinociceptive&#xD;
      action for BoNT-A, probably associated with an enhanced opioidergic and GABA-ergic&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these observations provide the rationale of this study, which is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether BoNT-A treatment is effective in reducing the number of migraine days in migraineurs&#xD;
      with a high monthly frequency of migraine attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase II, single group, non-randomized, non-controlled, open label trial&#xD;
      performed at a single centre: Mondino Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients affected by migraine with high frequency of attacks per month were enrolled at the&#xD;
      Headache Science Centre of IRCCS C. Mondino in Pavia. After the screening visit, selected&#xD;
      patients were evaluated with a headache daily diary for a period of 1 month. If the diagnosis&#xD;
      of episodic migraine with high frequency of attacks per month was confirmed, the patient were&#xD;
      enrolled and received the treatment with BoNT-A at the centre every 3 months for 4 cycles (at&#xD;
      visit V2-V5-V8-V11). At the first administration of the treatment (V2), 155 UI of Botox were&#xD;
      injected according to the approved PREEMPT protocol, in 31 sites. From visit 5, the PREEMPT&#xD;
      'follow-the-pain' paradigm will be applied in patients falling in the 'non-responder' or&#xD;
      'partial responder' classes after the 1st BoNT-A injection, with the possibility to increase&#xD;
      the doses up to 195 UI in maximum 39 sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 month the patients were asked to fill in 3 validated questionnaires for the&#xD;
      quantification of disability (Migraine Disability Assessment Score Questionnaire - MIDAS),&#xD;
      quality of life (Mental Status Questionnaire - MSQ), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety&#xD;
      and Depression Scale - HADS). Every month the patient also received a phone call from the&#xD;
      site personnel in order to be updated on the clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all the study period the patient was asked to complete a daily headache diary in order&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical condition and the medications use.&#xD;
