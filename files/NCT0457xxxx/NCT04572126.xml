  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will examine both the feasibility and efficacy of a single session,&#xD;
      web-based mindfulness-based intervention for smoking cessation. The study will explore (1)&#xD;
      participants' subjective experiences of the intervention, (2) cravings and negative affect&#xD;
      both before and after the intervention, and (3) changes in tobacco use one week and one month&#xD;
      following the initial intervention. Further, the study will examine how often participants&#xD;
      utilize the intervention between the initial study and follow-up periods.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Ratings Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's ratings of subjective likeability and helpfulness of the intervention. These ratings will be measured on a 5-point Likert Scale with higher scores representing more likeability and helpfulness. The 11-item questionnaire results in a score ranging from 11-55.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Past Month Cigarette and E-Cigarette use.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before the intervention and at one-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>An online version of the TLFB (Sobbel &amp; Sobbel, 1992) will be used to measure past-month cigarette and e-cigarette use. The measure will be administered pre-intervention and one-month following the intervention to show change over time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cigarette/E-cigarette Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately preceding and following intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Craving to smoke will be measured using the 10-item Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (Cox, Tiffany, &amp; Christen, 2001).While the QSU-brief can be scored by using all 10 items for one total craving score, maximum likelihood factor analysis of the QSU-brief revealed a two-factor model consisting of (1) a strong desire and intention to smoke with the perception of receiving positive rewards from smoking and (2) the expectation that smoking would relieve negative affect and the strong desire to smoke. The measure will be administered immediately preceding and following the intervention to show intervention influence on craving.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately preceding and following intervention as well as at one-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and negative affect will be measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (Watson &amp; Clark, 1999).</description>
