  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is the most common Food Allergy (FA) in children, and the essential&#xD;
      strategy in prevention is avoiding the allergens that may cause potentially life-threatening&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary developmental task of early childhood is the creation of healthy eating habits.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of FA in this period can lead to permanent changes in the life of the child and&#xD;
      her family. In early childhood, parents are often responsible for all aspects of FA&#xD;
      management because children are too young to understand the complexity of avoiding allergens.&#xD;
      Children often do not have the skills to implement FA management. Parents are advised to&#xD;
      follow a special weaning diet, avoiding any type of cow's milk, usually at least 1 year old.&#xD;
      However, depending on the clinical improvement, it can be recommended to continue this&#xD;
      exclusion diet for much longer. Thus, many children have to exclude a large group of food&#xD;
      from their diets, which is critical for their growth, development, and eating habits. This&#xD;
      may raise mealtime behavioral anxiety in a child with a FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eating behavioral anxieties are also very common in healthy, typically developing children.&#xD;
      Even 25% to 45% of normally developing children's parents report concerns about their child's&#xD;
      nutritional and mealtime behaviors, including the destructive child behaviors (eg., refusal&#xD;
      of foods, food selectivity, and getting off the table).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children with food allergies, monitoring long-term growth after the diet is another&#xD;
      important issue. Growth problems were reported in 21% of children with FA diagnosed with&#xD;
      malnutrition. Most studies focused on the effect of changes in eating behavior on growth&#xD;
      during an elimination diet or in short term intervals. Its long-term effects have only been&#xD;
      analyzed in a few studies. We aimed to investigate the eating behaviors, nutritional status,&#xD;
      and growth of young children (ages of 2 to 6) who had a strict diet due to CMA in early&#xD;
      childhood (ages of 0-2).&#xD;

      Study Design The study is planned to be a cross-sectional, case-control study and it will be&#xD;
      carried out between October 2020 and November 2020 in our tertiary care center (university&#xD;
      hospital located in Ankara, Turkey). The study will be conducted with the collaboration of&#xD;
      the departments of Pediatric Immunology and Allergy and Nutrition and Dietetics. The study&#xD;
      was approved by our University ethics committee (2011- KAEK-19) with the decision number of&#xD;
      108/2019. The children eligible for the study group will be enrolled from the pediatric&#xD;
      allergy and immunology outpatient unit. The control group children will be selected from the&#xD;
      health visitor clinics of Pediatrics. The patient informed consent form will be obtained from&#xD;
      all children's parents at the beginning of the study.The study will be performed on Caucasian&#xD;
      origin children who are among 2 to 6 years of age. The study group will be composed of&#xD;
      children (n=31) who had CMA (Ig E-mediated and/or non-Ig E-mediated and/or mixed type) proved&#xD;
      with oral food challenge tests in their early childhood (in ages of 0-2). The control group&#xD;
      (n=31) will include healthy children who had never been on a diet throughout their lives. No&#xD;
      children in the study and control groups will be on a dietary restriction during the study.&#xD;
      The inclusion and the exclusion criteria are given in detail at the space for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The children's eating behavior will be evaluated with Turkish validated&#xD;
      Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire - (CEBQ) by interviewing mothers face to face. The&#xD;
      CEBQ is a Likert type, parent-report rating scale measuring the variation in eating behavior&#xD;
      in children. The CEBQ consists of 35 items comprising eight subscales, each containing 3 to 6&#xD;
      items. Parents were asked to rate their child's eating behavior on a five-point scale (never,&#xD;
      rarely, sometimes, often, always; 1-5, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8 subscales of CEBQ and their interpretation are: The sub-scales Satiety Responsiveness&#xD;
      (SR) (i.e., &quot;My child has a big appetite&quot;, 7 items), Slowness in Eating (SE) (i.e., &quot;My child&#xD;
      eats slowly&quot;, 4 items), Emotional Undereating (EUE) (i.e., &quot;My child eats less when she/he is&#xD;
      tired&quot;, 4 items), and Food Fussiness (FF) (i.e., &quot;My child refuses new foods at first&quot;, 3&#xD;
      items) assess &quot;food avoidance&quot; (i.e., increased internal satiety and avoidance of eating),&#xD;
      while the sub-scales Food Responsiveness (FR) (i.e., &quot;My child is always asking for food&quot;, 5&#xD;
      items), Enjoyment of Food (EF) (i.e., &quot;My child loves food&quot;, 5 items), Desire to Drink (DD)&#xD;
      (i.e., &quot;My child is always asking for a drink&quot;, 3 items), and Emotional Overeating (EOE)&#xD;
      (i.e., &quot;My child eats more when worried&quot;, 4 items) assess &quot;food approach&quot; (i.e., high&#xD;
      responsiveness to food). Higher scores indicate a stronger display of food approach or food&#xD;
      avoidance (except FF) behavior. In the Turkish version of the CEBQ, a lower score for FF&#xD;
      means a stronger display for fussy eating. Therefore, while calculating the food avoidance&#xD;
      total score, reversed items of FF were summed with SR, SE, and EUE. The food approach total&#xD;
      score will be calculated by the summation of FR, EF, DD, and EOE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another questionnaire that will be conducted with the mothers will be to discuss their&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics. Three days' food record will be obtained from each mother&#xD;
      (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day). On the same days, the food consumed by children at school&#xD;
      will be recorded by the teachers, and consumption registration forms will be combined at the&#xD;
      end of three days. Portion sizes and volumes will be estimated with a portion size picture&#xD;
      book, including 120 photographs of foods, each with 3-5 different portion sizes. In addition,&#xD;
      each serves of participants will be confirmed with the pictures taken by the parents that&#xD;
      will show the plates of their children before and after each meal. Only the forms accurately&#xD;
      registered will be evaluated. BeBiS software version 7.2 will be used to calculate the daily&#xD;
      intake of energy, macronutrients, micronutrients, and dairy products. The Nutrition Guide&#xD;
      will be assessed the adequacy of children's nutrient intake for Turkey according to age and&#xD;
      gender. The same researcher will take the body weights (kg) and height (cm) of the children&#xD;
      with the same method, previously described by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the&#xD;
      same measuring instruments. Measurements will be performed using the standardized Conformité&#xD;
      Européene marked scales and stadiometers [A baby scale (Testut, Paris) will be used for&#xD;
      infants weighing &lt;15 kg and an electronic scale (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) will be used for&#xD;
      children weighing &gt;15 kg. Seca 213 and infantometer will be used for measuring participants'&#xD;
      height]. Scale and stadiometer are routinely calibrated in our hospital according to rules of&#xD;
      quality. Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated with the formula kg/m2. The anthropometric&#xD;
      (height-for-age [HFA], weight-for-age [WFA], and body mass index-for-age [BMI]) measurements&#xD;
      will be evaluated according to the Z-score using the WHO ANTHRO program (Version 3.2.2,&#xD;
      January 2011) and WHO ANTHRO Plus Software (WHO, 2009b) [Z-score = Patient's value - Average&#xD;
      value / Standard Deviation (SD)]. The Z-score (SDS) in the average child by age will be &quot;0&quot;.&#xD;
      Values between +2 SD and - 2 SD will be considered normal upper and lower limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primarily, we will compare the eating behavior of children who had a strict CME diet due to&#xD;
      CMA in early childhood with healthy children. Secondarily, we will evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      children's eating behavior on participants' nutritional status and anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
