  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study (RECOVER-LT) is to better understand the long-term paths of&#xD;
      recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) for an additional 5 year period after the original&#xD;
      RECOVER (NCT03604861) study. Long-term patterns of abstinence/opioid misuse as well as&#xD;
      measures of participants' physical, psychological, social and economic well being will be&#xD;
      monitored in order to identify factors associated with recovery from OUD.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of recovery will include assessment of symptoms of OUD as measured by an Opioid Craving Scale, using a visual analog scale which measures moment opioid craving, craving over the past 7 days and craving if participant was present in a previous drug use environment. Higher numbers indicate worse symptoms of craving.</description>
