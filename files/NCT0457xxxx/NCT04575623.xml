  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a neurological disease associated with an altered cortical excitability level .&#xD;
      The prevalence of migraine is10.5% of adults in Assiut governorate, and is more frequent in&#xD;
      women and in individuals with higher education level . There is evidence that migraine&#xD;
      patients could present cognitive deficits, being the affected functions memory, processing&#xD;
      information speed and attention. It was found that the prevalence of migraine in AlQuseir was&#xD;
      4.8/100 and the highest figures found during early adult life(18-40) years old .Patients with&#xD;
      migraine found to perform significantly worse in duration pattern test(DPT),non-verbal&#xD;
      dichotic test ,speech in noise (SPIN)test and found to have longer p300 frequency stimulus&#xD;
      latency which indicate presence of cognitive and central auditory processing dysfunction&#xD;

      The definition of central auditory processing CAP is based on auditory functions . Central&#xD;
      auditory processing CAP involves a large number of skills which are highly dependent on a set&#xD;
      integrity of the auditory pathways, from the outer ear to the auditory cortex. These skills&#xD;
      include auditory selective attention, sound detection, and localization, discrimination of&#xD;
      isolated and sequential sounds, as well as speech recognition, auditory comprehension and&#xD;
      memory .&#xD;
&#xD;
      central auditory processing CAP is an indispensable tool for the investigation of the&#xD;
      function of the central nervous system . The impairment of auditory processing could cause&#xD;
      difficulties in complex listening situations, such as understanding speech in back-ground&#xD;
      noise, rapid or degraded speech, and problems with comprehending verbal instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central auditory perception (CAP) can be assessed by Behavioral tests, which demonstrate good&#xD;
      correlations with electrophysiological measures . Recording of event-related potentials&#xD;
      (ERPs), because of its objectivity and noninvasive characteristics, presents one of the most&#xD;
      useful tools in investigating neural substrates and cerebral regions involved in specific&#xD;
      cognitive function. It implies recording of brain activity during a cognitive task .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the components of ERPs, theP300 is undoubtedly the most studied cerebral wave in&#xD;
      evaluating cerebral information processing during the course of various neurological diseases&#xD;
      because of its easy recording and reliability . The P300 develops if the subject is actively&#xD;
      engaged in the task of detecting the targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amplitude of the wave varies with the improbability of the targets and latency with the&#xD;
      difficulty of discriminating the target stimulus from the standard stimuli . Typical peak&#xD;
      latency P300 latency reflects timing of mental processes and the increase of latency&#xD;
      represents prolongation of the processing time&#xD;
