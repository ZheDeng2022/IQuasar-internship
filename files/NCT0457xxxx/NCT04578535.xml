      The purpose of the study is to assess the tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      HYQVIA with ramp-up and no ramp-up dosing in healthy adult participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is comprised of Part 1 and Part 2. Each study part consists of three treatment&#xD;
      arms (Part 1 [N=24]: Treatment Arms 1-3 and Part 2 [N=24]: Treatment Arms 4-6). Treatment&#xD;
      arms will be initiated in parallel within each study part. Each participant will participate&#xD;
      in only one treatment arm. After participants in Treatment Arms 1-3 (Study Part 1) have&#xD;
      completed Week 9, the tolerability and, safety data through Week 9 will be reviewed by a&#xD;
      safety review team. (Participants in arms 1-3 will continue in the study as the safety review&#xD;
      is being completed.) Once the safety review for Arms 1-3 (Study part 1) has been completed&#xD;
      and approved, Treatment Arms 4-6 (Study Part 2) will begin.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants with Tolerability Events Related to Infusion of HYQVIA</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of the study drug administration up to End of Study (EOS) (up to Day 182)</time_frame>
    <description>An infusion is considered tolerable if the infusion rate was not reduced, or the infusion was not interrupted or stopped, due to an AE related to HYQVIA infusion. A tolerability event is considered to have occurred if an infusion was tolerable. Tolerability events will be measured in terms of the number of participants for which the infusion was tolerable. Number of participants with tolerability events related to the infusion of HYQVIA will be assessed.</description>

    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the treatments or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the treatments. TEAE's will include clinical laboratory measurements, vital signs, serious, non-serious, severe, local and systemic TEAEs, TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation from study, and infusion-associated TEAEs, as well as number of participants and infusions with suspected adverse reactions plus adverse reactions of interest. Occurrence of TEAEs will be assessed.</description>
