      The investigators will link community pharmacy and primary care practices via a shared&#xD;
      electronic health record to improve medication therapy management for older patients taking&#xD;
      complex prescription (Rx) regimens. The Technology-Enabled Alliance for Medication Therapy&#xD;
      Management (TEAM) intervention will link a major, national community pharmacy chain&#xD;
      (Walgreens) to primary care practices (Access Community Health Network) via a shared&#xD;
      electronic health record (EHR) platform (Epic, Verona WI). Through shared access to patients'&#xD;
      medical records, pharmacists can perform comprehensive medication therapy management&#xD;
      services, document and communicate patients' Rx challenges for review and action by primary&#xD;
      care providers. The aims of this investigation are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the fidelity and efficacy of the TEAM intervention to promote healthcare&#xD;
           provider counseling, medication reconciliation, and safe regimen use among adults taking&#xD;
           complex Rx regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore patient, healthcare provider (pharmacist, prescriber), community pharmacy and/or&#xD;
           primary care practice barriers to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the costs of the TEAM intervention from both a community pharmacy and primary&#xD;
           care practice perspective.&#xD;

      The investigators will link community pharmacy and primary care practices via a shared&#xD;
      electronic health record to improve medication therapy management for older patients taking&#xD;
      complex prescription (Rx) regimens. The Technology-Enabled Alliance for Medication Therapy&#xD;
      Management (TEAM) intervention will link a major, national community pharmacy chain&#xD;
      (Walgreens) to primary care practices (ACCESS community health network) via a shared&#xD;
      electronic health record (EHR) platform (Epic, Verona WI). Through shared access to patients'&#xD;
      medical records, pharmacists can perform comprehensive medication therapy management&#xD;
      services, document and communicate patients' Rx challenges for review and action by primary&#xD;
      care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a 2-arm pilot to evaluate the efficacy of the TEAM&#xD;
      intervention compared to enhanced usual care. The investigators will enroll a total of 120&#xD;
      English and Spanish-speaking patients prescribed five or more chronic medications. Enrolled&#xD;
      patients will complete a follow-up interview two months after their baseline interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TEAM intervention enables a pharmacist to help patients on complex Rx regimens via&#xD;
      medication reviews by telephone and clinical decision support. Pharmacists will call patients&#xD;
      to conduct a Comprehensive Medication Review (CMR). Pharmacists will be able to document and&#xD;
      communicate patients' medication challenges for review and action by primary care providers.&#xD;
      A CMR will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ensure the primary care physician knows all medications the patient is taking&#xD;
           (reconciliation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate if patients are taking medication as prescribed, in a safe manner (proper&#xD;
           use)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Monitor and detect any drug-related adverse effects (ADEs) (surveillance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Address any questions or concerns patients may have about their medicine (e.g. side&#xD;
           effects, treatment alternatives, dietary restrictions, cost, 90 vs. 30 day scripts;&#xD;
           education)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Inquire about patients' adherence to regimens, what barriers they may experience (e.g.&#xD;
           cost, forgetfulness) and if they need assistance (e.g. synchronization requests, pill&#xD;
           box or reminder tools, etc.; adherence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After performing the CMR, the pharmacist will provide timely notifications via secure,&#xD;
      EHR-based messaging direct to prescribers of any medication concerns, based on either 1)&#xD;
      pharmacy information (e.g. medications ordered by other prescribers, fill data), 2) patient&#xD;
      report of problems during phone-based encounters, or 3) pharmacist review of the patient&#xD;
      record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this investigation are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the fidelity and efficacy of the TEAM intervention to promote healthcare&#xD;
           provider counseling, medication reconciliation, and safe regimen use among adults taking&#xD;
           complex Rx regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore patient, healthcare provider (pharmacist, prescriber), community pharmacy and/or&#xD;
           primary care practice barriers to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the costs of the TEAM intervention from both a community pharmacy and primary&#xD;
           care practice perspective.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to the TEAM intervention arm will receive at least one call from a Walgreens pharmacist to help them with their complex Rx regimens. Pharmacists will have read/write EHR access with established Epic security points. Through shared access to patients' medical records, pharmacists can perform comprehensive medication therapy management services, document and communicate patients' Rx challenges for review and action by primary care providers. After the pharmacist calls the patient for a Comprehensive Medication Review, they will add notes in their medication list for the prescriber, requesting the removal or discontinuation of prescribed drugs that patients report they are not taking and adding medications omitted from the provider's list. The pharmacist will provide notifications via secured Epic messaging direct to prescribers of any patient concerns.The prescriber will make changes to the patient's EHR and/or contact the patient as they see fit.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to enhanced usual care will have the medical record available to a Walgreens pharmacist with 'read only' access. All patients at the five targeted health centers already have read-only access in place. This means the Walgreens pharmacist will have the capability to review a patient's record as necessary. The pharmacist may refer to the EHR as needed and in a reactive manner; such as if a patient were to request a medication requiring review for billing purposes (i.e. verify insurance, prior authorizations), or if a patient safety concern was raised (e.g. potential drug-drug or drug- disease interaction, therapeutic duplication, etc.). Similarly, read only EHR access means pharmacists must continue to use existing communication channels (e.g. phone, fax) to contact prescribers.</description>

    <description>Pharmacists will have read/write EHR access with established Epic security points&#xD;
Pharmacists will initiate medication reconciliation activities by calling the patient for a Comprehensive Medication Review. Pharmacists will add notes in their medication list for the prescriber, requesting the removal or discontinuation of prescribed drugs that patients report they are not taking and adding medications omitted from the provider's list. The pharmacist will provide notifications via secured Epic messaging direct to prescribers of any patient concerns.&#xD;
At 6 month if poor adherence is determined, the pharmacist will initiate Therapy Management Review which is a call from the pharmacist to the patient specifically about the medication(s) for which they have poor adherence. If necessary, the pharmacist will create notes and send an in-basket message to the prescriber.&#xD;
The prescriber will make changes to the patient's EHR and/or contact the patient as they see fit.</description>
