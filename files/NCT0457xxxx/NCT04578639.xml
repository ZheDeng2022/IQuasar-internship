  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter non-inferiority study, designed to establish non-inferiority of the&#xD;
      study treatment rituximab compared with the comparator ocrelizumab for consecutively included&#xD;
      patients (male or female) with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis aged 18-60&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to demonstrate if rituximab is non-inferior to ocrelizumab with&#xD;
      regards to efficacy and safety in treatment naïve RRMS patients, diagnosed within the last 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators aim to perform a 30-months (24 + 6 months)&#xD;
      prospective randomized double blinded multicenter non-inferiority study to compare rituximab&#xD;
      to ocrelizumab in RRMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS disease activity as measured by brain MRI is more sensitive as compared to clinical&#xD;
      disease activity as measured by number of relapses or disability progression. New or&#xD;
      enlarging MRI T2 lesions is regarded an acceptable marker of disease activity, and is&#xD;
      routinely used in clinical practice by annual examinations (Thompson, Baranzini et al. 2018)&#xD;
      (Thompson, Banwell et al. 2018). The investigators will therefore use the proportion of&#xD;
      patients with no new or enlarging T2-weighted brain MRI lesions from month 6 to month 24 as&#xD;
      the primary endpoint of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are included to further evaluate potential the difference or&#xD;
      similarities in effectiveness between the treatments (disability progression, relapse rate,&#xD;
      T25FW, 9-HPT, SDMT), to evaluate the difference in safety issues (most notably hematological&#xD;
      complications, infections, malignancies, infusion reactions and other serious adverse events)&#xD;
      and to evaluate the difference in patient reported outcomes by evaluation of working status,&#xD;
      fatigue, anxiety and depressive symptoms, quality of life and treatment satisfaction (EQ-5D,&#xD;
      MSIS-29, FSMC, and SDMT). The exploratory outcomes are included to evaluate specific blood&#xD;
      samples and plasma biomarkers for treatment response (sNFL and CD19+ cell counts) and side&#xD;
      effects (hypogammaglobulinemia and neutropenia) of the two treatments, differences in&#xD;
      vaccination status (pneumococcus and/or influenza) and to determine the predictive value of&#xD;
      BICAMS for the individual patient.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The investigators as well as the study participants, are blinded to the treatment allocation status. To assure this double-blinding, a dedicated &quot;treating nurse&quot; will be appointed at each study centre. Information about randomization (treatment arm) will be given directly through electronic communication (automatic generated email) from Viedoc™ to the treating nurse as soon as the randomization procedure has been performed. Only the treating nurse will have access to information concerning which treatment arm the patient is allocated to.&#xD;
The treating nurse will order the medicine from the pharmacy and perform the dilution in NaCl (in an infusion bag).&#xD;
An evaluating nurse and evaluating neurologist (blinded to study drug) will perform the clinical evaluation of the patient while the patient receives the medication and as part of registration of study information. The evaluating neurologist and evaluating nurse will not be able to access the randomization procedure in Viedoc™.</masking_description>

    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) is a 29-item self-report measure comprising 20 items associated with a physical scale and 9 items associated with a psychological scale, also translated and validated in Norwegian.&#xD;
Patients are asked about the impact of MS on day-to-day life in the last 2 weeks. All items have 5 response options from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). Each of the 2 scales are scored by adding up the responses across items, then converting to a 0 to 100 scale, where 100 indicates greater impact of disease on daily function (worse health).</description>

It consists of two subscales, one measuring anxiety, with seven items, and another measuring depression, with seven items. The two subscales are scored separately. The scale has been validated for use among MS patients as a screening instrument for symptoms of psychological distress. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety and depression.</description>

    <description>The Fatigue scale for motor and cognitive functions (FSMC) is a method for evaluating fatigue in multiple sclerosis and other neurological conditions. The FSMC was developed and validated on a large sample of MS patients and healthy controls and includes subscales for both physical (motor) and mental (cognitive) aspects of fatigue. It was tested against 2 other validated fatigue scales (Fatigue Severity Scale and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale), and found to have better sensitivity and specificity than either of these instruments (Penner, Raselli et al. 2009). The FSMC has also undergone linguistic validation in over 20 languages, including Norwegian.</description>

Tests must be administered during daytime, in a standardized manner, and in a quiet room. The order of tests will be fixed: the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R), and California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II).
