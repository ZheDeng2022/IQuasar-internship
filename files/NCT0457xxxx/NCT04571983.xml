  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that helps fight infection. They have a&#xD;
      number of different functions but are primarily involved in numerous inflammatory processes.&#xD;
      They are recruited from the blood into sites of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with COPD, higher blood eosinophil count (BEC) predicts a greater reduction in&#xD;
      moderate and severe exacerbations in response to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy. The&#xD;
      Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease strategy (GOLD 2019) recommends the&#xD;
      use of BEC to guide ICS therapy and states that eosinophil levels above 300 cells/μL can help&#xD;
      identify responders, guiding initial dual therapy, with &quot;little or no effect at a BEC &lt; 100&#xD;
      cells/μL&quot;. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) COPD 2018 guideline&#xD;
      states that a higher BEC is associated with ICS response, but does not specify a threshold.&#xD;
      Earlier research studies have suggested that at lower levels of BEC the harm of ICS due to&#xD;
      pneumonia is greater than the benefit of severe exacerbation reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with COPD can have &quot;flare ups&quot; of their disease known as exacerbations. Blood&#xD;
      eosinophils play a critical role in assessing severity of these exacerbations and guiding&#xD;
      management. The association between BEC and reduction in exacerbation frequency is based on&#xD;
      BEC measured when the patient is clinically stable. Transient low eosinophil count&#xD;
      (eosinopenia with BEC &lt; 50 cells/μL) during severe exacerbation is extremely common. In the&#xD;
      Dyspnoea, Eosinopenia, Consolidation, Acidaemia and atrial Fibrillation (DECAF) score&#xD;
      derivation and validation studies combined, eosinopenia was present on admission in 1,340 of&#xD;
      2,645 severe exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) and is associated with longer length of stay,&#xD;
      higher in-hospital and one year mortality. Although eosinophilic COPD exacerbations occur,&#xD;
      overall BEC during moderate or severe exacerbation is lower than stable state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ECOPD managed in critical care low BEC is associated with higher rate of septic shock and&#xD;
      mortality. BEC are also suppressed during other acute illnesses, notably sepsis. Failure to&#xD;
      recognise that BEC are often suppressed during acute illness compared to stable state may&#xD;
      lead to ICS therapy being inappropriately withheld. The effect of exacerbation and other&#xD;
      acute illnesses on eosinophils is under-appreciated. Both NICE and GOLD guidelines fail to&#xD;
      mention whether BEC should be prospectively measured when patients are stable (reflecting RCT&#xD;
      evidence), or if reliance on historical values is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In routine practice some clinicians rely on previous BECs to avoid a delay in treatment&#xD;
      decisions. A number of these historical counts will have been taken during illness,&#xD;
      underestimating the patients' stable-state BEC. Conversely, COPD is associated with other&#xD;
      medical conditions, and BEC may be requested for reasons other than acute illness. Using the&#xD;
      highest BEC from multiple measures in the previous 24 months may therefore better agree with&#xD;
      stable state counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this trial is to assess the reliability of using BEC over the preceding 24&#xD;
      months to assess COPD eosinophil phenotype at both GOLD thresholds. The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be based on using the highest of at least three BEC. Secondary outcomes include a) the level&#xD;
      of agreement between baseline stable state BEC and both mean and the highest BEC over the&#xD;
      preceding 24 months, b) the influence of the number of BEC measures available and c) the&#xD;
      effect of limiting the time frame from 24 months to the previous 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BEC is associated with disease severity, providing further evidence that COPD eosinophil&#xD;
      phenotype may change over time. As an exploratory analysis, periods of sustained change in&#xD;
      eosinophil phenotype will be sought, and the relationship between eosinophil phenotype and&#xD;
      patient characteristics and certain medication will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also assess the relations between the dependent variables stable state&#xD;
      absolute eosinophil and basophil counts and both eosinophil to basophil and neutrophil to&#xD;
      lymphocyte ratios and the following clinical outcomes: a) moderate and severe exacerbations&#xD;
      and b) mortality. Some of these variables have previously been shown to be related to disease&#xD;
      severity and mortality.&#xD;

      In patients with COPD, higher blood eosinophil count (BEC) predicts a greater reduction in&#xD;
      moderate and severe exacerbations in response to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy. The&#xD;
      Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease strategy (GOLD 2019) recommends the&#xD;

      identify responders, guiding initial dual therapy, with &quot;little or no effect at a BEC &lt; 100&#xD;
      cells/μL&quot;. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) COPD 2018 guideline&#xD;
      states that a higher BEC is associated with ICS response, but does not specify a threshold.&#xD;
      An earlier post hoc risk-benefit analysis suggested that at lower levels of BEC the harm of&#xD;
      ICS due to pneumonia is greater than the benefit of severe exacerbation reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between BEC and reduction in exacerbation frequency is based on BEC measured&#xD;
      when the patient is clinically stable. Transient eosinopenia (BEC &lt; 50 cells/μL) during&#xD;
      severe exacerbation is extremely common. In the Dyspnoea, Eosinopenia, Consolidation,&#xD;
      Acidaemia and atrial Fibrillation (DECAF) score derivation and validation studies combined,&#xD;
      eosinopenia was present on admission in 1,340 of 2,645 severe exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD)&#xD;
      and is associated with longer length of stay (DECAF combined cohorts: median difference 1&#xD;
      day, p&lt;0.001 unpublished data), and higher in-hospital and one year mortality. Although&#xD;
      eosinophilic COPD exacerbations occur, overall BEC during moderate or severe exacerbation is&#xD;
      lower than stable state. In ECOPD managed in critical care low BEC is associated with higher&#xD;
      Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, rate of septic shock&#xD;
      and mortality. BEC are also suppressed during other acute illnesses, notably sepsis. Failure&#xD;
      to recognise that BEC are often suppressed during acute illness compared to stable state may&#xD;
      lead to ICS therapy being inappropriately withheld. Regrettably, whilst the effect of&#xD;
      eosinophils on exacerbation is well recognised, the effect of exacerbation and other acute&#xD;
      illnesses on eosinophils is under- appreciated. Both NICE and GOLD fail to mention whether&#xD;
      BEC should be prospectively measured when patients are stable (reflecting RCT evidence), or&#xD;
      if reliance on historical values is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In routine practice some clinicians rely on previous BECs to avoid a delay in treatment&#xD;
      decisions. A number of these historical counts will have been taken during illness,&#xD;
      underestimating the patients' stable-state BEC. Conversely, COPD is associated with&#xD;
      multimorbidity, and BEC may be requested for reasons other than acute illness. Using the&#xD;
      highest BEC from multiple measures in the previous 24 months may therefore better agree with&#xD;
      stable state counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this trial is to assess the reliability of using BEC over the preceding 24&#xD;
      months to assess COPD eosinophil phenotype at both GOLD thresholds. The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be based on using the highest of at least three BEC. Secondary outcomes include a) the level&#xD;
      of agreement between baseline stable state BEC and both mean and the highest BEC over the&#xD;
      preceding 24 months, b) the influence of the number of BEC measures available and c) the&#xD;
      effect of limiting the time frame from 24 months to the previous 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst BEC is relatively stable over weeks and months, agreement wanes over longer&#xD;
      timeframes. BEC is also associated with disease severity, providing further evidence that&#xD;
      COPD eosinophil phenotype may change over time. As an exploratory analysis, periods of&#xD;
      sustained change in eosinophil phenotype will be sought, and the relationship between&#xD;
      eosinophil phenotype and patient characteristics and medication (including prophylactic&#xD;
      azithromycin) will be assessed. Recent work suggests that a low Eosinophil to Basophil ratio&#xD;
      predicts exacerbation risk and mortality, whilst a high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio is&#xD;
      related to disease severity, exacerbations and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also assess the relations between the dependent variables stable state&#xD;
      absolute eosinophil and basophil counts and both eosinophil to basophil and neutrophil to&#xD;
      lymphocyte ratios and the following clinical outcomes: a) moderate and severe exacerbations&#xD;
      and b) mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance to the NHS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This study will assess the variation in BEC measured during both stable state and acute&#xD;
           illness in patients with COPD. The investigators anticipate that the results will help&#xD;
           prevent inappropriate denial of ICS therapy due to reliance on BEC sampled when a&#xD;
           patient is unwell.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both NICE COPD guidelines and the GOLD strategy statement appropriately recommend that&#xD;
           BEC should help direct ICS therapy in COPD, but fail to emphasise that the evidence&#xD;
           supporting this advice is based solely on BEC measured when the patient is stable. BEC&#xD;
           are suppressed during many acute illnesses, including severe exacerbations of COPD, and&#xD;
           it is during these episodes that blood tests are most likely to taken. Reliance on BEC&#xD;
           sampled during such episodes may lead to inappropriate denial of ICS therapy and&#xD;
           increased risk of moderate and severe ECOPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This study will determine whether the highest of at least three BEC measured over the&#xD;
           preceding 24 months provides an acceptable level of agreement with stable state BEC in&#xD;
           terms of ICS treatment choice. In a sensitivity analysis, the investigators will assess&#xD;
           the influence of using mean rather than highest BEC, the number of BEC available, and&#xD;
           timeframe on this outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the world of realistic medicine, ensuring a patient attends their GP practice or hospital&#xD;
      clinic for measurement of BEC when they are stable, and then returns when the result is&#xD;
      available before a treatment decision is made is unlikely to be achieved in most cases.&#xD;
      However multiple previous BEC are often available, and some are likely to have been measured&#xD;
      during recovery or taken at other times when the patient was stable. The clinical systems&#xD;
      used in primary and secondary care allow all previous BEC available for a patient to be&#xD;
      collated and displayed on screen simply by clicking on a single eosinophil measurement. The&#xD;
      outcome of this study will inform clinicians of the level of certainty several historical BEC&#xD;
      provide in regard to ICS treatment decisions.&#xD;

        Patients will be identified within primary and secondary care. The lead centre has a&#xD;
        research database of patients who have participated in previous trials, and both units have&#xD;
        strong links with primary care. Recruitment will be supported by engaging primary care&#xD;
        Participant Identification Centre (PIC) sites. Patients will also be identified following&#xD;
        attendance at clinic or pulmonary rehabilitation, and following admission with an&#xD;
        exacerbation of COPD. Those that meet selection criteria, including confirmation of&#xD;
        clinical stability on study entry, will be invited to consent to participate.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Maintenance oral prednisolone or other systemic steroids, anti-interleukin-5 therapy&#xD;
