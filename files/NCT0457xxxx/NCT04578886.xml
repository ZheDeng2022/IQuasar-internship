  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a common problem associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality and morbidity, including increased hospital and ICU length of stay,&#xD;
      greater hospital cost, increased ventilator days, and long-term cognitive disability. Various&#xD;
      pharmacologic agents including dopamine antagonists, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors,&#xD;
      melatonin, antipsychotics, alpha-2 agonists, and glutamate antagonists are used for treatment&#xD;
      of delirium in the ICU despite the lack of clear evidence of efficacy.Since there is no&#xD;
      evidence-based pharmacologic treatment of ICU delirium, current therapy is focused on&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic prevention techniques and pharmacologic agents are used once delirium is&#xD;
      established. Guanfacine, an alpha-2 agonist, has been identified as a potential medication&#xD;
      that may be of benefit in the treatment of delirium. The purpose of this study to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of guanfacine versus placebo on delirium in critically ill patients admitted to&#xD;
      the ICU and to determine whether guanfacine along with standard of care reduces the duration&#xD;
      of delirium, compared to standard of care alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common problem in critically ill patients with a reported prevalence in the ICU&#xD;
      ranging from 11% to 83%. Delirium has been associated with worse clinical outcomes including&#xD;
      increased days on mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, cost of care, self-removal&#xD;
      of important devices (endotracheal tubes, central venous catheters), use of physical&#xD;
      restraint, long-term cognitive impairment, readmission, and mortality. The etiology of&#xD;
      delirium is multifactorial, and risk factors include advanced age, substance abuse, metabolic&#xD;
      derangements, and sleep disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, evidence-based strategies for treatment of ICU delirium do not exist. Even&#xD;
      with the lack of strong evidence, both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies are used&#xD;
      as standard care in clinical practice. Non-pharmacologic strategies considered as standard&#xD;
      care include removal of causative factors, sleep maintenance, reorientation during the day,&#xD;
      early mobilization activities, timely removal of catheters and physical restraints, and use&#xD;
      of a scheduled pain management protocol. In combination with these non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      strategies, ICU patients are treated with pharmacologic agents to render the patient safe and&#xD;
      manageable and to promote sleep and normal circadian cycle. Despite lack of an FDA approved&#xD;
      drug for treating delirium and clear-cut efficacy of any drug, various pharmacologic agents&#xD;
      standardly used to treat delirium in the ICU include dopamine antagonists,&#xD;
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, melatonin, antipsychotics, alpha-2 agonists, and glutamate&#xD;
      antagonists. Antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, have been most commonly used. However, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of routinely using antipsychotics in managing delirium has been questioned&#xD;
      given the potential for adverse effects, medication interactions, and unproven benefit.&#xD;
      Haloperidol can cause serious side effects including Q-T prolongation, sedation, and&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms. For this reason the use of haloperidol is less than ideal in the&#xD;
      elderly patient population. Recent studies have looked at the perioperative use of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine in mechanically ventilated patients experiencing hyperactive delirium.&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a centrally-acting alpha 2 adrenergic receptor (Î±2-AR) agonist that&#xD;
      generally quiets noradrenergic activity, producing sedative, analgesic and antihypertensive&#xD;
      effects. When compared to haloperidol, patients receiving dexmedetomidine have fewer&#xD;
      ventilation days, shorter ICU length of stay, less need for tracheostomy, and quicker&#xD;
      resolution of delirium symptoms. Unfortunately, dexmedetomidine is expensive and delivered as&#xD;
      an intravenous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guanfacine, an alpha-2A antihypertensive agent with a safe pharmacodynamic profile, has also&#xD;
      been reported as treatment of ICU delirium. It has found use as an adjunct therapy in the&#xD;
      management of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Compared to dexmedetomidine,&#xD;
      guanfacine is a pure alpha-2A agonist with higher selectivity for the dorsolateral PFC&#xD;
      structures leading to improved neuronal function by enhancing short-term memory. Noting a&#xD;
      similarity between the inattention and hyperactivity of emergence and ADHD itself, clinicians&#xD;
      have started using guanfacine to manage young, healthy males who were commonly at risk for&#xD;
      emergence delirium after anesthesia. In this context, the drug has gained popularity for its&#xD;
      off label use perioperatively in a wide variety of patients with anxiety issues, known or&#xD;
      predicted to have potential for combative or difficult emergence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to dexmedetomidine, guanfacine may have a more unique and specific mechanism of&#xD;
      behavior modification that could be beneficial as a treatment in delirium. Furthermore, oral&#xD;
      guanfacine is cheaper and easier to use, with the ability to continue it outside the ICU.&#xD;
      From a pharmacokinetic standpoint, guanfacine is absorbed with peak onset over 1-4 hour and&#xD;
      has a half-life of 16 hours. The long half-life allows once-daily dosing before sleep.&#xD;
      Maximal drug levels at night promote sleep, with some drug remaining during the day to&#xD;
      provide a lesser degree of sedation. Outpatient studies have detected a ceiling effect on the&#xD;
      antihypertensive effect of guanfacine, wherein doses of 1 mg, 2 mg, or 3 mg all have the same&#xD;
      effect on blood pressure. This implies that up-titrating the guanfacine dose beyond 1 mg&#xD;
      daily might increase sedative/hypnotic effects, without increasing hemodynamic instability.&#xD;
      Maldonado et al at Stanford has utilized guanfacine for delirious/withdrawing patients (0.5-3&#xD;
      mg total daily dose). A recent case report by Dr. Habib Srour and colleagues described&#xD;
      successful use of guanfacine (1 mg q12hr) to control refractory agitation in an ICU patient&#xD;
      with a history of opioid misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to perform a pilot trial to evaluate protocol adherence, estimate&#xD;
      recruitment rates, and evaluate the safety and efficacy of guanfacine with standard care,&#xD;
      compared to standard care alone, on delirium in ICU patients. Before testing other drugs&#xD;
      compared with guanfacine, evidence needs to be collected to investigate if guanfacine is more&#xD;
      effective than placebo in treating delirium in ICU patients. The control intervention is&#xD;
      therefore chosen to be placebo along with standard or usual care. Given the literature and&#xD;
      our own experience with the drug for ICU delirium, the investigators plan to use a dose of 2&#xD;
      mg nightly for efficacy and minimization of side effects. The investigators will withhold&#xD;
      guanfacine or placebo if a patient does not have delirium for four consecutive assessments or&#xD;
      for safety reasons. The investigators will permanently discontinue guanfacine or placebo for&#xD;
      any life-threatening, serious adverse event that was related to the intervention. The trial&#xD;
      drug or placebo will be discontinued after the 14-day intervention period or at ICU&#xD;
      discharge, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of Delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of ICU admission up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the proportion of delirium-free assessments as measured by the Confusion Assessment Method- Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). CAM-ICU measures a patient's fluctuations in mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and consciousness.&#xD;
The CAM-ICU will be used twice daily with all patients for up to 14 days. Patients will be diagnosed with delirium when they have at least one positive CAM-ICU.&#xD;
The CAM-ICU is based on the assessment of errors made during the assessment. A score greater than 3 errors indicates delirium. The CAM-ICU score is only reported as a positive or negative value.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Type of Delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of ICU admission up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score (RASS) is a method to assess a patient's level of sedation in hospitalized patients. The score range is incremental and from -5 to +4. The minimum value is -5:unarousable, middle range value is 0:alert and calm, and maximum value is +4:combative.&#xD;
Based on the clinician's judgment and RASS, the participants will be categorized as having either hyperactive delirium defined (a RASS score of +1 to +4 at the time of positive Confusion Assessment Method- Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU)), or hypoactive delirium (a RASS score -3 to 0 with a positive CAM-ICU score).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of Deliirum</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of ICU admission up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Confusion Assessment Method- Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) score only indicates a positive or negative result but does not quantify severity of delirium. If the CAM-ICU score is positive, the secondary outcome of delirium severity will be assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit-7 (CAM-ICU-7). CAM-ICU-7 scores range from 0 to 7 errors, with 0-2 errors indicating no delirium, 3-5 errors mild to moderate delirium, and 6-7 errors as severe delirium. Indirect markers of delirium severity will also be recorded daily until ICU discharge or day 14 after enrollment. These markers are: 1) need for anti- psychotics or sedation (total daily doses will be calculated); 2) need for physical restraints; 3) patient removal of intravenous lines, drains or catheters.</description>
