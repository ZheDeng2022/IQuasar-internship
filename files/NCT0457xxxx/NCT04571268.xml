  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comprehensive understanding of healthy shoulder motion is a valuable contribution to the&#xD;
      academic literature and provides a basis of comparison for various shoulder pathologies and&#xD;
      treatments. However, the medical community is primarily interested in how pathology affects&#xD;
      shoulder function and the underlying musculoskeletal reasons for impaired function associated&#xD;
      with specific pathologies. Rotator cuff tears (RCT) provide an excellent model to study&#xD;
      shoulder biomechanics because RCTs can cause significant functional impairment and can be&#xD;
      quantified in size and location using standard clinical imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of this study a comprehensive database of three-dimensional joint angles and&#xD;
      EMG patterns of the structures of the shoulder joint complex of dominant and non-dominant&#xD;
      during common activities of daily living will be available for healthy subjects and those of&#xD;
      subjects whose dominant limbs are impaired by rotator cuff tears. These data will show normal&#xD;
      muscle activations and movement patterns required to complete activities of daily living and&#xD;
      compare them to the movement, and muscle activation patterns of persons who exhibit muscular&#xD;
      and movement dysfunction due to rotator cuff tears.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tears occur in approximately 20% of patients older than 65 years and increase&#xD;
      with age. These non-traumatic RCTs are generally caused by normal age-related degeneration.&#xD;
      Surgical treatment is effective, however recurrence of injury is common especially when the&#xD;
      original tear was caused by age related degeneration. Non-surgical treatment options are&#xD;
      designed to decrease pain and improve performance of activities of daily living and may be an&#xD;
      effective alternative to surgery. If non-surgical treatment options are unsuccessful,&#xD;
      surgical treatment may be considered. When rotator cuff tears are treated surgically,&#xD;
      postoperative rehabilitation is an important factor in determining outcome success, however&#xD;
      there is uncertainty regarding the best protocols for post-surgery rehabilitation. Evidence&#xD;
      suggests that a more complete understanding of motion and muscle activation is necessary to&#xD;
      design effective and reliable rehabilitation programs for rotator cuff injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will enable medical professionals to better answer a range of clinical questions.&#xD;
      They will provide health care professionals and researchers with a knowledge of relative&#xD;
      muscle contributions to specific joint motions required to perform activities of daily&#xD;
      living. This information is well suited to refine input variables for computer models and&#xD;
      robotic testing platforms which can improve virtual and cadaver testing of shoulder&#xD;
      impairment and repair models. Understanding the limitations to movement caused by RCT, and&#xD;
      the resulting muscle activation patterns, will inform better surgical indications and enable&#xD;
      therapists to better design rehabilitation protocols to enhance recovery from rotator cuff&#xD;
      tears with or without surgery, as well as develop programs to limit future tears. Knowledge&#xD;
      of muscle activation patterns during activities of daily living will also allow&#xD;
      pre-habilitation protocols to be tailored for a subsequent surgical procedure such as reverse&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty. These data will also assist in the design of shoulder prostheses whose&#xD;
      biomechanical characteristics will compensate for deficiencies present in a shoulder joint&#xD;
      impaired by rotator cuff injury. The knowledge gained from this study will provide a basis&#xD;
      for future studies investigating traumatic shoulder injuries and the design of effective&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocols for such injuries.&#xD;

        Patients between 50 and 70 years old, inclusive, who present with chronic right shoulder&#xD;
        pain with a documented right rotator cuff tear will be screened for eligibility and&#xD;
        participation. Rotator cuff tear subjects will be recruited under consultation with&#xD;
        physicians from their patient populations. Patient charts will be assessed by study&#xD;
        investigators to ensure they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to consent. Healthy&#xD;
