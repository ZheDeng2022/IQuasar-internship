      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of MRI-guided focused&#xD;
      ultrasound (MRgFUS) for treating Trigeminal Neuralgia. Trigeminal Neuralgia (pain) is a type&#xD;
      of pain involving the face that can be disabling to those it affects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually, people with trigeminal pain receive medicines to control the pain. However, these&#xD;
      medications may not give adequate pain relief. They may have unwanted side effects. In many&#xD;
      patients with Trigeminal Neuralgia, a blood vessel compressing the nerve could be responsible&#xD;
      for this condition. In such patients, surgery (also called micro-vascular decompression) is&#xD;
      considered to be the best option if the medications do not control the pain. However, not all&#xD;
      patients are good candidates for surgical correction and some patients may have recurrence of&#xD;
      pain following surgical correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When surgery is not possible or recommended, other procedures are also available to patients.&#xD;
      Such procedures usually result in selective damage to the nerve pain fibers in the Trigeminal&#xD;
      nerve. Examples of these treatments include injection of materials such as Glycerol into the&#xD;
      nerve, compression of the nerve with a balloon or selective radiation treatment of the nerve&#xD;
      (stereotactic Radiosurgery). These treatments may not always improve the patient's pain or&#xD;
      may only relieve the pain for a short duration of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These treatments may also result in damage to the nerve fibers that carry sensation from the&#xD;
      face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will assess a new device for treating patients who have disabling pain that has not&#xD;
      responded to medications or medications along with surgery. The device we will assess is&#xD;
      called the ExAblate Transcranial focused ultrasound system. In this study, we will use this&#xD;
      device to send ultrasound waves through the skull to precisely target and treat a tiny area&#xD;
      of the brain called central lateral nucleus.&#xD;

    <description>The ExAblate Transcranial system will be used to destroy a small cluster of cells that may be causing the study participant's pain . The ExAblate uses ultrasound to heat a small spot in the brain called central lateral thalamic nucleus. Ultrasound passes through the skin and skull and into the brain to focus on this particular spot.</description>

    <description>Patients' head will be placed in ExAblate device to hold it still for the treatment. The ExAblate Transcranial helmet will be placed on their head. The investigators will measure the study participant's heart, blood pressure, temperature, and breathing rate before the treatment begins. MRI scans will be taken to make sure the ultrasound waves will be aimed exactly within the target. A series of MR images will be taken to identify the target area, and plan the study treatment. The study investigators will decide on the area of participant's brain that will be treated. The ExAblate Transcranial system will compute a plan to cover the treatment area. This area is gradually heated while monitoring the patient's responses and neurologic examination.</description>
