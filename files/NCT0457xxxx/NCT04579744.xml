  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe the quality of life in patients submitted to surgical excision of&#xD;
      the adjuvants and injured surrounding tissue. For this purpose, the EuroQol questionnaire&#xD;
      (EQ-5d) facilitates to obtain values of health in the physical, psychological, and social&#xD;
      dimensions. It is a standardized non-disease specific instrument to describe and value the&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. Although there are only five domains, it has been found to&#xD;
      cover the most critical dimensions of quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>Each EuroQOL-5Dimensions instrument comprises a short descriptive system questionnaire and a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) that are cognitively undemanding, taking only a few minutes to complete. The questionnaire provides a simple descriptive profile of a respondent's health state. Values of health in the physical, psychological, and social dimensions are investigated. After surgical removal of foreign substances quality of life should have high values.</description>
