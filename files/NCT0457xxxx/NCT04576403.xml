    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy of an intervention with heated&#xD;
      mittens in patients with hand osteoarthritis (HOA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The joints of the hands are some of the most commonly joints affected by osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      together with hip and knee joints. The prevalence increases with age and as the elderly&#xD;
      population is growing so will the number of persons with HOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary symptoms for HOA are reduced function, stiffness and pain, with function being&#xD;
      the most limiting factor for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatments have some effect. Non-pharmacological treatments (such as&#xD;
      exercise) have been investigated in a limited number of studies with overall minimal effect&#xD;
      on the primary symptoms. In the earlier days the use of heating interventions, such as&#xD;
      paraffin bath, was common treatment for patients with arthritis. During the last decades a&#xD;
      shift from heating to exercise oriented treatment has occurred, however seemingly with&#xD;
      limited effect on the primary symptoms. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) newest&#xD;
      published guideline for the management of HOA (2020) recommend heating as a treatment among&#xD;
      others but without scientific sound evidence for effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that heated mittens worn at least 15 minutes every day for six weeks has a&#xD;
      beneficial effect on physical function in patient with HOA when compared to placebo mittens&#xD;
      (heat deactivated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups (1:1) and&#xD;
      physical function of the hand as primary endpoint after six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to include 200 patients with HOA for this study. The intervention group will&#xD;
      receive mittens with functioning heating elements; the control group will receive mittens&#xD;
      without a functioning heating element. All participants are asked to wear the mittens for 6&#xD;
      weeks, 15 minutes each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is change in physical function of the hand, measured with the&#xD;
      Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy of an intervention with heated&#xD;
      mittens in patients with hand osteoarthritis (HOA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The joints of the hands are some of the most commonly joints affected by osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      together with hip and knee joints. Approximately 40% of adults have both self-reported and&#xD;
      X-ray conformed signs of HOA. The prevalence increases with age and as the elderly population&#xD;
      is growing so will the number of persons with HOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOA is a heterogeneous disease with varying levels of symptoms and joint involvement. The&#xD;
      most frequently affected joints are the carpometacarpal (CMC) 1 joints together with the&#xD;
      distal interphalangeal (DIP), less frequent the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. The&#xD;
      primary symptoms are reduced function, stiffness and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatments have limited effect. Non-pharmacological treatments (such as&#xD;
      exercise) have been investigated in a limited number of studies with overall minimal effect&#xD;
      on the primary symptoms. In the earlier days the use of heating interventions, such as&#xD;
      paraffin bath, were common treatment for patients with arthritis. During the last decades a&#xD;
      shift from heating to exercise oriented treatment have occurred, however seemingly with&#xD;
      limited effect on the primary symptoms. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) newest&#xD;
      published guideline for the management of HOA (2020) recommend heating as a treatment among&#xD;
      others but without scientific sound evidence for effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interview have been conducted at the Parker Institute with people suffering from HOA and&#xD;
      all agreed that head was their preferred treatment for symptom reduction. They also stated&#xD;
      that heat could reduce stiffness of the fingers. Heating therapy is assumed to provide&#xD;
      analgesic effect and decrease muscle tonicity. Two studies have investigated the sort term&#xD;
      effect of heat wrap therapy on low back and wrist pain compared to ibuprofen or placebo&#xD;
      medication, respectively. In both studies the effect of the heat wrapping therapy was&#xD;
      superior to the control group in reducing pain and increasing motion. This suggests that&#xD;
      there is a short-term effect of heating therapy in musculoskeletal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammation level in HOA fluctuates it therefore could be argued that heating therapy&#xD;
      may reinforce present inflammation and should be avoided during flares. However, in persons&#xD;
      with rheumatoid arthritis heat do not seem to increase the inflammation markers in the&#xD;
      synovial tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies assessing the potential benefits of non-pharmacological treatments of HOA are scares&#xD;
      and both ACR (American College of Rheumatology), EULAR (European League against Rheumatism)&#xD;
      and OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) recommend exploration of this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it is relevant to develop and implement treatment strategies for the management of HOA&#xD;
      in order to optimize current treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous treatment strategies and recent recommendations it seems relevant to&#xD;
      investigate if a daily intervention with warm mittens can help reduce pain, improve function&#xD;
      and reduce stiffness in patients with HOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized controlled study is to assess the effect of heated mittens after 6&#xD;
      weeks on physical function in patients with HOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heated mittens worn at least 15 minutes every day for six weeks has a beneficial effect on&#xD;
      physical function in patient with HOA when compared to placebo mittens (heat deactivated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This study is designed as a randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups&#xD;
      and physical function of the hand as primary endpoint after six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each study participant, participation is 6 weeks with clinical assessments at baseline&#xD;
      and after 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of study participants to be randomised for this study is 200 based on a sample&#xD;
      size calculation (see section 14.1). Randomised participants who withdraw during study&#xD;
      participation or who are prematurely terminated will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization lists will be computer-generated based upon permuted random blocks of variable&#xD;
      size (2 to 6 in each block). The allocation ratio will be 1:1 stratified for the following&#xD;
      baseline conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. CMC 1 OA B. Grip strength&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators, outcome assessors, and participants will be blinded to treatment&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The persons performing the phone calls at week 2 and 4 will not be blinded to the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HOT intervention consists of a pair of mittens with heating elements. The mittens are&#xD;
      produced by Nordic Heat Aps, Denmark. The intensity of the heat can be adjusted by use of a&#xD;
      button placed at the dorsal side of the mittens. The mittens have three intensities: red=max,&#xD;
      yellow=medium and green=minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are instructed to wear the mittens at least 15 minutes every day, preferably&#xD;
      in the morning, for six weeks. If the participants want to use the mittens several times per&#xD;
      day or longer than 15 minutes they can. Participants will be instructed to fill out a diary&#xD;
      during the intervention period containing the following information; number of times per day&#xD;
      they wear the mittens, duration of each wear-time, and intensity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two batteries are placed in the bottom of the mittens with a wire connecting them to the&#xD;
      heating element. The batteries must be charged every day, using a charger. In addition to the&#xD;
      mittens all participants will receive three pairs of thin cotton gloves (Abena A/S, Aabenraa,&#xD;
      Denmark) to use under the mittens for better distribution of the heat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mittens, charger, cotton gloves, and diary will be handed out at the baseline visit,&#xD;
      after randomization, together with oral and written instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will receive the same type of mittens but with the heating&#xD;
      element being deactivated. Further they will receive cotton gloves to wear underneath the&#xD;
      mittens. Both groups will receive the same oral and written instructions on who to use the&#xD;
      mittens and all will be instructed to fill out a diary. Participants in both groups will&#xD;
      receive a phone call at week 2 and 4 to maintain compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Sample size A sample size of 200 in total will provide strong statistical power to&#xD;
      detect differences between groups in favour of heated mittens. For a two-sample pooled t-test&#xD;
      of a normal mean difference with a two-sided significance level of 0.05 (P&lt;0.05), assuming a&#xD;
      common standard deviation of 19 AUSCAN-function points (0-100 scale), a total sample size of&#xD;
      180 assuming a balanced design has a power of 80.2% to detect a mean difference of 8&#xD;
      AUSCAN-function points (corresponding to a small effect size of 0.42). To account for&#xD;
      dropouts, 200 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis population The intention to treat (ITT) population consist of all randomized&#xD;
      patients irrespective of whether the patient actually received study intervention or the&#xD;
      patient's compliance with the study protocol, in the treatment group to which the participant&#xD;
      was assigned at randomisation. A patient will be considered randomised as soon as a treatment&#xD;
      is assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical approach A statistical analysis plan that describes the details of the planned&#xD;
      statistical analyses will be produced before last patient's last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of changes from baseline and construction of confidence intervals (CI) for&#xD;
      continuous measures will be based on a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA;&#xD;
      including group as the main factor and baseline measure as covariate). Superiority will be&#xD;
      claimed if the computed 95% CI of the estimated group difference in the change from baseline&#xD;
      in the AUSCAN does not include 0 in the ITT population. All statistical tests will be&#xD;
      two-sided and statistical significance will be claimed if the computed p-value is equal to or&#xD;
      less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case report forms (CRF) The study will use electronic case report forms (eCRF) using an&#xD;
      in-house database created specifically to this trial by the Parker Institutes database&#xD;
      manager. To additional program will be used to capture the questionnaire registrations&#xD;
      electronically: RedCap will be used to supply data from home (AUSCAN send at week 2 and 4),&#xD;
      Cirkeline will be used to supply data from the study visits (baseline, week 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the eCRF a paper based CRF is created to allow for on-the-go registration of&#xD;
      participants at the clinic. An investigator will be responsible for the transfer of data from&#xD;
      the CRF to eCRF during the trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the trial, all data will be merged and stored in the in-house database. The&#xD;
      in-house database meets all regulatory standards and allows management of all activities&#xD;
      related to clinical trials that ensures optimal resource use and safety according to good&#xD;
      clinical practice and data protection legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance All data will be entered into a study database for analysis and reporting.&#xD;
      Any data captured electronically will be stored electronically in a separate database&#xD;
      according to standard procedures at The Parker Institute. Upon completion of data entry, the&#xD;
      databases will be checked to ensure acceptable accuracy and completeness. System backups and&#xD;
      record retention for the study data will be consistent with The Parker Institute standard&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data protection and regulation The study will be conducted in accordance with the Data&#xD;
      Protection Act and follow the General Data Protection Regulation. The study data management&#xD;
      and data security procedures are approved by the Regional Knowledge Centre on Data Protection&#xD;
      Compliance (videnscenter for dataanmeldelser i Region Hovedstaden) on behalf of the Danish&#xD;
      Data Protection agency.&#xD;
