  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity, defined as a velocity dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes, is one of the&#xD;
      most prominent motor problems that occur in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). This causes&#xD;
      difficulty in achieving balance, mobility, and an upright stance. CP is a group of permanent&#xD;
      disorders that affect the development of movement and posture caused by a non-progressive&#xD;
      damage to the brain. Because CP occurs in 2-3 of 1000 individuals, it is one of the most&#xD;
      common causes of severe physical disability in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mismanagement of spasticity can lead to contracture which is extremely difficult to treat and&#xD;
      may result in severe functional disabilities. The current management of spasticity in CP&#xD;
      includes physical therapy (i.e. passive stretching), oral medication, botulinum toxin&#xD;
      injection, and surgery. Botulinum toxin injection has been proven to effectively reduce&#xD;
      spasticity yet many patients are unable to get access to this treatment due to its high cost.&#xD;
      Moreover, Botulinum toxin injection is currently not covered by the public health insurance&#xD;
      of Indonesia. Therefore, other modalities which are more affordable and are non-invasive&#xD;
      therapies should be considered as a treatment option for spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radial Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (rESWT) has been utilized in the medical practice for&#xD;
      the treatment of several musculoskeletal disorders such as chronic tendinopathies and&#xD;
      spasticity. It is hypothesized that ESWT has two main effects which include a direct effect&#xD;
      from mechanical forces at the treatment point and an indirect effect from cavitation. Even&#xD;
      though rESWT has less penetration capacity over the focused Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy&#xD;
      (fESWT), rESWT is still believed to be more superior to fESWT because it requires less&#xD;
      precise focusing, is less painful, and costs less. These also make rESWT the more appropriate&#xD;
      choice for children with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have proven the efficacy of ESWT in reducing spasticity in spastic CP patients&#xD;
      with significantly long lasting effects. Despite promising results, there still has yet to be&#xD;
      a recommended guideline for the treatment of spasticity in children using rESWT. One of the&#xD;
      critical parameters needed to be determined is the frequency of treatment. Therefore, the&#xD;
      objective of this study is to understand whether the reduction in gastrocnemius stiffness in&#xD;
      children with spastic CP is influenced by the frequency of ESWT sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a double-blinded and randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric CP patients from the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Rumah&#xD;
      Sakit Umum Pusat Nasional Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo (RSCM) are involved in this research.&#xD;
      Participants were selected using the inclusion criteria as follow: 1) children with spastic&#xD;
      CP who are 5 - 18 years old, 2) one or two gastrocnemius muscle with an Australian Spasticity&#xD;
      Assessment Scale (ASAS) of two or more, 3) at least 6 months since the last botulinum&#xD;
      injection on gastrocnemius, 4) no surgical operation on lower limb within the last 12 months,&#xD;
      5) absence of severe contracture on gastrocnemius, and 6) ability of legal caregiver to&#xD;
      provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spasticity of gastrocnemius was evaluated using ASAS (0: no spasticity to 4: severe&#xD;
      spasticity). Data were collected at nine time points: 1) pre-ESWT, 2-6) immediately after&#xD;
      each ESWT session, 7) 4 weeks after the last (fifth) ESWT session, 8) 8 weeks after the last&#xD;
      (fifth) ESWT session, and 9) 12 weeks after the last (fifth) ESWT session. All patients were&#xD;
      examined by the same physiatrist who was blinded to the protocol (i.e. not informed about the&#xD;
      study and the group allocation) throughout the whole study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used a BTL-6000 SWT Topline (BTL, Czech Republic) to apply rESWT on&#xD;
      gastrocnemius muscles. For the procedures, a 1.2 cm probe was used. A total of 1,500 pulses&#xD;
      were delivered to each gastrocnemius muscle. The energy flux density was constant at 0.1&#xD;
      mJ/mm2 and the repetition frequency was at 4 Hz, with a pressure of 1.5 bars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For double-blinded treatment, 28 different spastic gastrocnemius muscles from 14 CP patients&#xD;
      were allocated into two groups. Both groups had a true or sham ESWT for five consecutive&#xD;
      weekly treatments. Group I received five true ESWT sessions. Group II received three true&#xD;
      ESWT in session 1, 3 and 5 and two sham ESWTs in session 2 and 4. No anesthesia was given.&#xD;
      Adverse events were closely monitored during and after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-group changes in ASAS were evaluated with Friedman analysis of variance from baseline,&#xD;
      immediately after each ESWT, 4 weeks after last (fifth) ESWT, 8 weeks after last (fifth) ESWT&#xD;
      and 12 weeks after last (fifth) ESWT; followed by post-hoc Wilcoxon signed-ranked test.&#xD;
      Inter-group differences in ASAS reduction were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U- test.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS ver. 23.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).&#xD;
      The level of significance was set at &lt;0.05.&#xD;
