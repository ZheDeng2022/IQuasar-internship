      The purpose of this study to age-related differences to the response of a combined pituitary&#xD;
      stimulation test with TRH, LHRH and ACTH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited in three different age intervals: 18-45 years, 55-80 years and&#xD;
      80+ years. These participants will all undergo the same stimulation test with 0.1 mg LHRH,&#xD;
      0.2 mg TRH, and 0.25 mg ACTH (Synachten). The tests will be perfomed at the same time of day&#xD;
      for all particpants (between 08:15 and 08:45) and participants will be fasting for the test.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken just before and at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes&#xD;
      following the stimulation test. Serum from blood samples will be stored at -20 degrees until&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
