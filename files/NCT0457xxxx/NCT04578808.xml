  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protocol has many assets. A prospective nationwide recruitment allows for the inclusion&#xD;
      of a large cohort of patients with UIA. It will combine accurate clinical phenotyping and&#xD;
      comprehensive imaging with CAWE screening. Besides, it will enable to exploit metadata and to&#xD;
      explore new pathophysiological pathways of interest by crossing clinical, genetic,&#xD;
      biological, and imaging information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Management of small (&lt;7mm) unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) remains controversial.&#xD;
      Previous retrospective studies have suggested that post gadolinium arterial wall enhancement&#xD;
      (AWE) of unruptured intracranial aneurysms on MR imaging may reflect aneurysm wall&#xD;
      instability, and hence may highlight a higher risk of UIA growth over time. This multicentric&#xD;
      prospective cohort aims at exploring vessel wall imaging findings of UIAs with consecutive&#xD;
      follow-up to substantiate these assumptions.The objective is to develop diagnostic and&#xD;
      predictive tools for the risk of IA evolution. The aim is to demonstrate in clinical practice&#xD;
      the predictive value of (AWE) for UIA growth. The growth will be determined by any&#xD;
      modification of the UIA measurement. Both UIA growth and the UIA wall enhancement will be&#xD;
      assessed in consensus by two expert neuroradiologists.The French prospective UCAN project is&#xD;
      a non-interventional international wide and multicentric prospective cohort. UIA of&#xD;
      bifurcation between 3 and 7 mm for whom a clinical and imaging follow-up without occlusion&#xD;
      treatment was scheduled by local multidisciplinary staff will be included. Extensive&#xD;
      clinical, biological and imaging data will be recorded during a 3 years follow-up (visits at&#xD;
      1 and 3 years after inclusion).&#xD;
