  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable&#xD;
      physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role. The researchers&#xD;
      hypothesize that the care partners who receive the intervention will show improvements in&#xD;
      caregiver strain and mental health.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in self-reported caregiver strain as measured by Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Caregiver Strain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 180 of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>TBI-CareQOL Caregiver Strain assesses perceived feelings of feeling overwhelmed, stressed and &quot;beat-down&quot; related to the care partner role. Self-reported responses are on a Likert scale. The measure is scored on a T metric with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more strain.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in self-reported anxiety score as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 180 of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Anxiety assesses self-reported feelings of fear, anxiety and hyper-arousal. Self-reported responses are on a Likert scale. The measure is scored on a T metric with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in self-reported depression score as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 180 of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Depression assesses self-reported feelings of sadness and worthlessness. Self-reported responses are on a Likert scale. The measure is scored on a T metric with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more depression.</description>
