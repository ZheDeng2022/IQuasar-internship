    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient from whom a voluntarily signed written Institutional Review Board or&#xD;
             Independent Ethics Committee-approved informed consent form can be obtained. If the&#xD;
             patient is aged under 18 years at the time of assent or willingness to participate in&#xD;
             the study cannot be confirmed due to MPS II-related intellectual disability, informed&#xD;
             permission from the patient's legally acceptable representative (e.g. his parents or&#xD;
             guardians) needs to be obtained instead of his consent or assent. (however, written&#xD;
             consent should be obtained from the patient himself too, whenever possible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males with confirmed diagnosis of MPS II&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Naïve patients or patients who are receiving stable enzyme replacement therapy with&#xD;
             idursulfase for more than 12 weeks before starting the JR-141 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients whose co-partners are of child-bearing potential agree to use a&#xD;
             medically accepted, highly effective method plus an approved method of effective&#xD;
             contraception from the time of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        &lt;Cohort A&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males aged 36-71 months old whose standard score by BSID-III or KABC-II is between&#xD;
             65-85 at screening; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males aged 30-35 months old at screening, with presence of the mutation in the IDS&#xD;
             gene, and who are judged as having the severe phenotype by the Expert Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
        &lt;Cohort B&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males aged 6 years or older and whose IQ are 70 and higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Attenuated patients with 1 SD deficiency in the omission errors or variability domains&#xD;
             of the TOVA test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of gene therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), excluding those&#xD;
             who need enzyme replacement therapy even after HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to undergo lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient who has received other investigational product (drug or device) within 4&#xD;
             months of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to comply with the protocol as determined by the principal investigator or&#xD;
             subinvestigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judged by the principal investigator or subinvestigator to be ineligible to&#xD;
             participate in the study due to a history of serious drug allergy or sensitivity&#xD;
             including sensitivity to anesthesia or hypersensitivity to any component of JR-141.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient who has a known or suspected local or general infection or is at risk of&#xD;
             abnormal bleeding due to a medical condition or therapy.A patient who otherwise is&#xD;
             judged by the principal investigator or subinvestigator to be ineligible to&#xD;
             participate in the study.&#xD;
