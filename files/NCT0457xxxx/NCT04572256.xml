  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess whether a 6-month course&#xD;
      of oral montelukast after ACL reconstruction reduces systemic markers of inflammation and&#xD;
      biochemical and imaging biomarkers of cartilage degradation. This study will specifically&#xD;
      target older ACL reconstruction patients with concomitant meniscal injuries as this group is&#xD;
      at greatest risk of rapid PTOA progression. Patients will randomly be assigned to receive&#xD;
      oral montelukast (10 mg) versus placebo daily for 6 months after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, patient-reported outcomes are improved&#xD;
      10 years post-surgery. Cytokine concentrations, however, remain elevated years after surgery;&#xD;
      over 80% of patients with combined ACL and meniscus injuries have post-traumatic&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (PTOA) within 10-15 years after injury. Since pain nociceptors are not located&#xD;
      in the articular cartilage, patient-reported outcomes improve despite progressive,&#xD;
      irreversible cartilage loss, thus making PTOA a &quot;silent killer.&quot; Because early cartilage loss&#xD;
      progresses without pain and dysfunction, the prevalence of PTOA continues to increase. PTOA&#xD;
      now represents the most common cause of military disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our recent results illustrate the downstream cytokine and degradative enzyme activity&#xD;
      following ACL reconstruction. ACL and meniscus injury initiate a biochemical cascade&#xD;
      resulting in cartilage degradation and this process involves an up-regulated pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      response with a dysregulated anti-inflammatory response. Single-dose intra-articular&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory treatment appears to reduce hyaline cartilage degradation shortly after the&#xD;
      time of injury based on synovial fluid measures of type II collagen degradation. The&#xD;
      intra-articular inflammatory milieu at the time of surgery appears to predict the patient&#xD;
      symptom state two years later; however, the effectiveness of preoperative anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      treatments in impacting patient symptoms or slowing long-term PTOA progression is as yet&#xD;
      unclear. A lack of efficacy in preoperative interventions may be attributed to a profound&#xD;
      inflammatory stimulus from surgical reconstruction of the ACL. The postoperative inflammatory&#xD;
      cascade results in articular cartilage and meniscus degradation due to matrix degrading&#xD;
      enzymes, especially those which breakdown type II collagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTOA affects the whole joint organ including the cartilage, synovium, and bone. PTOA&#xD;
      progression is multifaceted and includes activation of the pro-inflammatory Nuclear Factor&#xD;
      Kappa-B (NFkB) pathway, an increase in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, cell senescence, and&#xD;
      bone remodeling. Limiting the biochemical cascade through an innovative disease modifying&#xD;
      treatment to target upstream activity will potentially treat all components of the knee,&#xD;
      thereby lessening the inflammatory response, reducing cartilage catabolism, and potentially&#xD;
      improving pathologic bony remodeling observed after ACL reconstruction. The early proteomic&#xD;
      PTOA response is more similar to inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis than idiopathic OA; thus,&#xD;
      long-acting agents which better regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine activity may more&#xD;
      successfully limit tissue destruction. By re-purposing approved therapeutics with proven&#xD;
      immune efficacy, a readily-available and cost-effective strategy for disease modification may&#xD;
      be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montelukast was first approved for clinical use in 1998 for prophylaxis and chronic treatment&#xD;
      of asthma. The drug selectively inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1).&#xD;
      Montelukast blocks the actions of cysteinyl leukotriene D4 (LTD4), which is produced through&#xD;
      the arachidonic acid pathway. This pro-inflammatory signal is released from several cells&#xD;
      including the inflammatory mast cells and eosinophils. Montelukast also appears to address&#xD;
      multiple PTOA mechanisms by inhibiting cysteinyl leukotrienes. Cysteinyl leukotriene&#xD;
      inhibition in animal and laboratory models of PTOA resulted in the elimination of senescent&#xD;
      cells, reduced NFkB activation, decreased concentrations of pro-inflammatory and catabolic&#xD;
      factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) while increasing expression of anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      factors (inducing anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage infiltration), inhibiting&#xD;
      osteoclastogenesis and improving bone quality. The novel use of oral montelukast offers the&#xD;
      potential of a disease modifying treatment to prevent irreversible cartilage loss after ACL&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
