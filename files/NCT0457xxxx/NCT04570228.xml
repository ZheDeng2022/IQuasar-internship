  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theis is a prospective, multicenter, blinded, randomized sham controlled pivotal clinical&#xD;
      trial with a crossover at 6M, to assess the safety and effectiveness of pulmonary artery&#xD;
      denervation with the TIVUS™ System in subjects with PAH. The study will assess improved&#xD;
      and/or maintained exercise tolerance in patients with PAH through the analysis of exercise&#xD;
      tolerance, hemodynamic changes, clinical worsening and the quality of life who got treated by&#xD;
      the TIVUS system.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomized 2:1 with a sham controlled arm, with subjects and all follow up staff blinded to the subject treatment. Subjects will be unblinded at 6M, and sham control group will be offered treatment at this time if they meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria. The primary effectiveness endpoint is measured at 6 months. The safety endpoint for blinded patients is at 6 months, and for treated patients again at 12 months.</intervention_model_description>
