  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect information on side effects and how well Esperoct速 (turoctocog alfa&#xD;
      pegol (N8-GP)) works during long-term treatment (prophylaxis) in males with haemophilia A.&#xD;
      Participants in this study will get the same treatment as they would normally get, if they&#xD;
      were not participating in the study. All visits at the clinic are done in the same way as&#xD;
      participants are used to, when visiting their doctor. During visits at the clinic&#xD;
      participants might be asked for some relevant tests if considered useful by the study doctor.&#xD;
      During the visits the study doctor might ask if participants had any side effects since the&#xD;
      last study visit. Participants will be asked to note down in their own diary the number of&#xD;
      bleeds and how these were treated, as well as their regular prophylaxis. Participation in the&#xD;
      study will last for about 5-7 years, depending on when participants join the study.&#xD;
      Participants are free to leave the study at any time and for any reason. This will not affect&#xD;
      their current and future medical care.&#xD;
