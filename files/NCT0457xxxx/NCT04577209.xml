  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two purposes of this study. The first purpose is to determine the exposure seen by&#xD;
      medical providers (e.g. anesthesiologists, surgeons, and nurses) to infectious and smoke&#xD;
      particulates generated during anesthesia-related aerosol generating medical procedures&#xD;
      (AGMPs) and pediatric otolaryngologic surgeries (with and without an intubated airway). The&#xD;
      second goal of this study is to apply a local exhaust ventilation system (LEVS) to&#xD;
      re-evaluate the exposure seen by the same medical providers during the same AGMPs and&#xD;
      surgeries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the patient entering the OR, particle counters (Digital PM2.5 Air Quality detector,&#xD;
      ExGizmo, China) will ensure that the OR air quality has undergone the appropriate airflow&#xD;
      exchanges and thus will all read 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken every 30 seconds. A research assistant in the periphery of the OR&#xD;
      will observe and record the following events: patient entrance into the OR, initiation of&#xD;
      mask induction, intubation, rotation of OR table for surgery, initiation of surgery,&#xD;
      completion of surgery, rotation of OR back to anesthesia, extubation, and patient departure&#xD;
      from the OR. The particle counters will be positioned accordingly: 1) at the level of the&#xD;
      patient's head, 2) at the level of the anesthesiologist/surgeon performing the AGMPs, 3) to&#xD;
      the right of the patient, 4) to the left of the patient, 5) at the anesthesia workstation,&#xD;
      and 6) at the circulating nurse's computer in the corner of the room. The particle counters&#xD;
      will continue with measurements until the patient exits the OR. For patients randomized to&#xD;
      the LEVS group, active suction will be provided through the use of a closed biohazardous&#xD;
      smoke evacuation system (Neptune 3, Stryker, Michigan, USA) equipped with an internal high&#xD;
      efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter capable of capturing aerosolized particles as small&#xD;
      as 0.1 mm with 99.99% efficiency via suction power up to 25 cubic feet per minute air&#xD;
      exchange. The active suction will be positioned near the patient's airway without interfering&#xD;
      with the AGMP, and across from the location of the anesthesiologist or surgeon performing the&#xD;
      AGMP such that no HCW is positioned between the patient's airway and the suction device.&#xD;

    <description>To measure the particle concentrations in the air (Î¼g/m^3), particle counters will be located at each of the different healthcare worker positions in the operating room (OR) during an aerosol generating procedure either with a local evacuation system or without one. Measurements will be taken every 30 seconds from prior to the patient entering the OR to patient departure from the OR.</description>
