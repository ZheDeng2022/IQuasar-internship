  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Philips Healthcare has developed a next generation Allura investigational device. The&#xD;
      intended purpose of the investigational device is to perform neurovascular imaging&#xD;
      applications, including diagnostic, interventional and minimally invasive procedures on human&#xD;
      patients. The goal of this study is to investigate the accuracy of the next generation Allura&#xD;
      investigational device to determine the extent and localization of ischemic stroke changes in&#xD;
      brain tissue.&#xD;
