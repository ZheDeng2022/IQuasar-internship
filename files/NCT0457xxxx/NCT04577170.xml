  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that Fabry disease - FD is associated with elevated vascular resistance&#xD;
      induced by cerebral small-vessel disease, indicating increased distal resistance to blood&#xD;
      flow. The findings of this study may be used as a precursor for neuroimaging manifestations&#xD;
      related to stroke in FD patients.&#xD;

    <description>For the secondary outcome, age and sex-matched healthy controls will be consecutively enrolled. After clinical evaluation, healthy controls will present no FD-associated manifestations, hence they will be FD negative. In addition, brain MRI will be performed and subjects with white matter disease and leukoencephalopathy will be excluded. Included controls will be leukoencephalopathy negative. TCD and TCCD evaluation will be performed in healthy controls, in order to measure pulsatility index and compare the results against FD patients.</description>
