  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In last decades, several advances in the neuro-intensive management have lead to decrease&#xD;
      mortality in Intensive Care Units. A significant morbidity remains as patients survive after&#xD;
      a traumatic coma with uncertain quality of awakening and a high risk of functional&#xD;
      disability. Predicting awareness recovery and functional disability of those who will awake&#xD;
      constitutes a major challenge to inform patients' relatives, to give the best chances in&#xD;
      terms of rehabilitation resources or to adapt intensive cares to a reasonable level. Tools&#xD;
      currently available are not sufficient neither to predict bad awakening outcome nor to&#xD;
      predict good functional outcome. In many countries, life's support cessation is a constant&#xD;
      call for robust evaluation as soon as possible in ICU but it is mandatory to reach a positive&#xD;
      predictive value of non-awaking close to 100%. Many clinical, electro-physiological,&#xD;
      biological, radiological and functional parameters have been conducted with comatose patients&#xD;
      assuming the purpose to predict outcome. Regarding unfavourable outcome, the gold standard is&#xD;
      the abolition of the N20 component of somatosensory evoked potentials but the specificity is&#xD;
      high enough only for patients with anoxic coma. Several neurophysiological markers such as&#xD;
      MMN, P300 are correlated to a favourable outcome but the sensitivity and specificity remains&#xD;
      low for patients who suffered a severe traumatic brain injury. New Diffusion Tensor imaging&#xD;
      sequences provide complementary information to detect small structural lesions (diffuse&#xD;
      axonal lesions). Recently, functional MRI analyzing Resting State has also been proposed as a&#xD;
      prognostic marker during coma. PET using Fluoro-Desoxy-Glucose is able to assess the&#xD;
      metabolism in key regions of the awakening network in either anaesthesia or sleep. Recent&#xD;
      studies have reported interesting results at the chronic stage but to our knowledge, these&#xD;
      tools have only been used to address pathophysiology's issues and never to improve coma&#xD;
      prognosis at the initial stage. We hypothesize that the heterogeneity of the population&#xD;
      requires a global and accurate assessment of the central nervous system, combining&#xD;
      structural, metabolic and functional information in order to refine the prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our protocol integrates in one-sequence most radiological markers of brain injury within a&#xD;
      unique PET-MRI in Lyon. Our most relevant originality consists in confronting FDG-PET and MRI&#xD;
      sequences to a large clinical, electrophysiological and biological battery. The added&#xD;
      clinical value would be to question the synergistic effect of each parameter and to find out&#xD;
      which ones are the most useful for awakening prediction, as they have not been compared in a&#xD;
      multi-parametric database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET-MRI, as a new device combining physiological and prognostic questioning, allows us:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to implement a more integrative physio-pathological analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to avoid the cofounding effect of awareness' fluctuations in recording simultaneously&#xD;
           multiple functional imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RS will be analyzed at 2 epochs in order to assess the stability of brain connectivity,&#xD;
      related to neuronal activity (glucose metabolism) and brain perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of imaging result will be compared across morphological and functional sequences&#xD;
      and in comparison, to classical marker (clinical, electrophysiological and behavioural) to&#xD;
      build the most precise prognostic tool for acute comatose patients in ICU or&#xD;
      diagnostic/prognostic tool for chronic patients in rehabilitation unit.&#xD;
