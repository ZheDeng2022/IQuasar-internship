  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to assess the usefulness of systematic reinterpretation of CNV of unknown&#xD;
      significance. To investigate this question we will study all CNV of unknown significance&#xD;
      detected between 2010 and 2017.&#xD;

      Array-CGH is a front-line technique in many genetic indications in both prenatal and&#xD;
      postnatal settings. It allows the detection of chromosomal rearrangements (duplication or&#xD;
      deletion for example) in routine. The interpretation and classification of these copy number&#xD;
      variations or CNVs is essential but complex. It requires a systematic and methodical analysis&#xD;
      of the variation in the context of the scientific literature. When these revisions do not&#xD;
      meet either pathogenicity or benignity criteria, they are referred to as variation of unknown&#xD;
      significance (or VUS). They account for a significant proportion of the revisions up to 75%&#xD;
      (Palmer et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection of VUS does not, in most cases, allow for a diagnosis and often requires the&#xD;
      use of other, costly techniques. The human impact may also be significant in the absence of&#xD;
      possible genetic counselling (e.g. in the context of a future pregnancy). Reanalysis of an&#xD;
      VUS is of major interest for at least two reasons : (1) the first, if it is classified as&#xD;
      benign, makes it possible to close the investigation of the variant, to consider other leads&#xD;
      without ulterior motives, and to reassure the patient about the absence of pathogenicity of&#xD;
      the variant. (2) if the VUS is ultimately pathogenic, this makes it possible to name the&#xD;
      disease for the patient, to specify genetic counselling, to avoid further long and costly&#xD;
      investigation and possibly to propose treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, VUS can be reanalysed by the laboratory at the request of the prescribing&#xD;
      physician or possibly another physician. However, no systematic reanalysis procedure is&#xD;
      currently in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these variations of unknown meanings are frequent and represent an important issue,&#xD;
      to our knowledge, no systematic database study has been carried out. Some similar work has&#xD;
      nevertheless been carried out over a shorter period or on an ad hoc basis, showing an&#xD;
      interest in this type of approach (Palmer et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, it seems essential to determine the interest of reanalysing such variations in&#xD;
      several modes: diagnostic, economic and human.&#xD;
