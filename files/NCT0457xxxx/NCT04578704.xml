    <textblock>
      Bimaxillary dental proclination is the condition where the upper and lower dental arches are&#xD;
      procline thus increase lip fullness. Since the aim of orthodontic treatment in bimaxillary&#xD;
      proclination in to get flatten profile where the incisor inclinations are purposely reduced&#xD;
      or interincisal angle are increased, therefore it is guarded for corrected dentition to&#xD;
      maintain stable or not post orthodontic treatment.Therefore, this study is looking into&#xD;
      evidence which is the best retainer to maintain stability of bimaxillary proclination cases&#xD;
      following fixed appliances treatment.&#xD;

      Study title Stability of Bimaxillary Proclination Cases Following Fixed Appliances Treatment:&#xD;
      A Randomized Control Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Pre-treatment of bimaxillary proclination patient who completed active&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances and are scheduled to debond at Orthodontic&#xD;
      Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Randomized, prospective, single-center control trial. Three parallel arm groups&#xD;
      of patients will be assigned for 3 types of retention methods; 1.VFR 2.Fixed bonded retainer&#xD;
      3.Double regime (bonded &amp; VFR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study To determine the best mode of retention to maintain the stability of bimaxillary&#xD;
      proclination cases treated by four premolars extraction and fixed appliances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the post treatment dental and soft tissue stability in the retention phase up&#xD;
           to one-year post treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the effectiveness the different types of retainers to maintain the stability&#xD;
           of orthodontically corrected bimaxillary proclination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the impact of the different types of retainers on the OHRQoL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size The sample size calculation was done using G*power software version 3.1.The&#xD;
      f-test, repeated measures ANOVA, within-between interaction were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the effect size of 0.43 (Keating PJ 1986), maximum accuracy (power) of 80% (0.80),&#xD;
      error of 5% (0.05), number of groups are 3, number of measurements are 2, correlation among&#xD;
      repetitive measures is 0.5, nonsphericity correlation is 1, total number of 18 subjects&#xD;
      needed for entire study. Allowing for 50% dropout, a final sample size of 27 subjects with 9&#xD;
      subjects per group will be used.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The patient will be decided for the type of retention treatment by picking an opaque and sealed envelope.&#xD;
The participants study models will be examined and assigned with a blinding code by first researcher , who will be blinded to the subjects' retainer allocation. Patients name on the printed radiograph will also be removed. Therefore,the first researcher will be blinded to those she will be measuring. The blinding code will be prepared by second researcher before first researcher measure the casts and radiographs.</masking_description>

    <description>Patients will be instructed to wear the removable vacuum form retainer for 8 to 10 hours per day and only removed the retainers during tooth brushing. (Thickett 2010), (Gill 2007).&#xD;
The vacuum formed retainer will be constructed using thermoplastic material that will be purchased from manufacturer at 1.0mm thickness.&#xD;
Meanwhile, bonded retainer will be done using Ormco ® response deadsoft retainer wire size 0.190 round, made in USA by ORMCO Corporation, the fixed bonded wire will be extended distal to the extraction spaces that were previously closed by fixed appliances on both the upper and lower arches. The bonded retainer will be wearing by patients for 24 hours.&#xD;
Double regime retainer that will be comprised of vacuum formed and bonded retainer will be constructed using the same properties as vacuum formed retainer and bonded retainer. A standard oral and written instruction will be given to patients regarding retainer's uses. (Shawesh M et.al, 2009).</description>
