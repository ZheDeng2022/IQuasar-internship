  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if re-treatment with 225Ac-J591 can be given without&#xD;
      severe side effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of single dose of 225Ac-J591 at 90 KBq/Kg in men with progressive&#xD;
      mCRPC. If the patient responds and tolerates this dose, another may be given upon&#xD;
      progression, provided at least 12 weeks after the initial dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is being done because the standard treatments for prostate cancer that&#xD;
      has spread beyond the prostate gland are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the&#xD;
      disease and make men live longer. These treatments, however, are not curative so additional&#xD;
      treatments are needed. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a protein that is on the&#xD;
      surface of most prostate cancer cells. It is absent from most other normal places in the&#xD;
      body, but is present to some degree in the kidney, small intestine, salivary glands, and&#xD;
      brain. J591 is a monoclonal antibody (an engineered protein) which recognizes PSMA.&#xD;
      Actinium-225 (225Ac) is a small radioactive particle that emits alpha-particles&#xD;
      (damaging/ionizing radiation). 225Ac-J591 is the combination compound that has the&#xD;
      radioactive particle linked to J591. It is designed so that J591 will recognize PSMA and&#xD;
      drags the radioactive particle 225Ac with it wherever it goes. This drug used currently is&#xD;
      not FDA approved for any indication and is considered experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of the study, a small group of subjects will receive a dose of 225Ac-J591&#xD;
      based upon a prior study. If that dose does not lead to severe side effects in many subjects,&#xD;
      an additional small group will be treated. If the initial dose leads to too many severe side&#xD;
      effects, another group will receive a lower dose. If it is determined by a physician that a&#xD;
      subject's tumor has responded favorably to treatment, did not experience severe side effects&#xD;
      and subject in agreement, then the subject will be allowed to receive one additional dose of&#xD;
      the study drug 225Ac-J591, provided that at least 3 months have passed since the initial&#xD;
      dose. For subjects receiving re-treatment, they will also participate in the same study&#xD;
      procedures and followed for treatment including short-term and long-term follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatment visits and all visits involving investigational PSMA PET imaging are required&#xD;
      to be performed at the Weill Cornell Medicine - NewYork Presbyterian site located in the&#xD;
      upper east side of Manhattan.&#xD;
