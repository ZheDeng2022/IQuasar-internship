      The main objectives of the study are; to determine the efficacy of test drug Crano-cure for&#xD;
      the treatment of urinary tract infection, to compare the effectiveness of Polyherbal&#xD;
      formulation Crano-cure vs. Standard allopathic. Antibacterial/ antibiotic (Ciprofloxacin 500&#xD;
      mg) in treatment of UTI, to assess the safety of trial drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research literatures have revealed that Tribulus terrestris (Gokhro), Vaccinium macrocarpon&#xD;
      (karonda), Cuminum cyminum (Zeera sufaid), Rheum emodi (Revand chini) and Piper cubeba (Kabab&#xD;
      chini) are important therapeutic plants. Many pharmacological researches have been done on&#xD;
      these plants. For instance, antioxidant, antiseptic, anti-microbial, anti-bacterial,&#xD;
      anticancer etc. In the above claims and facts, the study is conducted to formulate and&#xD;
      evaluate the polyherbal capsule and to find out the most effective combination having&#xD;
      anti-bacterial activity.&#xD;

      A urinary tract infection (UTI) is the infection of kidney that affects urinary tract. It&#xD;
      affects the urinary bladder (cystitis) and kidney (pyelonephritis). Symptoms of urinary&#xD;
      bladder infection are painful urination, frequent micturation, and urinary incontinence.&#xD;
      Symptoms of infection in kidney include pyrexia and lumber pain also in addition to symptoms&#xD;
      of a lower urinary tract infection and rarely blood in the urine. In older age and in young&#xD;
      adults, symptoms may be unclear or non-specific [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary tract infections are grouped into two types; complicated and uncomplicated. In&#xD;
      uncomplicated cases of urinary tract infections, the function of urinary tract system does&#xD;
      not disturb. In complicated UTI, the normal function of UT system disturbs [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncomplicated UTI is usually caused by E. coli Staphylococcus saprophyticus Klebsiella&#xD;
      pneumonia Proteus mirabilis Enterococcus spp. While complicated UTI is caused by Similar&#xD;
      organisms which causes uncomplicated UTI Staphylococcus spp. Enterococcus spp. P. aeruginosa&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current studies on the prevalence of urinary tract infections approximately one third&#xD;
      population of the world has been suffering from this disease. This disease causes Pyuria,&#xD;
      burning urination, heamaturia, pyrexia, Vaginal itching, Offensive&quot; smell and turbid urine,&#xD;
      urinate frequent, urgency to urinate and suprapubic pain or pain in pelvis. It is not&#xD;
      life-threatening disease. Different antibacterial/ antibiotics are available such as&#xD;
      Co-trimaxazole, amoxicillin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, combination of trimethoprim and&#xD;
      sulfamethoxazole and quinolone antibiotics is taken as a choice for the treatment of UTI [3].&#xD;
      The antibacterial agents/ antibiotic available but they are limited in number, have adverse&#xD;
      effects, resistance of bacteria to these agents and relapse of the UTI. In order to overcome&#xD;
      the problem of less availability of drugs needed to treat urinary tract infection, with&#xD;
      traditional medicine derived from medicinal plants. This encouraged the search for new and&#xD;
      dynamic antibacterial agents from plant sources.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Clinical trials are designed to understand the nature of disease, its associated symptoms, and patient's response towards management. The study has aim to evaluate the effect of medical intervention with allopathic and herbal medicine to treat urinary tract infection. For this purpose, the patient suffering from urinary tract infection were examined and managed in different medical centers such as Shifa-ul-Mulk Memorial Hospital Hamdard University Karachi, Naseem ul Sehat Eastern Medicine Clinic Bahawalpur, Matab Hakeem Atta ur Rehman Siddique Lahore and khurshid Siddique Clinic Lahore.</intervention_model_description>
