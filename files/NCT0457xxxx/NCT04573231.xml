  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine the expression of prostate specific membrane&#xD;
      antigen (PSMA) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, androgen receptor&#xD;
      (AR)-positive metastatic breast cancer, and to determine its role in resistance to the&#xD;
      anti-androgen, bicalutamide. The investigators hypothesize that PSMA expression will&#xD;
      correlate with resistance to anti-androgen therapies, as has been documented in prostate&#xD;
      cancer, and this can be used to select patients most likely to benefit from these therapies&#xD;
      in future clinical trials. 15 people with HER2-negative, AR-positive metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      will be enrolled and be on study for about 3 days.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the expression of PSMA via 18F-DCFPyL PSMA-based PET/CT in patients with&#xD;
           metastatic HER2-negative, AR-positive breast cancer. Expression of PSMA will be&#xD;
           quantified using PSMA-based PET imaging using a novel agent, 18F-DCFPyL, as a&#xD;
           non-invasive imaging biomarker of tumor neovasculature in HER2-negative, AR-positive&#xD;
           metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSMA PET will be compared with the expression of PSMA in CTCs and diagnostic metastatic&#xD;
           tissue from patients with HER2-negative, AR-positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSMA expression will be correlated with clinical benefit (objective response and&#xD;
           progression-free survival) to bicalutamide and ribociclib for patients enrolled in&#xD;
           NCT03090165.&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative analysis of 18F-DCFPyL PSMA PET uptake will be performed at the lesion-level. Standardized uptake values (SUV) will be measured by manually drawing a region of interest (ROI) to encompass the entire lesion guided by the lesion extent visualized on conventional imaging. PET SUV based quantitative tumor uptake parameters will be obtained.</description>

    <description>PSMA expression in tumors will be semi-quantitatively scored by a study pathologist using published methods including separate assessment of tumor-associated and non-tumor vasculature, with the endothelium highlighted by a CD31 immunostain to facilitate definitive recognition.</description>
