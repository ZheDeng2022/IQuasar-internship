    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial investigates the side effects of CC-486 and how well it works in&#xD;
      combination with lenalidomide and obinutuzumab in treating patients with CD20 positive B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma that has come back (recurrent) or has not responded to treatment (refractory).&#xD;
      Chemotherapy drugs, such as CC-486, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Lenalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and may also interfere with&#xD;
      the development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory,&#xD;
      it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Obinutuzumab is a type of antibody&#xD;
      therapy that targets and attaches to the CD20 proteins found on follicular lymphoma cells as&#xD;
      well as some healthy blood cells. Once attached to the CD20 protein the obinutuzumab is&#xD;
      thought to work in different ways, including by helping the immune system destroy the cancer&#xD;
      cells and by destroying the cancer cells directly. Giving CC-486 with lenalidomide and&#xD;
      obinutuzumab may improve response rates, quality, and duration, and minimize adverse events&#xD;
      in patients with B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and toxicity of oral azacitidine (CC-486) in combination with&#xD;
      lenalidomide and obinutuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of CC-486 in combination with lenalidomide and obinutuzumab in&#xD;
      subjects with relapsed/refractory indolent B-cell lymphoma as assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Overall response rate: complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) per 2016 Lugano&#xD;
      criteria and Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. Duration of response (DOR): will be calculated from time of initial response assessment&#xD;
      demonstrating at least PR until disease response assessment that demonstrates progressive&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ic. Time to response (TTR): calculated as time from registration to first disease response&#xD;
      assessment that demonstrates at least PR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Id. Progression-free survival (PFS): Patients are considered a failure for this endpoint if&#xD;
      they die or if they relapse/progress or receive additional anti-lymphoma therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ie. Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
