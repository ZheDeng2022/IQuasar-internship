    <textblock>
      There is reason to believe the current dietary reference intakes for dietary protein for&#xD;
      children are too low. Furthermore, children with high levels of physical activity and fitness&#xD;
      may require a higher requirement. To better understand the protein requirements in minimally&#xD;
      and highly physically fit and active children 8-10 y old, investigators will use the&#xD;
      indicator amino acid oxidation technique.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Determine dietary protein requirements using the indicator amino acid oxidation&#xD;
      (IAAO) method in a group of thoroughly phenotyped school-age children who engage in different&#xD;
      levels of Physical Activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Daily dietary protein requirements are greater in children with high level of&#xD;
      physical activity vs. sedentary children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Adequate dietary protein intake is essential to support cellular integrity,&#xD;
      physical growth and function. Although dietary protein malnutrition is not prevalent in the&#xD;
      U.S., highly active individuals may require greater than the average protein intake to&#xD;
      support both increased metabolic demands and skeletal muscle repair and remodeling. The&#xD;
      current Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines do not have separate dietary protein estimated&#xD;
      average requirement (EARs) for physically active children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: This is a comparative two-group (sedentary vs. physically active), single&#xD;
      center, prospective cohort study designed to estimate and compare the dietary protein&#xD;
      requirements among sedentary and active children between the ages of 8-10 years. Each&#xD;
      participant will be assigned to 7 one-day dietary protein levels with the goal of obtaining&#xD;
      measures of phenylalanine oxidation corresponding to each level of protein intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 children will be recruited for this study at the Arkansas Children's Nutrition&#xD;
      Center (ACNC) with the expectation of a 20% attrition rate resulting in a total of 24&#xD;
      children (n=12/group) in the final analysis. The recruitment will ensure equal representation&#xD;
      of both sexes of children. After screening, the children and parents will attend an in-person&#xD;
      or remote assent/consent visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the assent/consent visit, children will consume a 2-day run-in diet to ensure protein&#xD;
      intakes of 1.5 g/kg/day and energy intakes of 1.7 x resting energy expenditure. Each child&#xD;
      will participate in 7 testing days, following an overnight fast before each visit. At each of&#xD;
      these testing days, participants will be randomly assigned to one of 7 test protein dosages&#xD;
      (0.2-2.4 g·kg-1·d-1) consisting of 8 isocaloric and isonitrogenous meals provided hourly,&#xD;
      each meal presenting 1/12 of the daily energy requirement. Study day diet is composed of a&#xD;
      crystalline amino acid mixture based on the amino acid profile of egg protein and protein&#xD;
      free diet toddler and 2 formulas for carbohydrate and fat. A stable isotope tracer will be&#xD;
      added to the 5th through 8th meals. Investigators will measure the rate of oxidation of this&#xD;
      tracer expired in breath (F13CO2), and flux of this tracer by its enrichment in urine.&#xD;
