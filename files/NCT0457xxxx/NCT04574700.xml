      Knee Osteoarthritis is a type of joint disease or common rheumatologic disease that result&#xD;
      from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone which is characterized by pain,&#xD;
      stiffness, and decreased range of motion. Knee OA is more important not only for its high&#xD;
      prevalence rate compared with other types of OA but also for its presentation at earlier age&#xD;
      groups particularly in younger age groups of obese women. Symptoms of knee OA progress slowly&#xD;
      over years. The incidence of knee OA increases by age and further increase with longer&#xD;
      lifetime and higher average weight of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of knee OA progress slowly over years. Pain and other symptoms of OA may have a&#xD;
      profound effect on quality of life affecting both physical function and psychological&#xD;
      parameters. Knee OA is not a localized disease of cartilage alone but is considered as a&#xD;
      chronic disease of the whole joint, including articular cartilage, meniscus, ligament, and&#xD;
      peri-articular muscle that may result from multiple pathophysiological mechanisms. It is&#xD;
      painful and disabling disease that affects millions of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common symptoms are progressive knee stiffness, pain, difficulties in performing activities&#xD;
      such as walking, stair climbing, squatting. Reduction in functional capacity associated with&#xD;
      muscular imbalance of lower extremity with pain. Muscles act as brace for knee joint,&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle weakness and hamstring inhibition effect this bracing. Muscle dysfunction&#xD;
      may actually precede and accelerate the cartilage deterioration. Evidence showed muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction is involved in pathogenesis of knee OA. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent&#xD;
      joint disease and a leading source of chronic pain and disability in the United States. Knee&#xD;
      OA accounts for more than 80% of the disease's total burden and affects at least 19% of&#xD;
      American adults aged 45 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical strategies exist for treatment of knee osteoarthritis with aim to reduce symptoms&#xD;
      like pain, delay disease progression i.e. pharmacological, physiotherapy and surgical&#xD;
      strategies. Patients experience chronic pain that cause reduction in ability to use their&#xD;
      joint. Due to prolong inactivity of joint to move through complete range cause muscle&#xD;
      shortness along with capsule tightness that leads for further increasing pain and disability.&#xD;
      Physical therapy interventions are first line of choice for the treatment of knee OA.&#xD;
      Treatment varieties i.e. modalities, therapeutic exercises, manual therapy along with&#xD;
      neuromuscular training to improve mechanical environment of knee joint&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is indicated at least 15-30 degree loss of active knee extension with 90 degree of hip&#xD;
      ﬂexion account as hamstring shortening. Hamstring muscle tightness and poor flexibility is&#xD;
      associated with knee OA. Hamstring flexibility is higher in healthy individual as compared to&#xD;
      subjects with knee OA.A statistically significant relationship was found between hamstring&#xD;
      tightness and proximal tibiofibular joint grade of arthritis (χ2 test, p=0.004) Recent study&#xD;
      reported 97.6% of middle aged men with hamstring muscle tightness Hamstring flexibility is&#xD;
      greater in females than males. Research showed that ischio-tibial flexibility reduce pain&#xD;
      stiffness and significant functional limitation in knee OA. Joint mobilizations are most&#xD;
      widely used in treatment of knee OA having various neuro-physiological effects including&#xD;
      decrease in pain, stiffness, activation and inhibition of muscles.The muscular system&#xD;
      reflects sensorimotor system it receives information from musculoskeletal and central nervous&#xD;
      systems. Changes occur in tone within the muscle are the first responses to nociception by&#xD;
      the sensorimotor system. Many studies reported effect of joint pathology on muscle tone for&#xD;
      example the presence of knee effusion causes reflex inhibition of the vastus-medialis and&#xD;
      multifidus has been shown to atrophy in patients with chronic low back pain. In this study we&#xD;
      aim to increase hamstring muscle length through activation of mechanoreceptors by&#xD;
      mobilizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no study conducted yet to determine effect of joint mobilization on adjacent muscle&#xD;
      length other than soft tissue techniques which are mainly stretches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature review: randomized control trail (2019) conducted for comparing effectiveness on&#xD;
      Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation(PNF) stretching verses static stretching on&#xD;
      hamstring flexibility in knee OA patients showed PNF stretching was better in outcome&#xD;
      measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study compared static verses intermittent stretching for increase of hamstring muscle&#xD;
      length concluded that intermittent stretching is more effective for hamstring flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-post study (2019) find out effect of unilateral posteroanterior mobilization(UPA) on&#xD;
      lumbar spine observed in his study that UPA lumbar mobilizations increased lumbar Range of&#xD;
      Motion and hamstring extensibility by a moderate magnitude and this effect remained for 10-15&#xD;
      minutes post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study reported Joint manipulations reduce nociceptor stimulus, depress responsiveness of&#xD;
      alpha motor neurons causing changes in muscle tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study on active stretching and passive mobilization of cervical spine for neck pain concluded&#xD;
      there was increase range of motion in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      comparing Muscle Energy Technique(MET) with conventional treatment for hamstring flexibility&#xD;
      in knee OA patients reported that MET was better than conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized control trail(2014)compared immediate effects of neurodynamics slider technique&#xD;
      verses static stretch concluded neurodynamics slider technique is more effective for&#xD;
      improving hamstring flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic effect of joint mobilization that joint mobilization may promote muscles&#xD;
      relaxation thereby increasing joint range of motion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint mobilization and traction allows for selective stretching of selected tissue and can be&#xD;
      expected to change both elastic and plastic component of stiffness. The intermittent&#xD;
      compression and distraction of joint distribute fluid into soft tissue decreasing spasm&#xD;
      allowing for easier movement and increase range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint mobilization cause stimulation of Golgi tendon organ activity, and reflex inhibition of&#xD;
      the muscle at the end of the passive joint mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study concluded that joint mobilization decreases muscle activity, reducing muscle&#xD;
      concentric activation, pain, and muscle tension in periarticular-tissue&#xD;
