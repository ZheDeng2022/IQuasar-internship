    <textblock>
      This study assesses the efficacy of sugammadex against neostigmine for hastening recovery&#xD;
      from neuromuscular blockade and optimizing pulmonary function in obese patients with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea presenting for outpatient surgery. Both drugs are used in&#xD;
      anesthesiology to reverse neuromuscular blockade that is given in the setting of inducing and&#xD;
      maintaining general anesthesia.&#xD;
