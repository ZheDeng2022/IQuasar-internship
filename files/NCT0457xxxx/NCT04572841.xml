      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of one dose level of SAR441344 versus placebo over 12&#xD;
      weeks in adult patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSjS), assessed by the change of the&#xD;
      European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;

           weeks in adult patients with pSjS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of one dose level of SAR441344 versus placebo in&#xD;
           adult patients with pSjS as determined by adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
&#xD;

           over 12 weeks in adult patients with pSjS determined by electrocardiogram, vital signs,&#xD;
           and laboratory evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the immunogenicity of one dose level of SAR441344 versus placebo over 12&#xD;
           weeks in adult patients with pSjS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group proof of&#xD;
      concept Phase 2 study to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SAR441344 in adult patients&#xD;
      with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSjS), as well as safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study visit frequency: every 2 weeks in the treatment period and every 4 weeks in the&#xD;
           follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total duration of the study will be 24 weeks (28 weeks including maximum screening&#xD;
           duration) for each participant, including a 12-week treatment period and a 12-week&#xD;
           follow-up period.&#xD;
