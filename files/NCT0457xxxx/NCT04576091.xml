      This phase I trial evaluates the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      combination therapy with BAY1895344, stereotactic body radiation, and pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      treating patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer that has come back (recurrent) and&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). BAY1895344 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision.&#xD;
      This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage&#xD;
      to normal tissue. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Giving BAY1895344, stereotactic body radiation therapy in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab may shrink or stabilize head and neck squamous cell cancer for longer than&#xD;
      treatment with radiation and immunotherapy without BAY1895344.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ATR kinase inhibitor BAY1895344 (BAY1895344)&#xD;
      with concurrent head and neck stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) reirradiation and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BAY 1895344 in combination with&#xD;
      concurrent head and neck SBRT and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity (overall response rate, progression-free&#xD;
      survival, and overall survival) of BAY 1895344, SBRT, and pembrolizumab for recurrent head&#xD;
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify predictive biomarkers of response to BAY 1895344, SBRT, and pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      including, but not limited to the following: genetic alterations of ATM and other&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response genes, tumor mutational load, circulating tumor&#xD;
      DNA, baseline tumor ATM expression, tumor PD-L1 expression, and change in circulating Ki67+&#xD;
      CD8+ T-cells relative to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BAY1895344 and stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT) given with fixed-dose pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Starting on day&#xD;
      7, patients also receive BAY1895344 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 7-9 and 14-16&#xD;
      during cycle 1, and before and after each SBRT treatment during cycle 2 for a total of 9&#xD;
      doses. Beginning cycle 2, patients undergo SBRT starting between days 2 and 8 for 3 fractions&#xD;
      with 2-3 days between fractions. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up quarterly for 2 years or until&#xD;
      death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

Tumor mutation burden will be categorized as high (above median) or low (equal to or below median). Other biomarker expression levels will be categorized as high versus absent/reduced. The chi-square or Fisher exact test will be used to study associations between expression levels and tumor response (complete response/partial response; stable/progressive disease). Associations with time-to-event endpoints will be investigated using the log rank test. Differences in change in circulating Ki67+ CD8+ T-cells relative to baseline between levels of tumor response will be explored using the t-test or non-parametric equivalent (e.g., Mann-Whitney) if appropriate. Cox regression will be used to explore associations between change in in circulating Ki67+ CD8+ T-cells and time-to-event endpoints. Other biomarkers will be analyzed similarly.</description>

             test will be required. The effects of BAY 1895344 on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason and because DNA-damage response inhibitors as well as other&#xD;
             therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to&#xD;
             study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after&#xD;
             completion of BAY 1895344 therapy or 4 months after completion of pembrolizumab&#xD;
             therapy, whichever is later. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 6 months after completion of BAY 1895344 therapy or 4 months after&#xD;
             completion of pembrolizumab therapy, whichever is later&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Patients who are currently participating and receiving study therapy or have&#xD;
             participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used&#xD;
             an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received transfusion of blood products (including platelets or red blood cells) or&#xD;
             administration of colony stimulating factors (including granulocyte colony-stimulating&#xD;
             factor [G-CSF], granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], or&#xD;
             recombinant erythropoietin) within 4 weeks prior to study day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after&#xD;
             consultation with the study principal investigator (PI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not&#xD;
             recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events (AEs) due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has new or progressive brain metastases, or leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with carcinomatous meningitis should be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to BAY 1893544 or pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
             years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,&#xD;
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current&#xD;
             pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent&#xD;
             (excluded from expansion phase only; patients who have received prior anti-PD-1,&#xD;
             anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 therapy may be included in the dose escalation phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications that are substrates of CYP3A4 with a narrow&#xD;
             therapeutic window, or strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible, if they&#xD;
             cannot be transferred to alternative medication. Because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical&#xD;
             reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be&#xD;
             counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because BAY 1895344 as a DNA-damage&#xD;
             response inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with BAY 1895344, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with BAY 1895344 and for 4 months after the end&#xD;
             of BAY 1895344 treatment. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned treatment start. Seasonal flu&#xD;
             vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted&#xD;
