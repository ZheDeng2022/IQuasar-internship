    <textblock>
      Locked-In Syndrome (LIS) is a devastating condition in which a person has lost the ability to&#xD;
      communicate due to motor impairment, while being mentally intact. For people affected by this&#xD;
      severe communication impairment, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) may be the only solution&#xD;
      that allows these people to start a conversation, ask questions, or request assistance (i.e.&#xD;
      self-initiated communication). To-date, spelling was accomplished at a rate of 2-3 letters&#xD;
      per minute with a predecessor device (the Medtronic Activa PC+S). To improve BCI performance,&#xD;
      the current protocol will use the Medtronic Summit System, which offers a rechargeable&#xD;
      battery and improved signal quality relative to Activa PC+S. Using signals from the motor&#xD;
      hand/arm and/or motor mouth/face area, the investigators will investigate different avenues&#xD;
      to improve the speed of communication using the Summit System. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of the Summit System when used to chronically record subdural&#xD;
      electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals in a BCI for use by patients with LIS in patients'&#xD;
      homes. The secondary objective will be to evaluate the efficacy of the Summit System as a&#xD;
      long-term source of ECoG signals for a BCI capable of allowing participants to control&#xD;
      alternative and augmentative communication software in patients' homes.&#xD;

      Locked-In Syndrome (LIS) is a devastating condition in which a person has lost the ability to&#xD;
      communicate due to motor impairment, while being mentally intact. As a result, interaction&#xD;
      with the environment is severely limited, and often can only be achieved in concert with a&#xD;
      caregiver, who points at letters on a board one by one until the affected person blinks his&#xD;
      or her eyes. For people affected by this severe communication impairment, Brain-Computer&#xD;
      Interfaces (BCI) may be the only solution that allows these people to start a conversation,&#xD;
      ask questions, or request assistance (i.e. self-initiated communication). A current study in&#xD;
      the investigators' collaborator's lab at the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU,&#xD;
      Utrecht, The Netherlands) aims to achieve communication in people with LIS, through a fully&#xD;
      implantable BCI system, the Medtronic Inc. Activa PC+S. This is a research version of a deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation device (Activa PC; FDA approved for treating Parkinson's disease and other&#xD;
      disorders) that has been modified to allow electrophysiological recordings (+S for sensing).&#xD;
      In the Utrecht Neuroprosthesis (UNP) study to date, spelling was accomplished at a rate of&#xD;
      2-3 letters per minute. To improve BCI performance, the current protocol will use the&#xD;
      Medtronic Summit RC+S device (henceforth referred to as the Summit System), which offers a&#xD;
      rechargeable battery and improved signal quality relative to Activa PC+S. Using signals from&#xD;
      the motor hand/arm and/or motor mouth/face area, the investigators will investigate different&#xD;
      avenues to improve the speed of communication. To achieve this, the investigators will use&#xD;
      the Summit System under an investigational device exemption (IDE) and a Collaborative&#xD;
      Research Agreement between Johns Hopkins University (JHU), UMCU, and Medtronic. The study has&#xD;
      two main objectives. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of the Summit System&#xD;
      when used to chronically record subdural electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals in a BCI for&#xD;
      use by patients with LIS in patients' homes. The secondary objective will be to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the Summit System as a long-term source of ECoG signals for a BCI capable of&#xD;
      allowing participants to control alternative and augmentative communication software in&#xD;
      patients' homes.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age between 22-75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical diagnosis of chronic Locked-In Syndrome (LIS) certified by an independent&#xD;
             board-certified neurologist, defined here as impairments of voluntary motor control&#xD;
             that are widespread and severe enough to prevent independent initiation and&#xD;
             maintenance of communication, spoken or otherwise, without the assistance of a&#xD;
             caregiver. Diagnosis of LIS requires exclusion of cognitive impairments as a cause for&#xD;
             impaired communication (see Exclusion Criteria). For inclusion in this study,&#xD;
             participants may have one of the following clinical variants of LIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. &quot;Classic&quot; Locked-In Syndrome, with the following signs documented on neurological&#xD;
             examination i. Quadriplegia ii. Bulbar palsy iii. Anarthria iv. Partial or complete&#xD;
             preservation of vertical eye movements and upper eyelid movements, or b. &quot;Incomplete&quot;&#xD;
             Locked-In Syndrome, with the aforementioned signs of &quot;Classic&quot; LIS, documented on&#xD;
             neurological examination, except that voluntary movements other than upper eyelid and&#xD;
             vertical eye movement may be preserved, albeit still severe enough to prevent&#xD;
             independent initiation and maintenance of communication, without the assistance of a&#xD;
             caregiver. Preserved voluntary movements may include: i. Horizontal eye movements ii.&#xD;

&#xD;
             a. Permanent lesion of corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts in the ventral pons&#xD;
             (basis pontis) due to ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, or trauma, based on the following:&#xD;

        least one axial section 2. Absence of lesions on brain MRI that could contribute to&#xD;
        communication impairment, including lesions of Broca's or Wernicke's areas, or sensorimotor&#xD;
        cortex 3. EEG demonstrating posterior basic rhythm reactive to eye opening and closing iii.&#xD;
        No clinical evidence of improving communication ability for at least 1 year prior to&#xD;
        recruitment, confirming chronic LIS b. Diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),&#xD;
        certified by an independent board-certified neurologist with expertise in neuromuscular&#xD;
        disorders, satisfying the following El Escorial World Federation of Neurology diagnostic&#xD;
        criteria for probable, laboratory supported, or definite ALS: i. Signs of lower motor&#xD;
        neuron (LMN) degeneration by neurological examination (weakness, atrophy, and&#xD;
        fasciculations), electrophysiological (electromyographic findings of denervation), or&#xD;

        regions (cervical, thoracic, lumbosacral), or in all three spinal regions iii. Progressive&#xD;
        spread of signs within a region or to other regions, together with the absence of&#xD;
        electrophysiological or neuroimaging evidence of other disease processes that might explain&#xD;
        clinical and electrophysiological signs of LMN and/or UMN degeneration (see below) iv.&#xD;
        Confirmatory testing including:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Electrophysiological Studies&#xD;
