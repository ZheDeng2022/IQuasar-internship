      The main aim of work is to compare between subtotal and total thyroidectomy intra and&#xD;
      postoperatively to identify which technique is better for patient of graves disease&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland[1] and it's the most&#xD;
      common cause of hyperthyroidism. [2] Treatment of Graves' disease includes antithyroid drugs&#xD;
      ; radioiodine ; and thyroidectomy . patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism can be treated with&#xD;
      any of these treatment options. There is a wide geographic variation in the choice of&#xD;
      therapy.[3] Medical treatment with antithyroid drugs is often accepted as first-choice&#xD;
      modality in Europe, followed by radioiodine in case of recurrence. Although surgery offers&#xD;
      the advantage of quick control and low morbidity in experienced hands, it is infrequently&#xD;
      recommended as initial treatment. Therapy with radioiodine is the most common treatment in&#xD;
      the United States, while antithyroid drugs and/or thyroidectomy are used more often in&#xD;
      Europe, Japan, and most of the rest of the world.recent literature shows that the relapse&#xD;
      rate was the highest among patients who received antithyroid drugs (40%) as compared to those&#xD;
      who received radioiodine (21%) or Surgery (5). [4] Two different surgical techniques are used&#xD;
      for the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism: a total thyroidectomy (TT) in which the entire&#xD;
      gland is removed and a subtotal thyroidectomy (STT) , in which most of the gland is removed&#xD;
      leaving a small unilateral or bilateral remnant in situ about 4-5 grams. Although&#xD;
      thyroidectomy has been broadly considered as a viable alternative theapy for patients with&#xD;
      Graves' disease , the resection extent and remnant size of thyroid gland remains&#xD;
      controversial.[6] Although total thyroidectomy has a lower recurrence rate it has raised a&#xD;
      concern that a more radical operation would increase the complications.[7] we intend to&#xD;
      perform this analysis based on the published literatures of randomized controlled trials to&#xD;
      evaluate the specific risks of thyroid surgery including recurrent hyperthyroididm ,&#xD;
      post-operative bleeding , recurrent laryngeal nerve injury , hypoparathyroidism and&#xD;
      opthalmopathy progression.&#xD;
