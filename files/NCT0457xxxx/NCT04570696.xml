  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to measure the TFPI plasma level, a molecule involved in the&#xD;
      regulation of the coagulation system, in haemophilia patients. The second objective is to&#xD;
      assess the effects of TFPI inhibition on thrombin generation. Indeed, there is sparse data on&#xD;
      the physiological and pathological changes of TFPI levels in human and particularly in&#xD;
      hemophilia patients. Yet, TFPI inhibitors may become one of the new by-passing treatments of&#xD;
      haemophilia. Until now, published data mainly reports in vitro pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of TFPI inhibitors. Hence, in vivo effects of TFPI inhibition remain&#xD;
      unclear, especially in haemophilia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical development of such molecules requires a dedicated biological monitoring.&#xD;
      Thrombin Generation Assay (TGA) in Poor Platelets Plasma (PPP) is a good candidate since it&#xD;
      is sensitive to Factor VIII and Factor IX deficiencies as well as to TFPI. However, TGA&#xD;
      results are very dependent on experimental conditions (i. e. Tissue Factor and phospholipids&#xD;
      concentrations) and the relationship between TFPI plasma level and TGA parameters has not&#xD;
      been studied yet. This study should provide with original data on TFPI plasma levels and the&#xD;
      effect of TFPI on thrombin generation in haemophilia patients. This should help to define the&#xD;
      monitoring of TFPI inhibitors in Haemophilia.&#xD;

      This study is a single-institution cohort study. Patients will be informed during their&#xD;
      follow-up consultation. If the patient agrees to participate to this study, a non-opposition&#xD;
      form will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If blood tests are prescribed during the consultation, the unused plasma samples that are not&#xD;
      required to perform the prescribed analyses will be collected and anonymized in order to&#xD;
      measure the TGA and TFPI levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TFPI plasmatic level and TFPI activity measurements will be performed by a quantitative ELISA&#xD;
      assay (Total TFPI ELISA kit®, R&amp;d Systems) and a chromogenic assay (Actichrom TFPI®, Cryopep)&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TGA will be performed on a Fluoroskan® machine using 3 different levels of Tissue Factor&#xD;
      (TF): 1, 5 and 20 pM. In order to study the relation between different levels of TFPI&#xD;
      inhibitors and TGA parameters, TGA will also be performed by spiking blood samples with&#xD;
      several concentrations of TFPI inhibitor. For each TGA performed, ETP (Endogenous Thrombin&#xD;
      Potential, nM/min), peak (nM) and lagtime (min) will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected from the computerized patient record: date of birth, age,&#xD;
      gender, haemophilia type (A or B) and its severity, ongoing treatments and deficient factor&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to measure the TFPI plasma level in haemophilia patients. The&#xD;
      second objective is to assess the effects of TFPI inhibition on thrombin generation. This&#xD;
      study should provide with original data on TFPI plasma levels and the effect of TFPI on&#xD;
      thrombin generation in haemophilia patients. This should help to define the monitoring of&#xD;
      TFPI inhibitors in Haemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no additional risk for the patient since only unused blood samples, not needed for&#xD;
      the prescribed blood tests, will be collected.&#xD;
