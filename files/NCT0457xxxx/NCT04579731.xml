  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of bowel bladder disorder, or BBD, has been highlighted as a major player in&#xD;
      vesicoureteral reflux and urinary tract infection (UTI). However, the diagnosis of BBD are&#xD;
      still conceptual and subjective, because of the diagnosis of constipation, main&#xD;
      pathophysiology in BBD has not been established well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional constipation is a common disorder among children, accounting for 3-5% of visits to&#xD;
      pediatric clinics and even 10% to 25% of consultation for pediatric gastroenterologists. It&#xD;
      could cause recurrent abdominal pain, stool retention as well as fecal incontinence. In the&#xD;
      urologic field, this is known to develop urinary symptoms. Constipation has been associated&#xD;
      with voiding dysfunction and urinary tract infection in children. It is assumed that impacted&#xD;
      stool in distal rectum mechanically affect the bladder leading to detrusor overactivity.&#xD;
      Additionally, impacted stool would elevate the uretheral sphincter tone, having patients void&#xD;
      with incomplete sphincter relaxation and eliciting dysfunctional voiding. Stool impaction may&#xD;
      be the source of bacteria causing urinary tract infection and led to recurrent bacteriuria.&#xD;
      Treatment of constipation by itself is quite effective alleviating urologic symptoms in as&#xD;
      much as two-third of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of constipation has been highlighted as a major player in vesicoureteral reflux and&#xD;
      urinary tract infection (UTI). The presence of bowel bladder disorder (BBD) was associated&#xD;
      with higher risk of breakthrough infection and a lack of spontaneous resolution. Although&#xD;
      constipation is the major player in BBC, there is any objective standard regarding the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of constipation. Given the high prevalence and morbidity of children&#xD;
      affected by UTI or VUR in relations to BBD, it is imperative that diagnostic and treatment&#xD;
      methods are developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the known implication of constipation, the diagnosis of constipation may be&#xD;
      problematic due to a lack of standard definition for this condition. This may be due to&#xD;
      different views between clinicians about which aspect are most crucial for diagnosing&#xD;
      constipation. Some underline the subjective nature such as infrequent or difficult&#xD;
      defecation, other stress the quality of stool, still others were in search of objective&#xD;
      criteria of constipation, like the amount of impacted stool or colonic transit time.&#xD;
      Consequently, various criteria have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of standard criteria for constipation causes trouble sometimes in making a proper&#xD;
      decision for diagnosis, intervention, follow-up, and discharge of treatment.&#xD;
