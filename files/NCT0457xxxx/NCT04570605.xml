      Pilot study for determining feasibility of home parasacral transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation in treatment of urinary urgency and incontinence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common voiding dysfunction in children1. While many&#xD;
      children may outgrow these issues, for some these symptoms persists and can lead to&#xD;
      emotional, social, behavioral and physical problems. Multiple treatments exist for OAB but&#xD;
      rarely is there guaranteed success. Many behavioral and lifestyle treatments involve a&#xD;
      significant time investment and office visits on the part of the patient and family.&#xD;
      Furthermore, medication therapy is often associated with bothersome side effects and is&#xD;
      discontinued, even despite efficacy2. As such, treatments with potentially less adverse&#xD;
      effects, often used in adult urology, are making their way into the pediatric urology&#xD;
      practice. These include intravesical botulinum toxin injections, sacral nerve stimulation&#xD;
      (SNS) and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTNS, first cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 for adult&#xD;
      use, has evolved into transcutaneous nerve stimulation in the pediatric population; obviating&#xD;
      the need for needles during treatment. Studies suggest mixed efficacy in electric nerve&#xD;
      stimulation for overactive bladder in the pediatric population, owing largely to the marked&#xD;
      heterogeneity in treatment protocols. While some researchers follow the traditional tibial&#xD;
      nerve pathway, others take a cue from SNS and target the parasacral area, while still others&#xD;
      rely on signaling from even further peripheral nerves to modulate bladder overactivity 3-5.&#xD;
      Perhaps further contributing to the disparate data is the varying treatment schedules used.&#xD;
      Some centers perform treatments daily, others weekly, others twice or thrice a week.&#xD;
      Similarly, some physicians recommend twenty-minute treatments, while others thirty or even&#xD;
      sixty minutes. The majority of studies rely on an office-based treatment model, while a few&#xD;
      have explored in home treatments 3-5. In the United States, there has been no study examining&#xD;
      the feasibility or efficacy of home parasacral transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation&#xD;
      (PTENS) on pediatric voiding dysfunction.&#xD;
