      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine is a common disabling disorder and its substantial burden is associated with&#xD;
      considerable negative impact on quality of life. Several pharmacological treatments are&#xD;
      available for migraine prophylaxis but insufficient efficacy and significant side effects&#xD;
      preclude their widely use for migraine treatment. In recent years, more attention has been&#xD;
      paid to dietary supplements and natural ingredients for the treatment of migraine. Omega-3&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) have beneficial on the reduction of neurogenic,&#xD;
      perivascular inflammations and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may play an important role&#xD;
      in the pathophysiology of migraine. However, the results of investigations carried out about&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs in the management of migraine are inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the clinical efficacy for omega-3 PUFAs migraine prevention. To uncover the&#xD;
      underlying biochemical or neurophysiological mechanisms by which omega-3 PUFAs for migraine&#xD;
      prevention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This two-year project includes clinical approaches to investigate the therapeutic effects of&#xD;
      omega-3 PUFAs on episodic migraine (4-14 days/month) without migraine preventive treatment in&#xD;
      the past one month. 120 patients, aged 20-65, will be randomized in a 12-week, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial comparing the effects of high-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA,&#xD;
      1.8g/day) and placebo intervention. All participants will complete a set of outcome measures:&#xD;
      headache questionnaires and headache diary, the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS),&#xD;
      patient overall impression questionnaire-migraine improvement questionnaire (PGI-I), patient&#xD;
      overall impression questionnaire-migraine severity questionnaire (PGI-S), Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory-II (BDI-II), Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), Migraine Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (MSQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI) at baseline and the&#xD;
      follow-up visits before and after 12 weeks of placebo or omega-3 PUFAs intervention (EPA, 1.8&#xD;
      g/day) and a series of blood tests for neurotransmitter, neurotrophic and neuroinflammation.&#xD;
      The clinical efficacy and the peripheral blood biomarkers, will be analyzed at baseline and&#xD;
      the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the clinical evidence of omega-3 PUFAs on migraine prevention. To provide&#xD;
      significant insights into molecular actions of omega-3 PUFAs on migraine prevention.&#xD;
