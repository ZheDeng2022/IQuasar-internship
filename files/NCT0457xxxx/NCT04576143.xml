      Recent clinical studies showed that breast cancer patients especially for those with lymph&#xD;
      node metastasis may benefit from dose-dense chemotherapy, like adriamycin and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (AC) q2w×4→ paclitaxel (P) q2w×4. However, the studies on dose-dense (dd)&#xD;
      regimen chemotherapy is mostly based on postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and the optimum&#xD;
      of dose-dense chemotherapy has not been determined for Chinese population with HER2-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer patients. In our study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, multi-center&#xD;
      clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of dose-dense chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen (dd epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by dd paclitaxel (P)) and conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy (epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel (T)) as preoperative&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of HER2-negative breast cancer in Chinese&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy refers to systemic chemotherapy as the first step for treating&#xD;
      breast cancer patients before planned local treatment like surgery for those without distant&#xD;
      metastasis. Randomized trials of chemotherapy have demonstrated similar long-term outcomes&#xD;
      when patients were given the same treatment preoperatively compared with postoperatively. It&#xD;
      is reported that preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy can facilitate breast conservation,&#xD;
      render inoperable tumors operable and provide important prognostic information at an&#xD;
      individual patient level based on response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the recommendation of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline,&#xD;
      patients with inoperable breast cancer, such as inflammatory breast cancer, N3 nodal disease&#xD;
      and T4 tumors are candidates for preoperative systemic therapy. As for those operable&#xD;
      patients with HER2-positive disease and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), if T ≥2 or N&#xD;
      ≥1, or large primary tumor relative to breast size in a patient who desires breast&#xD;
      conservation, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also preferred. Based on the results of NSABP-27&#xD;
      and Aberdeen clinical trials, chemotherapeutic drugs including taxanes (such as docetaxel,&#xD;
      paclitaxel) and anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin, epirubicin) have become the standard&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens for early operable patients and for HER2-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer patients, anthracyclines combined with cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel is&#xD;
      mostly common used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited to myelosuppression and bone marrow repair, conventional chemotherapy cycle is&#xD;
      usually set once every 3-4 weeks. Recent years, the application of granulocyte colony&#xD;
      stimulating factor (G-CSF), which can shorten the recovery time of leukocytes, enables&#xD;
      dose-dense chemotherapy (maximum tolerable dose, every 2 weeks as a cycle) to become a&#xD;
      treatment option for high-risk patients. The concept of dose-dense chemotherapy is based on a&#xD;
      mathematical model developed by Norton and Simon, and relies on an understanding of&#xD;
      Gompertzian model of tumor growth. Gompertzian kinetics explain that human neoplasms do not&#xD;
      grow in an exponential fashion, instead the cell-doubling time becomes progressively longer&#xD;
      as the tumor growth. Thus, cancer treatments that reduce the size of a tumor can promote&#xD;
      faster tumor regrowth between treatments indirectly. So Norton-Simon hypothesis suggests that&#xD;
      the most effective strategy is to expose the tumor to cytotoxic agents as frequently as&#xD;
      possible to minimize regrowth between cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CALGB 9471 used a randomized, 2×2 factorial design to prospectively compare sequential&#xD;
      doxorubicin, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide with concurrent doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      followed by paclitaxel, and to compare dose-dense schedules with conventional schedules. A&#xD;
      total of 2005 node-positive, previously untreated patients were enrolled. At a median&#xD;
      follow-up of 36 months, dose-dense treatment significantly improved disease-free survival&#xD;
      (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with conventionally scheduled treatment. The GIM2&#xD;
      study also demonstrated that dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy (FEC-P and EC-P every 2 weeks a&#xD;
      cycle) improved DFS and OS compared with standard interval chemotherapy (every 3 weeks a&#xD;
      cycle). However, the studies on dose-dense chemotherapy is mostly based on postoperative&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy. We aim to conduct a prospective, randomized, open-label, multi-center&#xD;
      clinical study to compare the efficacy and safety of dose-dense chemotherapy (dd&#xD;
      epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by dd paclitaxel (P)) and conventional chemotherapy&#xD;
      (epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel (T)) as preoperative neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the treatment of HER2-negative breast cancer in Chinese population.&#xD;
