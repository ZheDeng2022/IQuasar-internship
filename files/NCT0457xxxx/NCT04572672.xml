  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive urgency (HT urgency) is an alarm sign of uncontrolled hypertension. It can be&#xD;
      aggravated by nonadherent to medication and psychosocial stress. Mindfulness is beneficial&#xD;
      for reducing stress, while deep and slow breathing is effective for blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      lowering. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of pursed-lip breathing with&#xD;
      number counting (PLB with NC) that promotes mindfulness and a deep/slow breathing pattern on&#xD;
      BP and heart rate (HR) in the HT urgency patients.&#xD;

      This was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Patients aged between 18-80 years old,&#xD;
      diagnosed with HT urgency, who presented at the emergency room of Srinagarind hospital (a&#xD;
      1000-bed, tertiary-care level university hospital), Khon Kaen University between September&#xD;
      1st, 2019 to June 30th, 2020, were enrolled. Those with cardiac arrhythmias, acute HF, acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes, acute stroke, acute respiratory failure, alteration of consciousness, and&#xD;
      pregnant women were excluded. This study was approved by the Khon Kaen University Ethical&#xD;
      Review Board in Human Research (HE611586). All patients gave their written informed consent&#xD;
      before the enrollment.HT urgency was defined as SBP &gt;180 mmHg and/or DBP &gt;110 mmHg without&#xD;
      any signs or symptoms of target organ damages.&#xD;
