    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to evaluate the impact of virtual reality therapy on&#xD;
      mitigating heart failure pain in hospitalized patients with heart failure and compare this&#xD;
      impact to that of 2-dimensional guided imagery distraction therapy.&#xD;

      Through ongoing collaborative work between the MedStar Heart and Vascular Institute Advanced&#xD;
      Heart Failure clinical team at our hospital and the MedStar Washington Hospital Center&#xD;
      Palliative Care team, the research team identifies hospitalized patients with a primary&#xD;
      diagnosis of heart failure (ACC/AHA stage C or D). Subjects will be considered for enrollment&#xD;
      in this study if able to provide consent, at least 18 years old, and report moderate-severe&#xD;
      pain (at least 4 out of 10 where pain is rated on a Likert scale between zero and 10) in the&#xD;
      previous 24 hours. Subjects will be excluded if they already use VR for personal use, have&#xD;
      intractable nausea/vomiting, history of motion sickness, history of seizures or epilepsy,&#xD;
      have cranial structure abnormalities that prevent use of VR headset, are currently enrolled&#xD;
      in a palliative care or pain management study, and/or are on contact isolation. Institutional&#xD;
      review board approval will be sought and informed consent will be conducted before enrolling&#xD;
      every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consenting to participate, in addition to usual pharmacologic pain management, 128&#xD;
      patients should be randomized with a 1:1 ratio to receive either one 10-minute VR session, or&#xD;
      one 10-minute 2-dimensional guided-imagery session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR sessions will be administered using the Facebook (Facebook Inc., Menlo Park, CA) Oculus GO&#xD;
      VR. The VR software that will be used is the Forest of Serenity (Holosphere VR®, Birmingham,&#xD;
      UK) application. The guided-imagery session depicts a peaceful walk through a forest with&#xD;
      instrumental background music and 2-dimensional imagery. Patients will watch the guided&#xD;
      imagery video on a portable tablet for 10 minutes, the same duration as the VR intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in both arms will continue to receive standard pharmacologic pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the nature of the compared interventions, subjects and researchers cannot be&#xD;
      blinded to intervention. Our primary outcome measure will determine the impact of distraction&#xD;
      therapy (either VR therapy or 2-dimensional guided imagery) on self-reported pain experience.&#xD;
      Self-reported pain experience remains the standard for clinical pain research. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will measure impact of each distraction therapy on general distress level, general&#xD;
      quality of life, and satisfaction with pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent and randomization, subjects will complete surveys on electronic tablets to&#xD;
      provide baseline data on pain scores, general distress, general quality of life, and&#xD;
      satisfaction with pain management. Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short&#xD;
      Form (BPI-SF, modified to assess symptoms in the last 24 hours) that includes a 0-10 Likert&#xD;
      scale for self-reported pain as well as information about pain location, quality, and&#xD;
      interference of pain on daily living. General distress will be measured using the NCCN&#xD;
      Distress Thermometer (a Likert scale measuring from No Distress to Extreme Distress, where&#xD;
      &quot;distress&quot; is defined by the patient; we will not include the tool's associated Problem List&#xD;
      due to overlap with other survey questions and attempt to avoid survey fatigue). General&#xD;
      quality of life will be measured using the Functional Assessment in Chronic Illness-Therapy&#xD;
      in Palliative Care 14-item (FACIT-Pal 14) scale that measures non-pain symptoms and general&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of baseline surveys, subjects will be administered either VR therapy for 10&#xD;
      minutes or 2-dimensional guided imagery for 10 minutes. For both arms, a member of the&#xD;
      research team will educate the patient on the technology and assure comfort with use,&#xD;
      remaining outside the room but nearby during the actual 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the distraction therapy, subjects will be re-surveyed BPI-SF, FACIT-Pal 14, and&#xD;
      Distress Thermometer (Aim 1). Both groups will also be surveyed regarding acceptance of and&#xD;
      satisfaction with the distraction therapy intervention itself and its thematic content (Aim&#xD;
      2). Patients randomized to VR therapy will be surveyed regarding level of immersion of the VR&#xD;
      experience. In order to evaluate any residual effects of the distraction therapy, enrollees&#xD;
      will be re-surveyed BPI-SF, FACIT-Pal 14, Distress Thermometer, and pain management&#xD;
      satisfaction questions on the following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will reach 80% power to detect a difference of 1 unit in the pain score measure&#xD;
      between the 2 groups using a two-sample t-test with equal variance at a two-sided alpha=0.05&#xD;
      and assuming a within-group standard deviation of 2 for each group. Sample size calculations&#xD;
      were conducted in PASS.&#xD;
