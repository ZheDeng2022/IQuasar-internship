      This study is a comparative, single-center, non-randomized comparative study. After IRB&#xD;
      approval, the study will be conducted in three Phases. The Fresenius 5008S BPM Module and&#xD;
      Cuffs will be evaluated on a minimum of 120 subjects. Three reports will be generated and&#xD;
      submitted to different regulatory bodies with the following minimum subject demographics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: The submission to the United States Food and Drug Administration will include&#xD;
           85 adult and adolescents ages 13 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: The submission to European agencies will contain 50 adult and adolescents ages&#xD;
           13 and older and 35 pediatric subjects ages 3-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3: The submission to the China Food and Drug Administration will contain 73 adult&#xD;
           and adolescents ages 13 and older and 12 pediatric subjects ages 3-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject test is expected to take up to 1 hour. Data collection is expected to take 3-6&#xD;
      weeks for Phase 1. Phase 2 and 3 are expected to take an additional 2-4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Auscultator will have a normal audiogram before the study begins. All experimenters will&#xD;
      review the protocol prior to test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing will be conducted under normal office environment conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject or their legally authorized representative will be provided an IRB approved&#xD;
      Informed Consent. Additionally, subject ages 7 to 17 years, a discussion about the study will&#xD;
      be conducted to complete the Assent process for their participation. As applicable, subjects&#xD;
      / authorized representatives will be told about any new information that might change their&#xD;
      decision to participate. Representatives / subjects who have completed the informed consent&#xD;
      and health questionnaire form and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study if they meet desired blood pressure demographics. For Phase 3, an attempt will be made&#xD;
      to enroll a person of Chinese origin in each of the cuffs used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two trained observers will listen to the Korotkoff sounds at the brachial artery of the arm.&#xD;
      The reference blood pressure measurements by the observers will be performed sequentially&#xD;
      with the Device Under Test. The Device Under Test memory will be cleared prior to the next&#xD;
      determination. In some cases, this may mean powering down the device to clear the previous&#xD;
      readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood pressure measurements will be such that a reference measurement will be alternated&#xD;
      with the Device Under Test measurement. The auscultator will wait a minimum of 60 seconds&#xD;
      between each blood pressure determination. Each observer's recording of observations of the&#xD;
      reference sphygmomanometer shall not be visible to the other observer. The observers will&#xD;
      record the exact measurement heard during auscultation and will not round the blood pressure&#xD;
      readings. The readings of the Device Under Test shall not be visible to either of these&#xD;
      observers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observers will complete 1 or 2 initial baseline blood pressure measurements and then 3 to&#xD;
      8 NIBP measurements to be collected for the Accuracy evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Phase 1 and 2, any pair of observers' determinations with a difference greater than&#xD;
           4 mmHg shall be excluded per ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Phase 3, any pair of observers' determinations with a difference greater than 10&#xD;
           mmHg shall be excluded and 90% of the observers' determinations shall be within 5 mmHg&#xD;
           per YY 0670-2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any determinations are excluded, additional pair(s) of determinations shall be taken to&#xD;
      ensure that the needed number of valid test-reference pairs is available (up to a maximum of&#xD;
      8 paired readings) A minimum of 3 valid paired NIBP measurements are needed for the Accuracy&#xD;
      analysis. Each subject test is expected to take up to 60 minutes for the enrollment / data&#xD;
      collection process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no deviations expected from this investigation plan, should deviations be needed,&#xD;
      discussions will be conducted with the sponsoring company, Principal investigator and the IRB&#xD;
      will be notified.&#xD;
