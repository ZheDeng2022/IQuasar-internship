    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are 1) to compare the efficacy and safety of conventional myotomy&#xD;
      (long myotomy) and modified myotomy (short myotomy) in the treatment of type I/II achalasia&#xD;
      patients diagnosed according to Chicago Classification; 2) to compare the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of conventional myotomy (circular myotomy) and modified myotomy (full-thickness myotomy) in&#xD;
      the treatment of type I/II achalasia patients; 3) to compare the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      conventional myotomy (non-tailored myotomy) and modified myotomy (tailored myotomy) in the&#xD;
      treatment of type III achalasia patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a novel clinical technique used to treat achalasia. The&#xD;
      conventional POEM myotomy length averages 8 to 10 cm (4-6 cm in the esophagus, 2-4cm in the&#xD;
      LES, 2cm in the cardia &amp; 6-8 cm above and 2 cm below the gastroesophageal junction [GEJ]) for&#xD;
      typical achalasia (Chicago classification I, II), but there is no guideline or expert&#xD;
      consensus with regard to minimal myotomy length recommended in POEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the facts that achalasia is a primary motor disorder of LES dysfunction, patients&#xD;
      with type I/II achalasia may achieve a satisfactory outcome with shorter myotomy in procedure&#xD;
      of modified POEM, which only focused on the forced relaxation of the LES. Recently, some&#xD;
      retrospective studies have suggested that shorter myotomy is comparable with longer myotomy&#xD;
      for treating achalasia with regard to clinical efficacy and has the advantage of shorter&#xD;
      procedure time, which needs to be further confirmed by more prospective studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms with the International Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy Survey, a longer myotomy is&#xD;
      recommended for patients with type III achalasia. The length of myotomy in type III achalasia&#xD;
      can be gauged by high-resolution manometry (HRM). Recent research showed that postoperative&#xD;
      Eckardt score was significantly improved in the tailored group (myotomy length informed by&#xD;
      HRM) versus non-tailored for type III achalasia, but this study was limited by its&#xD;
      retrospective nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is still no conclusion on the thickness of muscle bundle dissection recommended during&#xD;
      POEM. Selective circular muscle myotomy is designed to avoid gastroesophageal reflux (GER)&#xD;
      postoperatively and decrease morbidity during POEM. But one meta-analysis showed that&#xD;
      Heller's surgery could keep patients in long-time remission, mainly because of its&#xD;
      full-thickness muscle bundle dissection to make sure of persist relaxation of LES. A&#xD;
      retrospective study comparing the outcomes of full-thickness and circular muscle myotomy&#xD;
      showed no differences in efficacy, GER or adverse events, although the procedural time was&#xD;
      shorter in the full thickness myotomy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further randomized controlled trials are warranted to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      different modified myotomy approaches in POEM for patients with achalasia.&#xD;
