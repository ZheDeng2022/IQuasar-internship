  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the mechanisms of change that are activated when individuals receive&#xD;
      a treatment that targets their weakness and the mechanisms activated when the treatment&#xD;
      capitalize on their strength. Patients will be assigned to one of two types of&#xD;
      psychotherapies in treating people with a major depression disorder, expressive-supportive&#xD;
      vs. emotion-focused treatment. Their ability to benefit from treatment based on their&#xD;
      pre-treatment levels of insight and emotional processing will be examined. This is a&#xD;
      four-month protocol, with a 2 year follow up period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and twenty-four patients suffering from major depressive disorder will be&#xD;
      randomized to participate in 16 sessions of either supportive-expressive therapy or&#xD;
      emotion-focused therapy. The two treatments are theorized to differ in their main mechanism&#xD;
      of change: supportive-expressive therapy places emphasis on insight as its main mechanism of&#xD;
      change, and emotion-focused therapy places emphasis on emotional processing as its main&#xD;
      mechanism of change. Both can serve as strength- or weakness-focused treatments, based on the&#xD;
      patient's baseline levels of insight and emotional processing. Importantly, this study will&#xD;
      employ multiple complementary methods, which will include session-by-session self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires from both patient and therapist, as well as interdisciplinary measures based&#xD;
      on hormonal and acoustic measures, cognitive tasks, clinician interviews, and behavioral&#xD;
      coding systems to complement the self-report measures. In addition, prior the beginning of&#xD;
      treatment patients will complete diaries via mobile survey application. The findings will&#xD;
      contribute to the research on personalized mechanisms of change and can help clinicians focus&#xD;
      on more efficient treatment delivery, adapted to given subpopulations of patients, according&#xD;
      to their strengths and weaknesses. If a mechanism most likely to stimulate change for a&#xD;
      subpopulation is identified, a corresponding treatment can be chosen that is most likely to&#xD;
      activate that particular mechanism and by that improve the rate of patients' respondent to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
