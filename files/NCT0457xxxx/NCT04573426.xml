    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of weight stigma on emotional&#xD;
      functioning and biomarkers of inflammation among overweight and obese women; and to determine&#xD;
      the degree to which acetaminophen moderates the stigma-related effects. Participants will&#xD;
      provide blood spot and saliva samples upon arrival, and then be randomly assigned to consume&#xD;
      either 1,000mg of acetaminophen in liquid form, or a placebo solution. Participants then will&#xD;
      complete a series of questionnaires assessing a variety of relevant psychological and&#xD;
      behavioral constructs. After this participants will be randomly assigned to read one of two&#xD;
      shorts stories and answer a series of questions about their reaction to the story. Finally,&#xD;
      participants will answer another series of questionnaires and provide a second saliva sample.&#xD;
      Participants will first be adult women in the Columbus, Ohio and surrounding areas with body&#xD;
      mass indices considered overweight or obese. A smaller cohort of women with normal weight&#xD;
      will be recruited at a later time for purposes of comparison.&#xD;

    <description>The Need Threat Scale is a 12-item measure designed to assess one's need for belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence, each of which represent a subscale of the measure. Respondents indicate how they are feeling right now using a five-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much so.&quot; In addition to four subscale scores, a composite score is calculated by averaging responses across the 12 items, with lower scores reflecting less needs satisfaction (i.e., more need threat).
