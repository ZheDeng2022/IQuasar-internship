    <textblock>
      This study uses a prospective cohort design to investigate if the seasonal influenza vaccine&#xD;
      is equally effective when given early and late before the proceeding influenza season. All&#xD;
      health care workers will be vaccinated for seasonal influenza either 3 months before or 1&#xD;
      month prior to the start of the influenza season. HCWs that consent to take part in the study&#xD;
      will have 4 blood samples taken for an antibody check. The initial antibody checks will be&#xD;
      done just prior to vaccination as well as 2 weeks after vaccination. Subsequent samples will&#xD;
      be taken at the peak of influenza season and at the end of the influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCWs that develop ILI during the course of the influenza season will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire and oropharyngeal self-swab. HCWs will also provide exhaled breath samples and&#xD;
      wear a mask in order to evaluate novel non-invasive methods for diagnosis of influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza positive and negative inpatients identified through the University of Leicester's&#xD;
      laboratory system will also be asked to provide breath samples to evaluate this technique for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of influenza.&#xD;

      Recruitment, Screening and Eligibility Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants (University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, UHL staff) will be&#xD;
      contacted by email to advertise and explain the study. The email will be part of the routine&#xD;
      seasonal influenza vaccination emails which are sent out each year to remind UHL staff to be&#xD;
      immunised. In addition, the investigators will advertise by posters in the high staff traffic&#xD;
      areas, e.g. the restaurant, and our Occupational Health Team will assist with this&#xD;
      advertising of the study. The investigators expect some Health care workers (HCWs) to become&#xD;
      aware of the study through word of mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have two phases of recruitment. For the month of September for the 'early'&#xD;
      vaccination group, and from mid-November to mid-December for the 'late' vaccination group -&#xD;
      the exact timings may vary depending on when the inactivated influenza vaccines are received&#xD;
      and the seasonality of the virus, as all recruitment will be completed prior to the start of&#xD;
      the influenza season. Allocation to the two vaccination groups will not be randomised; it&#xD;
      will be the HCWs decision if they would like to have the vaccination either early or late.&#xD;
      There will be a limit of 200 HCWs recruited to each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who express an interest in taking part in the study will be given an information&#xD;
      sheet either in person or via email. Following this the investigators will give them as long&#xD;
      as they need to decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the individual agrees&#xD;
      to participate, a member of the research team will screen and confirm eligibility.&#xD;
      Participants will only be recruited if all criteria are satisfied. At this time arrangements&#xD;
      will be made for staff members to attend an initial appointment at the Research Space at the&#xD;
      LRI. Recruitment in the research area will comply with the current social distancing measures&#xD;
      in place at UHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this initial appointment the study will be explained to staff members in groups. A member&#xD;
      of the research team will then seek written informed consent as detailed below from each HCW&#xD;
      individually. If an individual has more questions about the study another study team member&#xD;
      will be allowed to support and facilitate informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of inpatients Clinicians on the acute medical wards will be notified prior to the&#xD;
      start of the influenza season via email and posters, in clinical areas, of the study&#xD;
      involving inpatients with (influenza like illness) ILI. University Hospitals of Leicester&#xD;
      Virology department routinely call the clinical team of positive influenza cases in&#xD;
      inpatients during the influenza season. When the clinical team then goes to explain this&#xD;
      diagnosis to the patient they would also make them aware of the study and provide them with a&#xD;
      participant information leaflet. Following this the investigators will give the patient as&#xD;
      long as they need to decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the individual&#xD;
      agrees to participate they will inform a member of the clinical team who will then notify the&#xD;
      research team. A member of the research team will attend the ward to screen and confirm&#xD;
      eligibility. Participants will only be recruited if all criteria are satisfied. Using&#xD;
      laboratory results data, twenty inpatients with confirmed influenza-negative swabs will also&#xD;
      be recruited in the same way, as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following activities will be carried out at each visit and recorded in the CRF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be enrolled providing they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria and&#xD;
           give fully informed, written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then be assigned a study number&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a short questionnaire which will include demographic&#xD;
           information: Age, sex, ethnicity, job role, medical co-morbidities, regular medications,&#xD;
           smoking history, history of influenza infections and influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect 10ml clotted blood pre-immunisation for baseline antibodies. Process blood and&#xD;
           store serum for serology assays. The influenza vaccine will be administered in the&#xD;
           normal way.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given a thermometer, two influenza self-sampling kits (i.e. a swab&#xD;
           and a viral transport medium tube with a Microbiology sample bag), and two information&#xD;
           forms that they will complete in the event that they develop any influenza-like illness&#xD;
           (ILI). An ILI will be defined as per the WHO case definition as a fever of &gt;37.8oC and&#xD;
           cough with onset within the last 10 days. They will be shown how to operate the&#xD;
           thermometer, take a self-swab (i.e. a throat swab), and how to secure the swab in the&#xD;
           sampling tube. They will also be show how to complete an ILI event form (ILIef) -&#xD;
           briefly recording the timing and nature of their ILI symptoms/signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: 3 weeks after baseline visit (+ or - 7days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect 10ml clotted blood for serology. Process blood and store serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to provide breath samples, this will act as a control against&#xD;
           which breath samples that occurred during ILI will be compared Visit 3: Peak influenza&#xD;
           season usually January to February (+ or - 30 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect 10ml clotted blood for serology. Process blood and store serum. Visit 4: End of&#xD;
           influenza Season usually April to May (+ or - 30 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect 10ml clotted blood for serology. Process blood and store serum. ILI event study&#xD;
           visit Study participants will contact the study team by email or phone to alert them&#xD;
           that an ILI event has occurred, and to arrange for a study team member to collect the&#xD;
           swab and ILIef from them, as soon as possible after it has been taken, for appropriate&#xD;
           storage (in a -80oC freezer) until tested. If study participants are at home when they&#xD;
           develop ILI they will be asked to complete the self-swab and ILef. The swab will be&#xD;
           doubled bagged and collected by a member of the research team in accordance with the&#xD;
           transport guidance issued in the Government's guidance on COVID-19: safe handling and&#xD;
           processing for samples in laboratories in accordance with UN3373, packing instructions&#xD;
           650. Swabs will be delivered to the UHL virology laboratory and processed according to&#xD;
           standard operating procedures (see Section 8.7.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be reiterated to the study participant that results of these swab results will be&#xD;
      emailed and phoned through to them along with the latest occupational health advice. They&#xD;
      will be advised to follow occupational health policy for ILI whilst awaiting the swab&#xD;
      results, report sickness in the normal way and contact their GP if further medical advice&#xD;
      regarding this current period of illness is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contents of the ILIef will be entered into the participants case report form (CRF), no&#xD;
      personal information will be included. These details will be used in the interpretation of&#xD;
      the viral sequencing and antibody titres, performed at WHO Melbourne.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study participant is at work when they develop ILI they will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      breath sample and mask sample for the detection of influenza using novel methods prior to&#xD;
      leaving work. Sampling materials will be brought to where the HCW is located but if this&#xD;
      could not happen straight away then the HCW would be told to follow occupational health&#xD;
      advice and go home. Specimens collected from these processes are detailed in section 8.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient breath sample Inpatients will be approached as per the usual UHL infection control&#xD;
      policy. Only patients who have results available for a recent throat swab tested for common&#xD;
      respiratory pathogens will be approached. COVID-19 positive wards will not be involved in&#xD;
      recruitment instead inpatients with Influenza and other respiratory viruses will be recruited&#xD;
      from COVID-19 negative wards. Patients who are confirmed influenza positive are usually&#xD;
      managed in side rooms as per policy. In all cases, the patient will not be required to come&#xD;
      into contact with the analysis equipment, as the breath capture and analytical processes are&#xD;
      separate. Mask sampling will not be undertaken on patients who require oxygen therapy via a&#xD;
      face mask. Once consented to the study one member of the research team will approach the&#xD;
      patient with the masks, syringes and mouthpieces needed for breath sample collection. A&#xD;
      repeat throat swab will also be taken at this time so accurate comparison can take place&#xD;
      between the novel diagnostic methods and current practise. All three breath sampling methods,&#xD;
      where possible, will be used. Once the samples have been collected they will be placed in a&#xD;
      biological hazard bag and taken to the analysis machines. Swabs and mask samples will be&#xD;
      transported to the virology Laboratory at Leicester Royal Infirmary for processing. The&#xD;
      breath capture equipment (syringes and disposable mouth pieces) will be disposed of in the&#xD;
      normal way for clinical waste. TD tubes and the Bio-VOC sampler will be double bagged and&#xD;
      will be decontaminated. This is the only study visit required by inpatients and no further&#xD;
      follow up is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-swabs The swabs will be delivered to the Department of Clinical Microbiology at&#xD;
      University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust where they will be handled under Cat 2 (BSL-2)&#xD;
      conditions. They will be vortexed, and swabs discarded leaving the inoculated virus transport&#xD;
      medium (VTM). The VTM tubes will be tested on a standard diagnostic assay (routinely used for&#xD;
      hospital patient testing) to check for the presence of influenza (as many different&#xD;
      respiratory viruses can cause an 'influenza-like illness'). If influenza is detected, then an&#xD;
      aliquot of this VTM will be sent to WHO Melbourne, along with the serum samples, for viral&#xD;
      sequencing of influenza. VTM will be transported to the WHO laboratory under UN3733/Category&#xD;
      B regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VOC breath analysis All three analysis platforms will use the same basic collection approach.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to not to have eaten or drank anything at least 30 minutes before&#xD;
      breath sampling. Prior to sampling swill their mouth with water which they can then swallow -&#xD;
      and then provide three non-forced breath samples by exhaling into disposable mouthpieces for&#xD;
      3-5 seconds. Researchers will wear PPE dictated by local trust policy at UHL for collecting&#xD;
      nasal and oral swabs. Disposable clinical gloves will be used for all procedures. The&#xD;
      analytical devices will be kept on the ward or in a research area away from direct patient&#xD;
      contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For GC-IMS analysis, the mouthpiece is attached to a 10cm long plastic tube. As the patient&#xD;
      exhales into the tube, the researcher will draw a breath sample into a 5ml syringe part way&#xD;
      down the tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will then be injected from the syringe by the researcher into the BreathSpecTM&#xD;
      GC-IMS device for analysis. Any infectious material contained within the sample will be&#xD;
      destroyed by being heated to over 60°C as part of the analytical process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eNose uses a commercial CE marked breath capture unit, the Markes Bio-VOC. The unit holds&#xD;
      129ml of breath, comes sealed and only opened when ready to use, and is disposable. The user&#xD;
      fits a cardboard mouthpiece to the unit prior to sampling. Once the patient has breathed into&#xD;
      the unit the mouthpiece is removed and a syringe fitting is added, which connects to the&#xD;
      eNose. The syringe is then depressed and the sample is analysed. Analysis time is under 5&#xD;
      minutes. The eNose machine will be decontaminated at the end of each day of use according to&#xD;
      the manufacture's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For GC-MS analysis, a further breath sample is again collected using the Markes Bio-VOC unit&#xD;
      as above. Once the sample is collected it will be transferred onto a thermal desorption (TD)&#xD;
      tube (typically 89mm x 6.4mm). The inner walls of the tube are coated with an absorbent layer&#xD;
      to which breath chemicals adhere. The TD tube is placed at the end of the Bio-VOC unit and&#xD;
      captured air is pushed through the tube. Once completed, the ends of the tubes are sealed&#xD;
      with end caps. A validated decontamination process is then undertaken for the Bio-VOC sampler&#xD;
      and TD tubes through a long / high heat cycle to ensure the virus is killed off. The&#xD;
      decontaminated TD tubes will be kept in storage boxes in the research area of Leicester Royal&#xD;
      Infirmary for transport to the University of Warwick for analysis and final disposal, as per&#xD;
      a pre-defined Material Transfer Agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the GC-IMS analysis will be uploaded regularly from the BreathSpecTM onto a&#xD;
      DataSync shared drive and downloaded by analysts at the University of Warwick. No&#xD;
      identifiable data will be associated with this data, only a study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mask sampling Mask sampling consists of participants wearing a modified face mask (flat&#xD;
      surgical, duckbilled or FFP1) which contains up to 5 strips of 3D printed Polyvinyl alcohol&#xD;
      (PVA) for up to 60 minutes whilst being observed by a member of the research team. The&#xD;
      investigators will provide training, support and personal protective equipment to research&#xD;
      staff obtaining samples and agree protocols for local processing. Prior to use masks are&#xD;
      sterilised and kept in sealed sample bags, once worn they are placed back in these bags and&#xD;
      sealed. They will be transported to the UHL Virology Laboratory in line with current Risk&#xD;
      Assessments and Standard Operating procedures concerning transporting hazardous materials.&#xD;
      Viral RNA will be extracted and quantified from the PVA strips within the masks using&#xD;
      Real-Time quantitative PCR. The processing of the PVA strips requires them to be dissolved&#xD;
      into water, from which the RNA virus is extracted and analysed using molecular methods. The&#xD;
      masks and bags will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum testing and viral sequencing On each of the scheduled days requiring serum samples, the&#xD;
      clotted blood will be stored at 2oC to 8oC and centrifuged within 24 hours at the Research&#xD;
      Space, LRI. Sera will be stored in cryovials, with all cryovials labelled with the&#xD;
      participant's study number, visit number and date of collection at the Research Space, LRI.&#xD;
      Samples will be stored frozen at -80 oC until shipment. One set of cryovials will be sent to&#xD;
      the WHO reference laboratory in Melbourne once all samples have been collected. The other set&#xD;
      of cryovials will be stored as a safety measure in case of transport issues. With participant&#xD;
      consent, any unused serum samples will be stored for future ethically approved research and&#xD;
      shared with other research collaborators in other academic institutions and industry partners&#xD;
      inside and outside of the UK for future research. Serum will be used for Hemagglutination&#xD;
      inhibition and microneutralization assays and once all samples have been processed results&#xD;
      will be sent back to the research team at Leicester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) and Microneutralisation (MN) assays, together with&#xD;
      influenza viral sequencing will be performed at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference&#xD;
      and Research on Influenza (VIDRL), Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, 792&#xD;
      Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia.&#xD;
