  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of the U.S. population sometimes or always experiences loneliness, which is&#xD;
      alarming given that loneliness confers risk for negative mental and physical health outcomes.&#xD;
      Extensive research suggests loneliness is characterized by subjective isolation: many lonely&#xD;
      individuals maintain a number of relationships but still report feeling lonely. The goal of&#xD;
      this proposal is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging to reveal how the brain&#xD;
      represents our subjective connection to and isolation from other people, which will&#xD;
      ultimately inform optimal ways to intervene to reduce loneliness.&#xD;

      Extensive research suggests loneliness is characterized by subjective isolation: many lonely&#xD;
      individuals maintain a number of relationships but still report feeling lonely. Thus, a&#xD;
      neurobiological account of loneliness requires that we understand how the brain represents&#xD;
      our subjective connections to others and how loneliness alters these representations. The&#xD;
      long-term goal of this proposal is to identify how subjective isolation is represented in the&#xD;
      brain in order to identify novel ways to intervene on this representation to attenuate&#xD;
      loneliness. We propose that the brain organizes our representations of people based on our&#xD;
      subjective connection to them and that loneliness systematically alters this organization. In&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether subjective closeness organizes self and other&#xD;
      representations in the brain. While undergoing fMRI, participants will complete tasks in&#xD;
      which they reflect on themselves and other people. They will also report on their subjective&#xD;
      closeness to the other people. We will test whether the brain organizes mental&#xD;
      representations of the self and one's own social network members based on subjective&#xD;
      closeness. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how loneliness modulates self and other&#xD;
      representations in the brain. In Specific, Exploratory Aim 3, we will determine the cognitive&#xD;
      consequences of altered self and other representation in loneliness. Our proposal is&#xD;
      imperative for ultimately revealing neurocognitive mechanisms to intervene on to reduce&#xD;
      loneliness.&#xD;
