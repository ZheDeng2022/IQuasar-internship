  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurotrophic keratitis (NK) is a condition where the cornea, or clear outer covering of the&#xD;
      eye, has reduced sensation due to a variety of reasons. In more advanced cases of NK, the&#xD;
      cornea can develop an area of thinning called an ulcer. The purpose of this research is to&#xD;
      find out if Oxervate (cenegermin-bkbj 0.002%) an FDA-approved treatment for neurotrophic&#xD;
      corneal ulcers leads to an increase in thickness of the corneal stroma (middle layer of the&#xD;
      cornea) during and after treatment of a neurotrophic ulcer. Corneal thickness will be&#xD;
      measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-contact imaging device used&#xD;
      routinely in ophthalmology examinations. Corneal sensation will also be measured during and&#xD;
      after treatment with a device called a Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer to see if the treatment&#xD;
      increases corneal sensation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neurotrophic keratitis (NK) is a condition where the cornea, or clear outer covering of the&#xD;
      eye, has reduced sensation due to a variety of reasons such as previous surgery or infection.&#xD;
      In more advanced cases of NK, the cornea can develop an area of thinning called an ulcer. If&#xD;
      the cornea becomes too thin, it is at risk for perforation or rupture, which requires&#xD;
      extensive surgery to save vision and the eye. This risk can last for many years even after&#xD;
      the ulcer is no longer active. The purpose of this research is to find out if Oxervate&#xD;
      (cenegermin-bkbj 0.002%) an FDA-approved treatment for neurotrophic corneal ulcers leads to&#xD;
      an increase in thickness of the corneal stroma (middle layer of the cornea) during and after&#xD;
      treatment of a neurotrophic ulcer. The FDA trials demonstrated that Oxervate does lead to&#xD;
      more rapid healing of the epithelium (thin surface layer) of the cornea, but we are still&#xD;
      unsure if it increases the thickness of the stroma, which is the strongest part of the&#xD;
      cornea. Corneal thickness will be measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT), a&#xD;
      non-contact imaging device used routinely in ophthalmology examinations. Corneal sensation&#xD;
      will also be measured during and after treatment with a device called a Cochet-Bonnet&#xD;
      esthesiometer to see if the treatment increases corneal sensation. If treatment with Oxervate&#xD;
      increases corneal sensation, then this decreases the risk of future ulcer formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 10 subjects will take part in this research.&#xD;
