    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial for which the primary objective is to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      an online training program on physiotherapist's self-reported confidence in knowledge about&#xD;
      weight management for people with osteoarthritis. 80 physiotherapists will be recruited into&#xD;
      the study and randomized to one of two arms a) online training program (access to training&#xD;
      program for 6 weeks) or b) control group (no access to online training program during the&#xD;
      study). Questionnaires will be completed by all participants at baseline, and again at the&#xD;
      end of the 6 week intervention period. A biostatistician will analyse blinded, de-identified&#xD;
      data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centre for Health Exercise and Sports Medicine at the University of Melbourne have&#xD;
      developed a 6-module online training program designed to up-skill physiotherapists in weight&#xD;
      management for osteoarthritis patients. This is a randomised controlled trial evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the training program on physiotherapist's confidence in weight management&#xD;
      for osteoarthritis patients. After providing informed consent and baseline data,&#xD;
      physiotherapists will be randomized to either a) an online training program or b) control&#xD;
      group. Those randomized to the online training group will be provided access to the a&#xD;
      6-module weight management training program and have six weeks to complete all the modules.&#xD;
      Those randomized to the control group will receive no intervention. At baseline and six&#xD;
      weeks, primary and secondary outcome measures will be completed in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question is: What are the effects of an online training program designed to&#xD;
      up-skill physiotherapists in weight management for people with osteoarthritis? The primary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the effects of an online training program on physiotherapist's&#xD;
      self-reported confidence in knowledge about weight management for people with osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 participants will be recruited and randomization into the two study groups. To detect an&#xD;
      effect size of 0.8 with 80% power and two sided significance level of 5%, 26 participants are&#xD;
      required per group. Assuming a 35% loss to follow up, this will increase the same size to 40&#xD;
      per group (80 in total). The study will be conducted through The University of Melbourne.&#xD;
      Participants will be able to access the training remotely in their own time and access all&#xD;
      outcome measures online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biostatistician will analyse blinded, de-identified data. Analyses will be conducted with&#xD;
      participants in assigned groups, with multiple imputation to account for missing data if&#xD;
      required. Changes in self-reported confidence scores (primary outcome) will be compared&#xD;
      between groups at 6 weeks using linear regression (with group as a factor) adjusting for&#xD;
      baseline scores and the stratifying variables. Similar analyses will be conducted for&#xD;
      secondary outcomes measured at baseline and 6 weeks. Process measures will be described in&#xD;
      terms of mean (SD)/median (IQ range) or number (frequency). Standard diagnostic plots will be&#xD;
      used to verify model assumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an imbalance is noted between groups for relevant baseline characteristics, sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted including these characteristics as covariates in the models&#xD;
      assessing treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biostatistician will also conduct planned exploratory analyses to investigate potential&#xD;
      moderators that could influence the effect of the training at 6 weeks. Pre-identified&#xD;
      potential moderators include practice location (predominantly private vs predominantly&#xD;
      public), baseline self rated confidence in weight management and years of clinical&#xD;
      experience. To assess the moderation of the effect of randomised treatment group by the&#xD;
      binary potential moderator (practice location), an interaction term between randomised group&#xD;
      and the potential moderator, as well as terms for the randomised group and the potential&#xD;
      moderator, will be included in the outcome regression model. To assess the moderation of the&#xD;
      effect of randomised treatment group by continuous potential moderators (self rated&#xD;
      confidence in weight management and years of clinical experience), the multivariable&#xD;
      fractional polynomial interaction approach will be applied. This approach allows for&#xD;
      nonlinear functional forms of the continuous potential moderator to be included in the&#xD;
      regression model for outcomes, with the potential for separate nonlinear functional forms in&#xD;
      each treatment group.&#xD;
