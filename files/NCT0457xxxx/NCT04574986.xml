  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy and postpartum are recognized as periods of psychic fragility. However, the&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders of women that can emerge during these periods are underdiagnosed and&#xD;
      have consequences in particular on the development of the child, his relationship with his&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for an early diagnosis to allow appropriate treatment seems to be essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pregnancy monitoring is centered on the somatic and little on psychological evaluation of&#xD;
      the mother and the father.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the Early Prenatal Interview (EPP) was created through the perinatal plan of&#xD;
      2005-2007 in order to allow a more precise research of the factors of vulnerabilities likely&#xD;
      to be predictive of a somatic, psychological or social disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, until now, only few pregnant women benefited of this interview. In May 2020, EPP&#xD;
      became mandatory for all pregnant women. It now seems important to clearly identify the&#xD;
      place, function, organization and usefulness of this interview in order to maximize its&#xD;
      benefit in the monitoring of pregnancy&#xD;

      First, the investigators will describe the care pathway for pregnant women who have benefited&#xD;
      of an early prenatal interview (EPP) between March 2019 and March 2020, namely continued&#xD;
      classic follow-up or referral to a child psychiatrist / psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the investigators will define two subgroups within the women oriented towards&#xD;
      psychiatric follow-up: those who had this follow-up and those who did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the investigators will identify the factors of failure of this referral to psychiatric&#xD;
      follow-up and describe the eventual difficulties encountered by the lack of this follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will try to study these observations made with the perspective of&#xD;
      maximizing the benefit of the Early Prenatal Interview in the monitoring of pregnancy.&#xD;
