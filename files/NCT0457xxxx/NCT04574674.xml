    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of a home-based resistance exercise programme v/s a&#xD;
      home-based flexibility exercise programme on muscular endurance and flexibility on healthy&#xD;
      adults. Half of the participants will undergo a 12-weeks home-based resistance exercise&#xD;
      programme while the other half will undergo a 12-week home-based flexibility exercise&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular resistance training can lead to a variety of health benefits including increases in&#xD;
      muscle size and strength, reductions on body fat, increased metabolic rate, glycaemic&#xD;
      control, decreased blood pressure and improved blood lipid profiles. Because of this, current&#xD;
      physical activity guidelines recommend undertaking muscle strengthening activities involving&#xD;
      major muscle groups two days a week or more, alongside at least 150 minutes per week of&#xD;
      moderate intensity physical activity (or 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity physical&#xD;
      activity). However, only small portion of the population achieves the muscle strengthening&#xD;
      aspect of the guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why participation in muscle-strengthening exercise is low is not clear but people identify&#xD;
      several barriers including the lack of time, the effort involved, lack of purpose, pain due&#xD;
      to injury, negative experiences of prescriptive exercise, apathy, illness, injury inclement&#xD;
      weather and work commitment. In addition, some women have expressed a worry of looking&#xD;
      'manly' or 'bulking up' if they undertake resistance exercise. A further potential barrier is&#xD;
      lack of access to a gym with appropriate equipment to perform resistance exercise, or dislike&#xD;
      of a gym setting. Thus, identifying approaches to find a safe, enjoyable and accessible&#xD;
      programme that minimises the burden of performing resistance exercise, and identifying a&#xD;
      minimal amount of resistance training which can provide benefits is a key issue which could&#xD;
      help more people to undertake muscle strengthening exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analyses indicate that while performing resistance exercise two or more times per week&#xD;
      of resistance exercise per muscle group appears to be optimal to maximise strength gains, a&#xD;
      single set of resistance exercise per muscle group per week, if performed to failure is&#xD;
      sufficient to induce substantial strength changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to compare the effects of an app-based home-based resistance&#xD;
      exercise programme vs a home-based flexibility programme on muscular endurance (number of&#xD;
      press-ups, time achieved in half-squat test, and time achieved in plank test, assessed online&#xD;
      during a zoom call) and flexibility (sit and reach, assessed online during a zoom call) in&#xD;
      healthy adults. Secondary aims are a) to determine participants' adherence to both exercise&#xD;
      programmes, b) to determine participants' choice of weekly exercise volume (compared to&#xD;
      minimum prescription) in both exercise programmes c) to determine participants' distribution&#xD;
      of exercise throughout the week in both exercise programmes d) to determine the effects of a&#xD;
      exercise programmes on well-being, and finally e) to determine participants' perceptions,&#xD;
      feelings, thoughts, enjoyment, tolerance and acceptability of both exercise programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized control trial in which the flexibility exercise group will undergo&#xD;
      a 12-week home-based flexibility exercise programme. The resistance exercise group will&#xD;
      undergo a 12-week home-based resistance exercise programme. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      perform a minimum amount of resistance or flexibility exercise of 1 set/week for each of six&#xD;
      exercises and will have the opportunity to increase their volume of exercise to 2 sets or 3&#xD;
      sets/week per exercise if it is their choice. In addition, participants will be able to&#xD;
      distribute the exercises during the week according to their preference (all in one day or&#xD;
      spread over several days of the week, etc.). Participants will be encouraged to have a&#xD;
      minimum of one day of rest per week.&#xD;
