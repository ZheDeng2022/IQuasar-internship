    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of chemo-mechanical caries&#xD;
      removal using Papacarie-Duo and Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) in reducing dental&#xD;
      pain in pregnant women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 2019 and included 162 pregnant women&#xD;
      visiting family health centers in Alexandria, Egypt with dental pain due to caries not&#xD;
      extending to pulp who were randomly assigned into Papacarie-Duo group (n=82) and ART group&#xD;
      (n=80) after stratification by number of treated surfaces&#xD;

    <description>Difference in pain was measured using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The scale is represented by a 100-mm-long horizontal line labeled &quot;no pain&quot; at one end and &quot;worst pain&quot; at the other end. Participants were asked to mark the place on the line representing their level of pain</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with treatment was assessed using two questions: the first question was immediately following treatment: &quot;Was the treatment carried out according to your expectations?&quot; The second question was after 6 months&quot; &quot;Has the treatment solved the problem of your teeth?&quot; Each question was answered on a 10-point scale, with lower values indicating a negative perspective and higher values indicating a positive experience.</description>

    <description>Papacarie was introduced into the cavity using the applicator and left for 40 seconds. A blunt excavator was used to remove the softened dentin. The remaining gel was removed using a cotton pellet. When there was no change in gel color, the cavity was considered caries free. The cavity was then filled with high viscosity glass ionomer cement (GIC) in an encapsulated form (Riva Self-Cure, SDI Limited, Bayswater, VIC, Australia). A mechanical mixer was used to mix the capsule for 10 seconds, the capsule was placed into the applicator to apply the GIC into the cavity. For occluso-proximal cavities, a matrix strip with a wooden wedge was used to provide the appropriate contour of the restoration. A gloved finger was used to apply pressure on the GIC for one minute and occlusion was checked and excess material was removed</description>

    <description>The tooth was cleaned with a wet cotton pellet to remove debris and plaque. Caries was removed using sharp spoon excavators (Darby-Perry #220/221, #17 DE, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, USA), followed by cleaning the cavity using a small wet cotton pellet and finally dried with a dry cotton pellet. The cavity was considered caries-free when a leather-hard texture was reached and the excavator did not stick anymore. GIC was used to restore the cavity using the same technique described for the other group.</description>
