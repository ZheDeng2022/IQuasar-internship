    <textblock>
      This single institution feasibility and acceptability study includes patients with acute&#xD;
      leukemia which is designed to examine a novel palliative and supportive care intervention&#xD;
      (Palliative and supportive Care inTervention; PACT) in which registered nurses (RNs),&#xD;
      occupational therapists (OTs), and physical therapists (PTs) address the activity needs of&#xD;
      older adults with acute leukemia during their hospital stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess feasibility, acceptability, and change in pre&#xD;
      and post measures of symptoms, function, and QOL by administering the PACT intervention. The&#xD;
      first ten participants in the control group will receive usual care. The next 10 participants&#xD;
      will receive the PACT intervention. Each participant in the intervention group will be cared&#xD;
      by a collaborative, multidisciplinary, integrated team including RNs, OTs and PTs.&#xD;

    <description>Using the Adaptive Leadership Framework for Chronic Illness as a guide. RN will complete a symptom assessment within 2 days of patient admission and will continue to monitor patient's symptoms daily throughout hospitalization. OT, PT, project staff will assess and monitor function and physical health status within 2 days of patient admission and will continue to monitor patient's symptoms. Collaborating with patient, RN, OT, and PT will identify and monitor symptoms. RN, OT, PT, and patient will meet to exchange information and develop a shared understanding. RN, OT, and PT will also address technical challenges. PACT team and patient will use the shared understanding of adaptive challenges to find creative ways to do the adaptive work to reduce the impact of symptoms, function, and physical health. Finally, patient and PACT team will establish SMART goals, which are reassessed twice weekly.</description>
