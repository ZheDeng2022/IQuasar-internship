    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare different strategies of psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention for patients undergoing IVF treatment in a private fertility clinic. Recruited&#xD;
      patients were assigned to one of three groups: group intervention, couple intervention or no&#xD;
      intervention (control group). Three main variables were assessed: depression, anxiety and&#xD;
      life quality.&#xD;

      A total of 87 couples have participated in this study. All couples were about to start an&#xD;
      assisted reproduction treatment (artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization). Couples&#xD;
      were assigned to one of three study groups: group intervention, couple intervention or no&#xD;
      intervention (control group). Patients in the first group (group intervention) attended six&#xD;
      group psychotherapy sessions. Patients in the second group attended six psychotherapy&#xD;
      sessions (particular sessions in this case). The patients in the third group received no&#xD;
      psycho-social intervention. Assignation to each group was not randomized, it depended on&#xD;
      scheduling availability of the patients. Patients attended one session every week or 15 days.&#xD;
      Each session lasted 90 minutes. Sessions were designed to minimize the possible negative&#xD;
      psycho -social impact of infertility and its treatment. Different aspects were approached in&#xD;
      these sessions including emotion expression, social coping, communication skills, emotion&#xD;
      management in different social situations, identification of dysfunctional thoughts,&#xD;
      cognitive restructuring, and cognitive distortions. The outcomes measured were: anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, life quality, coping and perceived social support. These variables were assessed&#xD;
      before ART, after ART and in a follow-up performed six months after ART. Psychological&#xD;
      variables were assessed using different well-recognized inventories.&#xD;
