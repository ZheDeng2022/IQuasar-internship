  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label study to assess the PK of single 100 mg oral doses of&#xD;
      enasidenib (CC-90007) in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (HI),&#xD;
      and in matched healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degrees of hepatic impairment will be determined during screening by the subject's score&#xD;
      according to Pugh's Modification of Child's Classification of Severity of Liver Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled in 4 Groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Approximately 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (with a Child-Pugh score&#xD;
           of &lt; 7) will be enrolled in Group A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Approximately 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (with a Child-Pugh&#xD;
           score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9) will be enrolled in Group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C: Approximately 8 subjects with severe hepatic impairment (with a Child-Pugh&#xD;
           score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 15) will be enrolled in Group C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group D: Approximately 8-24 healthy subjects with normal hepatic function will be&#xD;
           enrolled in Group D. Subjects in Group D will be matched to subjects in Groups A-C with&#xD;
           respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 30 pounds). More than 1 subject with&#xD;
           differing degrees of HI can be matched to a single control; however, all subjects with&#xD;
           HI must be matched to at least 1 healthy match subject.&#xD;
