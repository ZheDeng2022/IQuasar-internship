      Brain injury is a serious problem after cardiac surgery. Brain injury can become evident in&#xD;
      the form of stroke and cognitive dysfunction after surgery. The current neuromonitoring&#xD;
      technique used is unable to monitor the region of the brain that is most susceptible to&#xD;
      injury. This study aims to use a novel, non-invasive brain monitoring technique known as&#xD;
      multichannel functional near infrared spectroscopy to assess brain oxygenation at multiple&#xD;
      brain regions simultaneously during cardiac surgery. This research enables the investigators&#xD;
      to understand the differences between regional brain oxygenation during cardiac surgery and&#xD;
      to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of multichannel functional near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy to be used as a future brain monitoring technique to detect brain injury in&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;

      Perioperative cerebral injury is a common and significant complication of patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. 1,2 During cardiac surgery, cerebral injury can occur as a result of&#xD;
      hypoperfusion, cerebral embolism, and/or inflammation. 3 These intraoperative cerebral&#xD;
      injuries could manifest as postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction (e.g., impaired memory&#xD;
      and attention, mood alterations), stroke, delirium, visual field deficits and coma. 4 Around&#xD;
      1% to 4% of cardiac surgical patients with closed-chamber cardiac procedures are complicated&#xD;
      with stroke. The incidence of stroke increases markedly to about 8% to 9% in open-chamber&#xD;
      (e.g., valvular surgery) or combined/complex procedures. These patients with neurological&#xD;
      injury are associated with increased postoperative mortality, prolonged intensive care unit,&#xD;
      hospital stay, decreased quality of life, and decreased long-term survival. 4 Despite the&#xD;
      advancement of surgical techniques and perioperative care leading to a progressive decrease&#xD;
      in cardiac surgical mortality since the 1980s1,5,6, the incidence of postoperative neurologic&#xD;
      complications has remained relatively unchanged. This is largely related to the lack of&#xD;
      effective monitoring and intervention to detect and mitigate intraoperative cerebral injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potentially treatable cause of cerebral injury during cardiac surgery is hypoperfusion&#xD;
      related infarct/ischemia. 7 Watershed, or boundary zone, are situated along border zones&#xD;
      between the territories of two major cerebral arteries (e.g., the middle and posterior, or&#xD;
      the anterior and middle cerebral arteries) where terminal arteriolar anastomoses exist which&#xD;
      are more susceptible to hypoperfusion related infarct/ischemia. 8 These hypoperfusion related&#xD;
      injuries are potentially treatable by increasing systematic blood pressure if those injuries&#xD;
      are being identified early. Previous study has used electroencephalography to detect&#xD;
      intraoperative brain injury at the watershed area9, but the clinical utility of&#xD;
      electroencephalography is limited because of its cumbersome set-up and complex logistics. As&#xD;
      such, this study aims to use a novel multichannel fNIRS to detect and monitor cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation at multiple brain regions simultaneously for adult patients undergoing during&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. This study will increase the experiences of using fNIRS as a monitoring tool&#xD;
      in cardiac surgery and improve the understandings to the cerebral injury pattern during&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multichannel functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging brain-imaging&#xD;
      technique to measure hemodynamic changes at the cortical surface. During the acquisition of&#xD;
      fNIRS data light (600-900 nm) is emitted from light sources that can pass through the skull&#xD;
      and reach cortex. Photons reflected from the cortex can be detected and quantified by&#xD;
      detectors placed in close proximity to the sources. Light is mainly absorbed by oxygenated&#xD;
      hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin, which have distinct absorption spectra. Alterations&#xD;
      in the concentrations of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin derived from neuronal activation can be&#xD;
      quantified using two or more wavelengths. The early studies has showed that the use of two&#xD;
      channels cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy can avoid profound cerebral desaturation and is&#xD;
      associated with significantly fewer incidences of major organ dysfunction. 10 However, one&#xD;
      major limitation of two channels NIRS is that sensor placement is currently limited to&#xD;
      forehead that only the frontal lobes are being monitored. Such placement prevents monitoring&#xD;
      the critical posterior watershed at the juncture of the anterior, middle, and posterior&#xD;
      cerebral arteries, and results in undetected stroke despite the patients having normal&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation throughout the surgery. The lack of comprehensive cortical coverage of&#xD;
      the important brain regions such as water-shed area also limit the utility of two channels&#xD;
      NIRS as a research tool to assess regional cerebral flow and metabolism during cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. The multichannel fNIRS offers a number of advantages for assessing surgical patients&#xD;
      intraoperatively including its high temporal resolution (~100ms), low-cost and portability.&#xD;
      The multichannel fNIRS allows up to 64 channels of real-time data acquisition and&#xD;
      interpretation, which allows adequate spatial and temporal resolutions to assess the brain&#xD;
      regions at risk intraoperatively. In this study, only 16 channels will be used to assess the&#xD;
      brain oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fNIRS system in this study is a class I Health Canada approved device (NIRx NIRScout&#xD;
      64x32 Laser/LED 4-wavelength fNRIS system, info:https://nirx.net/nirscout). It does not heat&#xD;
      up nor can it damage eyesight. This commercially available device has been used safely in&#xD;
      previous studies in neonatal population at Western (WREM #: 111168, 113443) and other studies&#xD;
      published in the literature. This device is approved for brain oxygenation monitoring in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single site, prospective, observational study where patients undergoing cardiac surgical&#xD;
      procedures will be monitored using multichannel fNIRS monitoring to assess cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation in regions of the brain that are susceptible to injury during cardiac surgery. No&#xD;
      intervention will be used in this study. 40 patients total will be included in the study and&#xD;
      receive this monitoring during surgery. There will be no randomization and no additional&#xD;
      changes to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to participate in this study will receive brain monitoring in the form of&#xD;
      multichannel fNIRS monitoring that is not standard of care. This consists of wearing the NIRS&#xD;
      cap that will be positioned on the patient's head according to international operational&#xD;
      guidelines and will be secured to the temporal region of the patient's forehead. The NIRS cap&#xD;
      is entirely non-invasive and does not pose any additional risk to the patient. Monitoring&#xD;
      will be commenced prior to the induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
