  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to test the efficacy of 10 sessions of Transcranial Rotating Permanent&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation (TRPMS) paired with aerobic exercise or computerized cognitive training&#xD;
      (CT) on mobility and depression symptoms in 40 individuals affected by multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Arm 1 will complete 10x40 minutes daily sessions of TRPMS+aerobic exercise.&#xD;
      Participants in Arm 2 will complete TRPMS+computerized CT. Primary outcomes for both arms&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline, at treatment end and after 4-week from the treatment end&#xD;
      (follow-up).&#xD;

    <description>Arm 2: CESD-10 10-item Likert scale questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms in the past week. It includes three items on depressed affect, five items on somatic symptoms, and two on positive affect. Options for each item range from &quot;rarely or none of the time&quot; (score of 0) to &quot;all of the time&quot; (score of 3). The total range of score is 0-30; higher scores indicate the presence of significant depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Arm 2: The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). A PHQ-9 score â‰¥10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively.</description>
