    <textblock>
      The study assess, evaluate and compare the efficacy of two methods of enteral feeding on&#xD;
      complications and nutritional status among ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study had utilized two methods of enteral feeding consisted of intermittent enteral&#xD;
      feeding by syringe pump and hospital blended enteral feeding by feeding bag and assess the&#xD;
      patient before and after feeding for 10 days by using three tools help to monitor hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters, GIT system assessment and laboratory findings assessment which help to evaluate&#xD;
      nutritional status and complications. The results showed that the complications in the&#xD;
      intermittent enteral feeding group were lower than those in feeding bag group.&#xD;

      Introduction Enteral nutritional support refers to the provision of calories, protein,&#xD;
      electrolytes, vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and fluids via the gastrointestinal route.&#xD;
      Enteral feeding is indicated for patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract whose oral&#xD;
      nutritional intake is insufficient to meet estimated needs .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral nutrition therapy has a number of advantages over par-enteral nutrition in the&#xD;
      management of patients requiring nutritional support. Enteral nutrition aids in the&#xD;
      preservation of gastrointestinal function by the provision of enteral nutrients and is&#xD;
      easier, safer and less costly to administer .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite these relative advantages, the delivery of safe and effective enteral&#xD;
      nutrition therapy may still present challenges for families and caregivers in terms of time,&#xD;
      technical expertise, and cost .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to advances in technology of enteral feeding tubes and delivery systems, specialization&#xD;
      of health professionals, and better education of parents and caregivers, the administration&#xD;
      of enteral nutrition has been associated with improved clinical outcome and safety profiles.&#xD;
      Enteral nutrition therapy is easier and safer to administer than is par-enteral nutrition.&#xD;
      Not only are the risks of intravenous access avoided, but there is also a wider margin for&#xD;
      error with most metabolic complications. As a result, enteral nutrition therapy is easier to&#xD;
      administer in low-intensity hospitals and patient care settings, including the home. However,&#xD;
      compared with normal diet, tube feedings require extra time and effort to administer and this&#xD;
      additional care need may contribute to increased burden and stress for families and&#xD;
      caregivers .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of&#xD;
      intermittent enteral feeding by using syringe pump versus hospital blended feeding by using&#xD;
      feeding bag on the nutritional status and complications among ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Design Structured as a randomized-controlled prospective study, the objective of this&#xD;
      study was to compare the efficacy of intermittent enteral feeding by using syringe pump&#xD;
      versus hospital blended formula by using feeding bag on reducing complications and improving&#xD;
      the nutritional status of patients the intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting Data was collected from assiut university hospitals .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample The study population consisted of patients eighteen to sixty years old, hospitalized&#xD;
      and treated in critical and trauma intensive care units. The inclusion criteria stipulated&#xD;
      that the patient was between eighteen and sixty years old; both genders were included;&#xD;
      patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract and poor oral nutritional intake and agreed&#xD;
      to participate in the study. A power calculation estimated that in order to detect an effect&#xD;
      size of 11.8 difference in mean of protein level between the two studied groups, with a&#xD;
      p-value &lt; 0.05 and 80% power, confidence level 0.95, a sample size of 22 patients for each&#xD;
      group was needed. However, 60 patients were attempted in this research work to avoid&#xD;
      non-response rate (30 for each group). This calculated using G Power 3.1 . The study data was&#xD;
      collected between June 2019 and December 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments and measurements Three tools used in this study were developed by the researcher&#xD;
      based on reviewing of the literature. The first tool was general assessment sheet used to&#xD;
      monitor hemodynamic parameters included (Mean arterial pressure (MAP) taken from bed side&#xD;
      monitor, heart rate (HR), temperature, respiratory rate and CVP readings, physical&#xD;
      examination done every day and included neurological examination and chest examination&#xD;
      regarding disturbances, chest x-ray assessment, mode of ventilation and duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, fluid balance assessment., assessment of laboratory findings in&#xD;
      addition to socio-demographic and medical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second tool is feeding assessment sheet was developed by the researcher and used to&#xD;
      assess BMI after assessing height and weight; assessment of amount of water, protein,&#xD;
      calories was given per day; assessment of mode of enteral feeding ; residual volume&#xD;
      assessment; period of feeding rest and frequency .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third tool is Patients' outcomes evaluation sheet which was developed by the researcher&#xD;
      and used to assess patients' outcomes and complications . .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention After getting ethical clearance patients were enrolled in the study, patients&#xD;
      were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following an initial assessment,&#xD;
      the patients were assigned to one of the two groups by block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups received 3000 ml of feed per day and the same formula per day which was 30-35&#xD;
      ml/kg of water, 0.8 g/kg of protein and 2000 k cal of calories for females and 2500 K cal for&#xD;
      males. The only manipulation was in the flow rate and the device which the feed was&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent enteral feeding group received intermittent feeding as the feed was given over a&#xD;
      24 hour period with intervals of rest (e.g. three hours feeding two hours rest) by using&#xD;
      syringe pump and Feeds were administered according to guidelines as the head of the patient's&#xD;
      bed was elevated at least 30 degrees from the horizontal before initiating feeding, the&#xD;
      feeding schedule was started at a rate of 50 ml/hr in adults to promote tolerance,the&#xD;
      administration rate of isotonic formulas increased in 20-25 ml/hr increments every eight&#xD;
      hours until the desired rate was achieved, the tube was flushed regularly with 20 to 30 ml of&#xD;
      warm water every four hours during continuous feeding and before and after intermittent&#xD;
      feeding and medication administration, the gastric residual volume was checked every 4-6 hr&#xD;
      routinely Feeding bag group received hospital blended formula which was 300 ml of feeds every&#xD;
      24 hrs with 4 hrs rest at night and given in 10 minutes with following the same guidelines in&#xD;
      the intermittent enteral feeding group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The data were collected from the first day of admission after stabilization&#xD;
      of the patient's condition and extended to 7 days, every day then the data were recorded in&#xD;
      the developed tools.The researcher assigned study sample (30 patients) to two groups&#xD;
      (intermittent enteral feeding group, feeding bag group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For intermittent enteral feeding group: The researcher assessed patients who were receiving&#xD;
      intermittent enteral feeding. For feeding bag group: The researcher assessed patients who&#xD;
      received hospital blended formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      faculty of nursing with no risk for study subject during application of the study as the&#xD;
      study followed common ethical principles in clinical research and written consent was&#xD;
      obtained from patients or guidance that participated in the study after explaining the nature&#xD;
      and purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient was assured that the data of this research was not be reused without second&#xD;
      permission, confidentiality and anonymity was assured and the patients had the right to&#xD;
      refuse to participate or withdraw from the study without any rational at any time.&#xD;
