  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the utility of Liver Incytes in&#xD;
      assessing NAFLD with or without advanced fibrosis in patients seen in liver clinics for&#xD;
      suspected NAFLD diagnosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will evaluate the performance characteristics of LSM as a measure of&#xD;
      fibrosis and ACE as a measure of hepatic steatosis by Liver Incytes in patients with&#xD;
      different stages of NAFLD. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of ACE will be compared to&#xD;
      CAP and LSM as measured by Liver Incytes to that measured by FibroScan® using liver histology&#xD;
      as the reference standard. The performance of these two methods will also be compared to that&#xD;
      of non-invasive blood based markers such as APRI, FIB4, and NAFLD fibrosis score in&#xD;
      predicting advanced fibrosis in biopsy proven NAFLD.&#xD;

          2. Suspected NAFLD or NASH with plans to undergo standard of care liver biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of biopsy proven NAFLD or NASH within 6 months prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Planned liver biopsy for evaluation of NAFLD within 6 months of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to provide informed consent&#xD;

             those used for hormone replacement, anabolic steroids, valproic acid, and other known&#xD;
             hepatotoxins) for more than 2 weeks in the year prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject with history of cirrhosis or clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation as&#xD;

             encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has history of other forms of chronic liver diseases such as viral hepatitis,&#xD;
             autoimmune hepatitis, cholestatic liver disease (primary biliary cirrhosis or primary&#xD;
             sclerosing cholangitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject with active substance abuse&#xD;
