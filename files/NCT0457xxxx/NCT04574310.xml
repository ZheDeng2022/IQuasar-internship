  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate whether there is any association between the&#xD;
      location into the uterine cavity, where the air bubbles containing the pre-embryos were&#xD;
      placed, and the implantation rate. Therefore, the images generated during pre-embryos&#xD;
      transfer are available in our database and studied retrospectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The success of a reproductive treatment is determined by three variables: the pre-embryo&#xD;
      quality, endometrial receptiveness and pre-embryo transfer. Several previous studies show a&#xD;
      lack of agreement concerning the greatest measurement. For instance, some of them refer to&#xD;
      the distance between the catheter and the uterine fundus, whereas some others take as a&#xD;
      reference the air-bubble where the pre-embryos were placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is for this reason that in the present study, we aim to evaluate the air bubble location&#xD;
      ratio into the uterine cavity with reproductive success, taking into account the different&#xD;
      variables to reach success. That is, embryo characteristics (quality, development day)&#xD;
      endometrium preparation (cycle type, hormone levels on day 5) and even the transfer procedure&#xD;
      (type of catheter, blood, difficulty channeling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a study that aims to collect data from January 2013 to october 2019. To this end, the&#xD;
      images generated during pre-embryos transfer are analyzed retrospectively. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      evaluated the existing differences on implantation rate according to air-bubble placement&#xD;
      into uterine cavity during the transfer procedure.&#xD;

        IVIVigo patients with a normal uterine anatomy and a single good quality embryo to transfer&#xD;
        at blastocyst stage, performed by the same gynaecologist using the &quot;three-drop technique&quot;&#xD;
        were included. All transfer were atraumatic, without blood presence, using soft catheter&#xD;
        and with controlled ultrasound transfer. The distance between the fundus surface and the&#xD;
        tip of catheter, the distance between the fundus and the air bubble, the endometrial&#xD;
        thickness and the implantation rate were recorded.&#xD;
