  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disorder with adverse neurocognitive and&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic outcomes. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard&#xD;
      therapeutic option to treat airway obstructions during sleep and thus, prevent its adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular and neurocognitive outcomes. Previous clinical trials, however, have largely&#xD;
      failed to show a consistent impact of CPAP on these health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main limitations of these trials may be the inadequate characterization of OSA and&#xD;
      its acute physiological consequences. By characterizing OSA based on the &quot;apnea-hypopnea&#xD;
      index (AHI)&quot;, there is a potential risk of negative results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the investigators intend to tackle this issue, by better characterization of&#xD;
      OSA-related physiological consequences during sleep using physiologically driven metrics to&#xD;
      capture the burden of OSA-related hypoxemia (&quot;hypoxic burden&quot;), autonomic response (&quot;heart&#xD;
      rate burden&quot;), and sleep fragmentation (&quot;arousal burden&quot;).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (including CPAP, oral appliances,&#xD;
             supplemental oxygen). Patients must be untreated prior to the baseline visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active use of non-prescription opioids (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled medical problem or major organ system disease, which, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigators (PI and Co-Is), would interfere with the evaluation of the subject&#xD;
             (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, unstable coronary heart disease, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, systemic neurological&#xD;
             condition that could affect respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sleep disordered breathing or respiratory disorders other than obstructive sleep&#xD;
             apnea:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  central sleep apnea (&gt;50% of respiratory events scored as central),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  chronic hypoventilation/hypoxemia (awake SaO2 &lt; 92% by oximetry) due to chronic&#xD;
                  obstructive pulmonary disease or other respiratory conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other sleep disorders: periodic limb movements (periodic limb movement arousal index &gt;&#xD;
             10/hr), narcolepsy, or parasomnias.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable or unwilling to use CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insomnia or insufficient sleep (self-reported inability to sleep &gt;6 hrs night).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (women)&#xD;
