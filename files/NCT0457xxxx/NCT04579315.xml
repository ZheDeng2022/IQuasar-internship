  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progresses normophosphatemia is maintained by increasing the&#xD;
      per nephron urinary phosphorus excretion. Clinically, hyperphosphatemia is associated with&#xD;
      high mortality, vascular calcification, endothelial dysfunction and progression of left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy. Currently the treatment of hyperphosphatemia is first being&#xD;
      initiated in stage 5 and consists of dietetic guidance to avoid dietary phosphate and&#xD;
      treatment with oral phosphate binders. However, studies have shown important side effects to&#xD;
      phosphate binders in terms of progression of vascular calcifications. Therefore, it might be&#xD;
      beneficial to start the dietetic treatment with a reduction of dietary phosphate earlier in&#xD;
      the disease stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to develop a New Nordic Renal Diet (NNRD) for CKD patients' stage&#xD;
      3-4 and to examine the long-term effects in a period of 26-weeks. NNRD has a high content of&#xD;
      vegetable foods, less animal products and more local food items with a lesser content of&#xD;
      phosphorus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial performed at Department of Nephrology&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen Denmark. Sixty patients will be randomized to either 26 weeks on&#xD;
      the NNRD (intervention) or 26 weeks on their habitual diet (control). The patients will be&#xD;
      randomized by blinded drawing by lot. The study participants can leave the trial at any time&#xD;
      during the study period, without any explanation. The investigator can at any time pull a&#xD;
      patient out of the trial, if there is concern for the patient's safety or if there is a&#xD;
      breach in terms of following the protocol. The principal investigator is required to document&#xD;
      and report dropouts from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project group has entered a cooperation agreement with Danish chefs. The agreement&#xD;
      involves that a team consisting of highly talented chefs will create the recipes for the&#xD;
      intervention. The recipes will be created in close collaboration with the principal&#xD;
      investigator who will use her expertise within Clinical Nutrition to combine the&#xD;
      international nutrients guidelines and culinarian experiences. Moreover, the agreement holds&#xD;
      that they will find the raw materials needed for the recipes and deliver them weekly to the&#xD;
      patients' homes throughout the study period in packages containing the recipes and raw&#xD;
      materials. There will be no financial costs for the patients. The patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group are expected to follow the recipes five days of the week during the study&#xD;
      period. The final two days of the week, the patients must plan their own meals. However,&#xD;
      still following the recommended guidelines upon the NNRD whole food approach delivered from&#xD;
      the principal investigator, who is a phd.-student and also a registered clinical dietitian&#xD;
      and MSc in clinical nutrition (Nikita Misella Hansen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is based on results from previous studies performed by this study&#xD;
      group. Within 6 months of participating in this study we expect a decrease in eGFR to be&#xD;
      about 1 ml/min/1.73 m2. This will have no influence on the total amount of 24-h urine&#xD;
      phosphorus excretion (primary endpoint), as CKD progresses normophosphatemia is maintained by&#xD;
      increasing the per nephron urinary phosphorus excretion stimulated by an increase in FGF23&#xD;
      and PTH leading to progressively increasing plasma levels of FGF23 and SHP the&#xD;
      &quot;phospho-toxicity model hypothesis&quot; to a compensation from PTH and FGF23. In a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study with a type-1-error risk of 0.05 (alfa, two tailed) and a power of 80%&#xD;
      (beta) with a standard deviation of 24-h urine phosphorus excretion of 200 mg and a minimum&#xD;
      clinical relevant difference of 300 mg the study population is estimated to 21 in each group.&#xD;
      In case of drop-outs we will include 30 participants in each group. Therefore, total number&#xD;
      of patients to be included in this study is 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline (day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Written consent will be obtained, randomization will be performed, and the following&#xD;
           data will be registered:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient history: Gender, age, disease history, current medical record, diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comorbidities - e.g. cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive lung disease,&#xD;
                diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Smoking (years) and alcohol consumption (average per week)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood- and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DEXA-scan and Electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weight, BMI, hip- and waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Questionnaires regarding quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dietary record&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Day 14 The patients will be asked to deliver a 24-hour urine sample for measuring&#xD;
           phosphorus excretion. Furthermore, blood samples will be drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Day 30, 60, 90, 120, 150&#xD;
&#xD;
           Every 4th week during the study period of 26 weeks (a total of 6 times) all patients&#xD;
           will be evaluated at the Department of Nephrology, University Hospital, Copenhagen.&#xD;
           During these first 5 visits the following data will be gathered:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  24-h urine phosphorus excretion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weight, hip- and waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Once a week Once every week the principal investigator will offer all the patients a&#xD;
           telephone meeting. Duration of the phone conversation will depend on individual needs,&#xD;
           but up to 20 minutes per patient/week despite of allocation. The content of these&#xD;
           conversations will evolve around dietary intake and overall general condition. The&#xD;
           principal investigator is in close collaboration with the others in the research group&#xD;
           who are all medical doctors and will discuss any clinical problem if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Day 180 (study completion)&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the last day of the study period, the patients will be asked to meet at&#xD;
           Rigshospitalet one more time. Data as on day 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 will be gathered,&#xD;
           moreover the following information will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DEXA-scan and ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weight, BMI, hip- and waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Questionnaires regarding quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dietary record&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Follow-up visit Three months after study completion there will be an end-of-trial visit&#xD;
           with a 24-h urine collection and blood samples&#xD;
