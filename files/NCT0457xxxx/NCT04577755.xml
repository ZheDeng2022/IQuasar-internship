    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of pomalidomide in treating patients with Kaposi&#xD;
      sarcoma. Pomalidomide is a cancer fighting drug that stops the growth of blood vessels,&#xD;
      stimulates the immune system, and may kill cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the proportion of participants with Kaposi sarcoma (KS) (with or without human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus [HIV], regardless of previous treatment status) treated with&#xD;
      pomalidomide who respond to treatment with a durable response (i.e., response duration of at&#xD;
      least one year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the overall response rate (ORR) and report 95% confidence intervals (CI) in the&#xD;
      overall study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. To measure the ORR in the HIV positive study population. Ib. To measure the ORR in the&#xD;
      HIV unrelated study population. II. To estimate the ORR in subgroups of KS in regard to HIV&#xD;
      and previous treatment status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the safety of pomalidomide therapy. IV. To describe changes in visceral&#xD;
      disease among those presenting with evaluable visceral disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess response duration in participants treated with pomalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect of pomalidomide treatment on the tumor microenvironment and explore&#xD;
      the relationship with clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the effects of pomalidomide on CD4 lymphocyte counts and HIV viral load in&#xD;
      HIV positive (+) participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the effect of pomalidomide treatment on serum biomarkers and explore the&#xD;
      relationship with clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) viral copy number in plasma and&#xD;
      explore whether changes correlate with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. After 12 cycles, patients with complete response, partial response, or stable&#xD;
      disease may continue pomalidomide for an additional 12 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <description>The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method will be used to describe duration of response for all treated participants. The cumulative proportion of study participants still in response at one year will be estimated using the point estimate and the 95% confidence interval using Greenwood's formula for the standard error of the K-M estimate. The proportional hazards model will be used to evaluate the association of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status and pretreatment status on duration of response.</description>

    <description>The binomial proportion and its 95% confidence interval will be used to estimate ORR in four groups defined by HIV status and pretreatment status (HIV+, pretreated; HIV+, treatment naive; HIV-, pretreated and HIV-, treatment naive). In addition, the binomial proportion and its 95% confidence interval will be used to describe the ORR for HIV+ and HIV- participants, and those that were pretreated and treatment na√Øve.</description>

                       requiring; any degree disease worsening by imagining) that would prompt&#xD;

                       largest diameter. For purposes of this assessment, if there is 20% reduction&#xD;
                       in size of any lesion, disappearance of any lesion, this constitutes&#xD;
                       regression unless there is concomitant increase in size or appearance of new&#xD;
                       lesions elsewhere&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must agree to participate in and comply with the mandatory POMALYST Risk&#xD;
             Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to take aspirin 81 mg daily as prophylactic anticoagulation&#xD;
             (patients intolerant to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), may use warfarin or low molecular&#xD;
             weight heparin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC): Participants with IDMC&#xD;
             may be eligible for the study provided all other eligibility criteria are satisfied:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The participant's legally authorized representative (LAR) is able and willing to&#xD;
                  sign consent in addition to the study candidate&#xD;
&#xD;

                  taken per protocol, recorded in the study drug diary, and returned to clinic with&#xD;
                  any unused pills&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant who is receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has symptomatic visceral KS involving the lungs or gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
             tract that requires immediate chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Participants with&#xD;
             minimally symptomatic visceral disease not requiring immediate tumor shrinkage are&#xD;
             eligible if in provider judgment potential disease progression will not cause a hazard&#xD;
             for the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to pomalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of agents containing zidovudine (including Combivir and Trizivir) are prohibited.&#xD;
             Changes to ART therapy during the study may be made if medically necessary (toxicity,&#xD;
             failure of regimen, etc.). Use of medications or substances that are strong inhibitors&#xD;
             of CYP1A2, which include amiodarone, cimetidine, fluoroquinolones (e.g.,&#xD;
             ciprofloxacin, enoxacin), fluvoxamine, and ticlopidine is prohibited.&#xD;
             Co-administration of efavirenz, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, with strong inhibitors of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is prohibited. Use of erythropoietin is prohibited.&#xD;
             Co-administration of corticosteroids greater than doses required for treatment of&#xD;
             adrenal insufficiency is prohibited. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult frequently-updated list; medical&#xD;
             reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this&#xD;
             information. As part of the informed consent/enrollment procedures, the participant&#xD;
             will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the participant is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection for which the participants have not completed at least 14 days of therapy&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment and/or is not clinically stable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has symptomatic congestive heart failure; unstable angina pectoris;&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia; or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pomalidomide is a thalidomide&#xD;
             analogue with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with pomalidomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with pomalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or therapies to target KS&#xD;
             lesions within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) with the exception of&#xD;
             ART, before enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with high clinical suspicion of concurrent Castleman disease or IL-6&#xD;
             related inflammatory disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For a reference of signs and symptoms consistent with IL-6 related inflammatory&#xD;
                  disease or KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS) can refer to publication&#xD;
