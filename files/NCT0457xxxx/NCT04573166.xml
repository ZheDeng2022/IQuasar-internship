      This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of personalized atrial septostomy&#xD;
      (PAS) with combined use of radiofrequency-ablation and balloon-dilation (CURB) in heart&#xD;
      failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFpEF).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial septostomy is an important palliative therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) . Though the&#xD;
      safety of balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) is satisfactory, the incidence of spontaneous&#xD;
      closure is higher, which limits the clinical utilization of this procedure. The&#xD;
      device-implantation improves the long-term patency. However, the created fenestration is&#xD;
      limited with fixed size and it is further complicated with the potential device-related&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) has the potential to cause irreversible damage around&#xD;
      the rim of fenestration created with BAS, which might prevent the re-adhesion of the septal&#xD;
      remnants. In addition, RFA on fossae ovalis might reduce the elastic recoil of local tissue&#xD;
      and contribute to create larger inter-atrial fenestration with same BAS procedure. Therefore,&#xD;
      the combined use of radiofrequency-ablation and balloon-dilation (CURB) might become a novel&#xD;
      procedure to create a stable inter-atrial fenestration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the adult patients who have HFrEF and HFpEF refractory to medical therapy may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After left and right catheterization, CURB procedure will be performed in all patients. The first step is RFA on fossae ovalis; and then graded BAS is carried out after transseptal puncture; finally, RFA is repeated around the fenestration-rim created with BAS. The fenestration-size will be determined based on the levels of AOP and MLAP, and the immediate size of fenestration will be evaluated with intra-cardiac echocardiography. The patency and size of fenestration will be followed up for 12 months. During the period of follow up, the other evaluations will include the improvement in exercise tolerance, major adverse cardiac and/or cerebrovascular events (MACCE), reduction of PAWP/MLAP at rest, cardiac remodeling, myocardial injury, and so on.</intervention_model_description>
