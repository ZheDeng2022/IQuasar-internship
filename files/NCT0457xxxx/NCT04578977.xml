      ) Terrible triad injury of the elbow is a complex injury that is classically defined as elbow&#xD;
      dislocation along with fractures of the coronoid process of the ulna and the radial head. The&#xD;
      injury is usually associated with typical soft-tissue disruptions (with common involvement of&#xD;
      the lateral collateral ligament complex, elbow joint capsule, as well as the common extensor&#xD;
      and flexor-pronator tendons)(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of terrible triad injuries include redislocation, residual instability, elbow&#xD;
      stiffness, heterotopic ossification, fracture malunion or nonunion, elbow arthrosis,&#xD;
      olecranon bursitis, ulnar or radial nerve palsy (due to the surgical approach or placement of&#xD;
      hardware), and hardware related complications(2) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of trrible triade is conservative or surgical treatment ,in this study we will use&#xD;
      surgical treatment and make evaluation of it.&#xD;

      The elbow is the second most commonly dislocated joint in adults and up to 20% of&#xD;
      dislocations are associated with a fracture. (1) Terrible triad injury of the elbow is a&#xD;
      complex injury that is classically defined as elbow dislocation along with fractures of the&#xD;
      coronoid process of the ulna and the radial head. The injury is usually associated with&#xD;
      typical soft-tissue disruptions (with common involvement of the lateral collateral ligament&#xD;
      complex, elbow joint capsule, as well as the common extensor and flexor-pronator tendons)&#xD;
      Complications of terrible triad injuries include redislocation, residual instability, elbow&#xD;
      stiffness, heterotopic ossification, fracture malunion or nonunion, elbow arthrosis,&#xD;
      olecranon bursitis, ulnar or radial nerve palsy (due to the surgical approach or placement of&#xD;
      hardware), and hardware related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of trrible triade is conservative or surgical treatment ,in this study we will use&#xD;
      surgical treatment and make evaluation of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment involves radial head repair or replacement ,medial and lateral collateral&#xD;
      ligament repair and coronoid fracture fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      aim of research isFunctional assessment of surgical treatment of terrible triade injury of&#xD;
      the elbow according to Mayo elbow performance score, According to the system of Mayo, scores&#xD;
      of 90-100 are classified as excellent, 75-89 as good, 60-74 as fair, and 0-59 as poor&#xD;
