      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 2 repurposed drugs&#xD;
      (acetylsalicylic acid and ibuprofen), for use as adjunct therapy added to, and compared with,&#xD;
      the standard of care (SoC) WHO-recommended TB regimen in drug-sensitive (DS) and multi-drug&#xD;
      resistant (MDR) TB patients.&#xD;
