  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to evaluate auditory sensitivity in teenagers with ADHD using&#xD;
      acoustic reflex thresholds (ART) and to examine the effects of ADHD stimulant medication on&#xD;
      ART.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disorder in children. Besides core ADHD symptoms (inattentiveness, hyperactivity,&#xD;
      impulsivity), ADHD also affects the ability to perceive and process sounds. Both&#xD;
      hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity to loud sounds are common symptoms in ADHD patients.&#xD;
      With stimulant medication, individuals with ADHD become more tolerant of loud noise than when&#xD;
      they were non-medicated. It remains unknown exactly how stimulant medication alters the&#xD;
      loudness perception. The proposed study will use the acoustic reflex to objectively measure&#xD;
      auditory sensitivity to loud sounds. The aims of this study are to evaluate auditory&#xD;
      sensitivity in patients with ADHD using acoustic reflex thresholds (ART) and to examine the&#xD;
      effects of ADHD stimulant medication on ART. Eligible participants will participate in two&#xD;
      sessions (off-med and on-med conditions) conducted on the same day. ADHD patients will be&#xD;
      asked to come to the laboratory before taking their ADHD medication. The investigators will&#xD;
      repeat three tests before and after taking stimulant medication. The investigators will also&#xD;
      conduct screening tests during and between the first and second sessions. The investigators&#xD;
      will compare a difference between the two independent groups (ADHD vs. Control) and compare a&#xD;
      within subject difference between medication conditions (on-med vs. off-med).&#xD;
