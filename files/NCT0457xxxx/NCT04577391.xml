  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the effects of Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy&#xD;
      (mCIMT) and Bimanual Training (BIT) based on the International Classification of Functioning,&#xD;
      Disability, and Health, Children &amp;Youth (ICF-CY) conceptual framework. Our assumptions were&#xD;
      that (1) mCIMT is more effective on outcomes representing all subdomains of ICF and (2) the&#xD;
      possible improvements in the body structure and function, activity, and participation&#xD;
      subdomains of ICF are intimately related to each other.&#xD;

      Thirty-two children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy (mean age 10.43 years [SD 2.9&#xD;
      years]; 15 females, 17 males) whose functional profiles associated with Manual Ability&#xD;
      Classification System, Gross Motor Function Classification System, and Communication Function&#xD;
      Classification System changed between level I-III were randomly distributed to one of the&#xD;
      mCIMT or BIT groups with equivalent dosing frequency and intensity (10 weeks/3 days per&#xD;
      week/2.5 hours per day). Outcome measures categorized according to the domains of&#xD;
      International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health, Children &amp;Youth (ICF-CY)&#xD;
      framework were used to document body functions, activity, and participation outcomes.&#xD;
      Assessments were carried out before (T1) and after treatment (T2), and at 16 weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention (T3) by a physical therapist blinded to group allocation. Before the study&#xD;
      entry, informed consent was obtained from the parents. General and specific contents related&#xD;
      to each intervention were delivered as individual sessions at the school (one session per&#xD;
      week) or group sessions with two participants at rehabilitation centers (two sessions per&#xD;
      week).&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in unimanual capacity on Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST) at 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST) is a criterion-referenced measurement tool, developed to evaluate upper extremity quality of movement in children with cerebral palsy.The Upper Extremity Skills Test has been validated for children with cerebral palsy aged 18 months to 12 years. Intra-rater reliability of the QUEST has been indicated to strong (ICC=0.96) in children with cerebral palsy aged eight and over.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in manual ability on ABILHAND-Kids at 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 16</time_frame>
    <description>ABILHAND-Kids is developed for children with cerebral palsy and measures a child's ability to manage 21 daily activities that require the use of the upper limbs. It measures the children's typical performance in daily life. ABILHAND-Kids is useful in reporting the functional performance of children with one affected side in the perspective of manual ability and has excellent test-retest reliability for Turkish children with cerebral palsy (ICC=0. 0.98)</description>

    <description>Children's less affected hand was restricted through a mitt with a material sewn shut on the palmar face to promote the use of involved side as maximum as possible. Besides, if the participant attempted to use his/her less affected hand as an assistive, a bandage was also used to strap less affected upper limb to the trunk. Specific activities were selected according to deficit of interest, participant preference (on the condition of having potential effects on hand skills) and parent/guardian, or their teacher's request (e.g., drawing, painting, and eating). In case of activities requiring both hand use, such as stabilizing paper during the painting or holding the bricks of lego on the ground, the treating physiotherapist undertook the role of the child's dominant hand.</description>
