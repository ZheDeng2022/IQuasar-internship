  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the project is to investigate if a mindfulness-based attention&#xD;
      training (MBAT) program contextualized for Military Senior Leaders (SLs) might benefit SLs in&#xD;
      three key domains: (1) cognitive abilities, (2) psychological well-being and self-reported&#xD;
      physical health, and (3) strategic leadership skills and ability. The MBAT-SL program will be&#xD;
      tested by the training cohorts and compared to the wait-list control cohorts.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Sustained attention to response task (SART) score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SART involves pressing a button to frequently presented non-target trials (numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) and withholding the button press to the infrequent target trials (number 3). The participants can have a total score between 0 and 100% with a higher score indicating better sustained attention.</description>
