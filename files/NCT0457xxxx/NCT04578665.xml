  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a new paradigm to understand how humans physically&#xD;
      interact with each other at a single and at multiple joints, with multiple contact points, so&#xD;
      as to synthesize robot controllers that can exhibit human-like behavior when interacting with&#xD;
      humans (e.g., exoskeleton) or other co-robots. The investigators will develop models for a&#xD;
      single joint robot (i.e. at the ankle joint) that can vary its haptic behavioral interactions&#xD;
      at variable impedances, and replicate in a multi-joint robot (i.e. at the ankle, knee, and&#xD;
      hip joints). The investigators will collect data from healthy participants and clinical&#xD;
      populations to create a controller based on our models to implement in the robots. Then, the&#xD;
      investigators will test our models via the robots to investigate the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      enhanced motor learning during different human-human haptic interaction behaviors (i.e.&#xD;
      collaboration, competition, and cooperation. This study will be carried out in healthy&#xD;
      participants, participants post-stroke, and participants with spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will look at how the task performance and motor performance of individuals&#xD;
      in dyadic physical interactions are affected by 1) different behavioral interaction&#xD;
      conditions (i.e., solo task, collaboration task, competition task, or cooperation task); 2)&#xD;
      the haptic impedance or stiffness of the virtual connection between dyadic peers (i.e., hard&#xD;
      connection, medium connection, or soft connection); and 3) the skill level of the other&#xD;
      partner (i.e., novice or expert). The investigators will be using both an ankle robot (M1&#xD;
      device) and a bilateral lower limb exoskeleton (H3/X2 device), and will collect EMG and EEG&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Experiment A , the investigators will recruit healthy volunteers (n = 180) to work in&#xD;
      dyadic pairs. With the collected data, the investigators will model how humans adapt force&#xD;
      and impedance and share roles/specialize during various dyadic interaction behaviors, and use&#xD;
      this knowledge to develop robot controllers that mimic movement error and force adaptation&#xD;
      for enhanced motor performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Experiment B , the investigators will recruit healthy volunteers (n = 180), participants&#xD;
      post-stroke (n = 72) and participants post-SCI (n = 72) to work in dyadic pairs within each&#xD;
      population. The investigators will test the robot controllers following the models for&#xD;
      mechanical adaptation and role sharing strategies between peers based on Experiment A. The&#xD;
      investigators will also monitor single-joint and multi-joint movement error and force&#xD;
      adaptation in regards to enhanced motor performance. The investigators will assess if the&#xD;
      robot controllers can pass a &quot;haptic Turing Test&quot;, rendering them indistinguishable with&#xD;
      respect to human peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Experiment C, the investigators will showcase the robot controllers by interfacing with&#xD;
      participants post-stroke (n = 20) and participants post-SCI (n = 20) with the single-joint&#xD;
      and multi-joint assistive robots to observe motor learning and functional outcomes with 10&#xD;
      training sessions per robot.&#xD;

Participants will start experimentation paired as novice-novice, and at the end of the session may be invited to continue additional sessions to be paired as the expert in a novice-expert dyad.</description>
