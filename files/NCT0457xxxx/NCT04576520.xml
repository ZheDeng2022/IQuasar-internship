  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is pilot study for a 2-arm parallel pragmatic randomized controlled trial that will&#xD;
      compare pharmacopuncture therapy and physical therapy for chronic low back pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic RCT, so the physicians will choose the type and volume of&#xD;
      pharmacopuncture and the type and time of physical therapy according to participants'&#xD;
      conditions, respectively.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analogue scale (VAS) of low back pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline VAS at week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scale of low back pain, minimum 0 to maximum 100, which is a higher score means a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analogue scale (VAS) of leg radiating pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 16</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scale of radiating leg pain, minimum 0 to maximum 100, which is a higher score means a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric rating scale (NRS) of low back pain and leg radiating pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 16</time_frame>
    <description>NRS is a pain scale in which the patient indicates their subjective pain as a whole number from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates 'no pain or discomfort' and 10 indicates 'the most severe pain and discomfort imaginable'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 6, 10, 16</time_frame>
    <description>ODI is a functional disability questionnaire. The possible range of each item score is 0 to 5. Total score range is 0 (better outcome) to 100 (worse outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Korean version of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 6, 10, 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire consists of 24 statements relating to the person's perceptions of their back pain and associated disability. This includes items on physical ability/activity (15), sleep/rest (3), psychosocial (2), household management (2), eating (1) and pain frequency (1). There is no weighting applied to the statements, therefore the score can range from 0 (no disability) to 24 (maximal disability).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6, 10, 16</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate the improvement after treatment on a 7-point Likert scale (1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-12 Health Survey version 2 (SF-12 v2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 6, 10, 16</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 consists of 12 questions across 8 domains, and higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 6, 10, 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L consists of 5 questions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, anxiety/depression) that ask about the current state of health, and answers each question with 5 likert. (1=I have no problems about, 2=I have slight problems about, 3=I have moderate problems about, 4=I have severe problems about, 5=I am unable to about)</description>
