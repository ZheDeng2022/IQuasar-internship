      The study will include overweight and obese otherwise healthy women, recruited from two main&#xD;
      borough in Oslo with the highest population of Somali origin. The study comprises two phases:&#xD;
      A 12-months controlled trial where the participants in the intervention borough will be&#xD;
      compared to participants in the control borough. This is followed by a 12-months maintaining&#xD;
      phase for the intervention borough where the control group will be given the same&#xD;
      intervention as the intervention group received during the first 12-months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Through a research-based intervention program, the overall goal of this project is to promote&#xD;
      immigrant health by improving, evolving and adapting a preventive healthcare in the&#xD;
      municipality. There is social inequalities and geographical differences in health in Norway.&#xD;
      Immigrant women struggle more with overweight and obesity than ethnic Norwegian women, and&#xD;
      immigrant women have an increased susceptibility for diabetes and other lifestyle related&#xD;
      diseases. In this study, we will measure the effect of a culturally tailored intervention&#xD;
      package (physical activity and nutrition) on weight reduction, and cardio-metabolic outcomes,&#xD;
      among overweight and obese Somali women. The study will include women (aged 20-67 years)&#xD;
      recruited from two boroughs in Oslo with the highest population of Somali origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention program composes a 12-month controlled trial. The core component of the&#xD;
      program is to counsel and empower women through individual counseling and group education&#xD;
      sessions with emphasis on physical activities and the creation of an enabling environment.&#xD;
      The goal is that the participants become more physically active, less sedentary, eat healthy,&#xD;
      and maintain these changes long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All main analysis will be done at data collected at the one-year follow up. In addition, the&#xD;
      control group in intervention phase will after the completion of the one-year follow up be&#xD;
      given the same intervention as the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      User involvement is included in the development, planning, implementation and dissemination&#xD;
      of the program results. The program will produce evidence, relevant for policy-makers and&#xD;
      stakeholders locally and globally, of how to improve health and nutrition strategies towards&#xD;
      immigrants and minorities. The program represents a collaboration between Oslo municipality,&#xD;
      the University of Oslo and the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences.&#xD;
