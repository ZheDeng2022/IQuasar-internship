  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, single arm, open label, adaptive design study to determine the preliminary&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity and confirm the safety of IT BO-112 in combination with intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. The study will enroll patients with advanced and/or metastatic melanoma that&#xD;
      have progressed on anti-PD-1-containing treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with the combination of BO-112 and pembrolizumab. IT administration&#xD;
      of BO-112 will be performed once weekly (QW) for the first 7 weeks and then once every three&#xD;
      weeks (Q3W); pembrolizumab Q3W will be administered IV. After enrolment of 40 patients, the&#xD;
      sponsor and investigators will review the overall response rate (ORR), durability of response&#xD;
      (DOR), disease control rate (DCR) and safety profile, and will decide whether to initiate a&#xD;
      subsequent randomized phase of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order of administration should be pembrolizumab then IT BO-112. BO-112 will be&#xD;
      administered IT at a total dose of 1-2 mg at each administration to 1-8 tumor lesions using&#xD;
      tuberculin (TB) syringes (or equivalent) with 20- to 23-gauge needles. The needle type can&#xD;
      also be per the investigator's discretion, to best distribute the study drug within the&#xD;
      lesion. Repeat IT dosing may occur if the lesion(s) remain(s) palpable or detectable by&#xD;
      ultrasound, after which, only pembrolizumab infusion will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BO-112 can be administered IT into multiple accessible lesions amenable to repeat&#xD;
      administration using an appropriate syringe and needle type for the location of the&#xD;
      lesion(s). The rationale for dosing multiple lesions is to produce an immune response against&#xD;
      a wider range of genetic mutations and antigenic diversity than may occur within a single&#xD;
      lesion, which in turn is expected to reduce the chance of immune escape by the tumor.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be willing and able to give written informed consent for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be â‰¥ 18 years of age on day of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of cutaneous or mucosal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known BRAF status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma. Patients must have progressed on&#xD;
             treatment with an anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) administered as monotherapy,&#xD;
             or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies. PD-1 treatment&#xD;
             progression is defined by meeting all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Received at least 6 weeks of standard dosing of an approved anti-PD-1/L1 mAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Demonstrated disease progression (PD) on or after PD-1/L1 as defined by RECIST&#xD;
                  v1.1. The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment no&#xD;
                  less than four weeks from the date of the first documented PD, in the absence of&#xD;
                  rapid clinical progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Progressive disease documented within 12 weeks from the last dose of anti-PD-1/L1&#xD;
                  mAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. This determination is made by the investigator. Once PD is confirmed, the initial&#xD;
             date of PD documentation will be considered the date of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Anti-PD-1-based therapy should have been the last line of systemic therapy as part of&#xD;
             first line treatment. Prior treatment either in neo or adjuvant setting is allowed.&#xD;

             injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. At least one accessible tumor lesion that is amenable to weekly injection. If liver is&#xD;
             a site of injection, presence of at least one additional tumor lesion outside the&#xD;
             liver amenable for injection.&#xD;

         10. Willingness to provide biological samples required for the duration of the study&#xD;
             including a fresh tumor biopsy sample. NOTE: If possible, the biopsied lesion should&#xD;
             be a non-target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Adequate hematologic and organ function defined by the following laboratory results&#xD;
             obtained within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment:&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin (Hgb) â‰¥ 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) â‰¤ 2.5x upper&#xD;

                  total bilirubin levels &gt;1.5 Ã— ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Prothrombin time (PT) (or international normalized ratio [INR]) within normal&#xD;

&#xD;
               8. Serum creatinine â‰¤ 1.5 Ã— ULN or creatinine clearance â‰¥ 30 mL/min (calculated per&#xD;
                  institutional standard)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Female patient of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the injection of study medication. If the&#xD;
             urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will&#xD;
             be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female patients who are not pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or&#xD;
             father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the&#xD;
             screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female patients of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth&#xD;
             control or be surgically sterile or abstain from heterosexual activity from the&#xD;
             beginning of the study through 120 days after receiving the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication. Patients of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically&#xD;
             sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2&#xD;
             methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive. Highly&#xD;
             unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a&#xD;
             woman who is â‰¥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be&#xD;
             considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the&#xD;
             study. The two birth control methods can be either: two barrier methods or a barrier&#xD;
             method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks&#xD;
             to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to&#xD;
             participate in the study, they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described&#xD;
             above). If there is any question that a patient will not reliably comply with the&#xD;
             requirements for contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Male patients should agree to use an adequate method of contraception from the&#xD;
             beginning of the study through 120 days after receiving the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. In countries where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients can be&#xD;
             included, HIV infected participants must be on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and have&#xD;

                  qualification (below the limit of detection) using the locally available assay at&#xD;
                  the time of screening and for at least 12 weeks prior to screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Participants on ART must have been on a stable regimen, without changes in drugs&#xD;
                  or dose modification, for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry (Day 1).&#xD;
