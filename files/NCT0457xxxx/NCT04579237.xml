      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiologic images are getting more complex. They are also being used more often. Medical&#xD;
      personnel are overwhelmed with data. Computer Aided Detection (CAD) and diagnosis may be able&#xD;
      to improve medical care. Researchers want to create and test ways to use CAD. To do this,&#xD;
      they want to use data from the Clinical Center s Department of Diagnostic Radiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create algorithms and software that accurately detect and characterize lesions, model&#xD;
      anatomy, and monitor diseases on radiologic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People of all ages who have radiologic exams stored in the clinical PACS (picture archiving&#xD;
      system) of the Clinical Center since July 6, 1953 with no end date. People with target&#xD;
      lesions of any kind will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use existing data. Participants will include males and females of all ages.&#xD;
      They will be chosen by keyword search on NIH databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data that is used may include CT, MRI, ultrasound, and other images. It may include a&#xD;
      participant s name, date of birth, and date of exam. It may include the name of the doctor,&#xD;
      radiologist, and hospital. Data such as age, gender, race, disease, and treatment may be&#xD;
      used. Other data from charts or studies may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging data of all organs of the body will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be kept in computers and servers. The equipment will be password protected.&#xD;
      Printouts will be stored in locked rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 10 years.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All radiologic exams available in the clinical PACS (picture archiving system) of the&#xD;
             Clinical Center taken from July, 6, 1953 with no end date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and Females of all ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with target lesions of any kind will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients without the target lesion will be included to determine the specificity of&#xD;
             the computer aided detection or diagnosis algorithm&#xD;
