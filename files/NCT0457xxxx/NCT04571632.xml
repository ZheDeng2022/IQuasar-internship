      A randomized phase II clinical trial of SBRT and systemic pembrolizumab with or without&#xD;
      intratumoral avelumab/ipilimumab plus CD1c (BDCA-1)+/CD141 (BDCA-3)+ myeloid dendritic cells&#xD;
      in NSCLC&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer cells can be recognized by the patient's own immune system, a process that is referred&#xD;
      to as the &quot;cancer immunity cycle&quot; (Chen &amp; Mellman 2013; Mellman 2013; Chen &amp; Mellman 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remarkable anti-tumor activity has been achieved by blocking the inhibitory T-cell receptor&#xD;
      CTLA-4 and/or the PD-1/-L1 axis. Immune checkpoint inhibition by monoclonal antibody (mAb)&#xD;
      therapy has become a standard of care in patients with advanced melanoma, renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and bladder cancer. Indications&#xD;
      are continuously expanding. Activity of PD-1/-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibition has been correlated&#xD;
      with hallmarks of pre-existing anti-tumor T-cell response (presence of activated cytotoxic T&#xD;
      lymphocytes (CTL) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) as evident from transcription profiles)&#xD;
      and PD-L1 expression by tumor cells (in response to T-cell secreted IFN-). Mutational load of&#xD;
      the cancer cells and presence of highly immunogenic neo-epitopes in the cancer cell genome&#xD;
      underlies the capacity for cancer cells to elicit an immune response (Tumeh, Harview et al.&#xD;
      2014). Responsiveness to treatment with CTLA-4 has been correlated with the expression of HLA&#xD;
      class I molecules by the cancer cells (Tumeh, Harview et al. 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In immune-evasive tumors a pivotal role has been attributed to the elimination of myeloid&#xD;
      dendritic cells (myDC) from the TME. myDC play a pivotal role in the initiation and&#xD;
      coordination of the activity of anti-tumor CTL activity within the TME (Rodig, Gusenleitner&#xD;
      et al. 2017). In animal models, myDC have been demonstrated to play an essential role in&#xD;
      &quot;licensing&quot; anti-tumor CTLs to eradicate tumor cells. Activation of oncogenic signaling&#xD;
      pathways such as the WNT/Catenin pathway can lead to the exclusion of myeloid DC from the TME&#xD;
      (Broz et al. 2014; Spranger &amp; Gajewski 2016). Absence of myDCs at the invasive margin and&#xD;
      within metastases has been correlated with defective CTL activation allowing the metastasis&#xD;
      to escape the anti-tumor immune response (Salmon, Idoyaga et al. 2016). These myDC also&#xD;
      migrate to tumor-draining lymph nodes and present tumor antigens to T-cells in these&#xD;
      secondary lymphoid organs (Salmon, Idoyaga et al. 2016). In mouse models, tumor-residing&#xD;
      Batf3 dendritic cells were shown to be required for effector T Cell trafficking and success&#xD;
      of adoptive T-cell therapy (Roberts et al. 2016). Presence of myeloid DC's was more strongly&#xD;
      correlated with a &quot;T-cell inflamed TME signature&quot; as compared to neo-antigen load in 266&#xD;
      melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (Spranger, Luke et al. 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two important human myDCs subsets exist that are differentiated by expression of either the&#xD;
      BDCA-1 or BDCA-3 surface marker. The CD1c (BDCA-1)+ antigen is specifically expressed on&#xD;
      human dendritic cells, which are CD11chighCD123low and represent the major subset of myDCs in&#xD;
      human blood (about 0.6 % of all peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)). CD1c (BDCA-1)+&#xD;
      myDC have a monocytoid morphology and express myeloid markers such as CD13 and CD33 as well&#xD;
      as Fc receptors such as CD32, CD64, and FceRI. Furthermore, myDC are determined to be CD4+,&#xD;
      Lin (CD3, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD56)-, CD2+, CD45RO+, CD141 (BDCA-3)-, CD303 (BDCA-2)-, and&#xD;
      CD304 (BDCA-4/Neuropilin-1)-.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proportion of CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC co-expresses CD14 and CD11b. These dual positive cells&#xD;
      for CD14 and CD1c (BDCA-1) have immunosuppressive capacity and inhibit T-cell proliferation&#xD;
      in vitro. Depletion of this cell type is preferred prior to using CD1c (BDCA-1)+ cells for&#xD;
      immune-stimulatory purposes (Bakdash, Buschow et al. 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC play an important role in the cross-presentation of tumor antigens&#xD;
      following immunogenic cell death (Di Blasio, Wortel et al. 2016). Under conditions of tumor&#xD;
      growth, myDC will be poorly recruited to the tumor microenvironment, do not get activated and&#xD;
      thereby fail to efficiently coordinate anti-tumor immunity within the tumor micro-environment&#xD;
      and present tumor associated antigens within tumor-draining lymph nodes. When activated&#xD;
      appropriately, human CD1c (BDCA-1)+ dendritic cells secrete high levels of IL-12 and potently&#xD;
      prime CTL responses (Di Blasio, Wortel et al. 2016). In vitro, IL-12 production by CD1c&#xD;
      (BDCA-1)+ myDC can be boosted by exogenous IFN-(Nizzoli, Krietsch et al. 2013) CD1c (BDCA-1)+&#xD;
      myDC spontaneously &quot;partially mature&quot; within 12 hours following their isolation. Optimal&#xD;
      maturation with secretion of IFN- as well as the orientation of stimulated T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      towards a Th1 phenotype is only achieved following Toll-like receptor stimulation (Nizzoli,&#xD;
      Krietsch et al. 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal models have established the safety and efficacy of intra-tumoral administration of&#xD;
      ipilimumab. An intratumoral dose of CTLA-4 blocking mAb administered at a ratio of [1:100]&#xD;
      compared to intravenous dosing was found to result in equivalent anti-tumor effect and was&#xD;
      associated with less systemic toxicity (Skold, van Beek et al. 2015) (Marabelle, Kohrt et al.&#xD;
      2013). In an ongoing clinical trial for patients with advanced melanoma, conducted by our&#xD;
      research group, intratumoral injection of CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC together with the CTLA-4&#xD;
      blocking mAb ipilimumab plus intravenous administration of the PD-1 blocking mAb nivolumab&#xD;
      have been proven feasible and safe. Intratumoral administration of an anti-PD-L1 IgG1 mAb may&#xD;
      increase the potential for antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement&#xD;
      dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators have previously investigated the utility of SBRT to primary&#xD;
      tumor and metastatic locations in oligometastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)&#xD;
      patients and found that this treatment was feasible, safe and resulted in an overall&#xD;
      metabolic response rate in 60% of the treated population, with 30% of patients achieving a&#xD;
      complete metabolic remission (Collen, Christian et al. 2014). Radiation therapy (RT) has been&#xD;
      recognized as potentially synergistic with immune checkpoint blockade. Tumor cell killing by&#xD;
      radiation results in release of tumor antigens, reduces the immunosuppression within the TME&#xD;
      and can reinvigorate the cancer-immunity cycle by upregulation of immunogenic cell surface&#xD;
      markers and inducing immunogenic cell death (Dewan, Galloway et al. 2009; Kulzer, Rubner et&#xD;
      al. 2014; Frey, Ruckert et al. 2017). Moreover, it has been shown that RT-induced immunogenic&#xD;
      cell death can trigger DC maturation and activation in vitro (Kulzer et al. 2014), providing&#xD;
      a clear rationale for combining DC-therapy together with RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized phase II clinical trial, the investigators propose to conduct&#xD;
      hypofractionated SBRT in combination with systemic PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade&#xD;
      (pembrolizumab) with or without intratumoral PD-L1/CTLA-4 inhibition plus intratumoral&#xD;
      administration of CD1c (BDCA-1)+ / CD141 (BDCA-3)+ myDC.&#xD;

                  pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures&#xD;
                  or completion.&#xD;
