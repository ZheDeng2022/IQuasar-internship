  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to show whether there is additional benefit of using Lexette and Sorilux in&#xD;
      the beginning of the treatment, and then maintenance treatment of Sorilux alone in moderate&#xD;
      plaque type psoriasis patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind study. Approximately 30 qualified subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled into a 8 weeks study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drugs that will be used in this study are Lexette® (0.05% Halobetasol propionate&#xD;
      foam) and Sorilux® (calcipotriene foam). Both Lexette and Sorilux are approved by the United&#xD;
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to study treatment at a 1:1 ratio: of Lexette plus Sorilux for 2&#xD;
      weeks versus Lexette plus vehicle for 2 weeks. Those subjects who are clear or almost clear&#xD;
      at the end of 2 weeks will be re-randomized into Sorilux for 6 weeks versus vehicle for 6&#xD;
      weeks at 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will attend a Screening Visit/Baseline visit and if found eligible will be&#xD;
      randomized to study treatment. Total study period is 8 weeks. Study visits will be,&#xD;
      screening/baseline, week 2 and week 8. Study assessments will be at each visit: BSA, PGA,&#xD;
      Itch VAS, DLQI, and TLSS in addition to standard medical assessments. There will be a&#xD;
      standard prohibited medication/treatment and washout periods.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at week 2 and week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/Baseline, Week 2, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a ten-question questionnaire used to measure the impact of skin disease on the quality of life of an affected person. Each question is scored on a four-point Likert scale:&#xD;
Very much = 3, A lot = 2, A little = 1, Not at all = 0, Not relevant = 0, Question unanswered = 0. The DLQI is calculated by adding the score of each question, resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. A score higher than 10 indicates that the patient's life is being severely affected by their skin disease.</description>
