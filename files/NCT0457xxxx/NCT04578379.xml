    <textblock>
      Familial Partial Lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2) is a heterogeneous group of rare lipodystrophy&#xD;
      due to autosomal dominant mutation in LMNA encoding Lamin A/C. Lamins A and C form with the&#xD;
      B-type lamins the lamina network underlying the nuclear envelope. Lamins are major components&#xD;
      that provide structural and mechanical stability for the nucleus ubiquitously. Lamins are&#xD;
      also key epigenetic regulator. Mutations in LMNA are involved in different inherited&#xD;
      pathologies as Emery-Dreifuss muscular Dystrophy, Limb Girdle muscular dystrophy, dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease, Charcot Marie Tooth Disorder type 2,&#xD;
      mandibuloacral dysplasia, Hutchinson Gilford progeria and Dunnigan-type-familial partial&#xD;
      lipodystrophy (FPLD2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inherited lipodystrophy prevalence is reported around 1.3 to 10 cases per million worldwide&#xD;
      and FPLD2 is the most frequent of all. Nevertheless, recent reports with systematic screening&#xD;
      in all non-obese patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome found higher prevalence&#xD;
      of lipodystrophy up to 1/7000 subjects. FPLD2 remain a rare group of disease and only&#xD;
      relatively small and heterogeneous cohorts of patients are reported. For this reason it is&#xD;
      difficult to fully decipher all aspects of this rare group of diseases. The &quot;typical&quot; FPLD2&#xD;
      is associated with missense mutation affecting the arginin residue in position 482&#xD;
      (p.R482Q,p.R482W,p.R482L). Patients harbouring mutation in other spot are considered to have&#xD;
      &quot;atypical&quot; lipodystrophy. The &quot;typical&quot; FPLD2 start around puberty with progressive&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat loss in upper limbs, gluteo-femoral adipose tissue and trunk and fat&#xD;
      accumulation in the cervicofacial area, neck, upper trunk, labia majora and visceral fat.&#xD;
      Resulting from the inability to store fat, patients affected by inherited lipodystrophy&#xD;
      develop severe metabolic syndrome and its complications: type 2 diabetes (DT2),&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and premature cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2006 a specific mutation of LMNA has been described in a patient originated from La&#xD;
      Réunion living in France mainland. To date this mutation have only been reported in patient&#xD;
      native from La Réunion and is called 'Reunionese' mutation and consist in a G insertion after&#xD;
      nucleotide 5670 (codon 654) in the prelamin-A-specific exon 11 (g.5670_5671insG) p.T655fsX49&#xD;
      that lead to a longer and non farnelysated prelamin A lacking the C-terminal CSIM motif. As a&#xD;
      result, nonfarnelysated mutated prelamin A accumulated in the cells leading to oxidative&#xD;
      stress and premature cell senescence. The 'Reunionese' mutation is expressed in 2 forms&#xD;
      either homozygous or heterozygous. Homozygous patients present with more severe phenotype and&#xD;
      cardiac laminopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to update the characterization of the patients diagnosed with the&#xD;
      'Reunionese' mutation. The investigators report here the largest cohort of patient with FPLD2&#xD;
      due to one single LMNA mutation either homozygous or heterozygous.&#xD;

      The investigators systematically reviewed the medical records of patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      genetically confirmed FPLD at Reunion University Hospital (La Réunion, France) from 2006&#xD;
      (beginning of the screening for lipodystrophy) to 2020. Due to the high prevalence of&#xD;
      lipodystrophy in our island and to follow the recommendations in follow up, a specific&#xD;
      check-up is organized in our centre since 2016. For this study the investigators collected&#xD;
      the data from patients who carried the same LMNA 'Reunionese' mutation: p.T655fsX49 and who&#xD;
      benefited a complete check-up in our centre since 2016. Between 2006 and 2020, 97 patients&#xD;
      were diagnosed with FPLD at Reunion University Hospital. Three different mutations were&#xD;
      diagnosed: 85 subjects carried the 'Reunionese' mutation LMNA p.T655fsX49 (70 heterozygous&#xD;
      and 15 homozygous), 8 carried the mutation LMNA p.R582H and 3 subjects carried a mutation of&#xD;
      PPARγ. Among the carrier of the mutation LMNA p.T655fsX49, 70 subjects benefit a recent&#xD;
      follow up with complete examination (61 heterozygous (HTZ) and 9 homozygous (HMZ)) and 4&#xD;
      deceased (all carrier of the homozygous form).&#xD;
