  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastomas are the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumors in adults. The&#xD;
      prognosis is poor despite multimodal therapy with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Therefore, novel treatments are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L19TNF is a fully human fusion protein consisting of human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α&#xD;
      fused to the L19 antibody in scFv format, specific to the extra-domain B of fibronectin. TNF&#xD;
      not only induces apoptosis or necrosis in certain target cells, but also exerts inflammation&#xD;
      and immunity. L19TNF selectively delivers TNF to the tumor site to spare normal tissues from&#xD;
      undesired toxicity. Preclinical experiments with L19TNF have demonstrated tumor growth&#xD;
      retardation in various mouse tumor models including models of glioma.&#xD;

Dose Finding Patients will be treated in cohorts according to a traditional 3+3 design with lomustine on Day 1 and L19TNF on Days 1, 3 and 5, and on Days 22, 24 and 26, of a 42-days cycle at different dose levels.&#xD;
The RD will be confirmed following a traditional 3+3 design.&#xD;
Cohort 1: 10 µg /kg L19TNF i.v. plus 90 mg/m2 lomustine Cohort 2: 10 µg /kg L19TNF i.v. plus 110 mg/m2 lomustine Cohort 3: 13 µg /kg L19TNF i.v. plus 110 mg/m2 lomustine&#xD;
The dose of 13 ug/kg L19TNF will be declared the RD in case none of three or not more than one out of 6 patients experienced a DLT. Dose limiting toxicity will be assessed during the dose-escalation from Day 1 through Day 42 after the first administration of lomustine and study drug (Cycle 1). Not more than 2 patients might be treated simultaneously in Cycle 1.</description>
