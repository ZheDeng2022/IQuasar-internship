    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether or not intensified radiation therapy adapted during the&#xD;
      radiation treatment course to high-risk, treatment-resistant tumor regions will improve&#xD;
      overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) compared to conventional&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Progression-free survival rate</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (failure defined as progression or death due to any cause) will be evaluated using standard response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of failures classified by relation to the high-dose radiation region</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patterns of failure (tumor growth) will be classified as follows:&#xD;
Central: &gt;95% of the tumor volume is within the high-dose radiation region&#xD;
In-field: &gt;80% to 95% of the tumor volume is within the high-dose radiation region&#xD;
Marginal: 20-80% of the tumor volume is within the high-dose radiation region&#xD;
Distant: &lt;20% of the tumor volume is within the high-dose radiation region</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Advanced MRI Gross tumor volume (GTV) and its association with overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-RT</time_frame>
    <description>GTV is defined as the combined hypercellularity tumor volume and hyperperfused tumor volume, assessed by high b-value diffusion MRI and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI, respectively. Patients will be grouped into those with less than 2.5 cc GTV and those with 2.5 cc or more GTV. This measure will be used to determine whether advanced MRI metrics can be used to distinguish pseudoprogression from true tumor progression, and to determine whether advanced MR-identified tumor volume 3 months post-chemoradiation is associated with survival.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported quality of life (QOL) using EORTC QLQ-C30 and BN20</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post-RT</time_frame>
    <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a validated questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients, with the EORTC QLQ-BN20 specifically for brain tumor patients. Patients will be classified as having deterioration if there is a clinically meaningful change (10 point drop from baseline) in the QOL scales. The percentage of patients with deterioration in each survey will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported symptom burden using MDASI-BT</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post-RT</time_frame>
    <description>The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) is a validated questionnaire developed to assess the symptom burden of brain tumor patients. Severity of symptoms is scored on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being &quot;not present&quot; and 10 being &quot;as bad as you can imagine.&quot; Patients will be classified as having deterioration if there is a clinically meaningful change (1 point increase in symptom severity from baseline). The percentage of patients with deterioration will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient objective neurocognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post-RT</time_frame>
    <description>Objective neurocognitive function (NCF) testing using Hopkins Verbal Learning Tests, Controlled Oral Word Association, and Trail Making Tests A and B. Test results will be reported as a composite, using the reliable change index (RCI) to categorize patients as improved, stable, or declined from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grade 3 or higher treatment-related toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-RT</time_frame>
