  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With population aging, the number of older persons in Taiwan with cognitive impairments&#xD;
      increases. Recent years witnessed an expansion of governmental policies and services&#xD;
      dedicated to improve long-term care. It is critical to develop an effective cognitive&#xD;
      intervention that can prevent, delay, or slow down cognitive decline. Although literature&#xD;
      support a multi-modal approach to preserve the cognitive capacity of older adults with&#xD;
      cognitive impairments, there is inadequate attention to facilitate the integration of&#xD;
      cognitively therapeutic activities to daily routines, nor to the establishment of a lifestyle&#xD;
      that promote brain health. Therefore, the adherence to the intervention program was low after&#xD;
      the program ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature support the effectiveness of a lifestyle approach to promote the health of and&#xD;
      reduce medical cost for persons with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and&#xD;
      diabetes. Empirical evidence also supports the effectiveness of Lifestyle Redesign&#xD;
      intervention to improve the general health and quality of life of frail older adults. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to combine a multi-modal cognitive intervention and lifestyle redesign&#xD;
      approach to improve the brain health of older persons with cognitive impairments. The goals&#xD;
      of this project are thus three-folds:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a contextualized lifestyle restructuring intervention that facilitates the&#xD;
           integration of cognition-promoting activities into daily routines and examine the&#xD;
           feasibility of this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the effectiveness of a brain-health lifestyle restructuring intervention,&#xD;
           social activity, and passive control in (1) general cognition, activity participation,&#xD;
           activities of daily living function, and quality of life, and (2)physical function and&#xD;
           cognitive function at the end of the intervention, 6 months after, and one year after.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To qualitatively explore the experiences of the participants with the intervention,&#xD;
           perceived effectiveness, and its contextual influences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a three-year project using a combined pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      and multiple case studies mixed-method research design. One hundred twenty-two older adults&#xD;
      with cognitive impairments and residing in community will be recruited and randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the groups of Lifestyle Intervention, Social Activities, and Passive Control. Subjects in&#xD;
      the Lifestyle Intervention group will, in six months, receive sixteen group sessions and six&#xD;
      individualized treatment sessions. Social Activities Group will receive twenty-two group&#xD;
      sessions. Control group will receive patient education materials with each assessment. All&#xD;
      participants will receive pre- and post-intervention, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up&#xD;
      evaluations. Primary outcomes include cognitive function, activity participation, daily&#xD;
      activity functions , and quality of life. Secondary outcomes include physical function,&#xD;
      functional memory, working memory, complex attention, and processing speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, factorial ANNOVA, and Generalized Estimating&#xD;
      Equation will be used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the Lifestyle&#xD;
      Restructuring Intervention. This study will also use multiple case studies to qualitatively&#xD;
      understand the experiences of eight participants about their participation in the&#xD;
      intervention, cognitive decline, and the contextual factors that affects their participation.&#xD;
      Sequential interviews and participant observation will be used to do qualitative data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
