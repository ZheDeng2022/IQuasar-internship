  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major health problem across the globe . Intracranial&#xD;
      pressure (ICP) following TBI can be elevated due to increasing mass effect from hematomas,&#xD;
      contusions, and diffuse brain swelling. Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is a surgical&#xD;
      procedure which involves removing a large part of the skull (bone flap) out to make more room&#xD;
      for the swollen brain.Mass lesions can be acute subdural hematoma (ASDH), intraparenchymal,&#xD;
      brain oedema, or a combination thereof. The most frequent indication for a DC is an acute&#xD;
      subdural hematoma (ASDH). The first modern use of DC following TBI was done by Harvey Cushing&#xD;
      in 1908. Cushing treated head-injured patients with a subtemporal DC and he reported a&#xD;
      substantial reduction in mortality. The management of TBI progressed significantly in the&#xD;
      21st century due to advances in neuroimaging, prehospital management, neurointensive care,&#xD;
      neuroanaesthesia, and rehabilitation. This led to a renaissance of interest in DC for&#xD;
      improvement patient conditions. One of the serious concerns regarding DC is that it may&#xD;
      reduce mortality, but increase the subset of patients with severe disability and persistent&#xD;
      vegetative state. The discrepancy in published outcome may, to some extent, be explained by&#xD;
      difference in patient selection, indications, timing , and technique of surgery. In terms of&#xD;
      surgical consideration regarding DC, it is now well accepted that the dura mater has to be&#xD;
      opened and the minimum diameter of unilateral DC should be around 11-12 cm. Skull&#xD;
      reconstruction (cranioplasty) after improvement of neurological state is recommended.&#xD;
      Decompressive craniectomy provides additional space for the swollen brain and can effectively&#xD;
      reduce ICP, thereby mitigating the risk of herniation. However, despite the positive effect&#xD;
      of DC on uncontrollable intracranial hypertension, the effect of surgical decompression in&#xD;
      mortality and overall functional outcome following TBI remained controversial.&#xD;
