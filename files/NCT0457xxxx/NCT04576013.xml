  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive non-invasive stimulation of nerves on their arm and intensive motor&#xD;
      training of their arm. The timing of the stimulation in relation to the training will vary by&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the differences in improvement of hand and arm function when nerve&#xD;
      stimulation is applied at different times in relation to motor training. The nerve&#xD;
      stimulation, called peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), is non-invasive and painless.&#xD;
      Subjects in the study may receive strong or mild PNS. Subjects will also vary by whether PNS&#xD;
      is delivered for 2 hours before the 2 hours of motor training, or during the 2 hours of motor&#xD;
      training. Which level of stimulation and its timing will be determined randomly for each&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
