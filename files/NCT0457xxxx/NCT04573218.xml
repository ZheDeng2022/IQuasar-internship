  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An unpublished study by the investigators on healthy participants has shown that the&#xD;
      supplementation of oil palm phenolics (OPP) at 250 mg is the optimum dose to demonstrate the&#xD;
      ability to lower total and LDL cholesterol. There is no clinical evidence as yet on that&#xD;
      optimum dosage of OPP supplementation in improving fasting lipid profile in minor&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia subjects. The investigators hypothesize that in a clinical study, OPP&#xD;
      supplemented to the minor hyperlipidemic participants will elicit a reduction in total and&#xD;
      LDL cholesterol while maintaining safety and tolerability. OPP may have the potential to be&#xD;
      positioned as natural health supplement in improving lipid profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oil palm phenolics (OPP) is a product filtrated from vegetation liquor of an aqueous waste&#xD;
      stream following palm oil milling process. A novel process to recover OPP that contains a&#xD;
      high amount of phenolic from the waste has been explored tremendously. Due to the high&#xD;
      phenolic content, OPP has been postulated in possessing various medicinal properties such as&#xD;
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and anti-tumour effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperlipidemia is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). It can be&#xD;
      defined as elevations of fasting total cholesterol or triglyceride concentration or both.&#xD;
      According to a previous research, OPP supplementation to hamster animal model has shown&#xD;
      positive effects in the reduction of total cholesterol and triglycerides as well as&#xD;
      improvement of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). In a previous study using the&#xD;
      rabbit animal model, OPP has shown a protective effect against atherosclerosis, a condition&#xD;
      whereby fat and cholesterol plaques are deposited inside the arteries. Based on the current&#xD;
      evidence from the preliminary studies on OPP, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      supplementation of OPP may prevent or delay the development of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigator's previous clinical trial phase I, an optimum dosage of OPP has been&#xD;
      obtained. Therefore, the investigators proposed a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of OPP to reduce the total and LDL cholesterol in minor hyperlipidemic participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be initiated with the recruitment of 50 volunteers with minor hyperlipidemic&#xD;
      condition. In this study, the participants will be supplemented with placebo/OPP capsules for&#xD;
      60 days. Participants will be required to take the placebo/OPP capsules in front of the study&#xD;
      staff to ensure compliance. Blood samples will be withdrawn at baseline, day 30 and day 60,&#xD;
      and will be analyzed for lipid profile, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory status. Data from&#xD;
      this study would hopefully assist the investigator in understanding the therapeutic roles of&#xD;
      OPP in humans under minor hyperlipidemic conditions.&#xD;
