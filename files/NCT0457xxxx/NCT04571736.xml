  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The medical information delivered to the patient before any surgery constitutes an essential&#xD;
      and compulsory step during the initial management of the operated patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different reasons for the quantity and quality of medical information retained by&#xD;
      the patient. An internet platform with personalized and secure access has been developed.&#xD;
      This platform contains, among other things, an explanatory video of thyroid surgery and&#xD;
      allows the patient to have access to information on surgical management at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that unlimited access for the duration of the study to this&#xD;
      platform could reduce the preoperative anxiety level of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The objective is to assess the impact of additional, personalized and accessible preoperative&#xD;
      medical information via a secure internet platform on the anxiety level of patients before&#xD;
      their surgery. For this, patients agreeing to participate in the study will be randomized&#xD;
      (drawn at random) during the inclusion visit and divided into one of the following two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group: patients included in this group will receive the usual medical&#xD;
           information as part of the surgery performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experimental group: the patients included in this group will have, in addition to&#xD;
           the usual medical information, personalized and secure access to a platform so that they&#xD;
           can have additional information on the surgery performed.&#xD;
