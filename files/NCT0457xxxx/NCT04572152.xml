&#xD;
          3. In dose-escalation cohorts (Phase 1a), subjects must have histologically or&#xD;
             cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor that is refractory or&#xD;
             relapsed to the current standard therapies, or for which no effective standard therapy&#xD;
             is available, or whereby standard therapy has been refused.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In pharmacodynamic-confirmation cohorts (Phase 1a), additional enrolled subjects must&#xD;
             have histologically or cytologically confirmed selected advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
             tumors, refractory or relapsed to the current standard therapies, or for which no&#xD;
             effective standard therapy is available. Other tumor types can be considered after&#xD;
             discussion with the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In dose-expansion cohorts (Phase 1b), subjects with specific tumor types will be&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Non-sterile males must be willing to use a highly effective method of birth control&#xD;
             for the duration of the study and within 120 days after the last dose of&#xD;
