      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who get COVID-19 have a wide range of symptoms. They also recover from COVID-19 in&#xD;
      different ways. In this study, researchers will use survey data to describe the different&#xD;
      ways people experience and recover from COVID-19. They will also use the data to help create&#xD;
      future studies to understand why some people do not fully recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the range and timing of symptoms that people have before, during, and&#xD;
      after COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who can give documentation of a positive COVID-19 or antibody test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a telephone interview. It will take 15 minutes. They will&#xD;
      provide their COVID-19 test results and medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a second telephone interview. It will take 30 60 minutes. They&#xD;
      will also take online surveys every 3 months for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview and surveys will ask participants about their health before they got COVID-19,&#xD;
      what happened while they had COVID-19, and what their recovery has been like.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get log-in data to take the online surveys. Completing all of the surveys&#xD;
      the first time may take up to 3 hours. Follow-up surveys will take up to 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Participants do not have to complete the surveys in one sitting. They will be able to save&#xD;
      their progress and finish the surveys later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted to take part in other research studies.&#xD;

      Title: Natural History of Post-Coronavirus Disease 19 Convalescence at the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description: In late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS/CoV2 appeared in Wuhan, China.&#xD;
      The various ways that humans will recover from COVID-19 is just starting to be observed and&#xD;
      it is clear there will be a wide range of convalescent experiences. A year into the pandemic,&#xD;
      the post-acute sequelae of SARS/CoV2 infection (PASC) is known to be common and includes a&#xD;
      broad range of symptoms and potential pathologies. This phased protocol is designed to&#xD;
      observe and study the convalescence and recoveries from acute SARS/CoV2 infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase A Phase A Surveying (Phase A) will enable people in the community that are convalescing&#xD;
      from COVID-19 to be studied&#xD;
&#xD;
      using telephone interviews and internet-based questionnaires. The objective of Phase A&#xD;
      Surveying is to observe and describe the range of medical syndromes that occur in the wake of&#xD;
      an acute SARS/CoV2 infection. Participants are required to be within the first six months of&#xD;
      their recovery and have documentation of a positive laboratory test for COVID-19. .Additional&#xD;
      cohorts of persons with neurological sequelae, persons with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19&#xD;
      with negative testing, and participants co-enrolled in other research studies within the&#xD;
      Division of Intramural Research will also be studied. The data collected during Phase A will&#xD;
      describe the range of symptoms and patterns of symptom clustering of PASC. This data will&#xD;
      also characterize the patient populations which have been or will be evaluated at the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase B Evaluation (Phase B) will allow surveyed participants of research interest from Phase&#xD;
      A to be invited to the NIH Clinical Center for a medical evaluation and to undergo a panel of&#xD;
      standard research measurements. Each participant will be medically and psychologically&#xD;
      characterized to best understand if their complaints can be attributed to known disorders.&#xD;
      The observations made during Phase B will provide insights into the range, character, and&#xD;
      subtypes of PASC. Individuals found to have disorders being studied within the Division of&#xD;
      Intermural Research at NIH will be appropriately&#xD;
&#xD;
      referred. Evaluated individuals with persistent symptoms in the absence of demonstrable&#xD;
      medical disease and individuals who fully recovered from SARS/CoV2 will be invited back to&#xD;
      the NIH Clinical Center for broad and deep research measurements Phase C Deep Phenotyping&#xD;
      (Phase C)employed will be synchronized with other NIH-approved deep phenotyping protocols to&#xD;
      foster crossphenotype comparison research with other medical syndromes, such as Myalgic&#xD;
      Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI). Deep&#xD;
      phenotyping characterizations would be used to generate scientific hypotheses for testing in&#xD;
      future studies and for cross-comparisons with other fatiguing disorders. Evaluated&#xD;
      individuals with PASC may be invited to participate in Phase D Longitudinal Evaluation phase&#xD;
      (Phase D). This would enable the observation of the natural history of PASC and allow for&#xD;
      exploration of the biological mechanisms underlying successful&#xD;
&#xD;
      recovery and how recovery can go awry. Previous epidemics have created unique medical&#xD;
      syndromes in the past. Data from this protocol may be used to characterize PASC and any&#xD;
      Post-COVID 19 Syndrome subtypes that may be discovered. If warranted, a Criteria Development&#xD;
      phase will develop data-driven research consensus criteria for defining PASC and any&#xD;
      Post-COVID&#xD;
&#xD;
      19 Syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this protocol will provide novel insights into COVID- 19 convalescence and its&#xD;
      potential outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current version of the protocol provides the details for Phase A, Phase B, and Phase C.&#xD;
      Additional phases will be detailed in planned protocol amendments.&#xD;
