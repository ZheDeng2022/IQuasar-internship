  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the treatment outcome of pulpotomy using Biodentine or&#xD;
      Portland cement regarding success rate and post-operative pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      -  Patients will be screened for eligibility through obtaining medical and dental histories&#xD;
           together with clinical [visual, palpation, percussion, cold sensitivity testing and&#xD;
           probing] and radiographic evaluations for the teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After ensuring eligibilty, profound local anesthesia of the tooth will be achieved using&#xD;
           4% Articaine with 1: 100000 epinephrine (Septodont. Saint-Maur-des-Fosses. France).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caries will be removed using a round, high-speed bur with adequate water cooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cases will be randomly divided into two groups according to pulpotomy material either:&#xD;
           Biodentine or Portland cement. Biodentine is mixed according to manufacturer's&#xD;
           instructions and placed in a 2-3 mm layer above the pulp tissue using an amalgam carrier&#xD;
           and gently packed using a condenser. Initial setting is achieved after 12 minutes.&#xD;
           Preparation of Portland cement: Industrial Portland cement is mixed with Bisthmus oxide&#xD;
           or Barium sulphate radio-opacifier in a 3:1 ratio. The mix is sieved through silk sieve&#xD;
           then sterilized in hot air oven at 135 ֯C for 2 hours. Portland cement is mixed in a 3:1&#xD;
           powder: distilled water ratio and placed in the pulp chamber and condensed against a&#xD;
           moist cotton pellet. A small cotton pellet moistened with saline is placed in the pulp&#xD;
           chamber against PC for 5 seconds to ensure water uptake then removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appropriate interim restoration will be done and checked throughout follow up period.&#xD;
           Patients will be referred for final restoration after endpoint of research. A&#xD;
           post-operative periapical radiograph is taken after interim restoration placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be contacted by telephone by the same operator to record pain intensity&#xD;
           (at 6, 12, 24, 48 and after 7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and radiographic evaluation is scheduled at 3 months postoperatively, and the&#xD;
           outcome will be determined according to clinical and radiographic criteria. Clinical&#xD;
           criteria include: absence of tenderness to palpation or percussion and the tooth is&#xD;
           functional, normal mobility and probing pocket depth. Soft tissues around the tooth are&#xD;
           normal with no swelling or sinus tract. Radiographic criteria include: absence of&#xD;
           periapical pathosis evident on the radiograph such as root resorption, root canal&#xD;
           calcification, furcal pathosis or new periapical rarefaction. In case of failure, the&#xD;
           tooth will be treated endodontically and referred for final restoration.&#xD;
