  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center prospective study involving analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)&#xD;
      and the gut microbiome in patients with metastatic breast cancer on standard of care&#xD;
      endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor in combination with an inhibitor of the&#xD;
      cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). Up to 20 patients with Estrogen Receptor positive&#xD;
      (ER+), Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer and&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 will be enrolled. This study&#xD;
      involves the collection and analysis of patient samples and does not involve therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endocrine therapies have been associated with an overall survival benefit in breast cancer&#xD;
      and are the preferred initial treatment approach in patients with ER+, HER2- metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer. Unfortunately, resistance to endocrine therapies eventually develops in the&#xD;
      metastatic setting and metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease. Endocrine&#xD;
      resistance may develop as a result of alterations in estrogen signaling and metabolism&#xD;
      pathways, which may be modulated by gut bacteria. In addition, genomic profiling of archival&#xD;
      tissues and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in ER+ breast cancer has identified multiple&#xD;
      somatic molecular alterations that may mediate response to endocrine therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to identify markers of endocrine resistance in ctDNA and the gut&#xD;
      microbiome in patients with ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
