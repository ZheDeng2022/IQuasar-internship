  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of transcutaneous tibial&#xD;
      neuro-stimulation (TTNS) in improving bladder emptying in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting with MS and performing clean intermittent self-catheterization (CISC) to&#xD;
      empty the bladder in the context of voiding dysfunction, will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be randomly assigned to two distinct arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PTNS de verum : patients will be treated with transcutaneous tibial neuro-stimulation at&#xD;
           a rate of one session of 30 consecutive minutes daily for a period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PTNS placebo : Patients will be treated with placebo (i.e. no current) transcutaneous&#xD;
           tibial neuro-stimulation for 30 consecutive minutes daily for a period of 12 weeks (same&#xD;
           treatment regimen as the experimental group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy in improving voiding dysfunction will be assessed 12 weeks after randomization using&#xD;
      the BVE ratio (Bladder Voiding Efficiency) = Ratio of urine volume / total bladder volume.&#xD;
