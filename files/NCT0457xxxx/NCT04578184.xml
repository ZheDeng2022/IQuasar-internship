  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In keratoconic eyes, the corneal epithelium shows a localized thinning over the cone that is&#xD;
      surrounded by an annulus of epithelial thickening. It has been postulated that epithelial&#xD;
      thickness mapping can be a sensitive tool for the keratoconus diagnosis. In keratoconus&#xD;
      screening the 5 mm diameter of the corneal centrum may be sufficient while studies have shown&#xD;
      that the cone apex is located in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to assess agreement and repeatability of epithelial thickness&#xD;
      measurements using two optical coherence tomography devices in healthy and keratoconus&#xD;
      corneas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to evaluate the differences between healthy and keratoconus eyes using&#xD;
      epithelial thickness map data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective monocentric study that includes patients divided into two groups:&#xD;
      patients with keratoconus and a control group formed out of patients without corneal&#xD;
      pathologies. For each patient only one eye will be included and corneal measurements will be&#xD;
      performed, focused on the corneal epithelium thickness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total 50 eyes of 50 patients will be included, divided into two groups: study group&#xD;
      comprised of 20 eyes with diagnosed keratoconus and a control group formed out of 30 healthy&#xD;
      eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will be measured with the corneal acquisition mode, also&#xD;
      allowing for epithelium thickness data, on each device without pupil dilatation. After each&#xD;
      measurement patients will be asked to blink in order to allow adequate tear-film recovery.&#xD;
      Each patient will be measured three times with both devices. Only one visit will be&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order in which the measurements will be performed (Anterion or MS-39) will be randomised&#xD;
      using randomised.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The corneal epithelial thickness will be measured as the distance between the air-tear and&#xD;
      the epithelium-Bowman interfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Mean differences in central corneal epithelial thickness between the devices investigated&#xD;
      (+ limits of agreement (1.96xSD) between the investigated devices)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeatability coefficient (within subject standard deviation - SD) and coefficient of&#xD;
           variation of the two devices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison in epithelial thickness between normal and keratoconus eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitivity and specificity of swept-source OCT device in keratoconus diagnosis&#xD;
