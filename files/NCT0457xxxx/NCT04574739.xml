      Fetal monitoring by transabdominal electrocardiogram recording&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiotocography (CTG), or electronic fetal monitoring (EFM), is the most common procedure&#xD;
      used for fetal assessment before and during labour and largely replaced the use of&#xD;
      intermittent heart rate auscultation with the Pinard stethoscope or intrapartal analysis of&#xD;
      fetal pH by scalp sampling. It relies on acoustic methods in the audible (auscultation) and&#xD;
      inaudible range of the sound spectrum (ultrasound). Ever since its introduction in the late&#xD;
      1960s, the benefit of the method has been controversial. Not only the great inter- and&#xD;
      intra-observer variability due to visual interpretation of CTG traces seems to be an issue,&#xD;
      but also the technical difficulties of the method: data assessment in adipose patients,&#xD;
      active fetuses or multiple gestation, confusions between fetal and maternal pulse, assessment&#xD;
      during water delivery, strong contractions or changing labour positions of the parturient. It&#xD;
      is common knowledge that CTG leads to unnecessary medical interventions such as caesarean&#xD;
      section and vaginal-operative deliveries, with the associated health consequences and&#xD;
      economic costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the continuous progress made in CTG technology in the past 50 years, CTG devices&#xD;
      still have drawbacks, namely their bulkiness (including cables and bedside computers),&#xD;
      combined with the limited informative value and suboptimal reliability of the measured&#xD;
      signals. The assessment can be uncomfortable for the pregnant patient, due to the fact that&#xD;
      the patient is bound to a machine and implicitly to the bed, particularly when a longer&#xD;
      surveillance is needed. Long periods of immobility can lead to further medical and psychical&#xD;
      problems during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wireless methods of fetal monitoring exist; nevertheless, the technical difficulties of the&#xD;
      assessment seem to be more pronounced when these are employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine continuous monitoring of physiological signals in normal and extraordinary&#xD;
      environments provides useful insides for better understanding and modelling of human&#xD;
      physiology. Under contract by the European Space Agency (ESA), the Swiss Centre for&#xD;
      Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) has designed and developed the LTMS system (Long Term&#xD;
      Medical System) system. In 2003, ESA commissioned CSEM to do a definition study for a&#xD;
      prototype of LTMS. Following the outcomes of this study, in 2006 CSEM built a first prototype&#xD;
      (LTMS-2) for ESA, which was validated at Bern University Hospital in 2008. In the subsequent&#xD;
      phase (LTMS-3, 2009-2010), CSEM manufactured a set of upgraded systems which were validated&#xD;
      in Antarctica (Concordia Station) in 2010 and during the Rio-Tinto field test of the Austrian&#xD;
      Space Forum spacesuit simulator in 2011. In 2015, CSEM delivered to ESA a new sensor system&#xD;
      (LTMS-S) with yet improved measuring functionalities and higher overall integration in an&#xD;
      easy to-wear vest. The system has been shipped to the Concordia Station in Antarctica for the&#xD;
      scientific investigation for monitoring the physiological adaptation of manned crews in&#xD;
      remote, isolated, and extreme environments. An in-depth clinical validation study at the&#xD;
      University Hospital in Lausanne has shown that the performance of the system was within the&#xD;
      contractual specifications and that it fulfilled the requirements set by international&#xD;
      medical standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it has initially been proposed to adapt and use LTMS-S for fetal ECG (fECG)&#xD;
      measurements, reconsidering the required noise level and resolution to capture fECG, it has&#xD;
      been decided to modify and use the ECGi-CDWe system, which has evolved from LTMS-S and&#xD;
      belongs to the cooperative sensors family of CSEM. This system outperforms LTMS-S in terms of&#xD;
      noise level, resolution, and also number of electrodes that can be connected (&gt;200). The said&#xD;
      system has been designed in the frame of an industrial mandate by respecting the requirements&#xD;
      of medical device development. Therefore a reduced version of ECGi-CDWe has been developed,&#xD;
      hereafter called ELAINE system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed project ELAINE is to build a state of the art fetal&#xD;
      surveillance system using this technology and by applying electrocardiography (ECG) as main&#xD;
      surveillance method. The project leaders believe that this could substantially improve the&#xD;
      quality of continuous fetal monitoring before and during labour, in particular in terms of&#xD;
      specificity. From measuring a full ECG with the detachable ELAINE sensors instead of heart&#xD;
      rate-based CTG, the project leaders expect a higher reliability in the monitoring of the&#xD;
      health status of the unborn. The systems based on LTMS technology are unobtrusive and do not&#xD;
      require cabling to bedside devices, increasing the maternal comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned before, the goal of the study is to adapt the ECGi-CDWe technology for fetal&#xD;
      surveillance. The full currently existing adult oriented LTMS-S system consists of a Master&#xD;
      unit connected to 8 measurement units via 2 cables. Reference and Guard electrode connections&#xD;
      are an integral part of the Master unit. The system is powered by a single battery attached&#xD;
      to the Master unit. 8 measurement units are powered from the Master unit via the 2 cables&#xD;
      connecting them to the Master unit. ELAINE system, being a part of the cooperative sensors&#xD;
      family of CSEM, benefits from a simple cabling scheme as opposed to the star topology&#xD;
      connection employed in almost any multi-lead ECG measurement systems in the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On one hand, the ELAINE sensors are small, unobtrusive and comfortable to wear. On the other&#xD;
      hand, they deliver a wide range of detailed signals with high accuracy. The ECG measured with&#xD;
      ELAINE contains for example all the information necessary to diagnose arrhythmic heart&#xD;
      diseases. The demonstrated high accuracy of the technology will enable the responsible team&#xD;
      at CSEM and the project leaders to record full fetal ECGs (fECGs), thus giving a more&#xD;
      accurate image of the cardiac health status of the fetus and making interventions more&#xD;
      effective. To make diagnoses even more accurate, the sensors developped by CSEM measure a&#xD;
      wealth of additional, signals, e.g. body sounds (potential for fetal heart auscultation),&#xD;
      muscular activity (ideal for measuring contractions), vibrations (physical activity of the&#xD;
      fetus). Finally, the ELAINE technology allows connecting many sensors in a very simple manner&#xD;
      (employing only a single two-wire bus for all sensors), making it very easy to simultaneously&#xD;
      record signals on different spots of the mother's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECG monitoring sensors will be tested at the Maternity Ward of the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Bern, in a first phase before labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-step validation has been planned to validate the measurements performed by the ELAINE&#xD;
      system: first it will be validated against the non-invasive gold standard to measure fetal&#xD;
      heart rate, i.e. CTG, and secondly it will be validated against a conventional ECG system to&#xD;
      measure maternal ECG. This two-step validation is justified as follows: CTG can extract fetal&#xD;
      heart rate information; however, not the complete ECG morphology. With ELAINE, the project&#xD;
      leaders claim to acquire fetal ECG signal rather than only fetal heart rate information.&#xD;
      Therefore, a validation only involving CTG will be a partial one. In order to complete the&#xD;
      validation, considering that the primary function of the ELAINE system is to acquire ECG&#xD;
      signals, it will be validated against a conventional ECG system which acquires maternal ECG.&#xD;
      In order to mitigate the risk of perturbation due to simultaneous connection of two ECG&#xD;
      systems, measurements will be conducted one after another - with the justification that ECG&#xD;
      morphology of a certain individual does not change in the time frame the experiments were&#xD;
      conducted. After the registration, the computer will filter and separate the two ECG curves&#xD;
      (fetal and maternal), based on the maternal ECG, which is available from the conventional&#xD;
      measurement, and on the fetal heart frequency, which is available after registration with&#xD;
      CTG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first and last quarter of the recording duration, both ELAINE and a conventional&#xD;
      CTG system will be connected to the maternal abdomen. Fetal heart rate information acquired&#xD;
      by CTG will be compared with the one to be extracted from ELAINE. During the second and third&#xD;
      quarters of the recordings, only the ELAINE device will be placed on the maternal abdomen to&#xD;
      perform measurements in the absence of the CTG system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two measurement electrodes of ELAINE will be connected to the maternal chest. An ECG&#xD;
      recording will be performed for 5 minutes. Then a conventional 2-lead ECG will be connected&#xD;
      to the maternal chest upon removal of the ELAINE system. An ECG recording of same duration&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project leaders believe that the technology developed for ESA in the LTMS series has the&#xD;
      potential to fundamentally change EFM, with the end goal to improve the clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      deliveries. For this, the project leaders envisage a product which produces more accurate&#xD;
      data on the fetal health status than current CTG devices and which is more comfortable to&#xD;
      wear. Following the reasoning above, the project leaders think that this can be achieved with&#xD;
      ECG measurements. In ELAINE, the project leaders will for the first time demonstrate that the&#xD;
      ELAINE technology is appropriate for monitoring fetal health.&#xD;
