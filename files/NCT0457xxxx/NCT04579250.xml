    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness. It is caused by influenza viruses that&#xD;
      infect the nose, throat, and lungs. Some people, such as older people, young children, and&#xD;
      people with certain health conditions, are at high risk of serious flu complications.&#xD;
      Researchers want to test a vaccine to prevent flu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the H10 Ferritin vaccine is safe and how the body responds to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy test (if needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get 1-2 injections of the study vaccine in the upper arm. They will stay in&#xD;
      the clinic for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a diary card for 7 days after each vaccination. They will record their&#xD;
      temperature and any symptoms. They will measure any skin changes at the injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have nose and throat secretions, and/or oral mucosal samples, collected with&#xD;
      a disposable swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may have apheresis. A needle is placed into a vein in both arms. Blood is&#xD;
      removed through a needle in the vein of one arm. The blood is spun in a machine that&#xD;
      separates the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the participant through&#xD;
      a needle in the other arm. Before apheresis, participants weight, pulse, and blood pressure&#xD;
      will be checked. Their medical history will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 8-10 follow-up visits. Participation will last about 10 months.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of VRC-FLUNPF0103-00-VP in 2 regimens. The hypotheses are&#xD;
      that the vaccine is safe and tolerable and will elicit an immune response. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine in&#xD;
      healthy adults. Secondary objectives are related to immunogenicity of the investigational&#xD;
      vaccine and dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Products:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational vaccine, VRC-FLUNPF0103-00-VP (H10ssF-6473), was developed by the Vaccine&#xD;
      Research Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and is&#xD;
      composed of Helicobacter pylori non-heme ferritin assembled with influenza virus H10&#xD;
      haemagglutinin (HA) insert to form a nanoparticle displaying eight HA stabilized stems&#xD;
      trimers from A/Jiangxi/IPB13/2013 (H10N8) influenza. The vaccine is supplied in single-use&#xD;
      vials at a concentration of 180 mcg/mL. VRC-PBSPLA043-00-VP consisting of sterile phosphate&#xD;
      buffered saline (PBS) will be the diluent for H10ssF-6473. Prepared study product will be&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle via needle and syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults between the ages of 18-70 will be enrolled; adults born between 1965 and 1970&#xD;
      will be excluded from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 1 or 2&#xD;
      doses of H10ssF-6473 in a dose-escalation design. In Group 1, the first 3 subjects will&#xD;
      receive a single low dose (20 mcg) of H10ssF-6473 on Day 0. If assessed as safe and tolerable&#xD;
      two weeks after vaccination of the third subject, enrollment will continue for the additional&#xD;
      subjects in Group 1 and begin for Group 2A. For Group 1, the protocol requires 1 vaccination&#xD;
      visit, 8 follow-up visits, and a telephone contact after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 2A and 2B are stratified by age as shown in the vaccination schema. In Group 2A, the&#xD;
      first 3 subjects will receive a higher dose (60 mcg) of H10ssF-6473 on Day 0. If assessed as&#xD;
      safe and tolerable two weeks after vaccination of the third subject, enrollment will continue&#xD;
      in Group 2A, begin for Group 2B, and subjects may receive the second vaccination at week 16.&#xD;
      For Groups 2A and 2B, the protocol requires 2 vaccination visits, 10 follow-up visits, and a&#xD;
      telephone contact after each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all groups, solicited reactogenicity will be evaluated using a 7-day diary card.&#xD;
      Assessment of vaccine safety will include clinical observation and monitoring of&#xD;
      hematological and chemical parameters at clinical visits throughout the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children are not eligible to participate in this clinical trial because the investigational&#xD;
        vaccine has not been previously evaluated in adults. If the product is assessed as safe and&#xD;
        immunogenic, other protocols designed for children may be conducted in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIH Employees&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIH employees and members of their immediate families may participate in this protocol. We&#xD;
        will follow the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in NIH Research Studies and will&#xD;
        give each employee a copy of the 'NIH Information Sheet on Employee Research Participation'&#xD;
        and a copy of the 'Leave Policy for NIH Employees Participating in NIH Medical Research&#xD;
        Studies.'&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either beneficial or&#xD;
        adverse, on the participant s employment or work situation. The NIH information sheet&#xD;
        regarding NIH employee research participation will be distributed to all potential subjects&#xD;
        who are NIH employees. The employee subject s privacy and confidentiality will be preserved&#xD;
        in accordance with NIH CC and NIAID policies. For NIH employee subjects, consent will be&#xD;
        obtained by an individual who is independent of the employee s team. If the individual&#xD;
        obtaining consent is a co-worker to the subject, independent monitoring of the consent&#xD;
        process will be included through the Bioethics Consultation Service. Protocol study staff&#xD;
        will be trained on obtaining potentially sensitive and private information from co-workers&#xD;
        or subordinates.&#xD;
