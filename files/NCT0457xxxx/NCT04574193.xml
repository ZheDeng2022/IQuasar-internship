  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project extends successful Phase I work that developed a Continuing Care mobile&#xD;
      application (app) for probationers and parolees with SUDs who are at elevated risk of&#xD;
      relapse, re-arrest, and incarceration. This Phase II STTR project will finalize app&#xD;
      development and evaluate its efficacy in a randomized controlled trial. The project has high&#xD;
      public health significance due to its potential to provide an accessible recovery support&#xD;
      tool for individuals on probation or parole that could improve their substance use disorder&#xD;
      treatment outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substance use disorders (SUDs) continue to be one of the most serious public health problems&#xD;
      in the US. Studies have consistently documented a substantially higher prevalence of SUDs&#xD;
      among adults under criminal justice supervision in the community (i.e., probation or parole)&#xD;
      as compared to the general population. There is growing recognition that addiction is a&#xD;
      chronic health condition, and individuals with SUDs typically cycle through multiple periods&#xD;
      of treatment, abstinence, and relapse over several years to achieve and maintain recovery.&#xD;
      Studies show that continuing care interventions can provide ongoing support or extend primary&#xD;
      treatment gains with respect to reducing substance use, relapse, and criminal activity.&#xD;
      Recent diffusion of Internet and smartphone technologies among disadvantaged populations now&#xD;
      offers unprecedented opportunities for increasing access to quality continuing care&#xD;
      interventions as well as chronic disease self-management tools. Probationers and parolees at&#xD;
      high risk for drug abuse relapse and involvement in health compromising behaviors are an&#xD;
      important population that stands to benefit from continuing care technologies. However, to&#xD;
      date, no such technologies exist that are specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of&#xD;
      this high-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on our team's extensive experience in the fields of criminology and substance use,&#xD;
      we propose to complete the development of a Continuing Care mobile application (app) and&#xD;
      conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess efficacy among clients on probation or parole&#xD;
      who are enrolled in outpatient substance use treatment. The app is designed to meet the&#xD;
      recovery and personal support needs of probationers and parolees with SUDs who are at&#xD;
      elevated risk of relapse, re-arrest, and incarceration. It is guided by the principles of the&#xD;
      transtheoretical model of behavior change and app content is derived from the Your Own&#xD;
      Reintegration System (YOURS) program, an empirically-supported16 intervention that focuses on&#xD;
      substance use recovery, reducing criminal thinking and behavior, and managing and building&#xD;
      support systems. If proven to be efficacious, the app could be deployed across the national&#xD;
      network of outpatient treatment providers, and be highly significant in its direct impact on&#xD;
      public health.&#xD;
