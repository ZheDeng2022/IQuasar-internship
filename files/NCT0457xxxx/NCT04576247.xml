    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this research is to assess the feasibility of a 12-week combined aerobic&#xD;
      exercise (AEx) and resistance exercise (REx) intervention and elucidate the impact of AEx/REx&#xD;
      on several physiological and behavioral components of energy balance among breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors (BCS).&#xD;

    <description>The 12-week intervention will build upon an ongoing resistance exercise program for cancer patients and survivors at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Health and Wellness Center. Resistance exercise will be led by certified cancer exercise specialists who provide individualized exercise programs to cancer patients and survivors. Exercise sessions are progressive, target all major muscle groups, are 50 minutes in duration, and completed 2x/week.&#xD;
The intervention will also include 3 self-directed moderate-intensity aerobic exercise sessions/week, building to 50 minutes at 60% heart rate maximum (determined at baseline). Target exercise will be achieved by a gradual progression of exercise duration over the first four weeks of the program.</description>
