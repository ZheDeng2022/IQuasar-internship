  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity occurs in 19% of adult Europeans. Non-specific&#xD;
      low-back pain is one of the most prevalent symptoms and the main cause of disability in&#xD;
      industrialized countries, generating significant public health expenditure on health and&#xD;
      occupational care. The combination of pain neurophysiology education and therapeutic exercise&#xD;
      has shown positive effects in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. Mobile health&#xD;
      tools (mHealth) are proposed as a cost-effective alternative to continuously record the daily&#xD;
      activities of patients and to provide rapid feedback to users and clinicians, reducing visits&#xD;
      to clinics. A 4-week (8-session) education and exercise-based intervention will be carried&#xD;
      out in a group of patients with non-specific chronic low back pain using two modalities: (1)&#xD;
      face-to-face guided by a health professional or (2) self-managed through BackFit App. The&#xD;
      sample will be divided into two groups and will be evaluated before (pre), after (post) and 3&#xD;
      months (follow-up) after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the influence of a 4-week (8 sessions) intervention based on education (about&#xD;
           pain neurophysiology and healthy lifestyle habits) and physical exercise (strength,&#xD;
           flexibility, joint mobility, and self-massage) on pressure pain thresholds (PPT) and&#xD;
           cognitive functioning (selective attention), as primary variable outcomes, and on&#xD;
           physical condition (balance and range of movement), affective and cognitive symptoms&#xD;
           (mood, anxiety, catastrophizing, fear-avoidance beliefs and kinesiophobia), pain&#xD;
           interference and self-reported clinical pain, as secondary variable outcomes, in&#xD;
           patients with non-specific chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile health application developed by researchers&#xD;
           (BackFit App) to carry out the intervention, in comparison with a supervised&#xD;
           intervention by a health professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This intervention based on education and physical exercise will increase PPT and improve&#xD;
           selective attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This intervention will also improve physical condition, self-reported clinical pain,&#xD;
           affective and cognitive symptoms and pain interference presented by patients with&#xD;
           chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The intervention performed with BackFit App will be as effective as that supervised by a&#xD;
           health professional.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive functioning assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive functioning was assessed by recording electroencephalographic activity during a computerized version of the Flanker task, which measures selective attention, under two experimental conditions: congruent flanks (arrows) with the target (pointing in the same direction as the central arrow) and incongruent (pointing the opposite direction).Regarding Resting EEG a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis has been made (delta, theta, &quot;Alpha&quot; and beta 1, 2 and 3. The EEG during the &quot;Flanker task&quot; was analyzed by means of a &quot;Cluster-based analysis&quot;. Primary outcome measures were recorded in a counterbalanced order and were measured at baseline and 4 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Heart Rate Variability (HRV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has been analyzed from ECG data. Primary outcome Measures were recorded in a counterbalanced order and were measured at baseline and 4 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Pressure pain thresholds (PPT).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate Pressure pain thresholds (PPT )(with a maximum of 5kg/cm2) will be applied pressure on the erector spinae and index finger with an algometer (area 1cm2). Primary outcome measures were recorded in a counterbalanced order and were measured at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Mono and bipedal static balance will be measured with the Wii balance board. Measurements will be performed after 15 minutes of rest once the subject arrives at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Range of movement of the hip will be measured with a goniometer. Measurements will be performed after balance measurements at baseline, 4 and Range of movement of the hip will be measured with a goniometer. Measurements will be performed after balance measurements at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical pain will be measured with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10cm) This outcome was measured at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain interference data will be collected with the Spanish version of Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (0-100%). This outcome was measured at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. A higher score indicates greater functional disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Affective symptoms (Mood)</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaires will be performed during rest prior to balance and range of movement measurements at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mood, often associated to chronic pain, will be assessed by the Spanish versions of Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire.&#xD;
The POMS questionnaire (Ranges from 0-200) assesses six mood subscales: tension-anxiety (0-36), anger-hostility (0-48), vigor (0-32), fatigue (0-28), depression (0-60) and confusion (0-28).&#xD;
High vigor scores reflect a good mood or emotion. Low scores in the other subscales reflect a good mood or emotion</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Affective symptoms (anxiety)</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaires will be performed during rest prior to balance and range of movement measurements at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety, often associated to chronic pain, will be assessed by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire. State (0-30) and Trate (0-30). Higher scores indicates greater anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive symptoms (catastrophizing)</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaires will be performed during rest prior to balance and range of movement measurements at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Other cognitive symptoms, such as catastrophyzing, will be assessed using the Spanish version of Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)(Ranges from 0-52), a 13-item scale where low scores show little catastrophization, and high values, high catastrophization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive symptoms (fear-avoidance beliefs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaires will be performed during rest prior to balance and range of movement measurements at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Other cognitive symptoms, such as fear-avoidance beliefs will be also assessed using Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ).(ranges from 0-96) Higher scores indicate more strongly held fear avoidance beliefs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive symptoms (kinesiophobia)</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaires will be performed during rest prior to balance and range of movement measurements at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Other cognitive symptoms, such as kinesiophobia (or fear of movement) will be also assessed using the spanish version of Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK).&#xD;
It consists of 11 items scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The higher the score, the higher the degree of kinesiophobia.</description>
