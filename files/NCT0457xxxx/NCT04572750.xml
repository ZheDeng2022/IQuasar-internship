  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepines (e.g., Ativan, Xanax) are widely prescribed medications that are used mainly&#xD;
      to treat anxiety and sleeping difficulties. Long-term use of benzodiazepine carries risks of&#xD;
      physical dependence, addiction, falls and other accidents, and problems in&#xD;
      thinking/concentrating. Researchers in Canada developed a printed self-help packet that&#xD;
      enabled many individuals to reduce or cease taking benzodiazepines on their own. This study&#xD;
      is designed to tailor that packet to the Veteran population, convert it to an app that people&#xD;
      can use on their laptop or smart phone, and test whether the app helps promote benzodiazepine&#xD;
      prescribing.&#xD;

      Background: Long-term use of benzodiazepine medication has been increasing sharply inside and&#xD;
      outside of VA, raising the risk of cognitive decline, falls, and overdose among patients. A&#xD;
      self-directed benzodiazepine tapering intervention known as EMPOWER was shown effective in a&#xD;
      non-VA clinical trial, and within VA there is significant interest in tailoring it to and&#xD;
      providing it for Veterans. Significance: Although often useful as short-term medications,&#xD;
      when taken for extended periods benzodiazepines carry risk of cognitive decline and other&#xD;
      brain damage, falls and other accidents, benzodiazepine dependence and opioid-benzodiazepine&#xD;
      overdose (VA Pharmacy Benefits Management Academic Detailing Service, 2017). This is major&#xD;
      concern within VA, which prescribes benzodiazepines to over 350,000 Veterans a year, 2/3 of&#xD;
      whom take them long-term (i.e., 3 months or more) (VA Pharmacy Benefits Management Academic&#xD;
      Detailing Service, 2017). Innovation: Because the EMPOWER intervention was paper-and-pencil&#xD;
      based, it would be useful to convert it to an electronic version that worked on smart phones,&#xD;
      tablets, and/or desktop computers. Accordingly, the proposed project intends to convert&#xD;
      EMPOWER to electronic format and to tailor it to the needs and preferences of the Veteran&#xD;
      population. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Tailor a promising non-VA benzodiazepine cessation&#xD;
      intervention (EMPOWER) to Veterans and simultaneously convert it from paper-and-pencil to&#xD;
      electronic format. Aim 2: Conduct a randomized clinical trial of the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      tailored, electronic intervention (EMPOWER-ED) on VA primary care patients' benzodiazepine&#xD;
      cessation/reduction and functional outcomes. Aim 3: Conduct a budget impact analysis to&#xD;
      estimate the costs of implementing the EMPOWER-ED throughout VA. Methodology: This conversion&#xD;
      and tailoring will be an iterative process that the project team will conduct via focus&#xD;
      groups comprising Veterans, VA primary care providers, and VA operational partners. When the&#xD;
      revised intervention, called EMPOWER-ED (for EMPOWER &quot;Electronically Delivered&quot;), is fully&#xD;
      designed and has been successfully beta-tested by Veterans, its effectiveness will be&#xD;
      evaluated in a randomized clinical trial with 170 Veterans who have been on benzodiazepines&#xD;
      for at least 3 months. The primary hypothesis of the study is that those receiving EMPOWER-ED&#xD;
      will be significantly more likely than controls to cease benzodiazepines entirely, and, to&#xD;
      reduce their dose by at least 25%, at 6-month follow-up. The secondary hypothesis is that&#xD;
      Veterans receiving EMPOWER-ED will also experience fewer anxiety symptoms, better sleep&#xD;
      quality, and overall health/quality of life at 6-month follow-up. A supplemental analysis of&#xD;
      benzodiazepine use only will be conducted using VA databases at 12 months to evaluate whether&#xD;
      changes identified at 6 months persist over time. The VA operational partners of the project&#xD;
      team (Pharmacy Benefits Management, Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative, and Office of&#xD;
      Connected Care) are committed to disseminating EMPOWER-ED if it proves successful. Therefore,&#xD;
      a third aim of the study is to undertake a budget impact analysis to determine what the costs&#xD;
      would be to implement EMPOWER-ED in the VA systemwide. Next Steps/Implementation: Because&#xD;
      electronically-delivered interventions are inexpensive to disseminate once they have been&#xD;
      developed, this project has an excellent chance to promote health care value by creating an&#xD;
      easily scaled-up, method of reducing the prevalence of a widespread risk to Veterans' health.&#xD;
