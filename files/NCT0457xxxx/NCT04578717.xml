    <textblock>
      Evaluating the clinical behavior of composite restorations in NCCLs when the surface is&#xD;
      pre-conditioned using bioactive glass air-abrasion has not been reported in the dental&#xD;
      literature. This double-blinded randomised clinical trial evaluated the effect of surface&#xD;
      pre-conditioning with bioactive air-abrasion on the performance of composite restorations in&#xD;
      NCCLs placed using etch&amp;rinse and self-etch adhesive systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      15 Patients with 100 teeth meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. NCCLs&#xD;
      characteristics were evaluated and recorded before the placement of restorations. The cavity&#xD;
      dimensions in millimeters (height, width, and depth), the cavity geometry (labeled at &gt;45°,&#xD;
      45° - 90°, 90° - 135°, and &lt;135°), the degree of dentin sclerosis , the existence of&#xD;
      attrition facets, and the existence of spontaneous sensitivity were measured and recorded in&#xD;
      the patient's form. The preoperative sensitivity was also evaluated by applying air from a&#xD;
      dental syringe placed 2 cm from the tooth surface for 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NCCLs meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned into four experimental groups&#xD;
      (n=25); A: air-abrasion + etch&amp;rinse, B: air-abrasion + self-etch, C: etch&amp;rinse and D:&#xD;
      self-etch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylaxis was conducted using a rubber cup with pumice and water. The color of the&#xD;
      composite was selected using VITA classical shade guide before applying local anesthesia with&#xD;
      Lidocaine 2% with 1:100000 adrenaline. Retraction chord was inserted into the gingival sulcus&#xD;
      with the aid of a blunt spatula without excessive pressure to the periodontium. Teeth were&#xD;
      isolated with rubberdam. No preparation or beveling of cavosurface margins was performed to&#xD;
      the NCCLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In air-abrasion groups, a clinical air-abrasion unit was used to pre-condition the NCCLs with&#xD;
      bioactive glass 45S5 powder for 10 sec. The operating parameters were; air pressure, 20 psi;&#xD;
      powder particles size, 20 µm; nozzle angle, 90◦; nozzle-lesion distance, 5 mm and the&#xD;
      internal nozzle diameter, 900 µm&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the etch&amp;rinse groups, enamel and dentine were etched using 37% Phosphoric acid for 30&#xD;
      sec and 15 sec respectively. NCCLs were rinsed thoroughly for 20 sec to remove the acid.&#xD;
      Excess water was removed using a cotton pellet to leave a moist dentine surface. One coat of&#xD;
      bonding adhesive was gently scrubbed on the entire enamel and dentin surface for 20 sec, air&#xD;
      dried for 5 sec and light cured for 10 sec using LED curing light ( output &gt;800mW/cm2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In self-etch groups, the bonding adhesive was applied to enamel and dentine for 20 sec with&#xD;
      agitation, gently air dried and light cured for 10 sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NCCLs were restored using FiltekTM Z250 XT resin composite, placed in 2 mm increments and&#xD;
      light cured for 20 s per increment. Final contour was achieved with a fine diamond rotary&#xD;
      instrument followed by finishing and polishing using Optrapol polishing kit .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation was conducted by two trained and calibrated examiners. The examiners and&#xD;
      patients were blinded to the group assignment, in accordance with the double-blinding&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial design. Each restoration was evaluated at baseline (one week after&#xD;
      restoration placement), 3 months and 6 months. This evaluation was conducted according to&#xD;
      World Federation criteria (FDI)&#xD;
