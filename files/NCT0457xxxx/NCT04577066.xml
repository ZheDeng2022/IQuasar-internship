  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of two phases and be aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of the new genetically attenuated GA2 malaria parasite (Phase 1) and its preliminary&#xD;
      protective efficacy against controlled human malaria infection (Phase 2) in healthy Dutch&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is one of the most common tropical diseases, accounting for 228 million infections&#xD;
      and 450.000 deaths each year. It is caused by five species of protozoan parasites belonging&#xD;
      to the genus of the Plasmodia. Plasmodia have a complex life cycle: they are injected into&#xD;
      the human host by female Anopheles mosquitos, migrate to the liver to replicate and then&#xD;
      enter red blood cells. The typical symptoms of malaria with fever episodes are caused by the&#xD;
      bursting of red blood cells, as the parasites leave to infect new cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rising resistance of both parasites against anti-malarial drugs and mosquitoes against&#xD;
      insecticides, make the need to eradicate malaria even more impellent. A promising approach to&#xD;
      disease control is the development of an effective vaccine. Among the different approaches to&#xD;
      vaccine development, live attenuated parasites stand out for their high protective efficacy&#xD;
      (&gt;90%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GA2 parasite, a new genetically attenuated malaria parasite, which is derived from the&#xD;
      NF45 Plasmodium falciparum strain and has been engineered to arrest development in the liver&#xD;
      before entering the bloodstream, was recently created. It should therefore not be able to&#xD;
      cause malaria in humans. The idea is that the GA2 parasite will prime the immune system for&#xD;
      recognition of non attenuated parasites in the future without causing disease itself. In&#xD;
      other words, exposure to the innocuous GA2 parasite could confer protection against&#xD;
      pathogenic malaria parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, this study si aimed at investigating the safety and tolerability of the GA2 parasite&#xD;
      and at determining its potential protective efficacy against controlled human malaria&#xD;
      infection. The former question will be investigated by exposing volunteers to sequentially&#xD;
      increasing numbers of GA2-infected mosquito bites. The latter question will be investigated&#xD;
      by repeatedly (3 times) exposing volunteers to the GA2 parasite and once to unattenuated&#xD;
      parasites. The efficacy of the GA2 parasite will be compared to another genetically&#xD;
      attenuated parasite, the GA1, which in previous studies has been shown to be safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated but only have limited protective efficacy. There will also be a placebo group.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This trial has bot a sequential as well as a parallel interventional study model.&#xD;
The safety and tolerability of the GA2 parasite will be assessed by means of a sequential study model. There will be 2 cohorts, which will be recruited sequentially and exposed to increasing numbers of infected mosquito bites.&#xD;
The preliminary protective efficacy of the GA2 parasite will be assessed by means of a parallel study model.There will be 3 groups of volunteers, who will be exposed to either GA2-infected, GA1-infected or uninfected mosquito bites.</intervention_model_description>
