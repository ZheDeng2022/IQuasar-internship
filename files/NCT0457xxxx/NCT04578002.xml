      This study is to investigate clinical efficacy of the pre-hospital triage of patients with&#xD;
      suspected acute stroke by using advanced telecommunication tools with digital audio and video&#xD;
      real-time streaming.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of today's main challenges in stroke medicine is to further decrease&#xD;
      event-to-treatment-time. On-site, pre-hospital, clinical assessment of patients with&#xD;
      suspected acute stroke can optimize further diagnostic and treatment pathways after patient&#xD;
      arrival at the dedicated stroke center. A telemedical approach (interactive video and audio&#xD;
      streaming) allows time efficient pre-hospital triage, via patient evaluation by simple,&#xD;
      pre-defined assessment measures and a standardized questionnaire. This study is to&#xD;
      investigate clinical efficacy of the pre-hospital triage of patients with suspected acute&#xD;
      stroke by using advanced telecommunication tools with digital audio and video real-time&#xD;
      streaming.&#xD;

    <description>Score to quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>

    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms (= 0) to death (= 6).</description>

    <description>Prehospital Triage of Patients with Suspected Stroke Using Onsite Mobile Telemedicine approach (interactive video and audio streaming). In patients with suspected stroke, a prehospital patient evaluation by end-to-end encrypted real-time audio- and video streaming from the pre-hospital setting to an in-hospital stroke physician, located at the University hospital of Basel, is requested and initiated (telestroke-path). The process is supervised and evaluated by an in-hospital stroke physician in real-time. Patients considered having an acute stroke will be directly transferred to cerebral imaging via CT.</description>
