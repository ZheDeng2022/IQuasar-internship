    <textblock>
      Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a new concept proposed in&#xD;
      2020. Unlike non-alcoholic fatter liver disease (NAFLD), the diagnosis of MAFLD requires the&#xD;
      presence any of the following 3 metabolic risks, including overweight/obesity, presence of&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, and evidence of metabolic dysregulation. However, there are patients that&#xD;
      have hepatic steatosis but no metabolic risk, who thus do not meet the diagnostic criteria of&#xD;
      MAFLD. Besides, there are patients with both MAFLD and other liver diseases. The clinical&#xD;
      features and the management of these patients remain unclear. Thus, further histopathological&#xD;
      and clinical study is required to elucidate and compare the characteristics of MAFLD and&#xD;
      NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, in this single-center, prospective clinical study, investigators are planning to&#xD;
      establish a long-term follow-up cohort of patients with either MAFLD or NAFLD. In order to&#xD;
      understand the risk of developing liver-related complications and important extra-hepatic&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular disease), and also to better elucidate the risk of disease&#xD;
      progression in &quot;lean&quot; NAFLD individuals without any metabolic dysregulation and MAFLD&#xD;
      individuals with dual or multiple causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, investigators aim to improve the diagnosis of MAFLD and improve patients'&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      The study is divided into 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, it contains a cross-sectional study to collect the clinical data of the patients&#xD;
      with fatty liver. The clinical features of this population will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the study will collect the plasma, urine and stool samples of the patients in this&#xD;
      cohort. And then a long-term follow-up of these patients will be carried out. Investigators&#xD;
      wish to find out biomarkers that can detail patient stratification and predict the prognosis&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
