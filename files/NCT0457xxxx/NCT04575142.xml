  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the outcomes of a CO2 laser device called AcuPulse Duo&#xD;
      on vocal lesions and compare them to the most commonly used Aura KTP laser in order to&#xD;
      determine which device has the best results. The CO2 laser device is an already FDA approved&#xD;
      device. However, there have been no studies comparing the two devices for this use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A flexible laryngoscope is passed through the patient's nose. Energy from the laser is&#xD;
      delivered through a fiber. This unique quality allows the physician to thread the fiber&#xD;
      through an endoscope and deliver energy. KTP is uniquely effective because the laser uses&#xD;
      green light, which has an affinity with blood vessels. This means that the energy from the&#xD;
      laser is absorbed more easily by blood vessels than other tissue. Targeting the blood supply&#xD;
      of a lesion causes the lesion to slough off, leaving the surrounding tissue undamaged.&#xD;
      However, the properties of the KTP are not necessarily ideal, in that it penetrates deep into&#xD;
      the vocal fold, risking scar formation. On the other hand, the CO2 laser is absorbed by water&#xD;
      found in soft tissues and is independent of tissue color. It is very precise and causes less&#xD;
      damage of the deep tissues, which results in less swelling and faster recovery. The absence&#xD;
      of a long healing process means that most patients can resume their normal activities even on&#xD;
      the same day The CO2 laser is the preferred laser for use in the operating room. The purpose&#xD;
      of the study is to evaluate the fiber-based version of the CO2 laser in the office setting.&#xD;

    <description>the CO2 laser (AcuPulse DUO, Lumenis, Yokneam, Israel) generally ranges from 3 to 10 W in superpulse mode, with 0.05 second on/0.01 second off, depending on lesion size and location of the lesion(s).&#xD;
The CO2 laser can be used in a continuous, pulsed, or superpulsed mode. The superpulsed mode reduces the exposure time to a few nanoseconds while delivering high energies of 400 to 500 W with each peak. The rest time between each peak allows the tissues to cool and reduces thermal injury to adjacent tissues.</description>
