      In this study, individuals without hepatitis C infection who are on the kidney transplant&#xD;
      waitlist will receive a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C infection and will be&#xD;
      treated for hepatitis C at the same time. Treatment will include glecaprevir 300 mg /&#xD;
      pibrentasvir 120 mg (G-P) administered on-call to the operating room for the renal transplant&#xD;
      procedure and continued for 2 weeks post-renal transplant.&#xD;

      In this study, individuals without hepatitis C infection who are on the kidney transplant&#xD;
      waitlist will receive a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C infection and will be&#xD;
      treated for hepatitis C at the same time. Treatment will include glecaprevir 300 mg /&#xD;
      pibrentasvir 120 mg (G-P) administered on-call to the operating room for the renal transplant&#xD;
      procedure and continued for 2 weeks post-renal transplant. The participant will continue to&#xD;
      be tested for Hepatitis C for 12 weeks post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that prophylactic treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir before&#xD;
      and after transplant will prevent the establishment of HCV infection in the recipients of&#xD;
      kidneys from HCV-infected deceased donors. Based on the success of preliminary studies, the&#xD;
      objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 weeks of G-P as&#xD;
      prophylaxis for HCV D+/R- kidney transplant.&#xD;
