  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of megestrol acetate alone or in combination with&#xD;
      metformin in preventing the progression of uterine pre-cancer (endometrial intraepithelial&#xD;
      neoplasia) to endometrial cancer. Megestrol acetate is a drug used to block estrogen and&#xD;
      suppress the effects of estrogen and androgens. It is the current non-surgical treatment of&#xD;
      endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Metformin is a drug that has been found to have&#xD;
      anti-cancer properties. Giving metformin and megestrol acetate together may decrease the&#xD;
      growth of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia in the uterus better than megestrol alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the change in endometrial cell proliferation, as measured by the percentage (%)&#xD;
      of Ki-67 positive cells, in participants with endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia who&#xD;
      undergo 4 weeks of treatment with megestrol acetate + metformin or megestrol acetate alone&#xD;
      prior to hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the changes in protein expression in the endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia&#xD;
      lesion, using immunohistochemistry (i-vi) in subjects treated with megestrol acetate +&#xD;
      metformin compared to those treated with megestrol acetate alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) ii. PTEN/PAX2 expression iii.&#xD;
      Markers of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway (phosphor-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), p(Ser473)-Akt,&#xD;
      phosphor-S6K, p4EBP1) iv. Markers of cell death (TUNEL, cleaved caspase-3) v. Markers of&#xD;
      intratumoral insulin signaling (Phosphorylated insulin receptor (pIR) and insulin-like growth&#xD;
      factor-1 receptor (total and phosphorylated IGF1R), vi. Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency&#xD;
      (baseline only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore whether baseline Ki-67 expression and other clinical characteristics are&#xD;
      associated with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Prior to standard of care surgery, patients receive megestrol acetate orally (PO)&#xD;
      twice daily (BID) for 21-35 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Prior to standard of care surgery, patients receive megestrol acetate PO BID and&#xD;
      metformin hydrochloride extended-release PO BID for 21-35 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 30 days.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) on an endometrial biopsy&#xD;
             or dilation and curettage specimen will be eligible. Participants can be diagnosed&#xD;
             with EIN at any time in the three months prior to surgery. Other commonly used&#xD;
             pathologic terms for EIN, such as complex atypical hyperplasia and atypical&#xD;
             hyperplasia will also be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior therapy for EIN is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the participant is diabetic, blood glucose must be appropriately controlled as&#xD;
             evidenced by a hemoglobin A1c of &lt; 8.0 in the last three months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
             If no A1c is available, it will be drawn with baseline laboratory parameters as is&#xD;
             standard of care prior to hysterectomy. For women who are diabetics who are on&#xD;
             insulin, metformin can cause relative hypoglycemia. Women who are diabetic and&#xD;
             receiving insulin will be allowed to participate, but will be asked to monitor their&#xD;
             blood glucoses closely and alert the study team if persistent hypoglycemia is noted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be a candidate and accepting of surgical management of EIN with planned&#xD;
             hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of megestrol acetate on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her study physician immediately. For metformin, published studies with&#xD;
             metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin&#xD;
             and major birth defect or miscarriage risk. Metformin can increase the potential for&#xD;
             unintended pregnancy in premenopausal women as therapy with metformin may result in&#xD;
             ovulation in some anovulatory women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are cancer survivors, provided they are without evidence of active&#xD;
             disease are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive will be eligible for&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No current hormonal therapy or hormone replacement therapy (prior use of oral&#xD;
             contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy is allowed, provided that it was&#xD;
             discontinued &gt; 3 months from trial enrollment). Vaginal estrogen use is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No current use of metformin therapy (prior use of metformin therapy is allowed,&#xD;
             provided that it was discontinued &gt; 1 year from trial enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not currently breastfeeding or pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents within 30 days of&#xD;
             enrollment or during this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to metformin or megestrol acetate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because it requires hysterectomy which is&#xD;
             contraindicated in women who are pregnant and wish to continue the pregnancy,&#xD;
             additionally, megestrol acetate is a category D agent. Megestrol acetate may cause&#xD;
             fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Fertility and reproduction studies&#xD;
             with high doses of megestrol acetate have shown a reversible feminizing effect on some&#xD;
             male rat fetuses. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events&#xD;
             (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with megestrol acetate,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with megestrol acetate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Personal history of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are diabetics on insulin will be eligible to participate but they will be&#xD;
             required to check their blood sugar regularly. Patients who are unable to check their&#xD;
             blood sugar will be excluded from participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are diabetics taking sulfonylureas and meglitinides will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with an alcohol use or abuse disorder due to increased risk of lactic acidosis&#xD;
             with metformin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of dofetilide, ulipristal, or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors as well as&#xD;
             drugs that reduce metformin clearance such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, or&#xD;
             cimetidine&#xD;
