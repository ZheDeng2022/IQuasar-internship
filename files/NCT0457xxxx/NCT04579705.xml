      Surgical hand scrubbing is the removal of transient flora and reduction of permanent flora as&#xD;
      much as possible before any sterile gloves are worn before any surgical intervention. It is a&#xD;
      cheap and easy method to prevent infections. Effective use of surgical hand scrubbing has an&#xD;
      important role in preventing and reducing the transfer of health-related infections. Although&#xD;
      many studies have been performed on surgical hand scrubbing, no standard practice has been&#xD;
      found in the method of scrubbing and optimal duration of scrubbing time. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to compare evidence-based surgical hand scrubbing methods in order to prevent&#xD;
      surgical site infections.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Original Value: Surgical site infections (SSI) are a serious problem due to increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospitalization, hospitalization and consumption of health&#xD;
      resources. It is reported from guides that the several factors like hair removal, skin&#xD;
      antisepsis, prevention of hypothermia, antimicrobial prophylaxis, providing adequate&#xD;
      oxygenation applied in intraoperative period reduce SSI. In addition to these factors, it is&#xD;
      known that hand antisepsis of the surgical team is one of the most important factors in&#xD;
      preventing SSI. Surgical hand scrubbing is the removal of transient flora and reduction of&#xD;
      permanent flora as much as possible before any sterile gloves are worn before any surgical&#xD;
      intervention. It is a cheap and easy method to prevent infections. Effective use of surgical&#xD;
      hand scrubbing has an important role in preventing and reducing the transfer of&#xD;
      health-related infections. Therefore, the research topic is directly related to patient&#xD;
      safety and is considered to be one of the important areas of health services at national and&#xD;
      international level in terms of establishing institutional culture in the prevention of&#xD;
      surgical site infections. Although many studies have been performed on surgical hand&#xD;
      scrubbing, no standard practice has been found in the method of scrubbing and optimal&#xD;
      duration of scrubbing time. The aim of this study is to compare evidence-based surgical hand&#xD;
      scrubbing methods in order to prevent surgical site infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The research is a randomized controlled prospective study. The universe of the&#xD;
      research was surgeon and operating room nurses in Gulhane Training and Research Hospital. The&#xD;
      sample size is at least 180 people for one-way analysis of variance with G * Power version&#xD;
      3.1.19 software to determine a medium level (0.25) effect size between 4 groups at 0.80 power&#xD;
      and 0.05 type I error level calculated (Tsai, 2016). Participants was divided into 4 groups&#xD;
      by randomization method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the first group performed the surgical hand scrubbing for 1 minute and&#xD;
      with using a nail brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the second group performed the surgical hand scrubbing for 1 minute and&#xD;
      without using a nail brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the third group performed the surgical hand scrubbing for 2 minute and&#xD;
      with using a nail brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the fourth group performed the surgical hand scrubbing for 2 minute and&#xD;
      without using a nail brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Practices in All Groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The application will take place during the first surgeries entered in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All groups will be used hand antiseptic (4% Chlorhexidine gluconate) which is used in&#xD;
           the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will be examined whether the nails are smaller than 2 mm. If the nails are long,&#xD;
           individuals will be asked to cut their nails with the help of disposable nail scissors&#xD;
           before surgical hand scrubbing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be no nail polish on the nails and there will be no jewelry on the hand and&#xD;
           the ring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 ml of antiseptic solution will be used at each washing stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers' Exclusion Criteria (Different from Exclusion Criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants want to leave the research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected surgery time is less than 1,5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A tear / puncture in the glove during the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the operation, data collection will be terminated in cases where the sterility of&#xD;
           the glove is impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will take place in three stages. At all stages (before surgical hand scrubbing,&#xD;
      immediately after and at the end of the surgery), culture will be taken from the active hands&#xD;
      of the participants with the Glove Juice Method. At all stages, culture will be taken from&#xD;
      the participants via Glove Juice Method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glove Juice Method It is a method used to determine the number of bacteria on hand. In this&#xD;
      method, individuals will be provided to wear gloves on their dominant hand. Powder-free&#xD;
      sterile gloves were used for all sampling. Then, 50 ml of 'Tryptic Soy Broth' medium was&#xD;
      placed inside the glove and all surfaces of the gloved hand were massaged for 60 seconds by&#xD;
      the researcher. A sample was taken from the liquid in the glove using aseptic techniques and&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applications in Medical Microbiology Laboratory Before surgical hand scrubbing, samples taken&#xD;
      with glove liquid technique were diluted 1:10 in Müller Hinton Broth broth in the laboratory&#xD;
      (500 μl sample, 4.5 ml. Müeller Hinton Broth). And 300 μl of it was placed on 5% sheep blood&#xD;
      agar plates with sterile micropipettes. 1 ml each of the other samples (after surgical hand&#xD;
      scrubbing and at the end of the surgery) was spread diluted into three 5 % sheep blood agar&#xD;
      plates with sterile micropipettes. All samples were incubated at 35° C for 48 hours under&#xD;
      atmospheric conditions. Total bacterial load was determined by counting the total colony&#xD;
      forming units (CFU) on the plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Method SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) Windows Version 22.00&#xD;
      package program will be used in the statistical analysis of the data obtained at the end of&#xD;
      the study. Number,%, mean ± standard deviation, median (25% -75%) values will be used in&#xD;
      defining the data. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to evaluate the suitability for&#xD;
      normal distribution. In comparative statistics, appropriate tests will be used according to&#xD;
      the normal distribution of the sample. In statistical decisions, p ≤ 0.05 level will be&#xD;
      accepted as an indicator of significant difference.&#xD;
