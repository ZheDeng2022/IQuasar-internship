    <textblock>
      To assess feasibility and determine preliminary efficacy of Fascial Distortion Model (FDM)&#xD;
      for plantar heel pain (PHP) in a pilot study. The FDM is a hands on direct technique that is&#xD;
      non-invasive and has been shown in preliminary studies to be effective in treating&#xD;
      musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. Study participants will be Active Duty Service Members (SM)&#xD;
      in the Fort Gordon catchment area.&#xD;

      This prospective, single arm pilot study was approved by the Dwight D. Eisenhower Army&#xD;
      Medical Center human subjects Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited from&#xD;
      Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center from March 2018 to February 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1-Screening and treatment visit The research staff will review the informed consent&#xD;
      with potential research participant(s) and will answer any questions the participant may have&#xD;
      about the information in the informed consent. Participants that are willing to participate&#xD;
      and sign the informed consent will be eligible to be screened for the study. Participants&#xD;
      will be provided copies of their signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study based on the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and their understanding and acceptance of possible side effects&#xD;
      that will be clearly identified in the consent form. Participants must have a current history&#xD;
      of PHP and be an Active Duty SM. Participants will be required to have provide detailed&#xD;
      information on the quantity of pain medications they consume daily and have a stable history&#xD;
      of PHP for at least 30 days prior to the start of screening and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed with the participant to assure the&#xD;
      participant meets the criteria required for participation in the study. Initially,&#xD;
      participants who meet the study criteria will screened and treatment on day one. During&#xD;
      screening, participants will provide or update a demographics questionnaire, Foot Health&#xD;
      Status Questionnaire (FHSQ), medication history, medical history information including&#xD;
      history of PHP and events leading up to the diagnosis, profile history, and will undergo a&#xD;
      musculoskeletal exam and a general physical exam, including vital signs. The involved&#xD;
      foot/feet will be undergo ultrasonography to and a thickness of the fascia will be measured&#xD;
      via ultrasound. Medication history includes any and all medications currently taking&#xD;
      including vitamins and minerals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to treatment the patient will be seated for at least 30-60 minutes and provide a visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS) measurement of their pain at rest, first step, one and two foot jump,&#xD;
      squat, walk, and run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will meet with a provider educated in the FDM who will follow the protocols&#xD;
      for treatment of the plantar heel pain to include diagnosis and treatment of: Continuum&#xD;
      distortions, trigger bands, herniated trigger points, folding distortions, cylinder&#xD;
      distortions, and tectonic fixations. These treatment may/can start in the foot and extend up&#xD;
      the lower leg and may involve treatment of decreased range of motion in the foot, ankle, or&#xD;
      lower extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be instructed to not apply heat to the area for the next 48 hours,&#xD;
      maintain profile (if they have one) status, and continue to limit their activity as to not&#xD;
      re-injure the foot/feet. The participant will return in two to seven days following the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2-Second intervention At Visit 2 which will occur at two to seven days, the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria will be reviewed with the participant to assure the participant&#xD;
      continues to meet the criteria required for participation in the study. Patient will report&#xD;
      on their activities since the last treatment and if they applied heat to the affected area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide or update a demographics questionnaire, FHSQ, medication history,&#xD;
      medical history, profile history, any adverse reactions to prior treatment, and will undergo&#xD;
      a musculoskeletal exam and a general physical exam, including vital signs with body mass&#xD;
      index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to treatment the patient will be seated for at least 30-60 minutes and provide a VAS&#xD;
      measurement of their pain at rest, first step, one and two foot jump, squat, walk, and run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will meet with the same provider as during visit one. The provider educated&#xD;
      with the FDM will follow the protocols for treatment of the plantar heel pain to include&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of continuum distortions, trigger bands, herniated trigger points,&#xD;
      folding distortions, cylinder distortions, and tectonic fixations. These treatment may/can&#xD;
      start in the foot and extend up the lower leg and may involve treatment of decreased range of&#xD;
      motion in the foot, ankle, or lower extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will return for last visit at 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 Follow-up, final visit Upon returning for the 4 month follow up, the participant will&#xD;
      undergo an exit neurological exam, physical exam, concomitant medications will be reviewed&#xD;
      and updated. Participants will provide a FHSQ, and updates to their profile, and any adverse&#xD;
      reactions to prior treatment. Ultrasound will be performed to measure the thickness of the&#xD;
      plantar fascia by the same provider that measure the fascia on the first visit. Participant&#xD;
      will be seated for at least 30-60 minutes and provide a VAS measurement of their pain at&#xD;
      rest, first step, one and two foot jump, squat, walk, and run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Termination&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team may terminate this study at any time and for any reason. If a participant&#xD;
      is withdrawn or the study is terminated, investigators will initiate participant intervention&#xD;
      according to institutional standard of care procedures. Participants will be terminated from&#xD;
      the study for any one of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of informed consent Failure to continue to meet inclusion criteria, meet any of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria or withdrawal by investigator Lost to follow up Serious Adverse event&#xD;
      Protocol non compliance Completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for early termination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update medical history &amp; medication history, Perform physical and musculoskeletal exams, if&#xD;
      possible Document reported and/or observed adverse events VAS, FHSQ questionnaire, profile&#xD;
      duration, ultrasound plantar fascia thickness measurement completed, if possible&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention with the fascial distortion model will be the research procedure, it will be&#xD;
      performed by the primary investigator (PI) or a trained member of the research team with&#xD;
      direct supervision of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructions for performing the FDM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnose the correct distortion, one of six options: herniated trigger point (HTP), continuum&#xD;
      distortion (CD), trigger band (TB), cylinder distortion (Cyd), folding distortion (FD), and&#xD;
      tectonic fixation (TF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis made by patients body language HTP: participant pushes two fingers into the tissues&#xD;
      CD: participant pushes with one finger into the tissue on a bony prominence TB: participant&#xD;
      sweeping fingers along the tissues in a linear pathway CyD: broad sweeping of tissues or&#xD;
      repetitive squeezing FD: holding or cupping the tissues TF: moving tissues/joint through&#xD;
      range of motion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will depend on the diagnosis made HTP: Apply direct firm pressure with the distal&#xD;
      phalanx of the first digit into the most tender portion of the tissues in the HTP for five to&#xD;
      ten seconds CD: Apply direct firm pressure with the distal phalanx of the first digit through&#xD;
      the tissues readjusting to find the most tender position and hold the position for five to&#xD;
      thirty seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TB: Apply direct firm pressure with the distal phalanx along the linear plane of tissue drawn&#xD;
      out by the patient CyD: Apply direct firm pressure with the distal phalanx of both hands&#xD;
      spreading the tissues apart, or apply a cupping device to the tissues, or grab the tissues&#xD;
      with the hands and twist the tissues in opposing directions as the PI deems appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FD: Find the direction in which the fascia is torqued by pulling or pushing in different&#xD;
      planes and then once that direction is found, apply traction in that plane that is constant&#xD;
      and then quickly add a thrust in the same direction. TF: Find the direction in which the&#xD;
      fascia is fixated and move the tissues through the range of motion while applying traction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only HTP, CD, and TBs are expected to be discovered and treated throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened on-site at DDEAMC for general inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      They will be given a full description of the study procedures and asked to read and sign an&#xD;
      IRB-approved informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and treatment of DDEAMC recruited participants will occur on the DDEAMC outpatient&#xD;
      clinic after the participants have been given a full description of the study procedures and&#xD;
      have signed a IRB approved consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening will include: Background information including medical+plantar heel&#xD;
      pain+medication histories, inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria evaluation, MSK and physical exams,&#xD;
      vital signs, as well as a series of questionnaires listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Documentation Data for this trial will be primarily collected in an electronic data&#xD;
      capture (EDC). This will be done with DoD AHTLA. It is the investigator's responsibility for&#xD;
      the collection and reporting of all clinical and safety data entered and confirm the data is&#xD;
      accurate, authentic, attributable, complete, and consistent. The investigator or sub&#xD;
      investigator must sign the note in AHLTA to attest the information contained is true and&#xD;
      causality of any safety information has been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected throughout the study at all three encounters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Exam Vital Signs Medical History PHP History Medication History Update Medications&#xD;
      Collect Adverse Events FHSQ VAS Profile status Ultrasound measured plantar fascia thickness&#xD;
      at visit one and three&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSK and physical Examinations. A delegated physician AIs will examine the patient for any&#xD;
      detectable abnormalities of the following body systems: general appearance; neck; head, eyes,&#xD;
      ears, nose, and throat; lungs; heart/cardiovascular; abdomen; neurologic; extremities; back;&#xD;
      musculoskeletal; lymphatic; skin; and other. The MSK examination will assess active and&#xD;
      passive range of motion, reflexes, sensory, muscle strength with focus on the lower&#xD;
      extremities. After the participant had been at rest for 30 minutes pain will be assessed at&#xD;
      rest, first step, one and two foot jump, squat, walk, and run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital Signs. Vital signs with body mass index will be measured at screening, Visit 1, and&#xD;
      each subsequent office visit. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate over 30&#xD;
      seconds should be taken after patients have been at rest (seated) for at least 2 minutes.&#xD;
      Blood pressure should be recorded in mmHg. Pulse rate should be measured in beats per&#xD;
      minutes. Weight will be recorded at each office visit and measured in pounds. Height will be&#xD;
      taken at screening and measured in inches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foot Health Status Questionnaire: The FHSQ is a 29 question questionnaire that is a validated&#xD;
      survey with a goodness-of-fit index of 0.9 suggesting a moderate fit of measurement of foot&#xD;
      health related to quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS will be used to assess the pain at the plantar heel&#xD;
      location during rest, first step, one and two foot jump, squat, walk, and run. The&#xD;
      participant will plot the pain level along a linear scale that gives a the opportunity for&#xD;
      any potential score from zero to one hundred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plantar thickness as measured by ultrasound. A trained AI will measure each participant at&#xD;
      the beginning of visit one and during visit three with the ultrasound. Measurement will take&#xD;
      place just distal to the calcaneus, an image will be saved for each participant and placed in&#xD;
      the EDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available subject's data will be used if they withdraw from the project or the research team&#xD;
      withdraws them from the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on other studies related to Fascial Distortion Model and the amount of variables the&#xD;
      goal will be to treat 50 feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis A per protocol analytic approach using SPSS 26.0 statistical package will be&#xD;
      employed to investigate whether manipulation using the FDM for PHP improved outcomes.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics to be performed to describe outcomes at each time point; average value&#xD;
      ± standard deviation (SD) will be reported at baseline unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will test the hypothesis that there was a&#xD;
      within subject omnibus improvement over time in FHSQ and VAS scores. Statistical assumptions&#xD;
      including sphericity to be met. Post-hoc within-subject paired sample t-tests will be used to&#xD;
      identify at which time points a statistically significant difference in FHSQ and VAS scores&#xD;
      occurred (i.e., at 1- or 16-weeks later relative to baseline). Average values ± standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD) will be reported for this analysis. The unit of analysis for both is the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of analysis for plantar fascia thickness is the individual foot, regardless whether&#xD;
      one or both feet were treated. A paired sample t-test will compare differences in the&#xD;
      thickness of study plantar fascia at 16 weeks post intervention relative to baseline. Given&#xD;
      that this is a pilot study, a conventional p-value of ≤ .05 was selected to denote&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;

    <description>Using physical exam and manual manipulation skills informed by the FDM, he identified and treated locations of presumed fascial distortion about the plantar area of the foot; &quot;distortions&quot; could include any of the six reported fascial anomalies in the FDM: continuum distortions, trigger bands, herniated trigger points, folding distortions, cylinder distortions, and tectonic fixations. Each distortion is associated with a recommended reparative manipulation. The purported mechanism of action is that the distortion-specific manipulation restores normal fascial homogeneity.</description>
