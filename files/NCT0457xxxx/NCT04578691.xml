  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project is testing whether in screw insertion of spine surgery using &quot;Anatase&quot;&#xD;
      Spine Surgery Navigation System is at least as safe and accurate as using O-arm assisted&#xD;
      spine surgery- Medtronic Stealthstation S7 Treatment Guidance System.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pedicle screw insertion is performed to treat the patients with spine conditions, including&#xD;
      degenerative, traumatogenic, and neoplastic lesions. Accurate insertion of pedicle screw is a&#xD;
      crucial step which directly affects the surgical outcomes. In order to place the screws&#xD;
      safely and accurately, various conventional techniques have been used, focusing on marking&#xD;
      anatomical locations, entry points and insertion angles. Since the early 1990, the methods&#xD;
      using computer systems that allow real-time image processing have been explored in order to&#xD;
      improve the accuracy of pedicle screw placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medtronic StealthStation® S7® System is a hardware platform that enables real-time&#xD;
      surgical navigation using radiological patient images. The application software reformats&#xD;
      patient-specific CT or MR images acquired before surgery, or fluoroscopic images acquired&#xD;
      during surgery, and displays them on-screen from a variety of perspectives. The &quot;Anatase&quot;&#xD;
      Spine Surgery Navigation System is indicated for precisely positioning of surgical&#xD;
      instruments and/or implants during general spinal surgery, such as pedicle screw placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a two-arms, single center, evaluator blind, controlled, parallel,&#xD;
      randomised study in patients with pedicle screw placement in spine surgery. This trial will&#xD;
      include patients need to undergo pedicle screw placement surgery with indication of spinal&#xD;
      tumor, traumatic injury or degenerative spine disease (Pedicle screws placed from 10th&#xD;
      thoracic vertebra to first sacrum), who are ≥20 years and ≤80 years of age with Body Mass&#xD;
      Index (BMI) &lt; 40 kg/m2 and Spine T-Score ≥ -2.5.&#xD;
