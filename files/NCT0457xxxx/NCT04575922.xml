    <textblock>
      This research is being done to study the effects of the combination of ipilimumab, nivolumab,&#xD;
      and radiation therapy in people with metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the following drugs and interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation Therapy&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the combination of ipilimumab&#xD;
      and nivolumab for metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer but they have been&#xD;
      approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved ipilimumab for metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved nivolumab for metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab and Nivolumab are both genetically-engineered antibodies. An antibody is a protein&#xD;
      that can attach to specific molecular targets. Ipilimumab and nivolumab work by activating&#xD;
      the immune system, which can help to fight certain cancers. This trial explores whether&#xD;
      radiation therapy may increase the benefit from immune activation with ipilimumab and&#xD;
      nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in this research study for as long as the study interventions are safe&#xD;
      and beneficial. Participants will then be followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bristol-Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by&#xD;
      providing funding for this study, including the two study drugs.&#xD;
