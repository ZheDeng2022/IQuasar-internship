  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease (CHD), the most common birth defect, is present in nearly 1% of the&#xD;
      population. CHD patients are associated with intense resource utilization and premature death&#xD;
      in adulthood. The risk of premature death is linked with reduced exercise capacity, a finding&#xD;
      consistently noted in youth with CHD. Reduced exercise capacity in this population has also&#xD;
      been associated with reduce physical activity and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in adults with acquired heart disease is an established secondary&#xD;
      prevention strategy that improves exercise capacity. The investigators propose a prospective&#xD;
      clinical trial of a home-based high intensity interval training (HIIT) program using a novel&#xD;
      telemedicine-equipped video game-linked cycle ergometer (MedBIKE™) for 10 to 18 year olds&#xD;
      with repaired moderate-complex CHD. The pilot study with the MedBIKE has shown promising&#xD;
      results. The investigators now seek to study the efficacy of this program in a broader CHD&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: This project is a prospective clinical trial of a home-based high intensity interval&#xD;
      training (HIIT) exercise program using a novel telemedicine-enabled and video game-linked&#xD;
      customizable cycle ergometer (MedBIKE™) in the pediatric congenital heart disease (CHD)&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The home-based the MedBIKE™ HIIT program will significantly improve exercise&#xD;
      capacity. The MedBIKE intervention will significantly improve time spent in MVPA and reduce&#xD;
      sedentary time, improve HRQoL and self-efficacy towards PA, and improve endothelial function.&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators hypothesize that the improvements in exercise capacity, along&#xD;
      with the improvements in the secondary outcomes will remain significantly improved up to&#xD;
      one-year post- MedBIKE intervention, when compared to pre-intervention values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Exercise intervention studies in the pediatric CHD population have been&#xD;
      limited by small sample sizes and there is limited data pertaining to the sustained effects&#xD;
      of exercise interventions on exercise capacity, physical activity, endothelial function, and&#xD;
      quality of life. This study, using standardized and largely operator-independent measure,&#xD;
      will be one of the largest exercise intervention clinical trials in the pediatric CHD&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Evaluate the impact of an eight-week, home-based HIIT MedBIKE™ program on&#xD;
      exercise capacity in youth with repaired moderate-complex CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: Evaluate the impact of the MedBIKE™ intervention on 1) PA; 2) HRQoL and&#xD;
      self-efficacy towards PA; 3) endothelial function; and 4) sustained changes in the primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method: This will be a single-center, prospective clinical trial. Potential&#xD;
      participants and families will be approached first by a clinical team member. In addition,&#xD;
      flyers with key study information will be placed in waiting rooms of the pediatric cardiology&#xD;
      clinics. Participants and parents expressing interest will meet with a research coordinator&#xD;
      who, along with one of the investigators and the clinical team will screen for eligibility.&#xD;
      Written consent and assent (if applicable) will be obtained from participants who are deemed&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following recruitment, participants will be administered the TACQOL and CSAPPA questionnaires&#xD;
      and an accelerometer to be worn for 7-days, after which participants will arrive for the&#xD;
      baseline assessment. As participants must be NPO for EndoPAT testing, they will have a small&#xD;
      meal following EndoPAT testing and at least two hours prior to CPET testing. A MedBIKE will&#xD;
      be installed in the participants home within 2-weeks of the baseline CPET at which time an&#xD;
      orientation session will occur to review the manual, safety procedures and the telemedicine&#xD;
      component. Participation will consist of a 12-week, 3-times per week (36 sessions in total)&#xD;
      HIIT program. All sessions will be supervised by an exercise physiologist. Protocol&#xD;
      completion will be considered a minimum of 27 of the 36 sessions (75%). Following the&#xD;
      completion of the intervention, the MedBIKE will be removed by the participants home and&#xD;
      returned to the Stollery Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up assessment, identical to that of the baseline (questionnaires, EndoPAT, CPET,&#xD;
      interviews and a 7-day week wear of an accelerometer) will occur 3-14 days post-intervention.&#xD;
      These assessments will be repeated at 6- and 12-months post-intervention.&#xD;

    <description>CPET (Exercise Stress Test and Spirometry) will be done to measure the VO2peak (mL/kg/min) output of participants. A comparison will be done pre- and post-MedBIKE intervention, as well as 6 and 12-months post, to determine the change in overall VO2peak of participants. We will also evaluate changes in VE/VCO2, peak power output (W), and HRmax (maximum heart rate).</description>

    <description>Participants will be provided with an accelerometer to wear for 7-days prior to the start of the MedBIKE intervention program and again for 7-days post intervention and again at 6 and 12-months post intervention. The accelerometer will measure the time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and the sedentary time. A comparison will be done pre- and post-MedBIKE intervention to determine changes in the physical activity levels. The 6-month and 12-month time points will be used for a comparison on the sustained changes of the intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the TNO AZL Children's Quality of Life (TACQOL) questionnaire. This questionnaire is a validated multidimensional instrument to assess the health-related quality of life in youth. The overall score of this questionnaire will be compared pre- and post-MedBIKE intervention to determine changes in health-related quality of life. The 6-month and 12-month time points will be used for a comparison on the sustained changes of the intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-intervention, 6-months post-intervention, 12-months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the Children's Self-Perceptions of Adequacy in and Predilection for Physical Activity (CSAPPA) scale. This questionnaire is a validated tool designed to assess self-perceptions of adequacy and predilection towards physical activity in youth. The overall score of this questionnaire will be compared pre- and post-MedBIKE intervention and again at 6 and 12-months post-intervention to evaluate sustained changes.</description>

    <measure>Changes in endothelial function to determine arterial volume will be measured using an EndoPAT 2000 instrument.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-intervention, 6-months post-intervention, 12-months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in endothelial function will be measured using an EndoPAT 2000. The EndoPAT is an observer-independent assessment that evaluates changes in arterial volume via finger plethysmography by capturing beat-to-beat variations in arterial pulse wave amplitude, thus generating a peripheral arterial tone (PAT) signal. The EndoPAT score will be compared pre- and post-MedBIKE intervention and again at 6 and 12-months post-intervention to evaluate sustained changes.</description>
