      Prospective observational research study to evaluate the role of wearable activity monitors&#xD;
      to predict physical function decline among prostate cancer survivors receiving ADT.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical function is a known predictor of QOL in advanced prostate cancer patients and key&#xD;
      measure of treatment tolerability. While treatment with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT)&#xD;
      improves survival, it is associated with significant toxicities that lead to physical&#xD;
      function (PF) decline. The average age of incident prostate cancer is 66 years, and in this&#xD;
      older group of men, chronic comorbid conditions often co-occur with diagnosis, further adding&#xD;
      to the risk for PF decline. With over 2.9 million prostate cancer survivors in the US, there&#xD;
      is an increasing demand for adequate symptom monitoring and PF assessment throughout cancer&#xD;
      care. However, there are currently no validated methods to systematically evaluate and&#xD;
      predict PF decline. Thus, the overarching objective of this proposal is to determine whether&#xD;
      the use of wearable technology to monitor objective daily activity combined with routine&#xD;
      symptom reporting can predict PF decline. To accomplish this, we propose a mixed-methods&#xD;
      approach that will provide quantitative information to help identify PC survivors at higher&#xD;
      risk for PF decline as well as a qualitative aim gain a deeper understanding of the perceived&#xD;
      relationships that PC survivors have with their physical activity levels and treatment&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
