      This study aims to answer whether use of a Vcare速 intrauterine manipulator leads to an&#xD;
      increased incidence of positive peritoneal cytology in patients undergoing surgical&#xD;
      management of early stage (FIGO stage I/II) endometrial cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer diagnosed in women worldwide and the&#xD;
      leading gynecologic cancer in developed countries, accounting for nearly 50% of all newly&#xD;
      diagnosed gynecologic cancers in the United States . The majority of endometrial cancers are&#xD;
      diagnosed at an early stage which portends a favorable prognosis. Despite early diagnosis and&#xD;
      generally favorable prognosis in these cancers, approximately 13% of patients will experience&#xD;
      recurrence . Most recurrences occur in patients with known high-risk pathologic features,&#xD;
      however approximately 3% of recurrences occur in patients with no high-risk pathology&#xD;
      features . While well-defined pathologic factors such as age, tumor grade, and depth of&#xD;
      invasion have been described for high-risk of recurrence, predicting recurrence in low-risk&#xD;
      patients has been an ongoing challenge in the management of early stage endometrial cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential contribution to recurrence in low-risk endometrial cancers may be the presence&#xD;
      of positively malignant peritoneal cytology. Positive peritoneal cytology (PPC) has been an&#xD;
      ongoing topic of debate regarding its significance and optimal management in early stage&#xD;
      endometrial cancers. Creasman and Rutledge initially described the prognostic value of&#xD;
      peritoneal cytology in 1971 by linking PPC with worse survival at 4 years . Since then&#xD;
      multiple studies have sought to address the significance of peritoneal cytology in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer, many with conflicting results. Studies by Kasamatsu et al, Fadare et al,&#xD;
      Lurain et al and Scott et al found that PPC is not a significant prognostic factor for&#xD;
      disease recurrence or survival . Contrary to these data however studies by Lee et al, Garg et&#xD;
      al, and Seagle et al have shown a positive correlation with PPC as both a prognostic factor&#xD;
      and survival . Despite these conflicting data directing the significance of PPC, it remains&#xD;
      an important contributing factor in the management and prognosis of endometrial cancer.&#xD;
      Although peritoneal cytology was removed from FIGO staging in 2009, NCCN guidelines continue&#xD;
      to recommend the collection of peritoneal cytology in order to further elucidate the impact&#xD;
      of PPC, with some authors calling for the reinstatement of peritoneal cytology in endometrial&#xD;
      cancer staging .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the effects of pathological factors and peritoneal cytology on recurrence&#xD;
      risk, recent studies in other gynecologic cancers have shown how different approaches in&#xD;
      surgical management play a key role in overall disease prognosis and outcomes. The LACC&#xD;
      trial, published in 2018, demonstrated the effects of differing surgical technique on&#xD;
      outcomes by showing that patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery for management of&#xD;
      cervical cancers fared worse in locoregional recurrence, disease-free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival than patients undergoing traditional laparotomy. This study highlights the impact of&#xD;
      surgical methodology on the prognosis and outcomes of oncologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to the management of cervical cancers, over the last two decades laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
      and staging has become the mainstay of management for women with uterine cancers. The&#xD;
      traditional approach of laparotomy with hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic&#xD;
      and para-aortic lymphadenectomy has come to be effectively replaced with the minimally&#xD;
      invasive, laparoscopic approach which affords an equally efficacious surgery with shorter&#xD;
      recovery and fewer complications . In order to perform more efficient and safe surgeries,&#xD;
      intrauterine manipulators have been employed in laparoscopic hysterectomy. Since their&#xD;
      introduction into gynecologic oncology surgery questions have risen regarding the possibility&#xD;
      of increased risk of tumor dissemination with usage of intrauterine manipulators. The&#xD;
      mechanisms of this have been theorized to include retrograde dissemination via the fallopian&#xD;
      tubes into the peritoneal cavity as well as increased lymphovascular space invasion .&#xD;
      Multiple studies have focused on the question of retrograde dissemination via the fallopian&#xD;
      tubes with conflicting results. A retrospective study by Sonoda et el found that when&#xD;
      low-risk endometrial cancer was managed with laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy&#xD;
      (LAVH) using an inflatable intrauterine manipulator, it was associated with increased&#xD;
      incidence of positive peritoneal cytology compared to the control population (10.3% versus&#xD;
      2.8%). Lim et al prospectively evaluated the effect of uterine manipulator use on peritoneal&#xD;
      cytology in laparoscopic hysterectomy using a RUMI manipulator and KOH colpotomizer and found&#xD;
      that 4.3% of patients in their study were upstaged due to PPC following usage of a uterine&#xD;
      manipulator . However, contrary to this, two prospective studies found that usage of a&#xD;
      uterine manipulator did not increase the incidence of malignant peritoneal cytology in&#xD;
      patients undergoing laparoscopic staging. A prospective study by Eltabakh et al evaluated&#xD;
      conversion from negative to PPC immediately following insertion of a Pelosi uterine&#xD;
      manipulator in 42 patients. Based on their results that demonstrated no patients converted to&#xD;
      PPC, they concluded that intrauterine manipulators do not increase the incidence of PPC.&#xD;
      Additionally, Lee et al published results of a randomized parallel trial of 110 patients&#xD;
      undergoing laparoscopic surgery and staging for stage I endometrial cancer either with or&#xD;
      without a uterine manipulator which showed no significant difference in the rate of positive&#xD;
      cytology in either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized control trial in which patients will be randomized into two&#xD;
      study arms following informed consent: a control arm utilizing a non-invasive sponge stick&#xD;
      (Foerster ring forceps containing a raytec sponge (Vistec Covidien Health, Mansfield, MA))&#xD;
      placed in the vagina for surgical assistance or a Vcare速 intrauterine manipulator (ConMed&#xD;
      Endosurgery, Utica, NY). Patients randomized to the Vcare速 group will have the Vcare速 placed&#xD;
      in the usual fashion under direct visualization following entrance into the abdomen. Cytology&#xD;
      washings will be obtained following entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Washings will be&#xD;
      obtained by washing approximately 150cc of normal saline over the bilateral paracolic&#xD;
      gutters, uterine fundus, and anterior and posterior cul de sacs. Fifty milliliters of fluid&#xD;
      will then be aspirated for cytology collection. Cytology washings will then be obtained again&#xD;
      prior to colpotomy. Patients will undergo total laparoscopic hysterectomy or robotic assisted&#xD;
      total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Peritoneal washings obtained during surgery will be&#xD;
      processed and undergo pathological examination. Covariate data including age, BMI, history of&#xD;
      previous tubal ligation, FIGO stage, histologic type, histologic grade, lymphovascular space&#xD;
      invasion, and gross evidence of tumor spillage will also be obtained.&#xD;
