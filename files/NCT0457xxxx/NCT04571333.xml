  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cochlear implants (CI) provide a large majority of recipients with a significant degree of&#xD;
      speech understanding. However, CI systems rely on external parts, namely Behind-the-Ear (BTE)&#xD;
      audio processors with coils or single-unit processors to function. This can have several&#xD;
      disadvantages: for instance, the hardware is exposed to external trauma and to the effects of&#xD;
      head movement and gravity. The device is also put at risk by humid, dusty, or dirty&#xD;
      conditions as well as by physical activities that lead to water exposure such as swimming or&#xD;
      sports in general (e.g. perspiration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, some patients are concerned with the cosmetic appearance of the external parts&#xD;
      which are visible (more so than modern behind-the-ear hearing aids), something that may not&#xD;
      be desirable to many potential candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation aims to collect data on the use of the Mi2000 system, a totally&#xD;
      implantable cochlear implant system, for the first time in human subjects.&#xD;
