  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised controlled trial in which women discharged from the symptomatic breast clinic,&#xD;
      who are above population risk (according to Tyrer Cuzick) will be asked to create lifestyle&#xD;
      related goals. They will be told their estimated risk of developing breast cancer and will be&#xD;
      randomised to one of three interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast cancer risk leaflet only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lifestyle website&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lifestyle website plus group coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty per cent of women will also be randomised to have Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms&#xD;
      (SNPs) performed, and these will be incorporated into their risk score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point will be whether or not women achieve their lifestyle goal.&#xD;
