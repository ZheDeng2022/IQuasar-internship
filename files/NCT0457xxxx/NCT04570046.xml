  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the pathogenesis underlying tremor in essential tremor (ET) and parkinson disease&#xD;
      (PD) as well as the mechanisms of tremor suppression after Magnetic resonance-guided focused&#xD;
      ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy through multi-model MRI study, and to identify imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers for triaging patients for the suitability of MRgFUS thalamotomy and predicting the&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson disease (PD) are the most prevalent tremor disorders. ET,&#xD;
      considered as a pure tremor disease, is characterized by upper limb intention or postural&#xD;
      tremor, while PD is characterized by a variety of motor and nonmotor symptoms, among them&#xD;
      rest tremor. A number of studies have demonstrated that Magnetic resonance-guided focused&#xD;
      ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is a minimally invasive and effective procedure suitable for&#xD;
      medication-refractory tremor in patients with ET and patients with PD. However, the treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness is variable among individuals. Therefore, it is important to clarify the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of tremor in both ET and PD and the mechanisms of tremor arrest produced by&#xD;
      MRgFUS thalamotomy to triage suitable candidates for MRgFUS thalamotomy and predict clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. In addition, localization precision and individualized treatment remain to be&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;
