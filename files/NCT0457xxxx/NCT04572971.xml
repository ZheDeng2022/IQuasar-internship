  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a condition where scar tissue (called fibrosis) builds&#xD;
      up in the lungs. It usually gets worse over time. Fibrosis causes the lungs to become stiff,&#xD;
      and reduces the amount of oxygen that the lungs can take up. People with IPF complain of&#xD;
      worsening breathlessness, which limits their day to day activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function tests are breathing tests that measure how well the lungs are working, and are&#xD;
      used by doctors to decide whether to start or stop medicines in people with IPF. However,&#xD;
      people with IPF tell us that lung function tests require a lot of effort, can make them cough&#xD;
      and feel very short of breath. About 1 in 5 people with IPF are unable to perform lung&#xD;
      function results accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impulse oscillometry (iOS) is a new type of breathing test. It uses sound waves to measure&#xD;
      the stiffness of the lung. The test is very quick (30 seconds), does not require any effort&#xD;
      from the patient, and only requires a patient to breathe in their usual way. iOS has been&#xD;
      used successfully in children who are unable to perform normal lung function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess whether people with IPF can perform iOS tests accurately and to&#xD;
      compare their experiences of having iOS tests with their experience of performing current&#xD;
      lung function tests. The investigators will also compare whether there is a relationship&#xD;
      between iOS tests and the information gathered from the tests currently used by doctors to&#xD;
      measure the impact of IPF (lung function tests, exercise tests, lung scans and questionnaires&#xD;
      that measure quality of life).&#xD;
