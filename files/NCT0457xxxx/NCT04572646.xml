  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is associated with a higher rate of surgical complications. For example, in&#xD;
      orthopedics, the risk of complications is 31% in smokers against 5% in non-smokers. The&#xD;
      management of this addiction is recommended and particularly interesting in scheduled&#xD;
      surgery, because it allows smoking cessation well before the procedure. However, for patients&#xD;
      who cannot consider this smoking cessation, the mere information of the risk cannot be&#xD;
      sufficient and a real strategy must be constructed and evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, studies results indicate that a patient reducing the number of smoked cigarettes&#xD;
      will unconsciously modify their smoking behaviour to obtain the usual nicotine level, this&#xD;
      effect is called self-titration. Conversely, nicotine replacement while continuing&#xD;
      consumption could induce an improvement in smoking behaviour, therefore less intoxication&#xD;
      which would be beneficial in terms of reduction of post-operative complications. This study&#xD;
      seeks to assess the effectiveness of a systematic proposition of nicotine replacement therapy&#xD;
      (NRT) in regular smokers. Tobacco addiction specialists have demonstrated that intoxication&#xD;
      and dependence are well correlated with the exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) level, so this&#xD;
      measurement will be used in addition to the patient's interview.&#xD;

    <description>Nicotine replacement therapy is proposed to every patient included in the study.&#xD;
Whether the patient accepts the therapy or not, exhaled carbon monoxide is measured at the preoperative consultation (about 15 days before surgery) and the day of surgery by a nurse. These two measures are compared to assess efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy.</description>
