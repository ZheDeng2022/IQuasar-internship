  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase II, randomized, open-label, clinical trial including patients with&#xD;
      muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder candidates for radical cystectomy.&#xD;
      The study will include patients ineligible for cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive durvalumab plus olaparib (Arm&#xD;
      A) or durvalumab alone (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study´s hypothesis is that for patients with muscle-invasive transitional cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the bladder who are not fit for cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy,&#xD;
      Durvalumab monotherapy will have a similar efficacy to historical chemotherapy controls and&#xD;
      Durvalumab in combination with olaparib will be associated with an even improved efficacy&#xD;
      results in terms of pathologic complete response (pCR).&#xD;

             if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The&#xD;
             following age-specific requirements apply: Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered&#xD;
             post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following&#xD;
             cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and&#xD;

             is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the&#xD;

             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
