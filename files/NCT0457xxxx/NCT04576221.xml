      Introduction Pneumonia represents a frequent complication in patients in ICU with rates up to&#xD;
      56% . Although oxygen therapy is the cornerstone for pneumonia treatment, its efficacy might&#xD;
      be minimized because of shunt effects due to the presence of pulmonary exudate and&#xD;
      atelectasis. To improve oxygenation, alveolar recruitment obtained through the application of&#xD;
      either invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) might be necessary, especially&#xD;
      in severe pneumonia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of NIV as a tool to treat pneumonia has dramatically increased over the past decades&#xD;
      and its efficacy has been well studied in clinical practice, especially in treating acute&#xD;
      cardiogenic pulmonary edema and exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).&#xD;
      Concerning NIV treatment in patients with pneumonia, its use has been proved to be effective&#xD;
      only in patients with COPD and in immunocompromised patients with lung infiltrates . The lack&#xD;
      of strong evidence in literature led international experts to suggest only cautious trials of&#xD;
      NIV in well-selected patients with pneumonia and in trained settings with a clear caveat to&#xD;
      avoid a delay in endotracheal intubation . One method of NIV is Continuous Positive Airway&#xD;
      Pressure (CPAP) which is used to administer fresh gas pressure to the spontaneously breathing&#xD;
      patient. By opening more alveolar spaces, CPAP increases the number of functional airways,&#xD;
      thereby reducing total resistance. The success of CPAP therapy is highly influenced by&#xD;
      patient compliance and the level of comfort provided by the CPAP mask and headgear. If the&#xD;
      patient is able to tolerate CPAP and use it correctly, its effective rate is nearly 100% .&#xD;
      The majority of patients fail the treatment not because of its low efficacy for maintaining&#xD;
      upper airway patency but because of intolerance .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different types of physiotherapy exercises which can benefit patient with pneumonia&#xD;
      and help lung recruitment as CPAP ventilation but it is more tolerance to patient than use of&#xD;
      CPAP mask . one of these exercises is breathing stacking which is a breathing exercise to&#xD;
      help improve and maintain the size of breath that the patient is able to take and can be used&#xD;
      regularly to help the patient clear mucus from his chest (secretion clearance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can also be used to help improve the strength of the cough and voice . It is mainly used&#xD;
      for people with weak breathing muscles which makes breathing and coughing difficult. Patients&#xD;
      with neuromuscular diseases often have weakness of their breathing (respiratory) muscles&#xD;
      which affects how well the respiratory system works. It is also used for people with bone or&#xD;
      structural problems which cause a small / altered chest shape making coughing difficult .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of NIV with using CPAP mask versus stacked&#xD;
      breathing on chest expansion and pulmonary function in patients with pneumonia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis:- the investigators hypothesized that stacked breathing exercise is more&#xD;
      effective on chest expansion and pulmonary function and more tolerant to patients with&#xD;
      pneumonia than NIV with using CPAP mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods Research design:- Quasi experimental research design will be utilized to&#xD;
      fulfill the aim of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The independent variables are NIV with using CPAP mask and stacked breathing exercise .&#xD;
           -The dependent variables are the patients ' outcomes which include:-&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Chest expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Pulmonary functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Duration of ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Complications as respiratory complications and general complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Research settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The study will be conducted in 4 settings include:- Chest intensive care unit at&#xD;
                Assiut university hospital. General intensive care unit at Assiut university&#xD;
                hospital. Obstetric intensive care at women health hospital. Trauma intensive care&#xD;
                unit at Assiut university hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Sample:- A convenience sample of 60 male and female adult patients will be taken,&#xD;
                the patients will be classified into two equal groups , 30 patients for each group.&#xD;
                CPAP mask group will receive NIV with using CPAP mask and stacked breathing group&#xD;
                who will receive stacked breathing exercise.&#xD;

    <description>â€¢ Breath stacking was done using a &quot;bag&quot; which is a simple device used to give artificial breaths..&#xD;
It is best done in a sitting position but can be done reclining or lying flat whichever position is used, try to avoid slouching. If sitting: rest against the back of a chair and keep the shoulders, arms and hands relaxed.&#xD;
If using the mouthpiece, place the lips tightly around the mouthpiece to create a tight seal.</description>
