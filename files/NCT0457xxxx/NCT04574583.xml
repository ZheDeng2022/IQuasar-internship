      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination immunotherapy techniques are being explored to improve responses and enhance&#xD;
      benefits in people with cancer. Researchers want to see if this type of treatment can help&#xD;
      people with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe dose of SX-682 in combined treatment with Bintrafusp alfa and BN-CV301&#xD;
      vaccines and to see if this treatment will cause tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older with metastatic cancer may be eligible for the first part of the&#xD;
      trial. Adults age 18 and older with metastatic triple negative breast cancer or p16 negative&#xD;
      head and neck squamous cell cancer, and who are not candidates for curative surgery may be&#xD;
      eligible for the second part of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have tumor biopsies. They will have physical exams. Their symptoms and&#xD;
      medicines will be reviewed. They will have blood tests. They will have electrocardiograms to&#xD;
      evaluate their heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have imaging scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They may have a&#xD;
      procedure where a small tube with a tiny video camera is put into the nose to look at the&#xD;
      throat if they have head and neck cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get bintrafusp alfa through an intravenous catheter. For this, a small tube&#xD;
      is put into an arm vein. They will get BN-CV301 vaccines as injections in the arm or thigh.&#xD;
      They will take SX-682 by mouth twice a day. They will take the study drugs up to 2 years.&#xD;
      They will keep a medicine diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have study visits every 2 weeks. They will have 1 or 2 follow-up visits&#xD;
      within 30 days after they stop treatment. Then they will be monitored by phone or email for 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination immunotherapy approaches are being actively explored to further improve&#xD;
           responses, enhance clinical benefit, and overcome resistance to PD(L)-1 agents in cancer&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory chemokine produced by various cell types.&#xD;
           Overexpression of IL-8 and/or its receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, is commonly seen in many&#xD;
           human cancers including breast, cervical, melanoma and prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SX-682 is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of the CXCR1/2 chemokine receptors that are&#xD;
           believed involved in MDSC-recruitment to tumor and other pro-tumoral mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bintrafusp alfa (M7824 or MSB0011359C) is a bifunctional protein composed of the&#xD;
           extracellular domain of the TGF-BetaRII receptor (TGF-Beta 'trap') fused to a human&#xD;
           IgG1. Preclinical data shows bintrafusp alfa treatment increases T-cell trafficking,&#xD;
           antigenspecific CD8+ T-cell lysis and NK cell activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CV301 is a poxviral-based vaccine comprised of recombinant Modified vaccinia Ankara&#xD;
           (MVA-BN-CV301, prime) and recombinant fowlpox (FPV-CV301, boost). CV301 contains&#xD;
           transgenes encoding two (2) tumor-associated antigens (TAA), mucin 1 (MUC1) and&#xD;
           carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), as well as three costimulatory molecules (B7.1, ICAM-1&#xD;
           and LFA-3, designated TRICOM). A recent phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated that&#xD;
           antigen-specific T cells to MUC1 and CEA, as well as to a cascade antigen, brachyury,&#xD;
           were generated in most participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical studies performed in LTIB with SX-682, M7824 and a CEA-based vaccine showed&#xD;
           a significant reduction in tumor growth as well as a significant increase in tumor&#xD;
           infiltration with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1 (Sequential Dose Escalation):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single agent SX-682.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the MTD of SX-682 followed by M7824 and CV301 vaccines in participants&#xD;
                with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. If the MTD is not reached the study will&#xD;
                be focused to describe the safety and tolerability of SX-682 followed by M7824 and&#xD;
                CV301 vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 (Combination Dose Escalation):&#xD;
&#xD;
           --To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SX-682 with M7824 and CV301&#xD;
           vaccines in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. If the MTD is not&#xD;
           reached the study will be focused to describe the safety and tolerability of the drug&#xD;
           combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3 (Expansion):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate preliminary efficacy based on Objective Response Rate (ORR), in each&#xD;
                disease cohort separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;= 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arms 1 and 2 (Dose-Escalation Cohort): Subjects with cytologically or histologically&#xD;
           confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3 (Expansion Cohorts):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TNBC: Subjects with cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced or&#xD;
                metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer that has progressed on at least one prior&#xD;
                treatment in the advanced or in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HPV negative HNSCC: Subjects with cytologically or histologically confirmed locally&#xD;
                advanced or metastatic, HPV negative head and neck squamous cell cancer (p16&#xD;
                negative for oropharyngeal) that has progressed on at least one prior treatment&#xD;
                involving a platinum drug or cetuximab in advanced or in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless there is no standard treatment&#xD;
           available, the participant cannot tolerate standard first line treatment, or the&#xD;
           participant declines standard treatment after appropriate counseling has been provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status of 0 to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate renal, hepatic, and hematologic function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects in Arms 1 and 2 may have disease that is measurable or non-measurable but&#xD;
           evaluable disease (e.g. present on bone scan, rising tumor markers, non-measurable by&#xD;
           RECIST but visible on CT scan). participants with third space fluid (for example pleural&#xD;
           effusions) as only site of disease will not be eligible. Subjects in Arm 3 must have&#xD;
           measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1 is a phase I, open-label, 3+3 sequential dose escalation trial with short term,&#xD;
           2-week SX-682 monotherapy lead-in followed by treatment with M7824 and CV301 vaccine&#xD;
           series in advanced solid tumors (Q2W dosing schedule) for the duration of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 is a phase I, open-label, 3+3 combination dose escalation trial with short term&#xD;
           SX- 682 monotherapy lead in followed by SX-682 combination with M7824 and CV301 vaccine&#xD;
           series in advanced solid tumors (Q2W dosing schedule). Each enrolled participant will&#xD;
           receive SX-682 as monotherapy for 2 weeks then will receive SX-682, M7824 and CV301 for&#xD;
           the duration of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3 has two expansion cohorts. Following identification of the MTD or R2PD for the&#xD;
           combination of SX-682, M7824 and CV301 vaccine, disease-specific phase 2 expansion&#xD;
           cohorts will open in 1) advanced/metastatic triple negative breast cancer and 2)&#xD;
           advanced/metastatic, platinum-refractory HPV negative head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
           carcinoma.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history of hepatitis C (HCV) infection must have been treated and&#xD;
             cured (viral load is undetectable). For participants with HCV infection who are&#xD;
             currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable or&#xD;
             unquantifiable HCV RNA 12 weeks or longer after definitive treatment completion.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active brain metastases or central nervous system metastasis (less&#xD;
             than 28 days out from definitive radiotherapy or surgery of brain metastasis) are&#xD;

&#xD;
        magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for 6 weeks after treatment is&#xD;
        complete and the MRI within 28 days prior to enrollment. Participants requiring&#xD;
        immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent) for&#xD;
        palliation are excluded. Patients with evidence of intratumoral or peritumoral brain&#xD;
        metastasis hemorrhage on screening imaging are also excluded unless the hemorrhage of brain&#xD;
        metastases is grade &lt; 1 and has been stable on two consecutive imaging scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to any of study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Steroid use or active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an&#xD;
             immunostimulatory agent with the exception of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diabetes type I, eczema, vitiligo, alopecia, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid&#xD;
                  disease or other mild autoimmune disorder not requiring immunosuppressive&#xD;
                  treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants requiring hormone replacement with corticosteroid are eligible if&#xD;
                  the steroids are administered only for the purpose of adrenal insufficiency and&#xD;
                  at doses of &lt;10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Administration of steroids for other conditions through a route known to result&#xD;
                  in a minimal systemic exposure (topical, intranasal, intro-ocular, or inhalation)&#xD;
                  is acceptable;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants on physiologic doses of systemic intravenous or oral corticosteroid&#xD;
                  therapy (greater tahn or equal to the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The use of corticosteroids as premedication for contrast-enhanced studies which&#xD;
                  is allowed prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as&#xD;
             cardiac or pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, bleeding diathesis or recent (within 3&#xD;
             months) clinically significant bleeding events or other illness considered by the&#xD;
             Investigator as high risk for investigational drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of second malignancy within 3 years of enrollment except for the following:&#xD;
             adequately treated localized skin cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, cervical carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ, superficial bladder cancer or other localized malignancy which has been&#xD;
             adequately treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any organ transplantation requiring ongoing immunosuppression including&#xD;
             allogenic stem-cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with bone metastases who have initiated denosumab or a bisphosphonate&#xD;
             therapy within 28 days prior to enrollment. Continuation of prior therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have a QTcf interval &gt; 475 msec or &gt; 480 msec with a BBB on screening&#xD;
             electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a personal or family history of long-QT syndrome or are on a&#xD;
             concomitant drug that is known to cause significant QTc prolongation within 2 weeks or&#xD;
             5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV) or&#xD;
             cerebrovascular accident within one year or acute myocardial infarction within one&#xD;
             year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants unwilling to accept blood products or blood transfusions as medically&#xD;
             indicated. As there is a risk of severe bleeding with M7824, participants must be&#xD;
             willing to receive blood transfusions if medically necessary for their own safety&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition, which would, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator&#xD;
             indicated the subject is a poor candidate for the clinical trial or would jeopardize&#xD;
             the subject or the integrity of the data obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study drugs potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects are unknown. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with study drugs.&#xD;
