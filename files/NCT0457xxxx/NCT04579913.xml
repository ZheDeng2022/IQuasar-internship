    <textblock>
      This study will recruit patients who participated in the MT-03 study in the iTind arm to&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of the iTind procedure at three to five years following&#xD;
      treatment as demonstrated by reduction of symptoms measured by IPSS and QoL and improvement&#xD;
      of functional parameters as measured by peak urinary flow and PVR. Sexual and erectile&#xD;
      function will also be assessed alongside the incidence of any related late occurring adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
