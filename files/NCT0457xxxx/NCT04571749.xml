  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will leverage implementation science and engineering to adapt, implement,&#xD;
      and rigorously evaluate tailored postoperative handoff protocols and implementation&#xD;
      strategies. In doing so, the investigators will develop a vital understanding of the factors&#xD;
      needed for successful and sustained use of evidence-based interventions in acute care. This&#xD;
      knowledge will inform approaches to bridge the evidence-to-practice gap that prevents&#xD;
      effective interventions from realizing the promise of improved patient outcomes in acute care&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical patients who require post-surgical critical care are usually transferred from the&#xD;
      operating room (OR) to the intensive care unit (ICU) for ongoing care. The process of&#xD;
      transferring the patient from the OR to the ICU is called a &quot;handoff.&quot; Handoffs involve the&#xD;
      transfer of patient information and transfer of patient care responsibilities from the OR&#xD;
      team to the ICU team. Multiple studies suggest that these handoffs can expose patients to&#xD;
      preventable harm, which can be avoided with standardization of the handoff. The Handoffs and&#xD;
      Transitions in Critical Care (HATRICC; IRB #819726) study, started in 2014, developed and&#xD;
      implemented a standardized OR to ICU handoff process in two Penn surgical ICUs (SICUs) that&#xD;
      did not have a standardized handoff process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four clinicians (surgeon, anesthetist, ICU provider, and ICU nurse) from two teams (surgical&#xD;
      and intensive care) usually take part in handoff communication. During the HATRICC study, the&#xD;
      investigators evaluated handoff communication between the OR and ICU teams before and after&#xD;
      implementation of the new standardized handoff process (the &quot;HATRICC process&quot;) in multiple&#xD;
      ways, using observations, interviews, focus groups, and surveys. The investigators&#xD;
      demonstrated a 20% improvement in information exchange after implementation of the HATRICC&#xD;
      standardized handoff process, a process tailored to meet the needs of the different&#xD;
      clinicians participating in OR to ICU handoffs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have indicated short-term success in standardizing OR to ICU handoffs, but&#xD;
      sustainability of these improvement interventions has been less well studied. Two studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated sustained or improved information exchange following the institution of&#xD;
      structured OR to ICU handoff processes, but the factors influencing sustainability remain to&#xD;
      be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ascertain determinants of OR-to-ICU handoff protocol adoption and use in 12 adult and&#xD;
           pediatric ICUs in five health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adapt handoff protocols using engineering approaches and select tailored implementation&#xD;
           strategies with implementation mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test the effectiveness of tailored, multifaceted, multilevel implementation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design and create a digital toolkit for other ICUs to identify implementation&#xD;
           determinants, customize OR-to-ICU handoff protocol, and select appropriate&#xD;
           implementation strategies.&#xD;
