  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High tibial osteotomy is a common procedure in orthopedic surgery; it is highly standardized&#xD;
      (incision location and size, the volume of periosteal lesion, implanted material). It is&#xD;
      associated with short recovery period but intense postoperative pain during first 24 hours.&#xD;
      The surgical wound has a comprehensive innervation by saphenous and a terminal muscular&#xD;
      branches of tibial nerve. These conditions allow reproducible measurements of analgesic drugs&#xD;
      effects in postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nefopam is a non-opioid centrally acting analgesic drug used as a part of multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia. The opioid-sparing effect of nefopam is still controversial across various&#xD;
      surgical procedures. In France nefopam is only available as a parenteral formulation; however&#xD;
      it is often administered orally. There is currently no study addressing the efficacy of oral&#xD;
      nefopam for the postoperative pain management including pain prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conduct a prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled study with the main objective&#xD;
      to examine the effect of perioperative orally administered nefopam on postoperative pain&#xD;
      after a high tibial osteotomy. Secondary objectives include the quantification of wound&#xD;
      allodynia, analysis of adverse events, clinical outcomes, and a pharmacokinetic study of&#xD;
      orally given nefopam (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid dosage).&#xD;
