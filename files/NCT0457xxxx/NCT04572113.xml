  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical orthoses are used to restrict motion for the purpose of preventing spinal&#xD;
      instability following trauma or pre- and post-surgery or to protect from pain. Modern&#xD;
      cervical orthoses are able to effectively restrict motion of the head however load is&#xD;
      concentrated on areas of occipital tissue and may, with long term wear, lead to tissue&#xD;
      breakdown in the form of pressure ulcers. Previous research has shown that the Miami J collar&#xD;
      (Ã–ssur Americas Foothill Ranch, CA) effectively reduced cervical movement while providing&#xD;
      superior pressure relief. As new cervical orthoses are developed and become commercially&#xD;
      available it is useful to examine their performance in comparison to existing well-tested&#xD;
      devices. DJO Global (Vista, CA) have recently developed a cervical collar. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the ability of this newly developed collar to restrict cervical&#xD;
      range of motion while at the same time limit the tissue interface pressure exerted by the&#xD;
      collar on patients when they are in an upright seated or supine position Data will be&#xD;
      collected in a fully equipped 3D motion analysis laboratory. Cervical range of motion will be&#xD;
      tracked and analyzed. Interface pressures between the head and collar will be measured using&#xD;
      custom pressure mats.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects will be seated in a backed chair and monitored to ensure their spine remains in contact with the backrest throughout the CROM assessment. Each subject will be instructed to perform a sequence of of neck flexion-extension, lateral flexion, and rotation movements. Each movement will be repeated six times until the motion is stopped by muscle tightness, discomfort or a substitution movement occurs, without a collar, and with each study collar chosen chosen in random order. Angular range of motion in degrees will be recorded in each plane. Flexion-extension - angle between maximum flexion and maximum extension. Lateral flexion - angle between maximum right lateral flexion and maximum left lateral flexion. Rotation - angle between maximum right rotation and maximum left rotation.</description>

    <measure>Tissue interface pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>At enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>With the subject seated, 3, 75 x 120mm pressure sensor pads, each pad each consisting of 40 individual sensors; will be placed over the anterior mandibles and occiput. The subject will be fit with an appropriately sized collar. The order of collar wear will be the same as for the CROM measurements. Pressure measurements and distribution of pressure will be recorded for a period of 30 seconds. The subject will then be placed in a supine position on a standard examination table without a pillow and pressure measurements and distribution of pressure will be collected for a period of 30 seconds while the subject maintains his/her head in a relaxed position.</description>
