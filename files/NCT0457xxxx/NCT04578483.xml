  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor management of post-operative acute pain can contribute to medical complications&#xD;
      including pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, infection and delayed healing, as well as the&#xD;
      development of chronic. In contrast, appropriate pain control is capable of reducing the&#xD;
      postoperative complications, preventing the development of chronic pain, and improving the&#xD;
      quality of life. The workloads of medical staffs and health care cost are subsequently&#xD;
      decreased. Recently, a lot of analgesic methods have been developed and used in clinical&#xD;
      practice, such as patient-controlled analgesia, ultrasound-guided long-term analgesia and&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia. This study is aimed to investigate the outcome of each postoperative&#xD;
      analgesic method used in China Medical University Hsinchu Hospital. This real world data can&#xD;
      serve as a reference toward high health care quality.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational, cohort study. Patients undergoing elective surgery will&#xD;
      be invited to the study. The written informed consent will be obtained prior to&#xD;
      participation. Demographic data, underlying condition, surgical procedures, consumption of&#xD;
      anesthetics and analgesics, analgesic methods, postoperative complications, pain intensity&#xD;
      and life quality will be collected from medical history and by questionnaires.&#xD;
