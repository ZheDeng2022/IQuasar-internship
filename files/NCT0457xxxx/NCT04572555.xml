      AIM: Establishing the effects of heat application on depression, anxiety, menstrual attitude&#xD;
      and severity of dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This randomized controlled prospective experimental trial was conducted with 43&#xD;
      students who were suffering from dysmenorrhea under 2 groups, the heat treatment group (n=20)&#xD;
      and the control group (n=23). To the heat treatment group, dry heat was applied for 20&#xD;
      minutes to the lower abdominal region of the subjects when their dysmenorrhea was most&#xD;
      severe. The control group did not receive any treatments. The data were acquired by using a&#xD;
      Personal Information Form. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for determining the severity of&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea, the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire to establish the type of pain, the&#xD;
      Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire to establish the attitude and the practices during&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale to determine the psychological&#xD;
      impacts of dysmenorrhea were used. In the first menstrual cycle, both groups received the&#xD;
      questionnaires, and no treatment was applied. At the second, third and fourth menstrual&#xD;
      cycles, VAS and the McGill Pain Questionnaire were applied before the treatment (T1), right&#xD;
      after the treatment (T2) and 2 hours after the treatment (T3). The Menstrual Attitude&#xD;
      Questionnaire and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale were applied right after the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      This experimental randomized controlled prospective study was conducted at the tocology&#xD;
      department of a university hospital in Balikesir, Turkey between March 2019 and June 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was determined using G * Power 3 calculations in accordance with prior&#xD;
      studies on heat application to the lower abdomen. Estimation of the effects was acquired from&#xD;
      the findings of Potur and Kömürcü (2014), who reported a pain severity of 1.99 ± 2.42 in the&#xD;
      heat-treated group and 5.78 ± 2.63 in the control group. We aimed to establish a similar&#xD;
      difference. For each group, the sample count was determined as 12. However, in order to&#xD;
      increase the power of the study, 23 students were included both in the heat treatment group&#xD;
      and the control group, totaling up to 46 individuals for the sample. Power analysis indicated&#xD;
      that the size of the sample had a power of 96% with α = 0.05. The decrease comparative to the&#xD;
      control group in the severity of dysmenorrhea pain after heat application had an effect size&#xD;
      of 0.616.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were determined as being at the ages of 18-30, being nulliparous,&#xD;
      having a VAS score of 2 and higher [24], not having a systemic or chronic disease and not&#xD;
      using hormonal contraceptives. The exclusion criteria were determined as using forms of&#xD;
      analgesic and alternative treatments during the study (1 subject in the heat treatment group&#xD;
      was excluded at the 3rd menstrual cycle) and experiencing menstrual irregularities (3&#xD;
      subjects in the heat treatment group and 4 subjects in the control group were excluded at the&#xD;
      3rd menstrual cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the sample of the study, students with dysmenorrhea pain were admitted. Randomization was&#xD;
      achieved by having the subjects pull envelopes for the designation of their groups. Students&#xD;
      who pulled the 'Heat Treatment Group' were allocated to the heat treatment group, and the&#xD;
      students who pulled the 'Control Group' were allocated to the control group. A total of 46&#xD;
      students partook in the study, and 3 students from the heat treatment group were excluded&#xD;
      from the study by their own requests. At the 1st and the 2nd menstrual cycles, the heat&#xD;
      treatment group consisted of 20 subjects, and the control group consisted of 23. At the 3rd&#xD;
      menstrual cycle, 4 subjects from the heat treatment group and 4 subjects from the control&#xD;
      group were excluded from the study in accounts of their analgesic medicine usage or inability&#xD;
      to menstruate. At the 3rd and 4th menstrual cycles, the heat treatment group had 16 subjects,&#xD;
      and the control group had 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the collection of the data, Personal Information Forms were developed by the researchers&#xD;
      in accordance with the scientific literature, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in order to&#xD;
      establish the severity of the dysmenorrhea pain, the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire to&#xD;
      determine the types of pain, the Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire to establish the attitudes&#xD;
      and the behaviors during menstruation and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale to&#xD;
      determine the psychological effects of dysmenorrhea were utilized. The Personal Information&#xD;
      Form was applied to the heat treatment group and the control group after receiving permission&#xD;
      from the subjects. The subjects were observed for a total of 4 menstrual cycles. The subjects&#xD;
      in the heat treatment group and the control group were instructed not to use any analgesic&#xD;
      medication or alternative treatments during the study. In the 1st menstrual cycle, heat&#xD;
      treatment was not applied to the subjects. In the first menstrual cycle, the Short Form&#xD;
      McGill Pain Questionnaire, VAS, the Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire and the Depression&#xD;
      Anxiety and Stress Scale was applied at the peak severity of dysmenorrhea pain. In the&#xD;
      following 3 menstruation cycles, VAS-T1 and the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-T1 were&#xD;
      applied to the heat treatment group and the control group at the peak severity of&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea pain. Later, 20 minutes of heat treatment was applied to the heat treatment&#xD;
      group. The control group were not given any treatments. VAS-T2, the Short Form McGill Pain&#xD;
      Questionnaire-T2, the Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire and the Depression Anxiety and Stress&#xD;
      scale were applied to the subjects in both groups 20 minutes after the primary evaluation.&#xD;
      VAS-T3 and the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire were applied to both groups 2 hours after&#xD;
      the primary evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermoforming was applied to the lower abdomen by the subjects themselves when the&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea pain was at its peak. The subjects were instructed on the application of the&#xD;
      thermophores. Thermoforming was applied wrapped in towels in order to shield the subjects&#xD;
      from the effects of direct heat. In a study, heat packs that had a temperature of 38.9 °C&#xD;
      were used for treatment of dysmenorrhea. In this study, the temperature of the water used in&#xD;
      the thermoforming process was 45 °C. Considering the risk of the thermophores cooling down&#xD;
      and the shielding provided by the towels, the water temperature was kept higher compared to&#xD;
      those in other studies. The temperature of the water was measured using a liquid thermometer.&#xD;
      Heat treatment was applied for 20 minutes without interruptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS): This scale was utilized to establish the severity of the&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea pain in the subjects. The scale consists of a 10 cm vertical line starting with&#xD;
      0 and ending with 10. In this study, VAS was applied in 4 menstrual cycles; 1st menstrual&#xD;
      cycle, once when the pain was most severe (T1), at the 2nd, 3rd and the 4th menstrual cycles,&#xD;
      once when the pain was most severe (T1), 20 minutes after the primary application (T2) and 2&#xD;
      hours after the first application (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ): This questionnaire was used to establish the&#xD;
      type of the dysmenorrhea pain in the subjects. The questionnaire consists of 15 items in 2&#xD;
      sub-scales that consist of the sensory (11 items) and affective pain (4 items) sub-scales.&#xD;
      Each item is evaluated with a Likert-type scale between 0 and 3 (0: none, 3: severe), and the&#xD;
      sum of these results established the total pain score. Furthermore, the evaluative total pain&#xD;
      intensity index was measured using a 6-point Likert-type scale. In this scale '0' represents&#xD;
      no detectable pain, whereas '5' represents unbearable pain. The Turkish version of the&#xD;
      questionnaire was tested for its validity and reliability in 2007 and found to be reliable&#xD;
      and valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS): This scale was developed by Lovibond and&#xD;
      Lovibond in 1995 to identify the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. The&#xD;
      validity and reliability studies of its Turkish form were performed by Akın and Çetin in&#xD;
      2007. The scale includes 42 questions in which the given answers are evaluated quantitively&#xD;
      between 0 (not suitable for me) and 3 (fully suitable for me). Depression, anxiety and stress&#xD;
      are rated as normal, mild, moderate, advanced and extreme. This scale was included in the&#xD;
      study to determine the effects of the heat treatment on depression, anxiety or stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire (MAQ): The reliability and the validity of the scale used to&#xD;
      establish the attitudes and the behaviors of the subjects during menstruation were tested by&#xD;
      Kulakaç et al. (2008). The scale includes 31 items as follows; menstruation as a debilitating&#xD;
      event (7 items), menstruation as a bothersome event (5 items), menstruation as a natural&#xD;
      event (5 items), anticipation and prediction of the onset of menstruation (8 items) and&#xD;
      denial of the effects of menstruation (6 items). Each item is evaluated between 1 and 5 (1: I&#xD;
      strongly disagree, 5: I strongly agree) using a 5-point Likert-type scoring.&#xD;
