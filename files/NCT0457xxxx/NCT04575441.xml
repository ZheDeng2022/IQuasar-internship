    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of exercises conducted with pilates ball&#xD;
      on balance, reaction time, quality of life, and behavior among preschool children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 volunteers, aged 4 and 5 years old, who continue kindergartens will randomly be grouped&#xD;
      into two as study group (SG) (n=30) and control group (CG) (n=30). Exercises including&#xD;
      pilates ball will be applied to SG children for 40 minutes, twice a week, 6 weeks. CG will&#xD;
      continue normal daily routines for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic information of all people will be recorded after their parents signed&#xD;
      informed consent form. Single Leg Standing (eyes open and close) for static balance,&#xD;
      Functional Reach Test (FRT)for dynamic balance, Ruler Drop Test for reaction time, dual task&#xD;
      performance methods will be used.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Exercises are generally suggested starting from primary school children. However, exercise&#xD;
      habit should be given to people from earlier ages. Moreover, doing exercise can be beneficial&#xD;
      to improve motor skills of this age and this improvement can support other developmental&#xD;
      areas of these children. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effects of an exercise&#xD;
      routine on balance, reaction time and dual task performance of preschool children. This&#xD;
      exercise program includes pilates ball to make more fun for this age group. All movements are&#xD;
      conducted with the same pilates ball. Exercises are conducted with individual sessions in the&#xD;
      kindergartens of children.&#xD;

    <description>Functional reach test is used. Children are asked to stand next to the wall with their right side and extend their right arm with 90 degree shoulder flexion. Then they are asked to extend with their arm as far as possible by protecting their lower limb posture. The distance is recorded in cm.</description>

    <description>Ruler drop test is used to measure reaction time. A rule of 50 cm long is used. Children are asked to catch the ruler as fast as possible. Since the ruler is left with its zero point below, distance is recorded in cm as the result of this outcome.</description>

    <measure>Dual task performance</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Timed-up and go (TUG) test is used as a motor skill and a cognitive task is asked from children as a second task. For timed up and go test, a three meter pathway will be marked with red colored masking tape. The TUG test is administered using 2 standard chairs and children are asked to walk in a self preferred speed. At the same time, children are asked to count many animal names.</description>

    <description>Various exercises are conducted with using pilates ball. Sensory feedbacks like proprioception and vestibulation are given. Many physical fitness parameters like balance, coordination, speed and agility are used in this exercise program. Children are taken to the program for 40 min, twice a week during 6 weeks.</description>
