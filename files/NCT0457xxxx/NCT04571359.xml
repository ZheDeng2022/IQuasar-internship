    <textblock>
      The evaluation of 24 hour urinary oxalate excretion is the gold standard for diagnosing&#xD;
      Hyperoxaluria in patients with recurrent urolithiasis. The relationship of oxalate&#xD;
      measurement between spot and 24 hour urine sample has not been studied in Pakistani&#xD;
      population before. Thus, it is necessary to see if spot urine samples show good correlation&#xD;
      with 24 hour urine samples in our population where the frequency of hyperoxaluria in patients&#xD;
      with urolithiasis is reported to be 64.5%. Also, the various pre analytical issues associated&#xD;
      with 24 hour urinary collection which may lead to the incorrect or misdiagnosis, need for&#xD;
      duplicate testing consuming extra resources and man power. We therefore, in this study, want&#xD;
      to see the correlation between 24 hour urinary oxalate and oxalate to creatinine ratio. The&#xD;
      aim of our study is to determine the relationship between 24 hour urinary oxalate and spot&#xD;
      urine oxalate to creatinine ratio and to identify if oxalate to creatinine ratio can be used&#xD;
      as an alternative to 24 hour urinary oxalate&#xD;

      A cross-sectional study was conducted at Section of Chemical Pathology, Department of&#xD;
      Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi from 1st February to 31st&#xD;
      December 2019. Adult patients with history of kidney stones presenting at the Clinical&#xD;
      Laboratory for 24 hours urine oxalate estimation were included in the study. Debilitated or&#xD;
      bed ridden patients and patients with renal failure or end stage renal disease, in whom&#xD;
      urinary oxalate is no longer an indicator of disease status were excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Study was approved by ethical review committee of Aga Khan University Hospital. Patients&#xD;
      after informed consent, were guided to submit a spot urine sample. Clinical details were&#xD;
      recorded on a structured questionnaire by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 hour urine samples were collected in a jar having thymol, which is routinely added to&#xD;
      limit bacterial growth and hence guard against citrate degradation. Spot urine samples were&#xD;
      collected in red top container without any added preservatives. The specimen were transported&#xD;
      to the laboratory within the 12 hours of collection of 24 hour urinary specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volume of 24 hour urine was measured in liters. After mixing of the urinary sample to&#xD;
      overcome effects of sedimentation, a 6 ml aliquot was made and HCl was added to avoid the&#xD;
      precipitation of oxalate crystals in every sample. Specimen was stored at -20 C till further&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary oxalate was measured on Micro lab 300 using a kit based on oxalate oxidase principle&#xD;
      by Trinity Biotech plc. Wick low, Ireland following standard operating procedures. Urinary&#xD;
      creatinine was measured on ADVIA 1800 by Siemens, US using kinetic Jaffe reaction. Both&#xD;
      normal and abnormal quality control materials were run with every batch of oxalate and&#xD;
      creatinine analysis in urine to validate the results. In addition, external proficiency&#xD;
      testing of urinary oxalate was conducted by College of American Pathologists (CAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cut-offs for 24 hour oxalate excretion was 502 킬mol/24 hours for males and 353 킬mol/24&#xD;
      hours for females. The cut-offs for spot oxalate: creatinine ratio was 33 킬mol/mmol for males&#xD;
      and 45 킬mol/mmol for females.&#xD;
