    <textblock>
      Gene mutation is a research hotspot in the occurrence of multiple malignant tumors. The&#xD;
      somatic gene mutations of many different types of tumors not only help to study the&#xD;
      tumorigenesis mechanism and molecular diagnosis, but also can be used as an ideal therapeutic&#xD;
      target. Large-scale gene profiling studies performed by humans in various types of epithelial&#xD;
      tumors have confirmed some new gene mutations. However, there are few reports on the&#xD;
      detection of genes related to inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, and humans have not yet&#xD;
      understood its molecular content. Therefore, it is necessary to further use molecular&#xD;
      detection methods to explore the molecular markers of IMT to facilitate its follow-up precise&#xD;
      treatment plan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor（IMT）is a rare clinical mesenchymal tissue-derived tumor,&#xD;
      which can occur in almost all organs and soft tissues, and is characterized by low-grade or&#xD;
      borderline tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is mainly based on histopathology and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry. The treatment is resistant to conventional chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The only curative treatment is complete surgical resection. When IMT shows&#xD;
      typical cellular structural features in pathology, the diagnosis is relatively simple.&#xD;
      However, in the presence of atypical features, the accurate diagnosis of IMT is still a&#xD;
      challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a better diagnostic method. Secondly, there&#xD;
      is no individualized treatment method for aggressive IMT patients who relapse and metastasize&#xD;
      after surgery. At present, gene mutation is a research hotspot in the occurrence of various&#xD;
      malignant tumors. The somatic gene mutations of many different types of tumors not only help&#xD;
      to study the tumorigenesis mechanism and molecular diagnosis, but also can be used as an&#xD;
      ideal therapeutic target. Large-scale gene profiling studies performed by humans in various&#xD;
      types of epithelial tumors have confirmed some new gene mutations. However, there are few&#xD;
      reports on the detection of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, and humans have not yet&#xD;
      understood its molecular content. Therefore, it is necessary to further use molecular&#xD;
      detection methods to explore the molecular markers of IMT to facilitate its follow-up precise&#xD;
      treatment plan.&#xD;
