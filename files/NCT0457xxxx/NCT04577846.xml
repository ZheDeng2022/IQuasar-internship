  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the second most prevalent malignancy in the world and an important component&#xD;
      of treatment warrants surgical procedures such as mastectomy. Surgical site infections after&#xD;
      breast surgery may range from 1-26%, which is high for surgeries that are considered &quot;clean&#xD;
      procedures&quot;, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wound&#xD;
      classification system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic antibiotics given before the surgical incision as per Joint Commissions SCIP&#xD;
      (Surgical Care Improvement Project) guidelines, have been shown to decrease the rate of&#xD;
      postoperative infections in a vast number of patients. There is however, no clear consensus&#xD;
      due to lack of evidence on continuation (duration) of prophylactic antibiotics in patients&#xD;
      undergoing mastectomy with indwelling drains, and thus antibiotic prescribing practices may&#xD;
      vary among breast as well as reconstructive surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial all patients undergoing mastectomy without immediate reconstruction will&#xD;
      receive a single prophylactic dose of preoperative antibiotic, and subsequently, the patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to either continue the prophylactic antibiotics or receive a placebo for&#xD;
      the duration of indwelling drains. The aim of this trial is to compare the difference in SSI&#xD;
      rates between these two study arms as the main outcome. In addition, the factors associated&#xD;
      with differing rates of SSI in the intervention and control group will also be identified.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, breast cancer comprises 10.4% of all cancer among women, making it the second most&#xD;
      common cancer (after lung cancer) and the fifth most common cause of cancer related death.&#xD;
      The management of patients as a matter of patient preference or as dictated by extent of&#xD;
      disease often warrants a mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports of surgical site infections after breast surgery including mastectomy may range from&#xD;
      1-26%, which is high for surgeries that are considered &quot;clean procedures&quot;. Despite a high&#xD;
      rate of surgical site infections, there is no consensus on the continuation/duration of&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics in patients undergoing mastectomy. Consequently, practices may vary&#xD;
      among breast and reconstructive surgeons. Evidence regarding the risk of SSI with the use and&#xD;
      duration of indwelling drains is also controversial. The length of prolonged, postoperative&#xD;
      antibiotic may also vary by practitioners, some using a pre-defined regimen of about 2-7&#xD;
      days, and others continuing them until the drains are removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most guidelines recommend a single dose of pre-operative antibiotics and continuation after&#xD;
      surgery has been discouraged. The use of common or more specific antibiotics for the duration&#xD;
      of drains being in place is also controversial. The recommendation by recent national&#xD;
      clinical guidelines is to use one dose of pre-procedural antibiotics for mastectomy patients&#xD;
      with or without drains. The American Society of Breast Surgeons also does not recommend the&#xD;
      continuation of post-surgical antibiotics in the absence of relevant indications. However,&#xD;
      practices vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is lack of evidence and significant surgeon practice variation despite guidelines&#xD;
      developed by leading societies, we propose to study the difference in rates of surgical site&#xD;
      infection (SSI) with or without continuation of prolonged post-operative, prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics in all patients undergoing mastectomy without immediate reconstruction and with&#xD;
      indwelling drains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial all patients undergoing mastectomy without immediate reconstruction will&#xD;
      receive a single prophylactic dose of preoperative antibiotic, and subsequently, the patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to either continue the prophylactic antibiotics or receive a placebo for&#xD;
      the duration of indwelling drains. The aim of this trial is to compare the difference in SSI&#xD;
      rates between these two study arms as the main outcome. In addition, the factors associated&#xD;
      with differing rates of SSI in the intervention and control group will also be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, the investigators will be able to identify the most effective&#xD;
      prophylactic regimen to reduce rates of SSI among mastectomy patients with indwelling drains&#xD;
      leading to evidence-based and informed decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine rates of surgical site infection (SSI) in patients in two separate arms of this&#xD;
      trial, in which all patients will receive the first prophylactic pre/perioperative antibiotic&#xD;
      dose and then be randomized to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis continued for the duration of indwelling drains&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Those who only receive a single dose of preoperative prophylactic antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify factors associated with differing rates of SSI in the intervention and control&#xD;
      group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical site infection(SSI) rates at the mastectomy wound site or the drain(s) insertion&#xD;
      site among patients. In this study SSI will be evaluated using the standard CDC criteria&#xD;
      which are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. purulent drainage from the incision or drain site;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. deliberate opening of the incision by a surgeon in patients having either tenderness,&#xD;
           localized swelling, redness, or warmth; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. diagnosis of SSI by the surgeon or study wound assessor (trained research assistant) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. prescription of therapeutic antibiotics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients clinically diagnosed and documented to have cellulitis.&#xD;
