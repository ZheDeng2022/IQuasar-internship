  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brief summary : Very few studies have evaluated the prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR),&#xD;
      highly resistant emerging bacteria and Clostridioides difficile toxinogenic (CDt) in&#xD;
      residents and in healthcare workers (HCW) in nursing home (NH). Most of study were conducted&#xD;
      in acute care services and were limited to specific bacterial species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : The carriage of MDR bacteria in resident may be a risk factor for an outbreak in&#xD;
      NH or in healthcare facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence for carriage of&#xD;
      MDR bacteria and CDt in residents in NH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the prevalence for carriage of MDR bacteria and CDt toxigenic in HCW in NH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the risk factors for carriage of MDR bacteria and CDt in residents in nursing&#xD;
           home&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the risk factors for carriage of MDR bacteria and CDt in healthcare workers in&#xD;
           NH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the presence of cross-transmission of MDR bacteria and CDt in one or several NH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the association between the presence of cross-transmission of MDR bacteria and&#xD;
           CDt in a NH and the management of infection control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishment a collection of stool samples&#xD;
