  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Müllerian anomalies (MA) are associated with infertility and affect approximately 6.3% of the&#xD;
      infertile population. The estimation of the frequency of MAs is not without controversy&#xD;
      because it depends on the diagnostic method used and sometimes on the established diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria. This pathology is associated with abortion during the second trimester in addition&#xD;
      to other complications that include preterm labor, fetal malpositions and an increased rate&#xD;
      of caesarean section, although some patients may remain asymptomatic. An association between&#xD;
      MA and endometriosis has been described and in particular the case of the septum uterus,&#xD;
      therefore it is difficult to establish whether the reproductive results of women with MA&#xD;
      tdepend only on the uterine factor or also on the quality of the oocytes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main reproductive problems associated with these malformations include, abortion ,&#xD;
      recurrent abortion ectopic pregnancy and preterm delivery . The experience gained from oocyte&#xD;
      donation shows that these women are pregnant less, even with the transfer of good quality&#xD;
      embryos. The hypothesis of this poor uterine receptivity is in the poor endometrial&#xD;
      vascularization that can decrease embryo implantation. The reason for infertility in women&#xD;
      with AM includes decreased muscle mass, decreased endometrial vascularization, decreased&#xD;
      capacity of the endometrial cavity, less receptive areas (septum). The lower fertility&#xD;
      observed in some women with Müllerian malformations has been partially explained by its tubal&#xD;
      factor and its association with endometriosis, with a higher prevalence in them, compared to&#xD;
      patients without malformations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have confirmed an irregular differentiation and estrogenic maturation of the&#xD;
      endometrium lining the uterine septum or its internal structure, which has less presence of&#xD;
      connective tissue and more muscle mass. Given the confusion generated if the unfavorable&#xD;
      reproductive result is due to oocyte quality or endometrial receptivity, it is necessary to&#xD;
      use a model that guarantees oocyte / embryo quality and this is offered by oocyte donation.&#xD;
      The aim is to evaluate the implantation rate in women with MA who receive donated oocytes&#xD;
      compared to women without MA.&#xD;
