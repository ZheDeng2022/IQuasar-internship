  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated significant associations of attention-deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with monoamine transporter genes, including dopamine&#xD;
      transporter gene (DAT1), norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2), and serotonin transporter&#xD;
      gene (SLC6A4) as well as the important role of environmental factors in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      ADHD. Hence, investigating how genes and environments interact with each other may contribute&#xD;
      to the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of ADHD. In this 3-year project,&#xD;
      investigators will explore the complex gene-environment interplay in ADHD with multimodal&#xD;
      neurobiological approaches, including neuropsychology, neuroimaging, and metabolites, in&#xD;
      order to identify the crucial pathophysiological pathways from genes to the brain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the present project, investigators aim to explore the complex gene-environment interplay&#xD;
      in children with ADHD to identify the crucial pathophysiological pathways from genes to the&#xD;
      brain. To achieve our objective, investigators will use multimodal neurobiological approaches&#xD;
      to effectively resolve the four major challenges in exploring gene-environment interactions&#xD;
      on ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. investigators will use multiple levels of neurobiological approaches to identify the&#xD;
           interactions between monoamine transporter genes and environment on ADHD, including&#xD;
           neuropsychology, neuroimaging, and neuroactive metabolites in plasma, which will provide&#xD;
           larger effects than clinical diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. investigators will employ correlation analyses to test for the presence of correlations&#xD;
           between the monoamine transporter genotypes and the environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. investigators will use both categorical (diagnosis of ADHD) and dimensional (inattention&#xD;
           and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms of ADHD) approaches to assess the interaction&#xD;
           effects between monoamine transporter genes and environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. investigators will conduct interactions with ageitems to model more accurately the&#xD;
           effects of age, which may be non-linearly related to the neurobiological basis of ADHD.&#xD;
