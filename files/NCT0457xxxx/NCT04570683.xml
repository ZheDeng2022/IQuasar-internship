      The study aim is to assess the immunological and clinical response in basal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (BCC) treated with ablative fractionated laser (AFL) as monotherapy and compare with BCC&#xD;
      treated with combination-therapy of AFL and the anti-PD1-drug nivolumab and with nivolumab as&#xD;
      monotherapy.&#xD;

      Explorative open label study. Patients and investigators are non-blinded and patients not&#xD;
      randomized to interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three intervention groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AFL monotherapy (8-10 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AFL+intratumoral nivolumab (8-10 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intratumoral nivolumab monotherapy (8-10 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend 4 visits Immunological response is determined by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      (IHC) analysis from biopsies taken prior to AFL, AFL+Nivolumab or Nivolumab treatment&#xD;
      (baseline) and compared with biopsies 1 week after treatment. Further, comparison of the&#xD;
      immunological response of AFL monotherapy with immunological response AFL+Nivolumab and&#xD;
      Nivolumab as monotherapy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included for AFL as monotherapy will after tumor demarcation receive AFL of the BCC&#xD;
      including a 5 mm margin. An occlusive bandage will be applied to the treated area and is to&#xD;
      be removed by the patient 24 hours after treatment or after end of secretion/oozing from the&#xD;
      treated area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included for AFL+Nivolumab will after tumor demarcation receive AFL of the BCC&#xD;
      including a 5 mm margin, immediately followed by intratumoral injection of Nivolumab. An&#xD;
      occlusive bandage will be applied to the treated area and is to be removed by the patient 24&#xD;
      hours after treatment or after end of secretion/oozing form the treated area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included for monotherapy with Nivolumab will after tumor demarcation get an&#xD;
      intratumoral injection of Nivolumab. An occlusive bandage will be applied to the treated area&#xD;
      and is to be removed by the patient 24 hours after treatment or after end of secretion from&#xD;
      the treated area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a final visit at week 15, around 12 weeks after first treatment, where&#xD;
      the clinical response will be evaluated, and treated tumor will be treated following national&#xD;
      guidelines for treatment of BCCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subgroups of clinical responders and non-responders tumor will at week 15 be used for&#xD;
      multiplex gene expression analysis via nanostring (Pan cancer immune profiling panel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all groups, clinical photographs are taken at every study visit. For patients that&#xD;
      present with more than one tumor, patients will be invited to participate with all tumors&#xD;
      relevant to the study.&#xD;
