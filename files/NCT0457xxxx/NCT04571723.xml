  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to understand whether the established Diabetes prevention&#xD;
      program works to reduce diabetes risk by shifting mindsets about health.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a lifestyle intervention which aims to modify health&#xD;
      behaviors, has reduced diabetes risk across several American Indian Communities. However,&#xD;
      there were significant attrition rates, and non-completers were at the highest risk at&#xD;
      baseline. One's mindset about health (i.e. whether it is fixed or malleable) may affect their&#xD;
      likelihood of completing the intervention and its efficacy in reducing risk. With an existing&#xD;
      CAB, I will develop a culturally congruent adaptation of the DPP, the Mindset-DPP (M-DPP).&#xD;
      The M-DPP will include a discussion of mindset in each session and will present material&#xD;
      focused on the plasticity of health, including evidence that one's mindset can affect&#xD;
      outcomes that relate to risk for diabetes. The investigators will implement the DPP and the&#xD;
      MDPP in a sample of 40 Blackfeet community members at risk for diabetes and test whether the&#xD;
      M-DPP associates with greater shifts towards a growth health mindsets (i.e. health can be&#xD;
      changed by effort) compared to the DPP, and whether the M-DPP associates with greater&#xD;
      increases in physical activity levels and greater reductions in waist circumference, and&#xD;
      greater retention compared to the standard DPP.&#xD;

    <description>The Health Mindset Questionnaire will be used to measure the degree to which participants view health as fixed or modifiable. Higher scores on the scale reflect a stronger growth health mindset (i.e. health can be changed) while lower numbers reflect a more fixed health mindset (i.e. health is not modifiable). The range of possible scores is 3-18. Change will be calculated from subtracting the health mindset score will be calculated by subtracting the health mindset score at baseline from subsequent health mindset scores (2 change scores will be calculated: one at 6 weeks after baseline and one at 11 weeks after baseline).</description>
