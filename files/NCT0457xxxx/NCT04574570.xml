  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This preliminary pilot study is a single-centre, prospective, uncontrolled, 32-month study to&#xD;
      assess the performance of personalised opening wedge High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) treatment&#xD;
      using the TOKA® device and procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical device being examined is a custom-made device and therefore does not require a CE&#xD;
      mark. Furthermore, the study will serve as a useful method of gathering clinical data and&#xD;
      measuring device performance, as well as establishing a potential commercial relationship&#xD;
      with the hospital administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives::&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the morphology of the knee joint and the improvement of OA following the TOKA®&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to Assess the functional outcome of the knee joint and the improvement of OA following&#xD;
           the TOKA® treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Evaluations::&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The morphology of the knee joint is assessed by verifying the matching between the&#xD;
           planned correction and the post-operative imaging results, along with the investigation&#xD;
           of the maintenance of the desired correction at the follow-up meetings. These results&#xD;
           are measured through the correction angle, hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA - mechanical axis),&#xD;
           Mikulicz point (recorded as a percentage of the tibial width from the medial to the&#xD;
           lateral region) and posterior slope, using the imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The functional outcome of the knee joint is assessed by a) performing a gait analysis of&#xD;
           the patients pre-operatively and post-operatively, b) the use of clinical scoring...&#xD;

    <measure>Functional Assessment via clinical scoring - European Quality of life via 5-Dimensions questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The functional assessment is performed via clinical scoring using the European Quality of life via 5-Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D). In applied EQ-5D, the respondents classify their own health status into 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression with 3 levels of severity (no problems, moderate problems, or severe problems. Based on that, patients could be classified into 243 health states and 2 additional states (unconscious and dead). The EQ-5D health states are converted into a single summary score by applying weights to each of the levels in each dimension, as is typically done in cost utility analysis. Health state index scores range from less than 0 (where 0 is the value of a health state equivalent to dead; negative values representing values as worse than dead) to 1 (the value of full health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility.</description>

    <time_frame>Before surgery and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The functional assessment is performed via clinical scoring using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). VAS is based on a 10-cm long straight line with one end meaning no pain and the other end meaning the worst pain; on this line, patients are asked to mark a point that matches the amount of pain they feel; the quantification of the point location with respect to the two ends is representative of the ammount of pain.</description>
