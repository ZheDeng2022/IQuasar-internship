  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wake Forest Post-Intensive Care Unit Telehealth (WFIT) program consists of a nurse&#xD;
      practitioner who has access to daily activity data as well as telehealth capabilities for 6&#xD;
      months post-hospital discharge in order to improve the post-critical illness care of&#xD;
      patients. The study team expects that this program will reduce costs to patients. Through&#xD;
      this intervention the study team hopes to improve quality of life, patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      reduce readmissions and ER visits, and reduce mortality. The study team will perform a formal&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with a cost-effectiveness analysis to demonstrate its value.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wake Forest Baptist Health (WFBH) discharges over 1,000 patients annually after a critical&#xD;
      illness such as septic shock and/or acute respiratory failure. This number is expected to be&#xD;
      even higher due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. To try to bridge this gap, the Wake&#xD;
      Forest Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Recovery Clinic was created in 2014. WFBH ICU Recovery&#xD;
      Clinic (1 of ~15 nationwide) uses a multidisciplinary approach to transition care for ICU&#xD;
      survivors back to Primary Care Physicians (PCPs). However, currently only about 5% of&#xD;
      patients leaving the ICU who had respiratory failure and/or septic shock and may benefit from&#xD;
      follow-up. In addition, patients seen in WFBH Recovery Clinic typically are only seen one&#xD;
      time and then return to the care of their PCPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor physical function following critical illness is associated with hospital readmissions&#xD;
      and mortality. However, barriers to post-ICU follow-up are common and include financial&#xD;
      concerns as well as transportation barriers. Additionally, the Wake Forest ICU Recovery&#xD;
      Clinic only sees patients once in the post-critical illness period, despite the fact that&#xD;
      post-ICU morbidity remains high for at least six months following discharge. Finally, data&#xD;
      demonstrates availability of internet services on a daily basis to the vast majority of the&#xD;
      population (79% total of NC Congressional Districts 5, 6, and 13 in 2013; 68% in a random&#xD;
      sample of 28 medical ICU patients). Taken together, this prompts the study team to propose&#xD;
      this Wake Forest Post-ICU Telehealth (WFIT) program of a nurse practitioner who has access to&#xD;
      daily activity data as well as telehealth capabilities in order to improve the post-critical&#xD;
      illness care of these patients. The study team expects that this program will reduce costs to&#xD;
      patients. Through this intervention the study team hopes to improve quality of life, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, reduce readmissions and ER visits, and reduce mortality. The study team will&#xD;
      perform a formal randomized controlled trial with a cost-effectiveness analysis to&#xD;
      demonstrate its value.&#xD;

    <description>Determine if the WFIT Program is cost-effective by measuring INB in the intervention arm (WFIT program) compared to an attention control arm.&#xD;
Incremental net benefit ($) = [Change in Quality of Adjusted Life Year (QALY) *100,000] - [Change in health care spending]&#xD;
INB is defined as the difference between change in quality of life evaluated at monetary valuation of 1 QALY (currently $100,000) and change in health care spending. Using this measure, even if WFIT does not affect patient quality of life, then INB will equal the reduction in health care spending.</description>
