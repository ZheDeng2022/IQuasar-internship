    <textblock>
      This is an open-label prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study comparing&#xD;
      DTM-SCS programming approach to Conventional SCS programming approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this investigational study is to study the effects of Differential Target&#xD;
      Multiplexed Spinal Cord Stimulation (DTM-SCS) in subjects with chronic, intractable pain of&#xD;
      the trunk with or without lower limb pain, including unilateral or bilateral pain without&#xD;
      prior history of spine surgery and refractory to conservative and surgical interventions.&#xD;

      This is an open-label prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study comparing&#xD;
      DTM-SCS programming approach to Conventional SCS programming approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects meeting study entrance criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two&#xD;
      study treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test treatment group with DTM-SCS programming approach&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control treatment group with Conventional SCS programming approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data at follow-up visits will be compared between the two treatment groups, and in reference&#xD;
      to baseline assessments collected at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an optional two-way crossover to the other treatment group available for all&#xD;
      subjects who remain implanted at 6 month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 250 subjects may be enrolled at up to 20 clinical sites in the United States in order&#xD;
      to include an estimated 135 subjects to the point of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This would allow a minimum of 100 subjects (50% in each treatment arm) to complete the&#xD;
      3-month endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected total duration of this study is approximately 32 months.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the percentage of randomized subjects who respond to SCS therapy at 3-months after device activation. An individual responder is a subject that experiences at least a 50% decrease in back pain relative to baseline assessment.</description>

    <description>This SCS group will be programmed under the direction of physicians with support of clinical representatives of the Test and Control treatments, which may identify the type of treatment to study participants. Also, open communication about sensation of paresthesia and pain relief is important in adjusting program parameters to provide optimal pain relief for participants. The assessments of device performance are done by the participants and not by the site personnel so the lack of blinding of site personnel should not affect results as pain is the major assessment and participants tend to describe pain truthfully since it affects their everyday life dramatically and not be influenced by knowledge of the device programming.</description>
