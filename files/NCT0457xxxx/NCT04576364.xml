      To compare the use of magnesium sulfate for 12 hours versus 24 hours in postpartum women with&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia with severe features , to ensure maximum efficacy of anticonvulsant action that&#xD;
      can be achieved with least exposure to Mgso4 side effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy constitute one of the leading causes of maternal and&#xD;
      perinatal mortality worldwide. It has been estimated that preeclampsia complicates 2-8% of&#xD;
      pregnancies globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preeclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy associated with new-onset hypertension, which occurs&#xD;
      most often after 20 weeks of gestation and frequently near term. Although often accompanied&#xD;
      by new-onset proteinuria, hypertension and other signs or symptoms of preeclampsia may&#xD;
      present in some women in the absence of proteinuria. Recently preeclampsia is divided into&#xD;
      preeclampsia with severe features, preeclampsia without severe, features. One of serious&#xD;
      complication of preeclampsia is occurrence of eclampsia. Eclampsia refers to the occurrence&#xD;
      of new-onset, generalized, tonic-clonic seizures or coma in a woman with preeclampsia.&#xD;
      Eclampsia can be prevented with magnesium sulphate, which decreases the risk of seizures by&#xD;
      50%, paralleled by a reduction in maternal mortality. It is considered as the gold standard&#xD;
      of management of eclampsia Although magnesium sulphate administration is recommended for all&#xD;
      women with severe preeclampsia, consensus has not yet to be reached on the ideal duration of&#xD;
      prophylactic postpartum anticonvulsant therapy. The use of magnesium sulphate has been&#xD;
      recommended for 24 hours following delivery, the period of greatest risk for the occurrence&#xD;
      of eclampsia. There are other regimen 12-hour, 6-hour Use of magnesium sulphate therapy is&#xD;
      not without complications, consequently longer duration therapy possesses the risk of&#xD;
      magnesium toxicity such as respiratory depression, renal and neuromuscular dysfunction. Risks&#xD;
      of these complications require regular supervision; hence it is particularly important to&#xD;
      assess the minimum effective duration of treatment&#xD;
