  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoedema is a chronic debilitating disease that can have severe adverse effects on&#xD;
      day-to-day life causing great physical and visual discomfort. The clinical presentation is&#xD;
      characterised by chronic swelling of limbs, accompanied by localised pain, skin changes and&#xD;
      recurrent infections. It is caused by a disruption in lymphatic flow which prevents the&#xD;
      normal circulation of interstitial fluid (situated in the spaces between the cells of the&#xD;
      body), resulting in swelling of the affected limb. It can be primary (cause unknown) or&#xD;
      secondary to a number of causes such as malignancy, trauma, surgery, radiotherapy, infection,&#xD;
      or venous disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In breast cancer treatment, axillary surgery and radiotherapy significantly damage normal&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage of the upper limb, causing lymphoedema in 1-in-5 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing body of evidence that this chronic and debilitating condition can be&#xD;
      better managed through early surgical intervention rather than the current conservative&#xD;
      management, which rely on pressure garments and massage. This surgical intervention,&#xD;
      lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA), joins up a number of the draining lymphatic vessels to&#xD;
      correspondingly sized veins on the affected limb using microsurgical techniques. A special&#xD;
      dye and camera system is used to facilitate identifying lymph vessels. This creates a new&#xD;
      drainage pathway for the lymph fluid around the area of disruption, improving lymphatic flow.&#xD;
      Volume reduction is expected and this would be expected to provide quality of life benefits&#xD;
      for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to compare the outcomes from both therapies and determine whether LVA&#xD;
      surgery can help to improve the physical burden and quality of life for patients affected by&#xD;
      lymphoedema. Furthermore, lymphoedema places a substantial burden on NHS services. If this&#xD;
      trial is successful, LVA surgery could improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall cost&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome measure is to evaluate the efficacy of LVA surgery (combined with CGT) by comparison of arm volume measurements across both the surgical and the control group at set time points post-surgery). This will be performed using the mean excess volume reduction (EVR) as a percentage change at 12 months - measured with perometry.</description>

    <description>Patients randomised to the surgical group will undergo near infrared spectroscopy imaging to assess suitability and plan the surgical procedure.&#xD;
Limb measurements with perometry and bio-impedance spectroscopy will be performed at baseline. Under general anaesthetic multiple LVA bypass procedures will be performed on the affected arm. Near infrared spectroscopy imaging will be used throughout. One week after discharge the patient will return for the bandages to be removed and the wounds inspected for any evidence of infection before renewing the bandage. Again, two weeks after surgery, the patient will return for inspection of wound and removal of sutures. It is at this point that the surgical patients will be returned into a standard lymphoedema compression garment, fitted by the research nurse. Thereafter, standard follow up (Bilateral) measurements and checks will be done at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Non-surgical cohort</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The main intervention for the non-surgical group largely encompasses limb measurements with perometry and bio-impedance spectroscopy at baseline before a compression garment is applied. The compression garments will be measured and fitted by a trained lymphoedema specialist and will be given the standard advice as is best practice for such patients currently. This cohort will likewise be followed up at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year and undergo perometry readings and measurements with comparable collection of data.&#xD;
For patients in both surgical and non-surgical groups, the compression garments will be measured and fitted by a trained lymphoedema specialist and they will be given the standard advice as is best practice for such patients currently. For each patient key details of the surgical technique, garment specification, imaging results and perometry/BIS measurements will be recorded on a study specific form for subsequent entry onto the database.</description>

    <description>Lymphoedema is well recognized as a chronic debilitating disease resulting from an abnormal collection of protein-rich fluid within the subcutaneous tissues of the body. Given the need to identify more effective treatments, more recent advances in super microsurgical techniques have seen the introduction of new procedures, perhaps the most successful of which have involved re-routing the lymphatic fluid by using microsurgery to divert small lymphatic channels into venules in the sub-dermal plane (LVA surgery). This procedure is performed under regional or general anaesthetic as a day-case operation, leaving only a few very short scars in the skin of the arm or leg.</description>
