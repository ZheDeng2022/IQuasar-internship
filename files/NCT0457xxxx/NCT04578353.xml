  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety and performance of AquaPass System for&#xD;
      enhancing fluid transfer through the skin, by increased sweat rate, in edematous patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, open label single arm study, conducted in two phases:&#xD;
      up to 6 healthy subjects (Phase 1) and up to 16 chronic heart failure (CHF) patients (Phase&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study, requirements and potential risks, consenting patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled and undergo 3 procedures (each procedure up to 3 (±1) hours operation), with&#xD;
      4-10 days between each procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up for 7 (±2) days from final procedure.&#xD;
