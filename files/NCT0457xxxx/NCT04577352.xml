  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy (using the modified Friedreich&#xD;
      Ataxia Rating Scale [mFARS]) and safety of vatiquinone in participants with Friedreich ataxia&#xD;
      (FA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, participants will be stratified by&#xD;
      baseline mFARS score (&lt;40 versus ≥40), age of disease onset (&lt;14 versus ≥14), and age at&#xD;
      screening (≤21 years or &gt;21 years) and randomized to receive either vatiquinone or placebo&#xD;
      using interactive response technology (IRT). Following completion of the randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled phase (72 weeks), participants will enter into an open-label&#xD;
      extension phase (24 weeks) during which they will receive open-label treatment with&#xD;
      vatiquinone at the dose they received in the randomized phase of the study (for participants&#xD;
      entering the extension phase who initially received placebo, the dose of vatiquinone will be&#xD;
      determined based on age and weight) and then a safety follow-up (approximately 30 days [±5&#xD;
      days] after last dose or termination visit, whichever is later).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy analysis will be based on change from baseline in mFARS score of&#xD;
      participants between 7 and 21 years old. In order to explore the treatment efficacy and&#xD;
      safety, approximately an additional 20 participants &gt;21 years of age will be randomized for a&#xD;
      total of approximately 126 participants.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) Score at Week 72</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) is a disease-specific scale that measures progression of neurological effects of FA. The mFARS is a validated and reliable 93- item scale; comprised of the neurologic component of the FARS and evaluates bulbar, upper limb, lower limb, and upright stability/gait function. For each item, responses categorize the corresponding neurological finding, and the findings are assigned a score ranging from 0 to 3, 4, or 5 with 0 being normal and higher numbers indicative of greater impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale Activities of Daily Living (FARS-ADL) Score at Week 72</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The FARS-ADL is a subsection of the FARS questionnaire that assesses activities of daily living, including speech, personal hygiene, feeding, and mobility. Participants rank each category using a scale of 0 (normal) to 4 (severe disability/ inability to carry out activity independently), with lower scores indicative of &quot;normal&quot; function/activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in 1-Minute Walk Test (1MWT) at Week 72</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The 1MWT is a timed performance test used to measure functional ability, walking endurance, balance, and muscle performance by measuring maximal walking speed in 1 minute. Participants will be instructed to walk as quickly as possible for 1 minute without running. Maximal walking speed will be measured upon completion of the walk and recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Falls Through Week 72</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The fall log directly relate to a participant's ability to ambulate during normal daily activities. Thus, each participant will be required to maintain a fall log, which will include the date and time of each fall. Falls as defined by World Health Organization as &quot;inadvertently coming to rest on the ground, floor or other lower level, excluding intentional change in position to rest in furniture, wall or other objects,&quot; will be reported.</description>
