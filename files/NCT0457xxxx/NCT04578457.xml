  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will perform two different listening tasks: (1) listening to, and repeating&#xD;
      back, sentence lists presented in noise, and (2) Subjective rating of effort &amp; performance&#xD;
      following each condition. During this study, continuous, non-invasive physiological&#xD;
      measurements (skin conductance, changes in pupil dilation) will be recorded from&#xD;
      participants. Using this paradigm we will be assessing the effect of different hearing aid&#xD;
      processing algorithms on listening effort. The study takes the form of a one factor&#xD;
      (algorithm), within-subjects design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant performs the Speech perception task with each algorithm (reference, noise&#xD;
      reduction I, noise reduction II, noise reduction III), at two individualized signal-to-noise&#xD;
      ratios (SRT90 and SRT50). Additionally subjective performance ratings in real-life will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;

    <measure>Differences in Event-related-skin-conductance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Skin conductance will be recorded from participants during the performance of the auditory task. Analyses will be carried out on the skin conductance response recorded during a time window following each auditory stimulus. It is planned to analyze event-related skin conductance response amplitudes &amp; latencies (micro-Siemens &amp; milliseconds).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in Event-related-pupil-dilation (ERPDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pupil dilations will be recorded from the participant during the performance of the auditory tasks.&#xD;
Analyses will be carried out relative to the pre-trial baseline (measured one second prior to the onset of the stimulus), in order to account for differences in baseline physiological activity.&#xD;
It is planned to analyze event-related-pupil-dilations. We use the unit: pixels. The size of a pixel in 1mm^2 is relative to the distance between the eye and the camera. Even though participants heads were placed on a chin rest that was always the same distance from the camera, the distance between the individual eye and the camera can still be different due to differences in participants' anatomies.&#xD;
Thus, pupil dilation are often reported relative to an individuals' baseline, for example as percent change relative to the baseline.&#xD;
Therefore, we use the unit: pixels, as the use of mm^2 may be inaccurate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oldenburg Sentence Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Words recalled correctly: words repeated back by participants are logged and the percentage of words recalled correctly calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sound Quality Ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sound quality ratings will be assessed with the aid of a Multi-Stimulus Test.&#xD;
The data, serving as secondary outcome measure, are collected in the laboratory.&#xD;
The scale ranges from 0 &quot;very bad&quot; to 6 &quot;very good&quot; in increments of 1. Individual sound quality rating from participants are averaged over 3 different acoustic scenes for each hearing aid program.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spectro-temporal-modulation Detection Thresholds (STM)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stimuli which contain simultaneous frequency and amplitude modulations of a wide-band noise carrier are presented to the participants.&#xD;
The depth of the modulations is systematically varied and the individual modulation detection thresholds are recorded as a broadband decibel (dB) value.&#xD;
For each participant 4 measures were made and averaged to give a mean STM threshold.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Non-verbal Trail Making Test A &amp; B</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making Test (TMT) is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible according to a given order. In version A the order is given by increasing digit number (i.e. 1-25) while in version B the order is given by alternating digits and letters (i.e. 1-A-2-B-3-Câ€¦). The data, serving as an outcome measure, are time-to-complete the set in seconds.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Digit-Span Test Forward (FW) &amp; Backward (BW)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The digit-span task is used to measure working memory's number storage capacity. Participants will see a sequence of numerical digits and are tasked to recall the sequence correctly, with increasingly longer sequences being tested in each trial. The participant's span is the longest number of sequential digits that can accurately be remembered, which means that the participant recalls two sequences out of a maximum of three sequences correct. Digit-span tasks can be given forwards or backwards, meaning that once the sequence is presented, the participant is asked to either recall the sentence in normal or reverse order.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Go/No-go Task</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Go/No-go task measures inhibitory control. Participants are asked to respond to a Go stimulus as fast as possible but not respond to a No-go stimulus. Go stimuli are presented at a rate much higher than the No-go stimuli to elicit prepotent motor activity. The outcome measure of this task is the number of commission errors (i.e. responding to a No-go stimuli) a participant commits as a measure of their ability to stop prepotent motor activity.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Volume Pulse</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood volume pulse will be recorded from participants during the performance of the auditory task (non-invasively with a photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor). Analyses will be carried out on the data recorded during a time window following each auditory stimulus (relative to baseline activity). It is planned to analyze event-related changes in pulse rate and amplitude (beats per minute).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Respiration Data</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Respiration rates will be recorded from participants during the auditory task using a belt placed under the ribcage. This data will only be used to control for changes in breathing patterns which may influence skin conductance measurements.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Skin Temperature Data</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Skin temperature will be recorded from participants during the auditory task using a small thermometer attached to the outside of the little finger (non-dominant hand). This data will only be used to control for changes in temperature which may influence skin conductance measurements.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Acoustic Reflex Thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tympanometry will be used to assess the mobility of the eardrum, prior to recording Acoustic Reflex Thresholds (ARTs). Compliance [ml], Middle Ear Pressure [daPa] and ear canal volume [ml] will be recorded and checked that they fall within normal limits. Where this is the case, ARTs will be measured using 0.5, 1 &amp; 2 kHz stimulus tones ipsi- and contralaterally for each ear. The resulting outcome measure will be the threshold [dB] required at each frequency and ear arrangement for a stapedial reflex to be present.</description>

          <title>Randomized Condition</title>
          <description>This was a crossover &quot;within subject design&quot; study in which all participants undertook all study conditions.&#xD;
These conditions consisted of different hearing aid settings, and were interleaved within study appointments.&#xD;
Accordingly, the different conditions are reported here as study 'Periods' to avoid participants being included multiple times in the overall protocol count.&#xD;
This means there will be a discrepancy whereby the number starting a period will be greater than the number completing the previous 'period'. Of course this is simply due to the fact that the study 'periods' as reported are not chronological.</description>

        <description>Pupil dilations will be recorded from the participant during the performance of the auditory tasks.&#xD;
Analyses will be carried out relative to the pre-trial baseline (measured one second prior to the onset of the stimulus), in order to account for differences in baseline physiological activity.&#xD;
It is planned to analyze event-related-pupil-dilations. We use the unit: pixels. The size of a pixel in 1mm^2 is relative to the distance between the eye and the camera. Even though participants heads were placed on a chin rest that was always the same distance from the camera, the distance between the individual eye and the camera can still be different due to differences in participants' anatomies.&#xD;
Thus, pupil dilation are often reported relative to an individuals' baseline, for example as percent change relative to the baseline.&#xD;
Therefore, we use the unit: pixels, as the use of mm^2 may be inaccurate.</description>

          <description>The sound quality ratings will be assessed with the aid of a Multi-Stimulus Test.&#xD;
The data, serving as secondary outcome measure, are collected in the laboratory.&#xD;
The scale ranges from 0 &quot;very bad&quot; to 6 &quot;very good&quot; in increments of 1. Individual sound quality rating from participants are averaged over 3 different acoustic scenes for each hearing aid program.</description>
          <population>By the time this outcome measure was performed, 2 of the original participants had withdrawn from the study.&#xD;

        <title>Non-verbal Trail Making Test A &amp; B</title>
        <description>The Trail Making Test (TMT) is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible according to a given order. In version A the order is given by increasing digit number (i.e. 1-25) while in version B the order is given by alternating digits and letters (i.e. 1-A-2-B-3-Câ€¦). The data, serving as an outcome measure, are time-to-complete the set in seconds.</description>

        <title>Digit-Span Test Forward (FW) &amp; Backward (BW)</title>
        <description>The digit-span task is used to measure working memory's number storage capacity. Participants will see a sequence of numerical digits and are tasked to recall the sequence correctly, with increasingly longer sequences being tested in each trial. The participant's span is the longest number of sequential digits that can accurately be remembered, which means that the participant recalls two sequences out of a maximum of three sequences correct. Digit-span tasks can be given forwards or backwards, meaning that once the sequence is presented, the participant is asked to either recall the sentence in normal or reverse order.</description>

        <title>Go/No-go Task</title>
        <description>The Go/No-go task measures inhibitory control. Participants are asked to respond to a Go stimulus as fast as possible but not respond to a No-go stimulus. Go stimuli are presented at a rate much higher than the No-go stimuli to elicit prepotent motor activity. The outcome measure of this task is the number of commission errors (i.e. responding to a No-go stimuli) a participant commits as a measure of their ability to stop prepotent motor activity.</description>

        <title>Blood Volume Pulse</title>
        <description>Blood volume pulse will be recorded from participants during the performance of the auditory task (non-invasively with a photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor). Analyses will be carried out on the data recorded during a time window following each auditory stimulus (relative to baseline activity). It is planned to analyze event-related changes in pulse rate and amplitude (beats per minute).</description>

        <title>Acoustic Reflex Thresholds</title>
        <description>Tympanometry will be used to assess the mobility of the eardrum, prior to recording Acoustic Reflex Thresholds (ARTs). Compliance [ml], Middle Ear Pressure [daPa] and ear canal volume [ml] will be recorded and checked that they fall within normal limits. Where this is the case, ARTs will be measured using 0.5, 1 &amp; 2 kHz stimulus tones ipsi- and contralaterally for each ear. The resulting outcome measure will be the threshold [dB] required at each frequency and ear arrangement for a stapedial reflex to be present.</description>
