  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial is designed to compare the recurrence&#xD;
      rates and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic subdural hematoma using exhaustive&#xD;
      drainage or fixed-time drainage after one-burr hole craniostomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs) are one of the most common neurosurgical conditions. The&#xD;
      goal of surgery is to alleviate symptoms and minimize the risk of symptomatic recurrences.&#xD;
      The standard surgical technique includes burr-hole craniostomy, followed by intraoperative&#xD;
      irrigation and placement of subdural closed-system drainage. The drainage is removed after 48&#xD;
      hours, which can be described as fixed-time drainage strategy. According to literature, the&#xD;
      recurrence rate is 5-33% with this strategy. In the investigators' retrospective study,&#xD;
      postoperative hematoma volume (p=0.001, B=0.028, Exp(B)=1.028, 95% CI 1.011-1.046) was found&#xD;
      to significantly increase the risk of recurrence. Based on these results, an exhaustive&#xD;
      drainage strategy may minimize postoperative hematoma volume and achieve a low recurrence&#xD;
      rate and good outcomes. This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      designed to include 304 participants over the age of 18 years presenting with a symptomatic&#xD;
      CSDH verified on cranial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. After informed&#xD;
      consent is obtained, participants are randomly allocated to an exhaustive drainage or&#xD;
      fixed-time drainage group. The primary endpoint is recurrence indicating a reoperation within&#xD;
      6 months. Secondary outcomes include modified Rankin Scale, Markwalder Grading Scale,&#xD;
      European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), rate of complications, rate of&#xD;
      adverse events and effect on comorbidity.&#xD;

    <description>All participants are treated with burr-hole craniotomy and a drainage system as follows. Participants undergo surgical procedure under local anesthesia in the hemisphere with a lateral position, but general anesthesia is performed when participant cannot tolerate the operation. A single 1.5 cm burr hole is drilled over the maximum width of the hematoma cavity. After coagulating with bipolar diathermy, dura mater is opened with a cruciate incision. A soft catheter is placed carefully in all directions of the hematoma cavity for irrigating subdural collections with 1,000 mL warm Ringer's lactate saline until clarification. The drainage catheter is inserted Â½ length of the maximum diameter of the hematoma cavity toward the frontal region. After the skin is closed, the catheter was connected to a soft collection bag that is placed under the head for passive drainage. During the drainage period, participants stay in bed until the drain is removed.</description>

    <description>All participants will be treated with a one-burr-hole craniotomy with irrigation and a closed drainage system. If the computed tomography (CT) scan on the first day after surgery indicates that the affected brain region shows sufficient re-expansion, the drainage catheter will be removed when drainage ceases. If subdural collections remain in the hematoma cavity, the participant will be treated with 30,000 U urokinase injection into the hematoma cavity through the catheter. The catheter will be closed and reopened in 1.5-2 hours, and a CT scan will be performed when drainage ceases. If the CT scan shows sufficient re-expansion of the brain, the catheter will be removed. However, if the brain does not show good re-expansion and there is still a residual subdural collection, the above steps will be repeated. If the participant is subjected to urokinase injection for 3 times, the catheter will be removed when drainage ceases.</description>
