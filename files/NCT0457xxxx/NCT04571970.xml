  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RGX-121 is a gene therapy which is designed to deliver a functional copy of the&#xD;
      iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) gene to the central nervous system. This study is a phase I/II&#xD;
      study to determine whether RGX-121 is safe, well tolerated, and potentially effective in&#xD;
      children five years of age and over who have severe MPS II.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MPS II is a rare X-linked recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the&#xD;
      iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) gene. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant&#xD;
      idursulfase (ELAPRASE®) is the only approved product for the treatment of Hunter syndrome;&#xD;
      however, ERT as currently administered does not cross the blood brain barrier and is&#xD;
      therefore unable to address the unmet need in MPS II patients with CNS (neurocognition and&#xD;
      behavior) involvement. RGX-121 is designed to deliver a healthy gene to cells in the CNS and&#xD;
      iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) may then be secreted by transduced cells which may cross-correct&#xD;
      non-transduced cells by taking up the functional enzyme. This is a Phase I/II, multicenter,&#xD;
      open-label, single arm study of RGX-121. Approximately 6 children (≥ 5 years to &lt; 18 years of&#xD;
      age) who have severe (neuronopathic) MPS II could be enrolled into a single dose cohort and&#xD;
      will receive a single dose of RGX-121 administered by IC or ICV injection. Safety will be the&#xD;
      primary focus for the initial 24 weeks after treatment (primary study period). Following&#xD;
      completion of the primary study period, participants will continue to be assessed (safety and&#xD;
      efficacy) for up to a total of 104 weeks following treatment with RGX-121.&#xD;
