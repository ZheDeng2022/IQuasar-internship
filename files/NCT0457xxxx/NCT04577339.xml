      This is a single-centre retrospective cohort study utilising electronic hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to improve care for all patients with an intestinal emergency,&#xD;
      irrespective of whether they have surgery or not. Data will be derived from electronic&#xD;
      patient records collected as part of routine clinical patient care on all general adult wards&#xD;
      (excluding maternity) between 2013 and 2020. We will then identify patients who had an&#xD;
      emergency laparotomy, and those who had a laparoscopic procedure. We aim to identify 2&#xD;
      further groups where treatment is non-surgical (but could be medical or interventional&#xD;
      radiology) or where treatment is considered futile, suggesting that an early focus on end of&#xD;
      life care might be appropriate. The primary objective is to provide mortality rates for&#xD;
      different treatment options, and analysis of short- and long-term outcomes. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are to define patient sub-groups with similar health characteristics based on&#xD;
      clinical data and an established risk index and to use statistical analysis to predict the&#xD;
      risk of death for each patient group and treatment option, which will allow us to identify&#xD;
      the best care pathways for each cluster.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal emergencies are common, involving perforation, obstruction or ischaemia of the&#xD;
      bowel, often needing life-saving emergency surgery, with a large incision to access the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity called &quot;laparotomy&quot;. This procedure is high risk with 10% mortality rate.&#xD;
      30,000 emergency laparotomies are performed each year in England and Wales. Since 2013, the&#xD;
      National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) has set standards of care and monitored outcomes&#xD;
      for emergency laparotomy, which has reduced mortality from 11.8 to 9.5%. However, patients&#xD;
      who do NOT have a laparotomy are not well characterised and do not receive the prioritised&#xD;
      care patients having surgery do, even though their condition is no less severe. Initial&#xD;
      research has shown a surprisingly large group of patients (32%) with an intestinal emergency&#xD;
      do not have surgery and have 30-day mortality of 63%. There are three additional groups of&#xD;
      patients admitted with abdominal emergencies: patients having keyhole surgery or&#xD;
      interventional radiological procedures, and patients for whom any treatment would be futile&#xD;
      and would benefit most from an end of life care pathway. Clearly further work is needed to&#xD;
      investigate the management of ALL patients with intestinal emergency, to optimise care for&#xD;
      each group of patients.The aim of this study is to improve care for all patients with an&#xD;
      intestinal emergency, irrespective of whether they have surgery or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre retrospective cohort study utilising electronic hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be derived from electronic patient records collected as part of routine clinical&#xD;
      patient care on all general adult wards (excluding maternity) between 2013 and 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have an acute intestinal condition, based on their ICD-10 codes and OPSC-4 codes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must be &gt;= 16 years of age at the time of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have at least one full set of vital signs recorded on the day of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have at least one full set of routine blood tests recorded on the day of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternity admissions during/after pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients admitted or undergoing abdominal surgery for a second time or more Using OPCS-4&#xD;
           codes from PAS and TheatreManTM and NELA data, we will then identify patients who had an&#xD;
           emergency laparotomy, and those who had a laparoscopic procedure. We aim to identify a&#xD;
           further group where treatment is futile, suggesting that an early focus on end of life&#xD;
           care might be appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have estimated that we will have about 2,500 patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria in&#xD;
      this period. Patient outcomes will be analysed from up to one year following their admission&#xD;
      for acute abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide mortality rates for different treatment options, and analysis of short- and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define patient sub-groups with similar health characteristics based on clinical data and&#xD;
      an established risk index, and to use statistical analysis to predict the risk of death for&#xD;
      each patient group and treatment option, which will allow us to identify the best care&#xD;
      pathways for each cluster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mortality risk for each treatment group&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of other outcomes and long-term complications and association between patient&#xD;
      factors and these outcomes&#xD;

    <description>Laparotomy is the opening of the abdominal cavity usually through a midline incision.&#xD;
Laparoscopy is using minimal access keyhole surgery to perform the surgery instead of laparotomy Interventional radiology is the use of imaging to perform a procedure on the abdomen without surgery, for example, using ultrasound to guide a needle to drain an abscess Best supportive care is usually end-of-life care concentration on relieving symptoms rather than treating the cause.</description>
