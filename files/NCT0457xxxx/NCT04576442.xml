  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity (PA) is an important component of asthma management in children. Studies&#xD;
      show that PA is associated with decreased severity of asthma symptoms, as well as improved&#xD;
      disease control and quality of life. However, urban minority children with asthma face&#xD;
      barriers to PA on multiple levels.The goal of this research project is to evaluate whether a&#xD;
      multifaceted school-based intervention that addresses key barriers to physical activity&#xD;
      reduces asthma morbidity among urban schoolchildren with asthma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial with 416 children ages 5-11&#xD;
      years with persistent or uncontrolled asthma from 26 Bronx schools. Schools will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either (1) the Asthma-PASS intervention or an asthma management (AM) comparison&#xD;
      group. Both groups will participate in an existing classroom-based daily activity program.&#xD;
      Enrollment will occur over 4 consecutive school years with 6-8 schools joining the study each&#xD;
      year. The investigators will assess the effectiveness of Asthma-PASS in reducing asthma&#xD;
      morbidity, and improving PA as well as additional clinical and functional outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators will also identify potential mediators and moderators of the intervention&#xD;
      effect. They will evaluate the process of intervention implementation by applying the RE-AIM&#xD;
      framework.&#xD;

    <description>The investigator will collaborate with the student's primary care provider (PCP) by sending a letter via facsimile, and/or email to ensure appropriate medications are prescribed or adjusted and rescue medications are available at school. Community Health Workers (CHWs) will follow up with PCPs as needed to provide reminders about prescriptions for controlled medications and to ensure a MAF is provided to schools to allow rescue medication administration by nurses. CHWs will work with local pharmacies when possible to have prescribed medications delivered to schools and homes. For students without a PCP, we will refer families to one of Montefiore Medical Center's 20 practices throughout the Bronx. For students without medical insurance or who are unable to go to a Montefiore clinic, the NYC DOE physicians who routinely attend NYC schools will provide medical care and prescribe appropriate medications.</description>

Each child will receive two 1-on 1, 20-minute developmentally appropriate educational sessions at school 3-4 weeks apart. Sessions will cover: 1) asthma basics, symptoms and triggers; and 2) medications and correct administration technique. Caregivers will be called after each child session to highlight key points reviewed with the child and answer questions.</description>
