  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Hepatic insufficiency is a complication that puts the life of the patient&#xD;
      undergoing resective surgery at risk. Thus, the diagnosis should be made early. The current&#xD;
      gold standard allows its diagnosis on the fifth postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indocyanine green is a water soluble dye. When administered intravenously, it binds to plasma&#xD;
      proteins and it is removed unchanged by bile, without experiencing enterohepatic&#xD;
      recirculation, which allows estimating the function of hepatocytes and the function of&#xD;
      hepato-splacnic flow. There is a measurement system named &quot;Non-invasive liver function&#xD;
      monitor&quot; (LiMON®, PULSION Medical Systems, Munich, Germany), which allows the measurement of&#xD;
      indocyanine green clearance at the patient's bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: The use of indocyanine green plasma disappearance during the perioperative&#xD;
      period tries to know the exact value of the hepatic function in the most real conditions,&#xD;
      when the excision has been performed, thus giving the investigators the actual value of the&#xD;
      unresected liver. This allows te investigators to estimate the risk of hepatic insufficiency&#xD;
      development that can lead to hepatic failure. Due to the characteristics of the test, it&#xD;
      could get reliable results earlier than the current &quot;gold standard &quot; (50:50 Criteria on the&#xD;
      5th postoperative day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses and Objectives: The investigators hypothesized that the determination of the&#xD;
      hepatic reserve by identifying the indocyanine plasma clearance in real time after hepatic&#xD;
      parenchymal resection could lead to a more accurate and earlier statement of the hepatic&#xD;
      reserve than current tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine the usefulness of indocyanine green in the perioperative&#xD;
      period to early diagnosis of hepatic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: A prospective observational post-authorization study (EPA-SP) is&#xD;
      performed to study de usefulness of indocyanine green. The study was approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      and Clinical Research Committee of the University General Hospital of Ciudad Real. Surgical&#xD;
      patients scheduled for liver surgery, who agreed to be included in the study and signed an&#xD;
      informed consent, were included in the study over a two-year period, after having understood&#xD;
      the study objectives and its possible complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements were performed with the LiMON® monitor prior to liver resection and on the first&#xD;
      postoperative day to patients undergoing liver resection surgery and compared with gold&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;
