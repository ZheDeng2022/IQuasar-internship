    <textblock>
      Management of trauma is a neglected field in developing nations.Road Traffic Injuries (RTI)&#xD;
      cause around 1.35 million deaths worldwide annually according to the statistics of World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) and in India 150000 death per year. An overwhelming proportion of&#xD;
      these deaths occur before patients even reach the hospital. Two third (60.7%) of the accident&#xD;
      victims belonged to the age range of 15 to 44 years. This indicates that active and&#xD;
      productive age people are the one affected by road traffic accidents related injuries in turn&#xD;
      adding to higher economic loss to the country. Lack of medical attention is attributed to&#xD;
      nearly 30 per cent of deaths at site and 80 per cent of the remaining patients died within an&#xD;
      hour of injury (golden hour). Most of these deaths are due to airway management failure,&#xD;
      respiratory failure or continuing hemorrhage that are preventable causes with appropriate&#xD;
      prehospital and subsequent hospital emergency care. Mortality due to RTI is increasing,&#xD;
      especially in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC). There is a lack of research on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of pre-hospital care in India. Selection of appropriate strategies and correct&#xD;
      policy-making in these conditions may lead to decreased rates of death due to RTI in several&#xD;
      countries.This study aimed to describe the prehospital care of RTI victims presenting to the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) in Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute,&#xD;
      Thrissur.&#xD;
