  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder impingement syndrome is a very common cause of shoulder pain and normally treated&#xD;
      with physiotherapy or surgery. Research has shown that physiotherapy is as effective as&#xD;
      surgery, however, the incidence of surgery for this condition is on the rise internationally,&#xD;
      nationally and locally. The most effective form of physiotherapy, however, is not known.&#xD;
      Laboratory studies have suggested that posterior shoulder tightness may contribute to&#xD;
      irritation of the soft tissue around the shoulder joint and perpetuate pain from shoulder&#xD;
      impingement syndrome. There is a lack of good quality evidence to support this perspective.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment for posterior shoulder tightness in&#xD;
      combination with 'best care' compared with 'best care' alone in individuals with shoulder&#xD;
      impingement syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomised, controlled, double blind (patient and assessor), parallel&#xD;
      group, feasibility study with 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients awaiting surgery will be&#xD;
      assessed for inclusion/exclusion criteria and then randomly allocated into one of two groups.&#xD;
      60 patients will be assigned to receive 'best care' physiotherapy, with or without treatment&#xD;
      for posterior shoulder tightness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy treatment will be delivered over 13-15 weeks and outcomes will be assessed at&#xD;
      0, 6-8, 13-15, 26 and 52 weeks. The results will help us to understand if this is an&#xD;
      important part of physiotherapy treatment, which might help reduce patient's pain and&#xD;
      disability as well as reduce the cost of treatment for the National Health Service.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomised, controlled, double blind (patient and assessor), parallel&#xD;
      group, feasibility study with 1:1 allocation ratio. The patients will be assessed for&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and then randomly allocated into one of two groups. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive the same exercise and educational interventions. The treatment group will also&#xD;
      receive specific intervention for posterior shoulder tightness; the placebo group will&#xD;
      receive placebo posterior shoulder tightness intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in secondary care environment. Subjects will be recruited from the&#xD;
      outpatient orthopaedic clinics at Worthing and Southlands Hospitals, part of Western Sussex&#xD;
      Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be promoted with fliers and research posters in the outpatients department.&#xD;
      The chief investigator or a research assistant will attend the orthopaedic shoulder clinics&#xD;
      and will approach patients in the waiting area to introduce the study and hand out fliers.&#xD;
      The orthopaedic team will also introduce the study to patients where appropriate and&#xD;
      introduce the patient to the chief investigator or the research assistant if the patient&#xD;
      expresses an interest in receiving more information relating to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where appropriate the chief investigator or the research assistant will ask the patient if&#xD;
      they would be willing to be contacted by the chief investigator the following day to discuss&#xD;
      the study further. If so the patient details will be passed to the chief investigator who&#xD;
      will call the patient at least 24 hours after the introduction of the study. The chief&#xD;
      investigator will call to discuss the study further and if the patient is happy to&#xD;
      participate an appointment will be arranged for the patient to attend the physiotherapy&#xD;
      department of either Worthing or Southlands hospital. At this time informed consent,&#xD;
      eligibility assessment and baseline outcome measurement will be performed. In addition&#xD;
      baseline characteristics will be recorded in an attempt to minimize selection bias. The&#xD;
      estimated time for this visit is 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to subject randomisation, sealed envelopes will be prepared containing the treatment&#xD;
      manual for the two treatment arms. The assessor will assign consenting participants a unique&#xD;
      study number and the anonymised data will be forwarded to the named research officer at the&#xD;
      Brighton and Sussex Clinical Trials Unit (B&amp;S CTU). The officer will enter the data into the&#xD;
      software package 'sealed envelope' that will process the data and assign the subject to the&#xD;
      treatment or placebo group. An E-mail containing group allocation will then be sent to the&#xD;
      assessor. The patient will then be transferred to the reception of the physiotherapy&#xD;
      department where the appropriately numbered envelop will be placed with the physiotherapy&#xD;
      notes and the patient booked for their initial physiotherapy session. The group allocation of&#xD;
      each patient will only be available to the treating physiotherapist when the envelope&#xD;
      containing the manual is opened at the initial physiotherapy consultation. The&#xD;
      physiotherapist will be instructed not to advise the patient to which group they have been&#xD;
      allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will take place prior to random allocation, half way through the intervention&#xD;
      (6-8 weeks) and at the end of the intervention (13-15 weeks). At 26 and 52 weeks a telephone&#xD;
      follow-up interview will repeat collection of Shoulder pain and Disability Index (SPADI) and&#xD;
      the EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and evaluate the surgical outcome. The chief&#xD;
      investigator will perform data collection, an assistant will accompany to assist with&#xD;
      measurement of posterior shoulder tightness. The assessor will be blind to the group&#xD;
      allocation of participants. Where possible the participants will complete questionnaires&#xD;
      unassisted, where assistance is required additional explanation will be provided by the&#xD;
      research assistant. Physical data will be collected in the form of a clinical examination at&#xD;
      baseline, 6-8 weeks and at 13-15 weeks. The examination will involve measurement of posterior&#xD;
      shoulder tightness through the use of three clinical tests. These tests will be performed&#xD;
      with measurement brace and digital inclinometer. A reliability study of these three clinical&#xD;
      tests has been performed by the chief investigator at the University of Brighton following&#xD;
      approval by the Faculty of Health Sciences Research Ethics and Governance Committee. The&#xD;
      three clinical tests to identify patients with posterior shoulder tightness are; horizontal&#xD;
      adduction, internal rotation in 90 degrees abduction and low flexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment intervention will be delivered in the physiotherapy outpatient departments of&#xD;
      Worthing Hospital or Southlands Hospital. Treatment will be delivered by NHS physiotherapists&#xD;
      over 13-15 weeks and consist of 6-8 sessions of physiotherapy. The first 4 sessions will be&#xD;
      delivered weekly and the subsequent 4 sessions will be delivered every 2 weeks. This&#xD;
      treatment dose and duration is consistent with previous high quality studies (Holmgren et al.&#xD;
      2014, Bernhardsson et al. 2011). The intervention will be delivered while patients are on the&#xD;
      surgical waiting list for subacromial decompression surgery. The current waiting times for&#xD;
      surgery vary considerably between consultants, from 18-28 weeks. This means the intervention&#xD;
      can be fully completed during the waiting time for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatment will be provided by NHS physiotherapist as part of their daily caseload. They&#xD;
      will be allocated 45 minutes for initial assessment and 30 minutes for subsequent treatment&#xD;
      sessions, in line with current departmental procedure. All therapists will be recruited for&#xD;
      the trial on a voluntary basis. Appropriate training will be provided to all&#xD;
      physiotherapists. It is estimated that 2 physiotherapists from each of the three&#xD;
      physiotherapy sites will be required to deliver the physiotherapy interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, physiotherapy treatment will consist of education regarding the nature of&#xD;
      the patients condition, and the prescription of an exercise program to be performed once a&#xD;
      day at home. Each group will perform three strengthening exercises to address the muscular&#xD;
      systems of the scapular and rotator cuff musculature and a stretching exercise for the&#xD;
      anterior shoulder. The exercises have been selected based on review of the available&#xD;
      literature relating to muscular dysfunction in shoulder impingement, electromyography (EMG)&#xD;
      studies of shoulder exercises and RCTs where the interventions have been adequately&#xD;
      described. The exercises with be taught by the physiotherapist and reviewed at each session&#xD;
      where the exercises will be progressed or regressed depending on the patients response since&#xD;
      the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition subjects allocated to the 'posterior shoulder tightness' treatment group will&#xD;
      also receive specific manual therapy during each physiotherapy session. The treatment has&#xD;
      been designed to mobilise the structures of the posterior shoulder. They will be prescribed&#xD;
      home stretches to address stiffness of the posterior shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'sham posterior shoulder tightness' group will receive home stretches and manual therapy&#xD;
      of similar durations to the 'posterior shoulder tightness' group, but delivered to structures&#xD;
      that have no known direct structural influence on the posterior shoulder. The intention is&#xD;
      for subjects to receive a similar dose of manual therapy to control for the generic effects&#xD;
      of manual therapy, which may have pain relieving mechanisms. The sham intervention will be&#xD;
      controlled for time and attention in order to create a comparable attention-control group.&#xD;
      Using this design it may be possible to determine if there is any additional benefit to&#xD;
      treating posterior shoulder tightness in combination with high quality rehabilitation for&#xD;
      patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be asked to perform 4 strengthening exercises each day and 2 stretches each&#xD;
      day as well as attending 6-8 physiotherapy treatments over a 13-15 week period. The exercises&#xD;
      will take approximately 10-15 minutes to perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed as a feasibility study as there are believed to be too many&#xD;
      unknown factors to proceed directly to definitive randomised controlled study design. These&#xD;
      are outlined in full in section 11A. It is predicted recruitment will begin in May 2016 and&#xD;
      continue until November 2018. Final follow-up assessment will occur one year after initial&#xD;
      outcome assessment. So it is predicted that final patient contact will occur in&#xD;
      October/November 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design was discussed in depth with a user group at its conception in June 2013 and&#xD;
      two patient representatives have continued to assist throughout the study design. Patients&#xD;
      have reviewed the recruitment strategy, patient information literature and consent forms.&#xD;
      They have agreed to participate in an informed consent rehearsal and appraisal prior to the&#xD;
      start of recruitment to ensure informed consent is thorough and easy for the patient to&#xD;
      comprehend and allows sufficient time for questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study steering committee will meet every 6 months to ensure the study is running&#xD;
      smoothly. The steering committee will include; Kevin Hall (lead researcher), Chris Mercer&#xD;
      (Physiotherapy Consultant, physiotherapy clinical lead), Professor Ann Moore (academic&#xD;
      supervisor, or a member of the academic supervisory team), Mr Nurang (Orthopaedic Shoulder&#xD;
      Consultant), Richard Brunton (service user), Pamela Clarke (service user), Clare Meachin&#xD;
      (Research and Innovation Department) and Physiotherapist (to be confirmed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress reports will be submitted to the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) at 6&#xD;
      months and then annually for the 5 year duration of the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Listed for subacromial decompression surgery by a consultant orthopaedic surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of posterior shoulder tightness, based on a positive result in 2 of 3&#xD;
             clinical tests (see below for explanation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Comprehensive in spoken and written English&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Site of mechanical pain consistent with shoulder impingement syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least 3 months duration of shoulder pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A minimum SPADI score of 20&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinical examination revealing a positive tests for pain with either Neer's test or&#xD;
             Hawkins-Kennedy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        Using the SEM values obtained from the recent reliability study conducted at the University&#xD;
        of Brighton (see appendix 1), side-to-side differences of more than 2×SEM are associated&#xD;
        with a 95% probability that the difference is not caused by the inaccuracy of the clinical&#xD;
        test. Using the SEM values obtained from this study, it is possible to be 95% confident&#xD;
        that the difference identified is not due to an error of measurement when the side-to-side&#xD;
        difference is greater than;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  7.4 degrees for horizontal adduction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  9.6 degrees for internal rotation in abduction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  7 degrees for low flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
        Based on these results a side-to-side difference of 10 degrees or more on two out of three&#xD;
        clinical tests will be considered positive for the presence of posterior shoulder&#xD;
        tightness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clustering tests enables the clinician to overcome the inherent weaknesses of individual&#xD;
        tests. Making a decision relating to the presence of posterior shoulder tightness on the&#xD;
        outcome of a cluster of tests may better reflect the complex anatomy of the posterior&#xD;
        shoulder and the multiple layers of connective tissue and muscle acting as passive&#xD;
        restraint to movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinically detectable large full thickness rotator cuff tear&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recent trauma (last 3 months) involving the shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
