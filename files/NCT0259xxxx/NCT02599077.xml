      Project Summary Endometriosis is a disease with a high prevalence that primarily affects&#xD;
      women of childbearing age. This condition brings an important physical and emotional burden&#xD;
      on sufferers and this is why it requires proper and timely medical management. At present&#xD;
      there are several first-line drugs available for the management of symptoms and disease&#xD;
      control. In the world literature we have reported several studies that demonstrate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of different groups of drugs such as oral contraceptives, progestins, GnRH&#xD;
      analogues and danazol. Within the available scientific evidence it has been extensively&#xD;
      described the benefits of the new progestins Dienogest, demonstrating a favorable safety&#xD;
      profile and efficacy along with a significant reduction of the symptoms of the disease by its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative antiagiogénicas in the endometrial tissue . However,&#xD;
      although the therapeutic properties of this drug are known, studies are needed to compare its&#xD;
      effectiveness with the effectiveness of other therapeutic agents as oral contraceptives. That&#xD;
      is why the main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of Dienogest to 2 mg / day&#xD;
      compared with a combined oral contraceptive (levonorgestrel + ethinyl estradiol) in the size&#xD;
      of the endometriomas diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasonography in 50 women having diameters&#xD;
      less than 4 centimeters of the same, which medical management will be given for one year at&#xD;
      the University Hospital Fundación Santa Fe de Bogota. The study was conducted by a clinical&#xD;
      trial, randomized, single-blind by the observer. The results will be analyzed and the&#xD;
      findings in the study will serve as a tool to define new therapeutic conduct in the&#xD;
      management of endometriosis.&#xD;

      Problem and Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity,&#xD;
      which induces a chronic inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a common problem that affects about 6-10% of women of reproductive age, 50-60% of women&#xD;
      and adolescents with pelvic pain and nearly 50% of women with infertility. it is&#xD;
      characterized by abdominal pain, back pain, pain during sex, dysfunctional uterine bleeding&#xD;
      and infertility. Being a common condition among women of childbearing age, which often goes&#xD;
      undiagnosed for many years. This delay in diagnosis is due to the variability of symptoms and&#xD;
      the lack of tools for accurate diagnosis available for primary care, which is a major burden&#xD;
      on the quality of life of patients symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of endometriosis should start with clinical history and physical examination&#xD;
      and transvaginal ultrasound has proven useful in the diagnosis of ovarian endometriomas and&#xD;
      its differential diagnosis with other ovarian masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically the lesions identified in endometriosis resemble endometrial tissue in places&#xD;
      outside the endometrium, which proliferates in response to hormonal changes that occur with&#xD;
      menstruation, causing increased pain and bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological agents are preferred as first-line treatment for managing the symptoms. Among&#xD;
      these, oral contraceptives are used to treat symptoms of menorrhagia and dysmenorrhoea&#xD;
      associated with endometriosis, affecting the endometrial lining by decreasing the&#xD;
      proliferation of endometrial tissue during the menstrual cycle, to shorten the number of days&#xD;
      in which endometrial tissue appears, reducing the amount and consistency of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another drug that is used to manage this condition is the Dienogest, which has proven&#xD;
      superior to treatment with placebo and the effect is comparable to that of other drugs used&#xD;
      in the management of endometriosis, as progestins or GnRH analogues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All drug treatments for endometriosis are effective in reducing the size and number of&#xD;
      lesions, and are not intended to cure the disease or eliminate the injury of the peritoneal&#xD;
      cavity. Another management option is surgery, which should be reserved for specific cases or&#xD;
      those patients who do not respond to drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometriosis is a disease that imposes a severe financial burden on society, and a physical&#xD;
      and emotional toll on people who have it. Therefore it is important to understand, and&#xD;
      education by medical staff against this disease. According to the statistics service&#xD;
      approximately 200 women a year are treated in reproductive age of which on average 50 are&#xD;
      endometriomas and since there is no clear scientific evidence on the impact of combined oral&#xD;
      contraceptives compared with using Dienogest, the objective of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      impact of Dienogest to 2 mg / day compared with combined oral contraceptives (levonorgestrel&#xD;
      + ethinyl estradiol) in reducing the size of the endometriomas diagnosed by transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound in women with diameters smaller than 4 centimeters thereof, in the Hospital&#xD;
      Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de Bogota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General: Determine the impact of Dienogest to 2 mg / day compared with combined oral&#xD;
      contraceptives (levonorgestrel + ethinyl estradiol 0.10 mg - 0.02 mg / day) in the treatment&#xD;
      of endometriomas diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound in women with smaller diameters 4&#xD;
      centimeters thereof, at University Hospital Fundación Santa Fe de Bogota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine Decreasing the size of endometriomas Dienogest using as medical treatment for&#xD;
           endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine Decreased endometriomas size using a combined oral contraceptive as medical&#xD;
           treatment for endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine Through ultrasound scanning diagnostic tool as the impact of the reduction in&#xD;
           size of endometriomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare The effect of the Dienogest vs the combined oral contraceptive in time.&#xD;
           Methodology Type of study Experimental study single-blind randomized clinical trial by&#xD;
           the observer. Universe Endometriomas of patients with diameters smaller than 4&#xD;
           centimeters diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound in patients presenting to the Santa Fe&#xD;
           de Bogota Foundation between 2015 and 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze cases of endometriomas in which medical management vs Dienogest be used with oral&#xD;
      contraceptives, the sample size is calculated using the estimated sample size with a&#xD;
      comparison of proportions between 2 samples with the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N: 200 Proportion: 1.6%, and the estimated prevalence of endometriosis is 8% and 20% of those&#xD;
      with endometriomas.&#xD;
