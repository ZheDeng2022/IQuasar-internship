      The aim of GLUTAMICS II is to evaluate whether intravenous glutamate infusion surgery reduces&#xD;
      the risk of postoperative heart failure as measured by plasma NT-proBNP in patients&#xD;
      undergoing moderate to high-risk coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Patients accepted for&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass surgery of at least two vessel disease or left main stenosis with or&#xD;
      without concomitant procedure and considered to be at moderate to high surgical risk&#xD;
      preoperatively with regard to postoperative heart failure will be studied. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is postoperative increase of NT-proBNP from the day before surgery to the third&#xD;
      postoperative day.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of the progress in cardiac surgery and perioperative management postoperative heart&#xD;
      failure remains the leading cause of death and organ failure. Although acknowledged as a&#xD;
      major problem in cardiac surgery there are no generally accepted criteria for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of postoperative heart failure. This in turn could explain why treatment for postoperative&#xD;
      heart failure is poorly documented with regard to clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemia prior to cardiopulmonary bypass is the main cause of myocardial infarction after&#xD;
      CABG. Available data demonstrate that ischemia and evolving myocardial infarction account for&#xD;
      a large proportion of patients with postoperative heart failure after CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional treatment of postoperative heart failure presents a therapeutic dilemma as&#xD;
      inotropic drugs not only aggravate ischemia and increase the size of evolving myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, but also stimulate apoptotic processes that may have adverse long-term&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of inotropes in cardiac surgery is therefore controversial. Some authors claim that&#xD;
      liberal use of inotropes and goal-directed haemodynamic therapy can improve outcome whereas&#xD;
      other report that liberal use of inotropes is associated with increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative measures that can enhance myocardial recovery and function without putting&#xD;
      further strain on the heart are therefore desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutamate could influence outcome after myocardial ischemia by two different biochemical&#xD;
      mechanisms. First, glutamate improves myocardial tolerance to ischemia by facilitated&#xD;
      anaerobic metabolism and substrate level phosphorylation during ischemia. The second&#xD;
      mechanism is related to the anaplerotic role of glutamate. Glutamate plays a key role for&#xD;
      replenishment of Krebs cycle intermediates lost during ischemia, which enhances post-ischemic&#xD;
      recovery of myocardial oxidative metabolism and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promoting metabolic and functional recovery with metabolic support represents a novel concept&#xD;
      in the treatment of heart failure after acute ischemia. Animal experiments suggest that&#xD;
      glutamate increases myocardial tolerance to ischemia and that glutamate promotes&#xD;
      post-ischemic recovery. Intravenous glutamate improved metabolic and hemodynamic recovery in&#xD;
      humans early after CABG. Early clinical experience with intravenous metabolic support showed&#xD;
      that the need for inotropes could be substantially reduced while clinical outcomes with&#xD;
      regard to postoperative mortality, postoperative renal dysfunction and long-term survival&#xD;
      compared favourably with the literature. This encouraging experience contributed to the&#xD;
      initiation of the first GLUTAMICS-trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first GLUTAMICS-trial investigated if intravenous glutamate infusion given in association&#xD;
      with surgery for acute coronary syndrome could prevent myocardial injury, postoperative heart&#xD;
      failure and reduce mortality. The study was negative with regard to the primary endpoint,&#xD;
      which was a composite of postoperative mortality, perioperative myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      left ventricular failure at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the study included a high proportion of low risk patients. Furthermore, the design&#xD;
      of the primary endpoint suffered from liberal preemptive use of inotropes in patients&#xD;
      anticipated to have weaning problems. It became evident at clinical endpoint committee&#xD;
      meetings that preemptive use of inotropes prevented detection of weaning problems in patients&#xD;
      who later developed severe heart failure. The secondary endpoint severe circulatory failure&#xD;
      discriminated mild short-lasting heart failure at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass from&#xD;
      clinically significant heart failure requiring substantial circulatory support and leading to&#xD;
      prolonged ICU stay or death. In the glutamate treated patients the relative risk of&#xD;
      developing severe circulatory failure was reduced by more than 50% in most risk groups&#xD;
      undergoing isolated CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first GLUTAMICS trial also included a substudy consisting of a blinded evaluation of&#xD;
      NT-proBNP as a marker for postoperative heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lack of generally accepted criteria for postoperative heart failure, the&#xD;
      evaluation of treatment is difficult. Consequently, comparative studies on different&#xD;
      treatment strategies of heart failure after cardiac surgery are sparse given the magnitude of&#xD;
      the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natriuretic peptides have been extensively studied in cardiology. In patients with chronic&#xD;
      heart failure markedly increased BNP and NT-pro BNP levels are associated with poor&#xD;
      prognosis. The response of natriuretic peptides to heart failure treatment has significant&#xD;
      prognostic implications, and non-responders have a poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cardiac surgery NT-proBNP increase was more pronounced in patients requiring inotropes.&#xD;
      High postoperative levels of BNP and NT-proBNP were associated with worse outcome, both in&#xD;
      the short- and long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first GLUTAMICS-trial permitted a blinded prospective evaluation of NT-proBNP by a&#xD;
      clinical end-points committee relying on strict prespecified criteria with regard to&#xD;
      postoperative heart failure. Data to be published demonstrate that postoperative NT-proBNP&#xD;
      (day 1 and day 3) levels were strong predictors for severe heart failure associated with&#xD;
      extended ICU stay or death. This implies that postoperative NT-proBNP could serve as a&#xD;
      measure to assess efficacy of treatment and preventive strategies for postoperative heart&#xD;
      failure. Albeit, a surrogate marker for postoperative heart failure it provides the advantage&#xD;
      of a standardized and objective analysis, which makes the study reproducible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to confirm findings in subgroups from the first GLUTAMICS-trial that intravenous&#xD;
      glutamate infusion reduces the risk of postoperative heart failure in moderate to high risk&#xD;
      patients undergoing coronary artery surgery by showing a reduced increase of NT-proBNP&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients accepted for coronary artery bypass surgery of at least two vessel disease or left&#xD;
      main stenosis with or without concomitant procedure considered to be at moderate to high&#xD;
      surgical risk preoperatively with regard to postoperative heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      310 patients are planned to be included after informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: patients with ambiguous food allergies that trigger shortness of breath,&#xD;
      headache or flushing; patients&gt; 85 years, previous cardiac surgery, patients who are in such&#xD;
      bad condition that they cannot be asked to participate, patients who for linguistic or other&#xD;
      reasons are unable to provide informed consent, severe renal failure with preoperative&#xD;
      dialysis or calculated GFR &lt;30 mL / min, patients requiring inotropic drugs or mechanical&#xD;
      circulatory support (intra-aortic balloon pump) due to circulatory failure even before they&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, patients who undergo surgery without the heart-lung machine&#xD;
      (off-pump), patients who undergo concomitant Maze-procedure or surgery of ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GLUTAMICS II is an investigator initiated prospective, randomized, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind trial with parallel assignment to glutamate or placebo (saline). The trial is&#xD;
      externally randomized and randomization is stratified for patients undergoing isolated CABG&#xD;
      and for those having CABG with concomitant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomly allocated to blinded intravenous infusion of 0.125M L-glutamic acid&#xD;
      solution or saline at a rate of 1.65 ml/kg and hour commencing at or up to 20 minutes before&#xD;
      the release of aortic cross-clamp. The infusion is continued for two hours after declamping&#xD;
      the aorta after which an additional 50 ml is given at a halved infusion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is a postoperative increase of NT-proBNP from the day before surgery to&#xD;
      the third postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are the absolute postoperative plasma levels of NT-proBNP day 1 and day&#xD;
      3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY VARIABLES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative mortality (30 days + hospitals), stroke within 24 hours and SUSARs&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is based on available results from the first GLUTAMICS study. In that study, the&#xD;
      following increase of NT-proBNP from the preoperative value to third postoperative day (mean&#xD;
      ± SD) were observed in patients with LVEF ≤ 0.30 or EuroSCORE II ≥ 3.0 undergoing coronary&#xD;
      artery surgery for with or without concomitant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutamate (n=71): 5261 ± 4409&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo (n=62): 7112 ± 6454&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment by external statistical expertise (80% power, 5% risk level; two-sided&#xD;
      test) suggests 141 patients in each group. To account for failed sampling and other loss we&#xD;
      plan a total of 310 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERIM ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis will be performed by an external independent statistician after 160 patients&#xD;
      by an adaptive design as reported in detail to the Swedish Medical Product Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update August 30, 2020: Interim analysis in December 2017 supported the original sample size&#xD;
      assessment and the aim was set to reach 300 patients with complete data for the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. The original goal of 280 patients with complete data has been reached and the study&#xD;
      is approaching 300 but as study solutions will expire September 30, 2020 this will be the&#xD;
      last date for inclusion of patients into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A concern with the use of glutamate is that it may act as an excitotoxin under certain&#xD;
      conditions and participate in events leading to neurological damage. However, brain tissue&#xD;
      concentrations of glutamate are more than fifty-fold higher than in blood whereas the dosage&#xD;
      used only elevates blood levels three-fold. Neurological outcome has been carefully monitored&#xD;
      when intravenous infusions have been used in clinical practice without evidence of adverse&#xD;
      effects. No evidence of subclinical neurological injury associated with intravenous glutamate&#xD;
      infusion could be detected by the S-100B measurements and no differences in neurological&#xD;
      outcome or other adverse events were found in the GLUTAMICS trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written informed consent eligible patients will be enrolled in the study. The study&#xD;
      will be performed according to the Helsinki Declaration of Human Rights and is approved by&#xD;
      the Regional Ethical Review Board in Linköping (Dnr 2011/498-31; Dnr 2015/333-32).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swedish Medical Products Agency requests surveillance and unblinding in cases of&#xD;
      CT-verified stroke within 24 hours of surgery, mortality and suspected unexpected serious&#xD;
      adverse reactions (SUSAR). External monitoring of all key data, written informed consent and&#xD;
      unblinding procedures will be done.&#xD;
