  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare dynamic inspiratory flow rates achieved by a&#xD;
      population of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients through the Breezhaler®,&#xD;
      Ellipta® and Handihaler® dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices. No active drug or placebo were&#xD;
      administered to patients in this study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inspiratory flow rates achieved by the COPD patients, via the breath actuated devices,&#xD;
      are one of the important factors that can influence the efficiency of the drug delivery by&#xD;
      the inhalation route. The peak inspiratory flow (PIF) rates achieved by COPD patients through&#xD;
      different breath actuated dry power inhalers may differ because of the differences in&#xD;
      internal resistance of the different type of devices. The results of inspiratory airflow rate&#xD;
      and pressure drop over time, from this study, provided an assessment of the range and&#xD;
      variability of inhalation profile characteristics generated by COPD patients within the&#xD;
      population selected for this study (e.g. demographics, gender, disease control) through the&#xD;
      Breezhaler and the other marketed comparator DPIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inhalation profiles were obtained through an Inhalation Profile Recorder (IPR). The&#xD;
      inhalation profile recorder was a data acquisition device which consists of a computer, an&#xD;
      interface unit and a pressure transducer. This allowed it to measure the real time dynamic&#xD;
      pressure drop at the mouthpiece of the inhaler during an inhalation maneuver. On the graphic&#xD;
      user interface, plots of inspiratory pressure drop versus time and flow rate versus time are&#xD;
      displayed in real time. The investigator or designated study personnel at site was&#xD;
      responsible for typing in the Test Location, selecting the Inhaler Type (Breezhaler, Ellipta,&#xD;
      Handihaler), typing in the Patient ID and Patient Age, selecting Male or Female, and&#xD;
      recording Patient Comments made during the test session, as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient were required to generate three (03) inhalational profiles through each of the&#xD;
      three (03) study devices: Breezhaler®, Ellipta® and Handihaler®.&#xD;
