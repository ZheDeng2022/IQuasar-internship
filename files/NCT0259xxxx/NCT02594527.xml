  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity levels of hospitalised older inpatients is low and this results in many&#xD;
      adverse health outcomes. Studies have shown that interventions designed to promote increased&#xD;
      physical activity of older inpatients using paid staff have shown improvement in physical&#xD;
      function of older inpatients, resulting in shorter hospital stay and reduced admissions to&#xD;
      nursing home. This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using trained&#xD;
      volunteers to increase physical activity of older people in hospital. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      recruited and trained to encourage older inpatients to mobilise or perform chair-based&#xD;
      exercises. Patients will be encouraged to walk or exercise with the volunteers twice a day&#xD;
      during their hospital stay. Quantitative analysis will be conducted on the outcome measures.&#xD;
      Patients, volunteers and staff members will also be interviewed to assess the acceptability&#xD;
      of the intervention. This feasibility study will help inform a future controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Previous research has shown that low mobility among older people in hospital is&#xD;
      associated with poor health outcomes including worsening physical function and increasing&#xD;
      dependence in activities of daily living. There is evidence that the implementation by&#xD;
      hospital staff of a mobility or exercise programme for older people in the acute care setting&#xD;
      is feasible with promising outcomes including improvement in physical function, shorter&#xD;
      hospital stay and reduced nursing home admissions. However employing additional therapy or&#xD;
      nursing staff is costly and there are well-recognised shortages of suitable applicants to&#xD;
      recruit to these posts. Many National Health Service trusts have an established volunteer&#xD;
      workforce and in Southampton trained volunteers have successfully assisted older inpatients&#xD;
      at mealtimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using trained&#xD;
      volunteers to increase physical activity levels of older people in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design: The first part of this feasibility study is the development with the&#xD;
      therapy team of a training programme, based on existing literature and best practice, to&#xD;
      ensure competency of volunteers in mobilising patients and encouraging physical exercise. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted on 2 wards (1 male 1 female) within the Medicine for Older People&#xD;
      department. Eligible patients will be encouraged by volunteers to mobilise or perform&#xD;
      chair-based exercises, depending on their mobility status, at least twice a day for about 15&#xD;
      minutes each session. The recruitment and retention rates of volunteers will be analysed as&#xD;
      will the physical activity interventions they were able to effect. The recruitment of&#xD;
      patients, their physical activity and adherence to the intervention will be studied.&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews and focus groups will be conducted to explore the views and&#xD;
      experiences of the patients, volunteers and health care professionals involved in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will be characterised including the measurement of physical activity levels&#xD;
      using a StepWatch Activity Monitor and GENEActiv accelerometer. This feasibility study is not&#xD;
      powered to show a statistical difference in the outcome measures but data from this study&#xD;
      will determine the sample size for future controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Results from this study will provide valuable information regarding the use of&#xD;
      trained volunteers to promote physical activity among older inpatients and the practicalities&#xD;
      of implementing the intervention throughout the whole department.&#xD;
