  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to establish the safety and tolerability of intravitreous&#xD;
      administration of altering regimens of Fovista™ (Anti-PDGF-B pegylated aptamer) administered&#xD;
      in combination with Anti-VEGF therapy (Lucentis®, Avastin® or Eylea®) in subjects with&#xD;
      subfoveal neovascular age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated with Fovista™ and Anti-VEGF therapy every month for the first three&#xD;
      months. Retreatment with Fovista™ and Anti-VEGF will occur if the following findings are&#xD;
      present PER INVESTIGATOR DISCRETION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ≥ 5 ETDRS letters loss OR;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant hemorrhage OR;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New or increased RPE elevation consistent with increased disease activity OR;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased neovascular lesion size OR;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New or increased foveal intraretinal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
      If anti-VEGF re-treatment is not administered based on the re-treatment criteria noted above,&#xD;
      Fovista™ anti-PDGF therapy MUST be administered at a minimum of every 3 months (as&#xD;
      monotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, subjects will be treated with Fovista™ or Anti-VEGF therapy for a total of 3-24&#xD;
      administrations.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects will be treated with Fovista™ 1.5 mg/eye in combination with anti-VEGF therapy.&#xD;
The following doses of Anti-VEGF therapy will be delivered based on the Investigator's discretion:&#xD;
Lucentis® 0.5 mg/eye&#xD;
Avastin® 1.25 mg/eye&#xD;
Eylea® 2 mg/eye&#xD;
Subjects will be treated with Fovista™ and Anti-VEGF therapy every month for the first three months.&#xD;
The regimen for administration of each intravitreal agent will be as follows:&#xD;
Injection Day #1-Administration of Fovista™ 1.5mg/eye&#xD;
Injection Day #2-Administration of Fovista™ 1.5mg/eye followed by anti-VEGF therapy after Fovista™ injection&#xD;
The same regimen will be delivered monthly until the subject reaches maximum visual acuity benefit. Maximum visual acuity is defined as no increase in ETDRS visual acuity at two consecutive visits.&#xD;
Subsequent re-treatment with the Anti-VEGF therapy will use a PRN (&quot;as-needed&quot;) regimen based on protocol specified retreatment criteria.</description>

             Subjects with any subfoveal scar or subfoveal atrophy directly below the center of the&#xD;
             fovea are excluded.&#xD;

             use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of the results of&#xD;
             the study or render the subject at high risk for treatment complications.&#xD;
