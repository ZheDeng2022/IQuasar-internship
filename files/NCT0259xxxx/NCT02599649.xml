  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if lirilumab and Opdivo (nivolumab),&#xD;
      alone or in combination with Vidaza (azacitidine), can help to control MDS. The safety of&#xD;
      these drug combinations will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Lirilumab is not FDA approved or commercially available. It&#xD;
      is currently being used for research purposes. Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available for the treatment of melanoma and non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Azacitidine&#xD;
      is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of MDS. The study doctor can&#xD;
      explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      study groups based on the status of the disease and then you will be assigned to a cohort&#xD;
      based on when you join this study. Each study group will be made up of 2 cohorts. Group 1 is&#xD;
      made up of Cohorts A and B. Group 2 is made up of Cohorts C and D. Each cohort will enroll up&#xD;
      to 20 participants each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have low risk (low or intermediate-1) MDS, you will be enrolled in Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Cohort A, you will receive lirilumab by vein over about 1 hour 1&#xD;
           time each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Cohort B, you will receive nivolumab by vein over about 1 hour&#xD;
           every 2 weeks during Cycles 1-9 and then 1 time each cycle after that. You will also&#xD;
           receive lirilumab by vein over about 1 hour 1 time each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have high risk MDS, you will be enrolled in Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Cohort C, you will receive azacitidine by vein for up to 40&#xD;
           minutes on Days 1-7 of each cycle. You will also receive lirilumab by vein over about 1&#xD;
           hour on Day 7 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Cohort D, you will receive azacitidine by vein for up to 40&#xD;
           minutes on Days 1-7 of each cycle. You will receive lirilumab by vein over about 1 hour&#xD;
           on Day 7 of each cycle. On Days 7 and 21 of Cycles 1-9 and then on Day 7 of Cycles 10&#xD;
           and beyond, you will also receive nivolumab by vein over about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Cohorts B or D, you will need to stay in the clinic for up to 1 hour&#xD;
      after your dose of nivolumab so the study staff may check your vitals and monitor your health&#xD;
      for any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both you and the study doctor will know to which group you have been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time each week during Cycle 1 and then 1 time during each cycle after that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. These tests may be done&#xD;
           more often if your doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, on Day 28 of Cycle 1 and then every 3 months after that,&#xD;
      you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease and for cytogenetic&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks, if you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be&#xD;
      collected for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue receiving the study drug(s) as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your&#xD;
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug(s) if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You participation on this study, if you cannot become pregnant, will end after your last dose&#xD;
      of study drug(s). If you can become pregnant, your participation on this study will be over&#xD;
      after the follow-up pregnancy tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Pregnancy Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you can become pregnant, at 30 days and 70 days after you have stopped taking the study&#xD;
      drug(s), blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Continued from #12: e) Use of non-oncology vaccines containing live virus for&#xD;
