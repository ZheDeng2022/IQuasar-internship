    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further advancements in biospecimens (blood cellular free&#xD;
      component, e.g., plasma, serum, tissue, urine), in order to develop precision medicine, for&#xD;
      lung cancer management and lung cancer screening (synergy with imaging). A co-clinical trial&#xD;
      approach, with integrative analyses leveraging data from the treatment of genetic mouse&#xD;
      models of lung cancer along with clinical samples and data from lung cancer patients, will be&#xD;
      used to elucidate genomic background metrics, identify cell free DNA mutations, and further&#xD;
      refine the liquid biopsy approach. Blood and urine samples will be analyzed for different&#xD;
      genetic components. The tissue biopsy will be implanted into a mouse and after the cancer&#xD;
      grows in the mouse the cancer DNA from the mouse will be compared with the human blood.&#xD;

      This is a feasibility study to collect tumor and peripheral blood and urine of patients with&#xD;
      lung cancer, or head and neck cancer, or other solid tumor who receive treatment. Blood and&#xD;
      urine will also be collected from subjects without cancer to assess non cancer profiles. To&#xD;
      conduct this study, a total of 30 study-eligible subjects of all races and ethnicities, aged&#xD;
      18 years or older with a diagnosis of cancer of the lung or head and neck cancer or other&#xD;
      solid tumor malignancy (Cohort A), will be enrolled and have their tumor collected once for&#xD;
      molecular profiling and xenograft development and blood collected at prespecified time&#xD;
      intervals until completion of treatment for liquid biopsy analysis (targeted sequencing,&#xD;
      whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing). A total of 140 study-eligible subjects of&#xD;
      all races and ethnicities ages 18 years or older will be enrolled in the non-lung cancer&#xD;
      control subgroups for chronic inflammatory disorder (Cohort B), people at risk to develop&#xD;
      lung cancer (Cohort C) and healthy people who complete vigorous exercise (Cohort D). A total&#xD;
      of 180 subjects will be enrolled into the resection and radiation therapy cancer cohorts&#xD;
      (Cohorts E and F).&#xD;
