      General objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the performance and safety profile of a novel innovative design of female condom&#xD;
      (Wondaleaf®) among healthy married women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the failure rate of Wondaleaf®, in terms of clinical breakage, non-clinical&#xD;
           breakage, invagination, misdirection, and slippage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the acceptability and satisfaction of use of Wondaleaf® by subjects and&#xD;
           their spouses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety profile of Wondaleaf®.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre clinical trial to assess the performance and safety profile of&#xD;
      Wondaleaf® in healthy married women. Referrals from doctors and nurses in the Maternal and&#xD;
      Child Health Clinics, Family Planning Clinics and private clinics in Sibu will be received. A&#xD;
      total of 63 couples will be recruited to use Wondaleaf® and to study self-reported total&#xD;
      clinical failure and total female condom failure and their components failure events of&#xD;
      clinical breakage, non-clinical breakage, total breakage, slippage, misdirection, and&#xD;
      invagination (as per World Health Organisation (WHO) Female Condom Technical Review Committee&#xD;
      definition(1)). Secondary outcomes were safety parameters (retention of investigational&#xD;
      device intra-vaginally should it break, complaint of sexually transmitted diseases, vaginal&#xD;
      infection and/or urinary tract infections, all adverse events, serious adverse events,&#xD;
      adverse device events and serious adverse device events, allergic reaction) as well as&#xD;
      acceptability and satisfaction of the use of Wondaleaf®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A focus group discussion will be held for the first two couples, to a maximum of five couples&#xD;
      recruited based on the same inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to trial the&#xD;
      process of training / counselling of using the condom, as well as completing the coital log.&#xD;
      Experience gathered from these focus group testing and discussion, will be used to enhance&#xD;
      the strength of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, each couple will be asked to use five Wondaleaf® and to complete a coital log&#xD;
      at home after each condom use. Before putting on the investigational device, the subject must&#xD;
      check for device or package breakage. During sexual intercourse, the couple ought to notice&#xD;
      if any breakage of the condom has occurred, and if the female condom slips completely out of&#xD;
      the vagina or the penis of male spouse is inserted between the condom and the vaginal wall as&#xD;
      well as event of invagination (when the external retention feature of the female condom is&#xD;
      partly or fully pushed into the vagina).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject must maintain the wearing of investigational device for the entire process of&#xD;
      intercourse until the male spouse ejaculate intra-vaginally. Following each ejaculation of&#xD;
      the male spouse, the investigational devices must be checked for breakage before, during and&#xD;
      after withdrawal of the condom from the vagina. A coital log must be completed by the couples&#xD;
      within 12 hours after the use of each investigational device. Coital logs are used to obtain&#xD;
      data for condom performance and safety. The five female investigational devices should be&#xD;
      used within a period of four weeks. The used investigational devices shall be discarded&#xD;
      safely in the usual and safe manner at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the women completed five uses of Wondaleaf® or after four weeks (whichever occurs&#xD;
      first), they will return to the clinic to return their coital log and to fill out an&#xD;
      acceptability and satisfaction questionnaire. Any unused female investigational devices (i.e.&#xD;
      the female condom) will be returned for counting purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the women were confirmed pregnant during study period, the subjects will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study. The married couple will be referred for antenatal care of their choice.&#xD;
