  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether a structured physical activity program (PA)&#xD;
      during palliative chemotherapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) and/or&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes (ESAS-r) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While safety and feasibility as well as some improvements in fitness, fatigue and certain&#xD;
      aspects of quality of life have been shown for physical activity in cancer patients during&#xD;
      treatment, none of the pre-requisites above (i-iv) is fulfilled in the setting of patients&#xD;
      with advanced colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, evidence, primarily from the adjuvant setting, that physical activity impacts on&#xD;
      treatment tolerability and tumor progression is a strong enough rationale to now embark on&#xD;
      this prospective trial. By assessing in a large randomized controlled trial whether a 12-week&#xD;
      structured physical activity program during chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      colorectal cancer undergoing standard first-line chemotherapy improves progression-free&#xD;
      survival as compared to standard first-line chemotherapy alone, all pre-requisites for a&#xD;
      practice-changing intervention are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical exercise ACTIVE-program describes a 12-week exercise program consisting of a&#xD;
      combination of a bi-weekly aerobic exercise (cycle ergometer) supervised by a physical&#xD;
      therapist and a self-paced increase in physical activity during daily life using a pedometer&#xD;
      with a daily step goal as a motivational tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the supervised exercise program twice a week, patients of the intervention&#xD;
      group are recommended to be physically active at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo standard systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Patients in the care-as-usual group are not actively encouraged to change their physical&#xD;
      activity level e.g. to start a fitness program during chemotherapy.&#xD;

The chemotherapy-completion-rate is defined as the number of dose modifications due to toxicity during the first 24 weeks after randomization per patient: after each 6 week-period (week 6, 12, 18, and 24) it is assessed whether there have been dose modifications (decrease/delay of systemic treatment i.e. chemo or biological) due to toxicity during the previous 6 weeks (y/n). The proportion of patients without any dose modification due to toxicity during the first 24 weeks will be calculated as well</description>
