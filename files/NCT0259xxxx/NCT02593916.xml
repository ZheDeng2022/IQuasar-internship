      To create a registry/database of patients who either have taken drugs that treat&#xD;
      cardiovascular conditions or that have presented with cardiovascular symptoms that may be&#xD;
      related to medication. Potential enrollees are those receiving (presently or in the past) the&#xD;
      medicine(s) of interest. Subjects will be identified from computerized Intermountain&#xD;
      Healthcare records. Patients receiving a drug of interest, both with and without an ADE will&#xD;
      be enrolled in approximately equal numbers. Outpatients will be contacted by mail and invited&#xD;
      to participate. Interested subjects will be instructed to return the enclosed response card&#xD;
      with their intent indicated. The registry coordinator will contact interested subjects and&#xD;
      the project will be explained. Willing participants will be enrolled either in person or via&#xD;
      mail with the assistance of the project coordinator. Persons presenting in person for&#xD;
      enrollment will be given the choice of venipuncture or buccal swab for sample collection for&#xD;
      DNA extraction. In all cases informed consent will be obtained before collecting samples.&#xD;
