      Lung units that participate in gas exchange are known as 'recruited' lung. Patients with lung&#xD;
      injury suffer from a proportion of units that do not participate in gas exchange (i.e. the&#xD;
      derecruited lung), which results in impaired gas exchange and induces an inflammatory&#xD;
      cascade. The level of PEEP is often coupled to indices of oxygenation such as PaO2, PaO2 to&#xD;
      FIO2 ratio, or oxygen index. Currently, two strategies are widely accepted and considered&#xD;
      equivocal, one strategy using a lower PEEP level coupled to a certain oxygen requirement, the&#xD;
      other using a higher PEEP level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of an electrical&#xD;
      impedance tomography (EIT) PEEP titration protocol designed to recruit collapsed lung in&#xD;
      children with ARDS and properly maintain lung volumes by setting an optimal PEEP level. A&#xD;
      safety system has been developed using the ARDSnet FIO2/PEEP High (upper threshold limit) and&#xD;
      Low (lower threshold limit) algorithm. Efficacy will be defined as an improvement in lung&#xD;
      volume as assessed by electrical impedance tomography, lung compliance and by an improvement&#xD;
      in markers of gas exchange. Safety will be defined as the incidence of barotrauma and&#xD;
      hemodynamic consequences that occur during the protocol. Those results will be compared to&#xD;
      incidences of barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise within the ARDS literature. Knowledge&#xD;
      gained from this pilot will be instrumental in developing an EIT imagine guided protocol&#xD;
      which will allow us to conduct future RCTs utilizing EIT technology&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently, clinical practice regarding positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategies for&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) revolves around two PEEP/FIO2 algorithms developed&#xD;
      NHLBI research ARDSnet program. These two algorithms are known as the &quot;High&quot; PEEP/ lower FIO2&#xD;
      and &quot;Low&quot; PEEP/ higher FIO2 protocols. The High PEEP/ lower FIO2 protocol is seen as&#xD;
      aggressive or the highest PEEP level a clinician would want to set, while the low PEEP/&#xD;
      higher FIO2 is seen as lowest PEEP level a clinician would set. While many studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated safety and efficacy of a PEEP setting based on a required fraction of inspired&#xD;
      oxygen (FIO2) to maintain adequate oxygenation, yet there are equal outcomes between the two&#xD;
      strategies. There is growing evidence that the Low PEEP/ higher FIO2 protocol leaves large&#xD;
      proportions of the lung derecruited and the High PEEP/FIO2 protocol may create overdistension&#xD;
      in the compliant sections of the lung that are largely free from disease as it uses a single&#xD;
      gas exchange (oxygenation) parameter to determine PEEP settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To demonstrate safety of an EIT guided PEEP titration strategy. (Hypothesis:&#xD;
      EIT guided titration of PEEP will improve ventilation and oxygenation without increasing&#xD;
      incidence of barotrauma or hemodynamic compromise.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To demonstrate the efficacy of a PEEP titration strategy to increase&#xD;
      distribution of ventilation and improve oxygenation in children with ARDS utilizing an EIT&#xD;
      guided protocol within two standards of care. (Hypothesis: EIT guided titration of PEEP will&#xD;
      lead to a more homogeneous distribution of ventilation, improved lung compliance and improved&#xD;
      ventilation and oxygenation.) Background and Significance Lung units participating in gas&#xD;
      exchange are known as 'recruited' lung. Patients with lung injury suffer from a proportion of&#xD;
      lung units which not participating in gas exchange (i.e. the derecruited state), at times&#xD;
      resulting in impaired gas exchange. Derecruitment of alveoli may also cause intrapulmonary&#xD;
      shunting and worsen lung injury through atelectotrauma. Outcomes in ARDS have improved&#xD;
      significantly since clinicians have begun to employ lung protective strategies, including&#xD;
      low-tidal volume ventilation and permissive hypercapnea. However, low-tidal volume&#xD;
      ventilation has been recognized to decrease recruited lung volume, a phenomenon that persists&#xD;
      despite the aggressive positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy employed in ARDSNet&#xD;
      studies. Atelectasis associated with low-tidal volume ventilation is relieved through the use&#xD;
      of so-called sigh breaths, higher levels of PEEP or recruitment maneuverers. Further, the&#xD;
      proportion of lung remaining in the derecruited state may contribute to the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality associated with ARDS. In adults, several strategies have been utilized to recruit&#xD;
      the lung: sustained inflation (SI) and the maximal recruitment strategy. The so-called open&#xD;
      lung approach (OLA) includes an SI followed by the setting of PEEP to the measured lower&#xD;
      inflection point of the PV curve. An alternative approach to setting PEEP is a decremental&#xD;
      PEEP titration, which includes the sequential lowering of PEEP until a predetermined&#xD;
      decrement in PaO2 or SaO2 occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of lung recruitment in the long-term course of ARDS is not yet clear. It is clear&#xD;
      that lung recruitment is most effective earlier in the course of ARDS. Grasso et al&#xD;
      demonstrated that patients who received a recruitment maneuver on day 1±0.3 of ARDS could be&#xD;
      recruited, versus patients recruited on day 7±1. Similarly, Gattinoni et al7 and Crotti et al&#xD;
      found limited recruitment in patients who were well along in the course of ARDS. Borges et&#xD;
      al, Tugrul et al, and Girgis et al all recruited patients early in the course of ARDS, and&#xD;
      each found marked lung recruitment, on average, in all the patients studied. Each of these&#xD;
      studied demonstrated an ability to improve oxygen saturations and (sometimes studied)&#xD;
      end-expiratory lung volume. While no study has examined the effect of this change on&#xD;
      morbidity or mortality, in children hypoxemia is known to be a common cause of morbidity.&#xD;
      Importantly in children, treatment of hypoxia often drives escalating ventilator settings,&#xD;
      the use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) or the use of extra-corporeal&#xD;
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Early recruitment and proper titration of PEEP in children with&#xD;
      ARDS may prevent the need for escalation of care towards these more invasive, and&#xD;
      risk-imposing therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) Barber and Brown introduced electrical impedance&#xD;
      tomography to the medical community in the early 1980s. From there a wide spectrum of&#xD;
      applications in medicine ranging from gastric emptying, brain function, breast imaging, to&#xD;
      lung function have been explored. It is our belief that the most valuable benefit of EIT is&#xD;
      in the monitoring of regional lung function in critically ill patients. Early EIT devices&#xD;
      fell susceptible to poor sensitivity and signal interference in the clinical setting. After&#xD;
      years and a renewed interest from a few commercial companies interested in ventilation&#xD;
      technology, many of these shortcomings have been resolved. As with any new modality, EIT and&#xD;
      its clinical utility and application need to be methodically explored; therefore we propose&#xD;
      this IRB protocol to take us a step closer on this journey to develop a clinically useful&#xD;
      tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical impedance tomography capitalizes on changes in electrical impendence between&#xD;
      air-filled versus tissue or fluid-filled spaces in order to characterize and quantify&#xD;
      regional distribution of lung volume at the bedside. This technology has been validated in&#xD;
      animal and human studies. The technology utilizes a series of 16 electrodes placed across the&#xD;
      patient's chest. As small currents, which are undetectable to the subject, are passed between&#xD;
      the electrodes, impedance is measured between and amongst the series. Through a complex&#xD;
      interrogation and manipulation of these impedance values, a two-dimensional image is formed,&#xD;
      and has been shown to correlate with clinical and radiographic changes in patients. The&#xD;
      ability to estimate lung volume and regional distribution of gas non-invasively and in real&#xD;
      time may give us insight as to what mode of ventilation or setting is more effective in&#xD;
      optimizing positive pressure ventilation.&#xD;
