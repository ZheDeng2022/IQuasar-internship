  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I/IIa clinical trial is designed to assess the feasibility of delivery and safety&#xD;
      of Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived RPE Cells on a parylene membrane (CPCB-RPE1) in patients&#xD;
      with advanced, dry age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To test the safety and tolerability of CPCB-RPE1 during and after subretinal implantation&#xD;
      in patients with geographic atrophy with evidence of involvement of the central fovea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess visual acuity, visual field, and retinal function after CPCB-RPE1 implantation.&#xD;
      Implanted and fellow eyes will be compared post-implantation to assess the ability of the&#xD;
      implant to prevent disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the feasibility of measuring the change in area of geographic atrophy over time&#xD;
      using spectral domain optical coherence tomography or fundus autofluorescence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include two cohorts, each of 10 patients. For the first cohort, the study&#xD;
      population will be patients with advanced, dry AMD with evidence of significant geographic&#xD;
      atrophy involving the fovea. These patients will have significant central vision loss with&#xD;
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the eye to be implanted of BCVA of 20/200 or worse.&#xD;
      Each of these patients will have substantial RPE and photoreceptor loss. Patients will be&#xD;
      screened for overall health status to minimize risks associated with retinal surgery and any&#xD;
      subsequent immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the safety and tolerability of CPCB-RPE1 is demonstrated in the first cohort, patients&#xD;
      with less advanced disease will be recruited into a second cohort in this Phase I/IIa&#xD;
      clinical trial. In this second cohort patients will have significant central vision loss with&#xD;
      BCVA of the eye to be implanted of 20/80 or worse, but better than or equal to 20/400 with&#xD;
      comparably less damage to the RPE/photoreceptor complex than Cohort 1. These patients will be&#xD;
      screened in the same manner for overall health status to minimize risks associated with&#xD;
      retinal surgery and any subsequent immunosuppression. Assessments of visual function will be&#xD;
      the same as in Cohort 1.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive one CPCB-RPE1 implant of approximately 100,000 differentiated RPE cells attached to a small parylene membrane. The density of cells on the membrane represents the approximate density of RPE cells in the human eye. The membrane size was chosen to cover a substantial portion of the macular region of the retina.</description>
