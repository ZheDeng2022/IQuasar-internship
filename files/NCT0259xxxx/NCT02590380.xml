      sagittal correction of the adolescent idiopathic spine deformity in comparison to the side&#xD;
      loading DePuy Synthes USS II pedicle screw system. This is a single-center, single-surgeon&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with follow-up evaluations of patients conducted at initial&#xD;
      follow-up (2 weeks to 8 weeks), 3 months, 12 months and 24 months post-procedure. Adverse&#xD;
      events will be monitored continuously.&#xD;

    <description>Radiographic analysis of the spinal deformity in the coronal plane at the indicated time periods will be compared to the pre-operative measurements (OVERALL CHANGE from baseline at each timepoint).

    <description>Radiographic analysis of the spinal deformity in the sagittal plane at the indicated time periods will be compared to the pre-operative measurements (OVERALL CHANGE from baseline at each timepoint).

    <time_frame>Initial follow-up (2 weeks to 8 weeks), 3 months, 12 months and 24 months post-procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of back and leg pain will be evaluated in all study subjects using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). The study will employ a 15% improvement for success. OVERALL CHANGE from baseline will be assessed at each timepoint.</description>

    <measure>SRS-22</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial follow-up (2 weeks to 8 weeks), 3 months, 12 months and 24 months post-procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Scoliosis and its treatment have a great impact on the quality of life of the affected patients. The Revised Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22r) is a specific questionnaire for spine conditions. It is applied to patients with idiopathic scoliosis, whose conditions and treatments have a great impact on their quality of life. The SRS-22r was created and revised with the purpose of evaluating this impact from the patient's point of view. The reviewed version contains 22 questions distributed into five domains: function/activity (FA), pain (P), self-image/appearance (SA), mental health (MH) and satisfaction with treatment (ST). The scores vary from 1 to 5, in which 5 is the best health quality of life of patients. OVERALL CHANGE from baseline will be assessed at each timepoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated Blood Volume Loss/Salvage Return</measure>
    <time_frame>Operative Data - to be collected immediately after case is completed. Estimated blood loss will be noted by the surgical/anesthesia team and this value can then be immediately collected.</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of blood loss over the entire length of the surgery as well as salvage return volumes will be captured intraoperatively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of Hospital Stay</measure>
    <time_frame>At discharge (up to one week post surgery) - Once the subject has been released from the hospital, the length of hospital stay can be calculated using the intake and discharge dates.</time_frame>
    <description>The length of hospital stay from the date of admission to the date of discharge will be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Return to Work/School</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial follow-up (2 weeks to 8 weeks), 3 months, 12 months and 24 months post-procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to and the time it takes for the subject to be cleared to return to work/school from the date of surgery will be documented. Once the subject has returned to the &quot;baseline&quot; status this question will not be asked.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Return to Sport/Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial follow-up (2 weeks to 8 weeks), 3 months, 12 months and 24 months post-procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to return to sport as performed by the individual patient pre operatively. Time to walking unaided, running, swimming, trampoline, contact sport, normal social interactions with peer group. Once the subject has returned to the &quot;baseline&quot; status this question will not be asked.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of Analgesia Post-Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial follow-up (2 weeks to 8 weeks), 3 months, 12 months and 24 months post-procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>The types and dosages of any analgesia taken by the patient post-surgery will be documented. Overall change from baseline (pre-operative medications) will be analyzed at each interval - anticipation is that use of analgesia decreases and/or ends after surgery.</description>
