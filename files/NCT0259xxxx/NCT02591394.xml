  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Stroke Transitions Education and Prevention (STEP) Clinic is a new type of clinic&#xD;
      designed for stroke patients and was established to provide a comprehensive approach to&#xD;
      stroke risk factor reduction. The goal of this study will be more effective than usual care&#xD;
      at reducing blood pressure in patients with poorly controlled blood pressure after an&#xD;
      ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      STEP clinic patients will receive personalized goals, instructions to self-monitor, a blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor, prescription medications, sleep apnea screening, dietary counseling, and&#xD;
      more frequent follow-up if needed. A stroke neurologist will see patients in the usual care&#xD;
      group and recommendations will be sent to their primary care providers.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will visit with STEP clinic staff (including a stroke nurse practitioner or stroke doctor) to receive personalized goals, stroke education (including diet and exercise), instructions to self-monitor using blood pressure cuff, and prescription medications Patient will be scheduled for additional clinic follow-up or be contacted for telephone follow-up for management of your blood pressure. Questionnaires will be administered to determine medication adherence and persistence (following instructions for prescribed medication), disability, depression, cognition, self-efficacy, and sleep apnea. The care plan determined by the STEP clinic will be shared with the patient's primary care provider.</description>
