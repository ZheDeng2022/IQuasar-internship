  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create an electronic registry to house phenotypic information&#xD;
      from patients with achondroplasia. The initial focus of this registry will be to include U.S.&#xD;
      patients with achondroplasia. Once populated, the collective data can be queried to pursue&#xD;
      clinical research questions pertaining to health outcomes and treatment options for patients&#xD;
      with this conditions. The registry is longitudinal in nature with the functionality to&#xD;
      retrospectively enter patients' clinical data from the prenatal period up through the most&#xD;
      recent encounter, with all intervening data entered in a chronologic fashion.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to create an electronic registry to house phenotypic&#xD;
      information from patients with all types of bone conditions. The initial focus of this&#xD;
      registry will be to include U.S. patients with achondroplasia. Once populated by&#xD;
      co-investigators with particular interest, expertise and large clinical populations with&#xD;
      these bone conditions, the collective data can be queried to pursue clinical research&#xD;
      questions pertaining to health outcomes and treatment options for patients with these complex&#xD;
      conditions. The registry is longitudinal in nature with the functionality to retrospectively&#xD;
      enter patients' clinical data from the prenatal period up through the most recent encounter,&#xD;
      with all intervening data entered in a chronologic fashion. The database has been created in&#xD;
      RedCap, a publicly available database format created by researchers at the University of&#xD;
      Miami specifically for academic researchers collaborating across multiple research sites. The&#xD;
      rationale for creating such a database is simple; achondroplasia is relatively rare so&#xD;
      collaboration among researchers is essential to gather similarly affected patients to answer&#xD;
      common clinical research questions. The goal is to better understand the natural history and&#xD;
      treatment outcomes for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry was built by, based at and maintained by personnel from the Greenberg Center&#xD;
      for Skeletal Dysplasias in the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine (IGM) at Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins. The registry is web-based and therefore easily accessible to our co-investigators at&#xD;
      other sites across the U.S., including Alfred I. DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware, University&#xD;
      of Wisconsin in Madison and University of Texas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to enroll at least 1500 patients with achondroplasia from the aforementioned&#xD;
      sites. Access to the registry is password-protected and the data will be backed up on the IGM&#xD;
      server daily. A co-investigator will be able to enter and access the identifying information&#xD;
      (i.e. name, address, contact information, DOB) for their patients only in the registry.&#xD;
      Thereafter, a unique study identification number, calculated age of the subject (based on the&#xD;
      date of data entry) and diagnosis will be the only identifiers accessible to the other&#xD;
      co-investigators. The total deidentified phenotype data will be available to the&#xD;
      co-investigators during data analysis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects may be active clinical patients at the above sites or no longer treated at a&#xD;
