    <textblock>
      Vergenix™ Flowable Gel is an advanced wound care device primarily made of lyophilized Type I&#xD;
      recombinant human Collagen (rhCollagen) . Vergenix Flowable Gel is supplied as a powder&#xD;
      contained in a syringe that will be hydrated with saline, forming a gel. The Vergenix™&#xD;
      Flowable Gel provides a scaffold for cellular invasion and capillary growth. A secondary&#xD;
      dressing to cover and secure the primary Vergenix™ Flowable Gel wound site followed by a&#xD;
      final dressing application that will wrap the wound and surrounding area&#xD;

    <description>Wound inspection is a combination of measures that includes assessing the wound grade (according to Texas classification for Neuropathic ulcers only), wound's area and depth, presence of granulation tissue and the percentage of wound area covered with granulation, quality of the granulation tissue (granulometer scale), presence and location of epithelialization, presence of necrotic tissue and percentage of wound area covered with necrotic tissue, amount and quality of wound's secretions, presence of infection.</description>
