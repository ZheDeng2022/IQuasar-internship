    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide some information (pilot data) about whether the study&#xD;
      drug, suvorexant, (1) affects levels of orexin in people with panic disorder, and (2) is&#xD;
      associated with decreased panic symptoms in response to a carbon dioxide (CO2) challenge.&#xD;

      Orexins&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypocretins (orexins), a more recently identified class of pro-arousal neuropeptides, are&#xD;
      synthesized by neurons in the lateral and posterior hypothalamus The main described orexins,&#xD;
      orexin A (ORX A) and orexin B (ORX B), are both cleaved from a common precursor peptide,&#xD;
      prepro-orexin. Orexin A, a 33 amino-acid residue peptide, appears to be conserved across many&#xD;
      mammalian species. Orexin B contains 28 amino acids. Orexins promote a variety of behaviors&#xD;
      including alertness, vigilance, locomotion, fight-flight responses, and feeding. The&#xD;
      physiological effects of the orexins are mediated via 2 G-protein coupled receptors, ORX1 and&#xD;
      ORX2. Orexin A binds with greater affinity to the ORX1 receptor, while orexin A and B bind&#xD;
      with similar affinity to the ORX2 receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orexins and Animal Fear Models&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orexins have been implicated in anxiogenesis in some animal fear models. For example, central&#xD;
      (icv) injection of orexin A in mice induced anxiety-like responses in the light-dark&#xD;
      exploration test and elevated plus maze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using an established, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-deficit, rodent model of&#xD;
      panic-vulnerability, the investigators' Indiana University preclinical anxiety collaborators&#xD;
      provoked a panic-like response in rodents with an anxiogenic sodium lactate (NaLac) infusion,&#xD;
      which response was blunted following either site-specific orexin (ORX) gene silencing or&#xD;
      systemic pretreatment with an ORX1 antagonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, ORX neurons (peptidergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus) were shown, in&#xD;
      turn, to stimulate discrete efferent sites within an emotional network (e.g., bed nucleus of&#xD;
      the stria terminalis) to elicit specific behavioral components of the panic-response&#xD;
      following sodium lactate. Taken together, these results support the concept that ORX&#xD;
      hypersecretion or ORX neuronal overactivity could also be present in human panic disorder&#xD;
      (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orexins' Emerging Role in Human Anxiogenesis / Panicogenesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to the NaLac model animals, humans with PD have been reported to have cortical and&#xD;
      subcortical GABA deficits. If these GABA deficits also extend to impairment of GABAergic&#xD;
      inhibition of dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) ORX neurons in PD patients, as predicted by the&#xD;
      NaLac animal model, they may result in ORX hypersecretion, increased sympathetic activation,&#xD;
      and panicogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been few clinical studies of ORX metabolism or function in human anxiety&#xD;
      populations. However, recently generated human pilot data in the principal investigator's&#xD;
      (PI's) lab, studying the effects of a well-documented anxiogenic stimulus (35% CO2&#xD;
      inhalation) on behavioral, physiological, and biochemical (plasma ORX A; assayed by a&#xD;
      standard radioimmunoassays [RIA] kit) measures, in 1 PD patient and 2 healthy volunteers. In&#xD;
      this paradigm, the PD patient had a mild panic episode associated with marked early&#xD;
      elevations in plasma ORX levels, relative to the volunteers who had minimal anxiety,&#xD;
      consistent with a role for ORX in the initiation or elaboration of the human panic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was also demonstrated that, in contrast to human subjects without any axis I psychiatric&#xD;
      disorder or with depression alone without panic, only subjects who had high panic scores but&#xD;
      no depression had significantly elevated ORX levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ORX hyperactivity hypothesis of panic that has been evinced from this work is highly&#xD;
      innovative, and promises to broaden the understanding of the neurobiology of human panic&#xD;
      disorder, as well as provide new treatment directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there are limitations with using plasma ORX A as a measure of central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) ORX function, one research group has recently published human data indicating that&#xD;
      resting state CSF and plasma ORX A levels are highly correlated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the central hypothesis of this translational human pilot project, and a more&#xD;
      definitive project based on it, is as follows: PD is a human anxiety disorder associated with&#xD;
      specific cortical and subcortical GABA deficits that result in disruption of normal&#xD;
      inhibitory regulation of pro-arousal ORX neurons. This disruption promotes excessive ORX&#xD;
      release, sympathetic activation, and vulnerability to spontaneous or chemically induced&#xD;
      panic. Pretreatment with an ORX1 receptor antagonist prior to chemical challenge is therefore&#xD;
      expected to block the evoked panic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the Use of CO2 Inhalation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 35% CO2 challenge is well documented in the literature as being reliable, safe, and easy&#xD;
      to administer. The procedure has acceptable test-retest reliability, and may be used to&#xD;
      monitor improvement in clinical status following the administration of antipanic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 70% of PD patients will have a panic attack in response to this challenge,&#xD;
      which closely resembles a real-life panic. Therefore, in addition to resting/baseline&#xD;
      measurement of plasma ORX A, CO2-evoked levels of plasma ORX A in PD patients will also be&#xD;
      examined, and these responses will be correlated with other behavioral and physiological&#xD;
      parameters recorded during the CO2 test. The PI has had considerable experience using PD&#xD;
      challenge paradigms in clinical research contexts, and he is very familiar with the&#xD;
      application of the 35% CO2 challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Aims and Expected Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is a study that gathers pilot data relating to the role of orexin in human panic&#xD;
      disorder. The effect sizes generated from this pilot work will permit planning and powering&#xD;
      of a larger-scale study. It is anticipated that the study will be completed over the course&#xD;
      of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 will be to provide a preliminary demonstration that acute administration of&#xD;
      the first-in-class, FDA-approved insomnia agent, suvorexant, a mixed ORX1/2 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist, will block 35% CO2-induced panic symptoms in PD patients, via amelioration of&#xD;
      central ORX neuronal hyperactivity (as reflected in blunted plasma ORX responses to CO2&#xD;
      challenge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address Specific Aim 1, a prospective, parallel-group, repeated-measures design will be&#xD;
      used to compare behavioral, physiological, and biochemical (plasma ORX) responses in 2&#xD;
      independent, unmedicated groups of PD outpatients (n=6 in each group) at baseline/resting&#xD;
      state and after panic provocation due to brief (1 minute) inhalation of a 35% CO2 / 65% O2&#xD;
      gas mixture. PD patients will be randomized, in a double-blind manner, to receive either a&#xD;
      single, oral dose of the mixed ORX1/2 receptor antagonist, suvorexant (10 mg dose), or&#xD;
      identical placebo, 120 minutes before CO2 challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: It is expected that, compared to placebo, suvorexant pretreatment will&#xD;
      blunt behavioral, physiological, and biochemical (plasma ORX) responses to 35% CO2 in PD, due&#xD;
      to suppression of CNS ORX hyperactivity. The effect sizes generated from the pilot work will&#xD;
      permit planning and powering of a larger-scale study, to definitively address Specific Aim 1.&#xD;
