      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteus syndrome (PS) is caused by a mutation in the AKT1 gene. This gene makes a protein&#xD;
      that communicates with other proteins in the body to make cells grow. The AKT1 mutation&#xD;
      changes chemical signals in the body and causes overgrowth. PS can be fatal. The drug MK-7075&#xD;
      reduces signals from the AKT1 protein. This may reduce or stabilize some of the overgrowth in&#xD;
      people with PS. Researchers want to find the best dose of MK-7075 based on its effect on&#xD;
      tissues in people with PS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose of MK-7075 in people with PS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 6 and older with PS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take MK-7075 by mouth once daily for up to 12 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must stay near the NIH Clinical Center (CC) during the whole first cycle, for&#xD;
      weekly visits to the CC. For cycle 2, they will have visits every 2 weeks. They will have 1&#xD;
      visit before cycles 3 and 4, and once before every other cycle for cycles 5 11. The final&#xD;
      visit will be at the end of cycle 12. Visits may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small skin samples taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG: Soft electrodes on the skin record heart signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiogram: A small probe held to the chest takes pictures of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint and mobility function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete surveys by phone and in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a daily medication and symptom diary.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proteus syndrome is a rare segmental overgrowth disorder caused by a somatic gain of function&#xD;
      mutation, c.49GA, p.Glu17Lys) in the oncogene AKT1, encoding the AKT1 kinase . The disorder&#xD;
      is progressive, with high morbidity and mortality - there are very few living adults with&#xD;
      this disease. Tissues and cell lines from patients with Proteus syndrome harbor admixtures of&#xD;
      mutant alleles that ranged from &lt;1% to approximately 50%. This mutation causes constitutive&#xD;
      activation of AKT1, through Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation. This activation stimulates the&#xD;
      AKT/PI3K pathway, mediating processes including increased cell proliferation and decreased&#xD;
      apoptosis. The progressive nature of the disorder and the mechanism of disease (gain of&#xD;
      function) make AKT1 an excellent target for therapeutics, specifically repression. The&#xD;
      AKT/PI3K pathway is mutated in numerous cancers as well. Because it is commonly mutated in&#xD;
      cancer, pharmaceutical companies are interested in targeting this molecule with inhibitors.&#xD;
      Indeed, Proteus syndrome can be considered a simple model for cancer therapeutics, as these&#xD;
      patients are known to harbor only a single activating mutation instead of the hundreds or&#xD;
      thousands that are mutated in cancers. ArQule Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co.,&#xD;
      has developed a small molecule, miransertib (MK-7075) that effectively inhibits AKT, with the&#xD;
      lowest IC50 for AKT1 (as compared to AKT2 or AKT3, and orders of magnitude lower for other&#xD;
      kinases). This agent has undergone significant development with animal toxicity studies and&#xD;
      is currently in phase I trials in patients with different types of cancer. In addition, we&#xD;
      have performed in vitro testing with miransertib in cells from patients with Proteus syndrome&#xD;
      and demonstrated reduction in AKT1 phosphorylation at doses in the range of achievable blood&#xD;
      levels in humans with low toxicity. Because Proteus syndrome is a chronic disease, typical&#xD;
      approaches to defining the recommended phase II dose by determining the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) are not appropriate it is unreasonable to propose that patients would tolerate&#xD;
      significant side effects for prolonged time periods. As an initial trial for this disease, we&#xD;
      propose a phase I study to determine a recommended dose for subsequent trials, which will&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of miransertib in Proteus syndrome. The recommended phase II dose will&#xD;
      be determined based on the tolerability of miransertib in children and adults with Proteus&#xD;
      syndrome and measures of drug levels in plasma and affected tissues in patients with Proteus&#xD;
      syndrome and measures of tissue phosphorylation of AKT1. We hypothesize that the recommended&#xD;
      dose of miransertib will be substantially below that of doses used in patients with cancer&#xD;
      and that this will lead to a highly favorable risk-benefit ratio on which we can base future&#xD;
      efficacy studies.&#xD;

             In addition, an important objective of this study is to characterize the&#xD;
             pharmacokinetics of MK-7075 in the pediatric population since it has been better&#xD;
             studied in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
