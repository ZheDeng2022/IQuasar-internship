    <textblock>
      Background: Medical male circumcision (MMC) for HIV prevention is a priority in 14 East and&#xD;
      Southern African countries, and the long-term sustainability of MMC programs could best be&#xD;
      achieved by early infant male circumcision (EIMC.) However, the acceptability and safety of&#xD;
      EIMC provided by non-physicians is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We conducted a trial of EIMC using the Mogen clamp provided by newly trained&#xD;
      clinical officers (CO) and nurse midwives (NMWs) in 4 health centers in rural Rakai, Uganda.&#xD;
      501 healthy neonates aged 1-28 days with normal birth weight and gestational age were&#xD;
      randomized to CO (n=256) and NMWs (n=245), and were followed up at 24 hours, 7 and 28 days.&#xD;
      Combined analgesia was provided by paracetamol suppository, Eutectic Mixture of Local&#xD;
      Anesthetics (EMLA) cream and a 24% sucrose solution.&#xD;

      The objective was to assess the acceptability and safety of neonatal male circumcision&#xD;
      performed by clinical officers (equivalent to US physician assistants) and nurse midwives,&#xD;
      using the Mogen clamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a randomized, blinded trial of circumcision using the Mogen clamp under topical&#xD;
      anesthesia in healthy male infants aged 1-28 days, with normal birth weight and gestational&#xD;
      age, performed by trained clinical officers or nurse midwives, randomized 1:1 in Rakai&#xD;
      District, Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers of male infants born in 4 health centers were invited to participate and signed an&#xD;
      informed consent for screening and enrollment. Infants were screened on enrollment prior to&#xD;
      randomization (1;1) to clinical officer and nurse midwife circumcision providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up was via a phone call at 24 hours, 7 days and 4 weeks post-circumcision.&#xD;

    <description>The standard procedure for neonatal circumcision is as follows: combined analgesia was topical 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine &lt;1 gm applied 60 minutes and 40mg acetaminophen suppository 30 minutes prior to surgery. Infants were given a 24% sucrose solution pacifier if needed. Infants under 2 weeks of age received subcutaneous Vitamin K 1 mg. The perineum cleaned, and the penis swabbed with povidone iodine. Hemostats were applied at 3 and 9 o'clock positions and the glans pushed down. Traction was applied before placing the Mogen clamp, the clamp was closed for 5 minutes and the foreskin removed with a scalpel.&#xD;
Petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline) was applied to the glans and the wound covered with sterile gauze. Infants were observed for one hour. Mothers were instructed in wound care.</description>
