      A SINGLE CENTER, SINGLE DOSE, OPEN-LABEL, RANDOMIZED, TWO PERIOD CROSSOVER STUDY TO DETERMINE&#xD;
      THE BIOEQUIVALENCE OF TWO INHALATION FORMULATIONS CONTAINING BUDESONIDE 200 µg ADMINISTERED&#xD;
      AS 3 PUFFS (TOTAL DOSE OF 600 µg) IN AT LEAST 52 HEALTHY MALES AND FEMALES UNDER FASTING&#xD;
      CONDITIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to determine whether the inhaled test product, budesonide 200 µg&#xD;
      (pressurized inhalation suspension) and the inhaled reference product, Budesonida Pulmictan®&#xD;
      200 µg (budesonide; pressurized inhalation suspension) are bioequivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose the PK profile of budesonide will be compared after administration of a&#xD;
      single dose of 600 µg (3 puffs) of each of the two inhalation formulations, under fasting&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor has developed a new formulation (test product) of an existing medication&#xD;
      (reference product) which is intended for a variation in the existing marketing&#xD;
      authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study in healthy males and females is designed to establish a PK profile under&#xD;
      fasting conditions for the orally inhaled test and reference products to evaluate&#xD;
      bioequivalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-dose, open-label, laboratory-blind, randomized, two-period crossover&#xD;
      study with inhalation administered budesonide200 µg conductedunder fasting conditions inat&#xD;
      least 52 healthy males and femalesat a single study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening period, including serum cortisol levels and documented inhalation training, of&#xD;
           maximum 21 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two treatment periods (each of which will include a profile period of 24 hours)separated&#xD;
           by a wash-out period of 7 calendar days (minimum number of days based on half-life of&#xD;
           the analyte) to 14 calendar days (maximum number of days based on logistical&#xD;
           arrangements) between consecutive administrations of the IMP;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A post-study visit within 72 hours of completion of the last treatment period of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned randomly to treatment sequence, prior to the first&#xD;
      administration of IMP.&#xD;
