      A primary aim of the current proposal is to compare the effect of daily consumption of&#xD;
      healthy lean protein as either whey protein (2 meals per day) or whole food (25% of total&#xD;
      daily caloric intake) consumed as 6 small meals throughout the day, one of which is consumed&#xD;
      immediately following exercise training (within 30 min) and another 2 hours prior to going to&#xD;
      bed at night, over a 16 week period on muscle and fat mass, cardiovascular health, aerobic&#xD;
      fitness, glucose, insulin, blood lipids, heart rate and muscle strength in overweight men and&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the effects of increased healthy protein&#xD;
      intake (25% of daily caloric intake as protein; 25% as healthy fats and oils; 50% as complex,&#xD;
      unrefined carbohydrates) consumed as 6 small meals during the day in combination with&#xD;
      exercise training 4 times per week, over a 16 week period in 25 overweight, but healthy males&#xD;
      and females (30-60 yrs old). A secondary purpose is to compare the effects of consuming two&#xD;
      of the 6 small meals during the day comprised of whole food protein source servings&#xD;
      20g/serving) with a matched group consuming whey protein for 2 daily protein servings&#xD;
      (20g/serving). In the case of both groups, 1 serving will be consumed immediately following&#xD;
      exercise [within 30 minutes] and 1 serving will be consumed 2 hours before going to bed. On&#xD;
      non-exercise days, all participants will continue to consume 6 small meals per day in the&#xD;
      same ratio of 25% lean protein, 25% healthy fats and oils, and 50% complex, unrefined&#xD;
      carbohydrates but the groups will differ only in the composition of the last meal of the day&#xD;
      consumed 2 hours before going to bed in which one group will consume protein (20g/serving) as&#xD;
      whole food protein sources and the other group will consume a single serving of a whey&#xD;
      protein supplement. The primary purpose of this study is to quantify changes in the following&#xD;
      health outcomes at baseline and 16 weeks: total body muscle mass and fat mass (iDXA);&#xD;
      abdominal fat mass (most highly related to cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk); blood&#xD;
      sugar (glucose); blood lipids; insulin, aerobic fitness (assessed with a submaximal exercise&#xD;
      test); and muscular strength (measured by 1 repetition maximum (RM) of the chest and leg&#xD;
      press). The following additional measures will be assessed at baseline and 16 weeks: waist&#xD;
      circumference; body weight, heart rate, blood pressure, and hunger (Visual Analog Scales).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each participant was screened prior to participating in the study using the Health and&#xD;
             Fitness History, Physical Activity, and Physical Activity Readiness questionnaires&#xD;
             administered by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical clearance was secured from the participant's primary care physician to verify&#xD;
             no cardiovascular,metabolic or orthopedic issues that would prohibit them from&#xD;
             performing the exercises for the duration of the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Depending on the outcome of the health history, fitness and activity questionnaires&#xD;
             and the physician's clearance, participants were informed of eligibility to&#xD;
             participate in the study. A group meeting was scheduled for all eligible and&#xD;
             interested participants to review the entire study. This process took place prior to&#xD;
             administering any tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants were excluded if they smoked, had a whey protein intolerance, or&#xD;
             orthopedic conditions that prohibited them from engaging in strenuous exercise&#xD;
