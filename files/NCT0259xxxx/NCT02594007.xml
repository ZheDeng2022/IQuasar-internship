    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) affects 5.7 million Americans and is the only major cardiovascular&#xD;
      disorder on the rise. The primary aim of this study is to formally study the combined effects&#xD;
      of several different tele-health modalities, all currently approved and available for general&#xD;
      use, to determine if such combinations will result in an increase in early intervention and a&#xD;
      resultant decrease in acute cardiac decompensation requiring a hospitalization or Emergency&#xD;
      Room (ER) visit. This study will attempt to characterize the frequency of health care&#xD;
      interventions attributable to the use of these technologies, and any relationship between&#xD;
      these interventions and the frequency of hospitalization or ER visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include characterization of healthcare utilization, healthcare costs,&#xD;
      and patient experiences with regard to the use the provided technologies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 400,000 to 700,000 new cases of heart failure (HF) are diagnosed each&#xD;
      year and the number of deaths in the United States from this chronic condition has more than&#xD;
      doubled since 1979 - averaging 275,000 annually. HF accounts for over 1.1 million annual&#xD;
      hospital discharges, 3.4 million physician office visits, 668,000 emergency department&#xD;
      visits, and 293,000 outpatient visits per year. The economic impact is equally staggering:&#xD;
      the total estimated annual cost of heart failure exceeds $40 billion. This figure is expected&#xD;
      to reach $97 billion by 2030. While initial hospitalizations consume a vast amount of health&#xD;
      care resources, readmissions are also a significant problem. The overall readmission rate&#xD;
      (all cause) in the United States is 19.6%. Studies have shown the 30-day readmission rate for&#xD;
      HF to be 24%. The important clinical implication is that patients are particularly vulnerable&#xD;
      in the early post-discharge period (30-90 days from hospital to home) and require heightened&#xD;
      surveillance, especially if the hospital admission has been prolonged or if the patient has&#xD;
      had prior admissions for worsening HF. Despite advances in pharmacologic and monitoring&#xD;
      device therapy, the inability to effectively manage and influence patient behavior and the&#xD;
      inability of patients to identify signs and symptoms of decompensated HF are major hurdles to&#xD;
      improving outcomes and avoiding subsequent readmissions. Less than 10% of HF patients are&#xD;
      eligible for implantable monitoring devices due to a variety of reasons. Non-invasive cardiac&#xD;
      telemetry units only monitor a patient's echocardiograph (ECG). HF patients present with&#xD;
      numerous other physiologic parameters which largely go unmonitored and changes in status&#xD;
      undetected after discharge from hospital to home. A worsening status in any one of these&#xD;
      indicators may predict worsening condition or decompensation. This gap leaves a tremendous&#xD;
      percentage (the majority, in fact) of the HF population at risk for repeat medical crisis and&#xD;
      re-hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Managing the HF patient population requires highly skilled clinicians, stringent monitoring&#xD;
      and care coordination, and advanced technology integration. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      patient-centered non-invasive remote monitoring care system for HF. This model leverages&#xD;
      three distinct technology platforms. This unique care plan brings together physiologic data&#xD;
      capture with symptomatic and behavioral patient information into a dynamic patient engagement&#xD;
      and education mobile platform that analyzes, predicts and notifies clinicians when a&#xD;
      patient's baseline health is changing before it leads to a negative health consequence and&#xD;
      subsequent hospital re-admission or ER visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A small cutaneous Mobile Patient Monitoring patch (SEEQ®) from Medtronic that&#xD;
           continuously collects ECG data, plus heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory&#xD;
           rate, and atrial fibrillation status. These added physiologic parameters provide&#xD;
           clinicians more precise insight into a patient's condition and clearly differentiates&#xD;
           the monitoring technology from standard approaches. The Medtronic patch is applied like&#xD;
           a band-aid to the patient's chest prior to hospital discharge. As it collects data, the&#xD;
           information is wirelessly transmitted via Bluetooth to a patient care platform from&#xD;
           which providers can access information in live-time for 30 days post discharge.&#xD;
           Medtronic's patch does not require leads like other commercially available systems, and&#xD;
           does not need to be removed during bathing and other normal activities. Thus this&#xD;
           product increases patient compliance and enhances satisfaction. An increase in patient&#xD;
           compliance will ensure a more complete and accurate picture of the patient's health.&#xD;
           Captured data is used to 1) provide clinicians with physiological data for patients who&#xD;
           are at risk of near-term decompensated HF, and 2) allow clinicians to deliver live-time&#xD;
           treatment intervention and guidance from anywhere at any time, preventing health&#xD;
           problems from escalating into health crises.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Another key differentiator in this care model is the patient's use of a tablet-based&#xD;
           tele-health mobile software application that includes the patient's discharge plan, a&#xD;
           daily medication management list, reminders, and CHAT features for live, interactive&#xD;
           communication with the care team. The software assesses the patient's psychosocial&#xD;
           status and enables clinicians to coach and guide patients to change negative health&#xD;
           behaviors and adhere to their care plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medtronic's Cardiocom system deploys a proprietary cellular-based patient interface tool&#xD;
           (Commander Flex), a blood pressure cuff that interfaces directly with the Commander Flex&#xD;
           and a Bluetooth enabled medical-grade scale that also interfaces directly with the&#xD;
           Commander Flex. The patient is required to take the blood pressure and weight&#xD;
           measurements at prescribed intervals over the evaluation period (30 days) as well as&#xD;
           answer a variety of behavioral and symptomatic questions that operate on a proprietary&#xD;
           tree-based questioning algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Docview® mHealth solution encourages self-management and empowers patients to become&#xD;
           stakeholders in their health. The application collects real-time data with regular&#xD;
           &quot;check-ins&quot; to analyze state of wellness, and enables patients to connect live with&#xD;
           their care team - no matter where they are. The entire process takes less than one&#xD;
           minute to complete and the answers provide the care team an actionable&#xD;
           risk-stratification snapshot. Automating the process allows larger patient populations&#xD;
           to be monitored, yet drastically reduces provider-patient involvement, as only at-risk&#xD;
           patients need to be notified (10-15% estimated). In a traditional setting, the&#xD;
           monitoring team typically calls every patient and could maintain a caseload of only&#xD;
           20-25 patients (average call time 20-25 min). All patients have to be contacted by phone&#xD;
           just to determine if a risk exists. The proposed tele-health solution uses real-time&#xD;
           data analysis and predictive modeling to proactively notify a provider that a patient's&#xD;
           baseline health is changing prior to a negative health issue, and quickly delivers an&#xD;
           intervention to the patient based on clinical decisions and statistically validated&#xD;
           treatment algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This unique care plan brings together physiologic data capture with symptomatic and&#xD;
      behavioral patient information into a dynamic patient engagement and education mobile&#xD;
      platform that analyzes, predicts and notifies clinicians when a patient's baseline health is&#xD;
      changing before it leads to a negative health consequence and subsequent hospital&#xD;
      re-admission or ER visit.&#xD;
