  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of mini-trampoline training on balance, cardiorespiratory fitness, strength and&#xD;
      neuropsychological parameters in an overweight or obese population are unknown. The aim of&#xD;
      this 2-arm randomized controlled trial is to compare the effects of a 12-week mini-trampoline&#xD;
      training and a 12-week nordic walking training on balance, fitness and strength in&#xD;
      overweight/obese individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of literature suggests, that obesity is not only associated with medical&#xD;
      conditions such as diabetes, but also linked to altered gait, impaired balance and a greater&#xD;
      likelihood of falls. Weight reduction has been shown to improve balance controle. Methods to&#xD;
      increase physical activity are largely not accepted in this population and those which&#xD;
      conserve the musculoskeletal system are rare. Physical activity has been shown to influence&#xD;
      mood, quality of life and eating behavior. Mini-trampoline training has been shown to enhance&#xD;
      stability and increase fitness.&#xD;
