      postprandial cardiometabolic response in healthy Chinese men.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spices have been used for centuries to enhance food flavouring and to maintain health. Use of&#xD;
      spices as a culinary ingredient is common amongst people of all ethnicities within South and&#xD;
      East Asia. Spices are also one of the main sources of polyphenols in the Asian diet. Several&#xD;
      in vitro studies and some in vivo studies, mainly in animals have shown that individual&#xD;
      spices, including turmeric (containing curcumin), cinnamon (cinnimic acid), ginger, garlic&#xD;
      etc. have been shown to improve glucose and lipid metabolism.However, well-controlled&#xD;
      randomised trials, within the normal dietary context in humans are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted using a three-way randomised crossover design using the Latin&#xD;
      square approach. In the two treatment sessions, each volunteer will consume a mixed spice&#xD;
      dish at two doses (i.e., 'small portion' or 'large portion' curry sauce), and rice as the&#xD;
      base ingredient. In the control session, the same base ingredient (rice) but without the&#xD;
      mixed spices will be served. The total amount of mixed spices consumed, to be made from dried&#xD;
      powders of turmeric, cumin, coriander, gooseberry (amla), cinnamon, clove and cayenne pepper,&#xD;
      will be 6 g and 12 g for small and large portion curries respectively. In addition, as added&#xD;
      vegetables, the curry meals will contain tomato, garlic, onion and ginger, whereas the&#xD;
      control meal will just have tomato and peeled aubergine, although, the total amount of&#xD;
      vegetables will remain the same across all dishes (treatment or control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study will be to measure postprandial and fasting changes in&#xD;
      blood glucose, insulin, triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids (FFA), 24h ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP), endothelial function and inflammatory markers following consumption of&#xD;
      increasing doses of mixed spices in a single meal, on separate occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study will be to monitor changes in blood levels of gut&#xD;
      hormones, plasma and urine metabolome including polyphenols such as benzoate and hippurate,&#xD;
      gut microflora content and function, as a result of the mixed spice intake. A subset of the&#xD;
      treatments (control and high spice dose only) will also have interstitial glucose monitored&#xD;
      continuously for a period of up to 3 days using the continuous glucose monitoring system&#xD;
      (CGMS).&#xD;
