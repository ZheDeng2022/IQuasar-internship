  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if C16G2 Gel administered over a certain period of&#xD;
      time either with a toothbrush or a custom dental tray can effectively kill bacteria in the&#xD;
      mouth that cause dental cavities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This multi-center, multiple-arm study will evaluate the microbiological activity and safety&#xD;
      of C16G2 Gel in male and female dental subjects, 12 to 75 years of age. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and open-label manner and enroll&#xD;
      adolescent (12-17 years of age) and adult subjects (18-75 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately 128 study subjects will be enrolled into up to 7 study arms. Study&#xD;
      drug (C16G2 Gel or Placebo) will be administered via manual brush gel application (MBGA) or&#xD;
      tray gel application (TGA). Two C16G2 concentrations will be evaluated. Four study arms will&#xD;
      be conducted in a double blind manner, with a treatment allocation ratio of 4:1&#xD;
      (C16G2:Placebo), three study arms will be conducted in an open-label manner. Before dosing,&#xD;
      eligible subjects will undergo professional dental prophylaxis on Day 0. Clinic visits for&#xD;
      all study arms will include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -21 to 0), and a varying number of dosing&#xD;
      and follow-up visits.&#xD;
