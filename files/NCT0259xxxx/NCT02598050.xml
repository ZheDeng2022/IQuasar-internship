    <textblock>
      The purpose of this work is to determine whether preoperative cognitive screening of patients&#xD;
      over the age of 65 can be used as predictor of postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing&#xD;
      lower extremity surgical procedures. This work is important as it may aid patients, families&#xD;
      and physicians about the appropriateness of the surgical procedure and in providing resources&#xD;
      to patients who are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overriding hypothesis is that preoperative cognitive impairment is a risk factor for poor&#xD;
      surgical outcomes in seniors and that preoperative screening is superior to standard or&#xD;
      systematic clinical processes for identifying at-risk patients. The first objective is to&#xD;
      assess the marginal benefit of structured preoperative cognitive screening relative to&#xD;
      standard or systematic preoperative evaluation for identifying seniors with likely cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. The second objective is to determine whether preoperative cognitive impairment&#xD;
      predicts postoperative outcome. This project is designed as a prospective, single-center&#xD;
      observational study. The cohort will consist of 250 consenting subjects ≥ 65 years of age who&#xD;
      present to the BWH Weiner Center for Preoperative Evaluation (CPE) prior to elective lower&#xD;
      extremity joint replacement surgery. These surgeries are selected because they are common in&#xD;
      this age group, associated with significant morbidity, and along with dementia are considered&#xD;
      a priority area (bone and joint conditions) by AHRQ. These ages are chosen as significant&#xD;
      clinical data demonstrate increased cognitive impairment in community dwelling elders.&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria include: patients ≥ 65 years of age with an ASA physical status of I-IV&#xD;
      presenting for elective joint replacement. Exclusion criteria will include planned ICU&#xD;
      admission postoperatively, uncorrected vision or hearing impairment (unable to see pictures&#xD;
      or read or hear instructions); limited use of the dominant hand (limited ability to draw);&#xD;
      and or inability to speak, read, or understand English. Study staff will use the CPE&#xD;
      computerized scheduling system, which is updated continuously in real time and captures&#xD;
      relevant information such as age and procedure, to identify potential subjects. When patients&#xD;
      check in with the receptionist in the CPE for their appointment they will be notified that&#xD;
      they (and their surrogate) may be eligible to participate in a study in the CPE involving&#xD;
      patients over the age of 65. The receptionist will then provide them with a brochure about&#xD;
      the study that includes information about the purpose of the study, the risks to the patient,&#xD;
      and the potential benefits to society. The patient will then be asked if they are willing to&#xD;
      speak with one of the study investigators and only those patients that agree to speak with a&#xD;
      study investigator will be approached. Patients with known cognitive impairment will be&#xD;
      included in the study to determine whether this information is included in the preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation form. They will sign their own consent if they are capable and going to sign their&#xD;
      surgical procedure consent. In the event that the patient is not capable of signing their own&#xD;
      consent a surrogate will be asked to provide consent with assent from the patient. In our&#xD;
      prior studies with similar patient populations less than 1% had documented cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. The staff member will then describe the goals and risks of the study in a quiet&#xD;
      room in the PATC and ask the patient (and their surrogate where appropriate) if they choose&#xD;
      to participate. After all questions have been answered and the patient has the opportunity to&#xD;
      read the consent form, written consent will be obtained by one of the study investigators.&#xD;
      After obtaining consent, study staff will gain information about the patient's age and years&#xD;
      of education. Study staff will administer standard instruments to assess health and&#xD;
      functional status (basic and instrumental activities of daily living [ADLs and IADLs,&#xD;
      respectively, and the WHODAS]). The World Health Organization Disability Scale 2.0 (WHODAS)&#xD;
      is an alternative to the SF36 to measure physical health and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients will be asked if they've had a fall within the last 6 months, whether&#xD;
      they've been evaluated for a change in memory or thinking, who accompanied them to their&#xD;
      appointment, their employment status, and their living situation (alone, institutionalized,&#xD;
      living with family members) in a patient survey. The study staff will also administer the&#xD;
      MiniCog, a simple cognitive screening tool that takes just 2-4 min to complete and has little&#xD;
      or no education, language, or race bias. In addition, the Animal Fluency Test will be&#xD;
      administered, which is a short cognitive screen that takes one minute to complete. Other&#xD;
      measures of cognitive impairment will be obtained by study staff through: documentation on&#xD;
      the patient's standard preoperative form, patient or informant report of diagnosis or&#xD;
      evaluation for cognitive impairment or memory concerns, and systematic medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their routine preoperative blood draw the phlebotomist will be provided with three&#xD;
      heparinized blood tube labeled with only the patient's study ID number that will be returned&#xD;
      to the investigative team and processed within 30 minutes of the blood draw. Briefly, half of&#xD;
      the sample would be spun down and plasma harvested and stored at -80 degrees C and when an&#xD;
      adequate sample size obtained used to measure inflammatory cytokines by ELISA. The remainder&#xD;
      of the sample will be divided into 1-ml aliquots and incubated at 37°C for 15 min with&#xD;
      phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (control), 100 ng/ml interleukin (IL)-6, 100 ng/ml IL-10, or&#xD;
      a combination of 100 ng/mlIL-2 and 2 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor,&#xD;
      or 1g/ml lipopolysaccharide. Blood samples will be resuspended in 1.4 ml stabilizing buffer&#xD;
      and incubated for 10 min at room temperature for fixation in PFA, cooled to 4C, and stored at&#xD;
      80C until further processing for flow cytometry to determine the immune response of the white&#xD;
      blood cells to a ex-vivo immune challenge and whether these correlate with Mini-Cog score or&#xD;
      the development of delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each enrolled patient will receive a business card listing the investigators' contact&#xD;
      information and be advised to expect a follow up telephone call 6 months and 1 year after&#xD;
      surgery to verify data elements and reassess functional outcome. Delirium will be assessed&#xD;
      prospectively once per day on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 by a trained study team member&#xD;
      using the Confusion Assessment Method [CAM]. Delirium is most common on postoperative days&#xD;
      1-3 and the CAM is a well-validated measure of delirium in surgical patients. For functional&#xD;
      status, the WHODAS will be administered 6-12 months postoperatively either by personnel in&#xD;
      the surgeon's office as part of routine follow up or by study staff or by telephone.&#xD;
      Investigators will also collect information on secondary outcomes including duration of PATC&#xD;
      visit, presence of an advanced directive, whether they had surgical procedure, time to PACU&#xD;
      discharge, discharge to place other than home (rehabilitation, skilled nursing facility),&#xD;
      hospital length of stay (LOS), in hospital complications, perioperative variables including&#xD;
      drugs administered, BIS, estimated blood loss, blood transfusions, fluid administered, blood&#xD;
      pressure, oxygen saturation, 30-day reoperation or readmission rate, and 30-day and 1-year&#xD;
      mortality. These outcomes are recorded in the medical record, the BWH Balanced Scorecard, an&#xD;
      electronic database of all hospitalized patients that tabulates 31 elements of the hospital&#xD;
      event, or the BWH Research Patient Database Enhanced Query. Data will also be confirmed by a&#xD;
      follow up telephone interview. Thirty day and 1 year mortality will be recorded.&#xD;
