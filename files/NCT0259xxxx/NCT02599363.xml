    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study to assess the safety and Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel +&#xD;
      ribociclib (LEE011) in patients with Rb+, advanced breast cancer. Dose escalation will be&#xD;
      performed using standard 3 + 3 dosing strategy. The starting dose of ribociclib (LEE011) is&#xD;
      200 mg once daily; dose escalation proceeds in 200 mg increments up to a maximum of 600 mg.&#xD;
      Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) will be based upon first-cycle toxicity.&#xD;

             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Highly&#xD;
             effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In&#xD;

             implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception&#xD;

             transdermal hormone contraception Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or&#xD;
             intrauterine system (IUS) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap&#xD;
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal&#xD;
             suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill&#xD;
             before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier&#xD;
             method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential.&#xD;
