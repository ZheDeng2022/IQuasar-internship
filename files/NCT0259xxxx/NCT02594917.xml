  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are performing this research study to determine whether having low&#xD;
      iron-sulfur cluster levels can cause a disease known as pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is&#xD;
      defined as abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually, small specialized structures inside each human cell called mitochondria are in&#xD;
      charge of generating energy within lung arteries for normal function. During situations of&#xD;
      disease or stress, lung arteries undergo a change in the function of mitochondria, resulting&#xD;
      in the development of PH. In studies on mice, investigators have learned that alterations in&#xD;
      the production of specific metal complexes called iron-sulfur clusters are responsible for&#xD;
      these changes. This makes it more likely that mice will develop PH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators want to find out if alteration of iron-sulfur cluster&#xD;
      formation leads to increased likelihood of developing PH in humans.&#xD;

      Test group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include two visits for the test group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit one there will be required and optional research activities as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Required research activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Peripheral blood draw (3.5 tablespoons) drawn by research coordinator. This blood is to&#xD;
      isolate PBMCs for generation of iPSCs.If patient did not want to give a blood sample we will&#xD;
      ask if willing to give a urine sample. A clinical research coordinator will give the patient&#xD;
      a plastic container and will explain how use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following research activities will be optional at visit one:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical exam and blood work (kidney/liver, blood count, coagulation, B-HCG, iron&#xD;
           studies, and plasma for microRNA) processed at Presby Lab. This will be required if the&#xD;
           patient approved to do right heart cath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 6 Minute Walk Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Skin Biopsy from underarm or inner thigh by physician (Dermatology department) (if&#xD;
           patients agree to do, if not, we will only get a blood sample)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Resting Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit will last 7-8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Two:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will include optional Right Heart Catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right Heart catheterization by PI/Sub-Investigator. Duration ~ 3 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IF the results show that the pressure in the lung vessels is elevated without&#xD;
                exercise AND there is no other abnormality in the heart function, we will NOT do&#xD;
                exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IF the patients are physically able to perform exercise testing/agree to do an&#xD;
                exercise testing, patients will have an Exercise Right Heart catheterization and a&#xD;
                Rest and Stress Echocardiography. (Determined by PI/Sub-Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All participants who will do right heart catheterization will have to do a&#xD;
                pregnancy test before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise Echocardiogram completed in. If patient unable to exercise medication&#xD;
           (Dobutamine) will be given. Duration ~ 1-2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise Right Heart catheterization Duration ~ 2-3 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL GROUP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group will only have one visit. At this visit there will be a minimum required&#xD;
      research activity to participate in the study and this will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Peripheral blood draw (3.5 tablespoons) drawn by research coordinator. This blood is to&#xD;
      isolate PBMCs for generation of iPSCs. If participant did not want to give a blood sample we&#xD;
      will ask if willing to give a urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following research activists will be optional at visit one:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical exam and blood work (kidney/liver, blood count, coagulation, B-HCG, iron&#xD;
           studies, and plasma for microRNA) processed at Presby Lab. This will be required if the&#xD;
           patient approved to do right heart cath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ECG, done by research coordinator and read by PI/Sub-Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 6 Minute Walk Test, done by research coordinator, if patient could perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Skin Biopsy from underarm or inner thigh by physician (Dermatology department) (if&#xD;
           patients agree to do, if not, we will only get a blood sample) This visit will last 6-7&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
