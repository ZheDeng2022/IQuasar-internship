    <textblock>
      This study systematically quantified the effects of the Isagenix Performance System (IEPS)&#xD;
      compared to a standard recommended control (C) diet both of which were combined with a&#xD;
      4-day/week exercise training program on total and regional (abdominal) body composition (lean&#xD;
      mass and fat mass), muscular strength and performance, flexibility, blood lipids and glucose,&#xD;
      hormones, mood state and energy metabolism in 60 healthy middle-aged (25-55 years old) men&#xD;
      and women following a 12-week intervention. Participants were enrolled in one of two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Isagenix Energy &amp; Performance System, 2g/kg/Body Weight (BW) Protein (IEPS) (n=30)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. IEPS-I, n=15; consume protein feeding immediately after exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. IEPS-2, n=15; consume protein feeding 2 hours after exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control, 1g/kg/Body Weight Protein (C) (n=30)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Participants were matched for body weight, body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat (%BF)&#xD;
      and then randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) Isagenix Energy &amp; Performance System at&#xD;
      2.0 g/kg Body Weight per day of protein and combined exercise training (IEPS, n=30); or (2) a&#xD;
      control (C) diet containing 1.0 g/kg Body Weight per day of protein and combined exercise&#xD;
      training (C, n=30). All participants followed a program of progressive exercise training for&#xD;
      12 weeks. All testing procedures (see below) were administered pre-intervention and post&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups were provided meal plans and instructed to follow the meal plans&#xD;
      throughout the intervention. Participants in the IEPS were provided two shakes and 1 bar meal&#xD;
      replacement each day to help them meet the 2.0 g/kg Body Weight of protein per day.&#xD;
      Participants were given a 2-wk supply of the supplement and asked to return the empty packets&#xD;
      before they received the next two-week's supply as a means of assessing their compliance. C&#xD;
      participants were required to follow a healthy meal plan providing 1.0 g/kg Body Weight of&#xD;
      protein per day by consuming whole foods for all of their meals. They were not provided&#xD;
      additional protein supplements. However, they were provided food supplies consisting of&#xD;
      granola bars, chocolate milk, and fruit to help them meet their 1.0 g/kg BW protein per day.&#xD;
      They were also asked to return empty food packets to monitor compliance. Similar dietary&#xD;
      interventions to the two proposed in this study have been used successfully in the past by&#xD;
      the PI with no adverse events being reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the study, each subject was familiarized with the exercise training&#xD;
      protocols by participating in eight supervised exercise sessions over a two-week period (4&#xD;
      times per week) in the Skidmore College fitness and weight training rooms located adjacent to&#xD;
      the Health &amp; Exercise Sciences Department. Participants were asked to perform all the&#xD;
      exercise sessions at Skidmore College for the first two weeks and had the option to perform&#xD;
      one or two of the exercises (I, E) on their own at home or at their local gym following the&#xD;
      two week familiarization. Participants were required to perform 4 exercise sessions per week&#xD;
      of the following exercises: a) resistance training (R); b) interval sprint training (I); c)&#xD;
      stretching training (S); and d) endurance training (E). During the course of the&#xD;
      interventions, a member of the research team periodically &quot;checked-in&quot; (weekly) with each&#xD;
      participant by phone, email, or in-person to answer any questions or provide guidance with&#xD;
      the exercise and dietary intake. All exercise training guidelines and recommendations&#xD;
      followed the American College of Sports Medicine, such that their exercise intensity will be&#xD;
      based on their individual fitness level and health status.&#xD;
