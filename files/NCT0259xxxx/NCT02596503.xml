    <textblock>
      This IND-exempt Phase I trial will establish the recommended Phase II (RP2D) dose of eribulin&#xD;
      in combination with fixed doses of oral irinotecan in adolescents and young adults with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors. Eribulin will be administered intravenously on days 1&#xD;
      and 8 of a 21-day cycle, while irinotecan will be administered orally on days 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned an eribulin dose level at the time of enrollment using a 3+3 Phase&#xD;
      I design, and there will be no intrapatient dose escalation. Once the RP2D has been&#xD;
      established, there will be up to 10 patients enrolled in a dose expansion cohort. In absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or toxicity, subjects may receive up to 17 cycles of therapy.&#xD;
