      This is a Phase 3, prospective, randomized, dual-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of SST-0225 (5.4 grams,&#xD;
      applied up to 6 times in 24 hours, over a 48-hour dosing period) for the treatment of pain&#xD;
      associated with DOMS.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 3, prospective, randomized, multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of SST-0225 for the&#xD;
      treatment of pain associated with DOMS. Healthy volunteers will be recruited to undergo an&#xD;
      exercise regimen designed to induce DOMS in the elbow flexor of the non-dominant arm.&#xD;
      Subjects who are eligible following the exercise regimen will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      treatment with SST-0225 or placebo for a 48 hour period. Subjects will be housed in the&#xD;
      clinic for the first 24 hours of dosing and sent home for the second 24 hour dosing period.&#xD;
      Arm pain/soreness will be assessed throughout the study using an 11-point (0-10) Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to SST-0225 or placebo at up to&#xD;
      three study centers in the US. Subject participation will be between 12 and 26 days depending&#xD;
      on the length of the initial screening period. Once a subject is randomized the duration of&#xD;
      participation will be 10 days. The expected duration of the study is approximately six months&#xD;
      depending on enrollment. The sample size may be increased to a maximum of 250 based on the&#xD;
      results of the planned interim analysis described in Section 15.2 of the protocol.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be the time weighted summed pain/soreness intensity difference from baseline NRS pain/soreness on movement assessments over the first 24 hours (SPID24) following the first application of IP on Day 1. SPID24 will be calculated by summing the time weighted NRS pain/soreness on movement assessment differences from baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) to 24 hours (using actual reported NRS assessment times) post first dose of IP on Day 1.</description>

After subjects complete their 24 hour post first dose NRS pain/soreness on movement assessment, they will be released from the clinic and will continue outpatient treatment for the remaining 24 hours.
