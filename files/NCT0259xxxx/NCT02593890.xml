      A randomised interventional comparative control study will be undertaken to compare the THEYA&#xD;
      Recovery Range postoperatively for patients undergoing wider lumpectomies, partial&#xD;
      mastectomies and total mastectomies to current practice using a mixed method combining&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative instruments. 100 female participants are hoped to be recruited&#xD;
      following breast surgery after a newly diagnosed breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will answer the research question:- &quot;What is the clinical and psychosocial impact&#xD;
      of the THEYA Recovery Range in comparison to recommended practice during and after breast&#xD;
      cancer treatment?&quot; This study will leverage the findings of a pilot study conducted by&#xD;
      Applied Research Connected Healthcare (ARCH) measuring the usability of the THEYA Recovery&#xD;
      Range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the participants' experience of recovery in the immediate&#xD;
      post-operative period and the psychosocial effect of THEYA Recovery Range in comparison to&#xD;
      current recommended practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide, and the most frequent cancer among&#xD;
      females with nearly 1.67 million new cases diagnosed in 2012 (WHO, 2012). Due to population&#xD;
      increases, health service and cancer awareness, more women are diagnosed with breast cancer&#xD;
      each year. Advances in diagnosis and in treatment have seen an increase in survival from&#xD;
      breast cancer for Irish women in recent years (ABC, 2010). In Ireland, after non-melanoma&#xD;
      skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common tumour diagnosed in women in 2008-2010. With an&#xD;
      average annual amount of 2,767 women diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008-2010 (NCRI, 2013).&#xD;
      As a result, more women are living with the permanent effects of breast cancer (Gho et al.,&#xD;
      2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients' newly diagnosed with breast cancer, surgery is the first choice of treatment.&#xD;
      84% of females receive surgery as a form of treatment, be it as a single modality or in&#xD;
      combination with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy (NCRI, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized interventional comparative control study will be undertaken to compare the THEYA&#xD;
      Recovery Range postoperatively for patients undergoing wider lumpectomies, partial&#xD;
      mastectomies and total mastectomies using a mixed method combining quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative instruments. 100 female participants are hoped to be recruited following breast&#xD;
      surgery after a newly diagnosed breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who can participate? Women over the age of 18 years with no upper age limit, with a newly&#xD;
      diagnosed breast cancer that are planned to undergo breast surgery as treatment in a 3 month&#xD;
      period from recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What does the study involve? Participants will be randomly assigned, by use of a sealed&#xD;
      envelope into two groups: an intervention and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the intervention group will be fitted by the investigator with a THEYA Recovery bra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the control group will have standard post-operative care, with recommended bra or&#xD;
      fitted by the Breast Care Nurse Specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete three questionnaires before fitting : The Breast Q, The Body&#xD;
      Image Scale and the EQ 5D 3L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to continue wearing bra for a period of three to four weeks,&#xD;
      then re-assessed on return visit, with re-assessment of the three questionnaires. 30&#xD;
      partcipants will be randomly selected from the sealed envelope to undergo a semi-structured&#xD;
      interview, in order to gain a better understanding of their experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? The benefits for participating&#xD;
      include receiving the same level of care, and for those undergoing lumpectomy a free bra. The&#xD;
      study aims to evaluate the patients requirements in post-operative lingerie in order to help&#xD;
      and further assiss these women. As this is an area of minimal research. There are no risks&#xD;
      envisaged from participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where is the study run from? The study is ran from The Beacon Hospital, Mater Misericordiae&#xD;
      University Hospital, Mater Private Hospital and St.James's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? The study is planned to&#xD;
      start in November 2015 and is expected to run until December 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who is funding the study? The study is being funded from the Irish Research Council and THEYA&#xD;
      as part of an Employment Based PostGraduate Award.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female over the age of 18 years, with no maximum age limit once all other criteria are&#xD;
             met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a comprehensive understanding and fluency of the English language with the&#xD;
             ability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be scheduled to undergo a mastectomy or lumpectomy for a new first time diagnosis of&#xD;
             breast cancer within a 3 month period of recruitment - as this cohort are the&#xD;
             principal users of post-surgery bras.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No pre-existing severe co-morbidities and / or documented psychological diagnosis i.e.&#xD;
             depression, severe chronic disease - as we do not want to over-burden a person who has&#xD;
             any ailments other than their surgery discomfort. As well as that, the bra is designed&#xD;
             to help recovery from breast surgery, and having further ailments may alter data we&#xD;
             receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be available for the full duration of the study which will be 3 months from&#xD;
             recruitment to post-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Are under the age of 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Do not have intellectual capacity to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Are not scheduled to undergo a mastectomy or lumpectomy within a 3 month period of&#xD;
             recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have pre-existing severe co-morbiditie(s) and / or documented psychological diagnosis,&#xD;
             as the diagnosis of breast cancer is challenging enough and it may exacerbate any&#xD;
             psychological condition, and the researcher would like to avoid any perceived&#xD;
             additional stress for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Those that are not fluent English speakers, grossly hearing or speech impaired.&#xD;
