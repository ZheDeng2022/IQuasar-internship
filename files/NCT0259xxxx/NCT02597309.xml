  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of adding a SGLT-2 inhibitor (namely&#xD;
      Canagliflozin) on the dose of U-500 insulin required to achieve glycemic control in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that adding Canagliflozin to patients treated with U-500&#xD;
      insulin may result in significant reduction in insulin dose due to improved insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and weight loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is one of the main causes of type 2 diabetes. Continuation of insulin&#xD;
      resistance may lead to the failure of multiple oral antihyperglycemic medications in&#xD;
      achieving glycemic control and the further requirement of escalading doses of insulin. On&#xD;
      contrary, reduction of glucose toxicity and weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and may&#xD;
      result in substantial reduction in insulin dose and %A1C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      U-500 insulin is the fastest-growing prescribed insulin in the US due to increased prevalence&#xD;
      of severe obesity and extreme insulin resistance. Patients requiring high insulin doses of&#xD;
      ≥200 units/day are the typical candidates for U-500 insulin. However, patients on such high&#xD;
      doses of insulin rarely achieve target glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are new antihyperglycemic medications&#xD;
      approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Adding a SGLT-2 inhibitors to other&#xD;
      antihyperglycemic medications was shown to reduce glucose toxicity, improve insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and reduce body weight. Consequently, daily insulin dose may be reduced without&#xD;
      compromising glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose transporter subtype 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that was approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in March, 2013. Canagliflozin, at the doses&#xD;
      of 100mg and 300mg daily, improves blood sugar control by a novel mechanism which causes the&#xD;
      kidneys to block reabsorption of about 50-80 grams of glucose. Canagliflozin lowers the renal&#xD;
      threshold for glycosuria and causes excess glucose to be excreted in the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of adding a SGLT-2 inhibitor (namely&#xD;
      Canagliflozin) on the dose of U-500 insulin required to achieve glycemic control in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that adding Canagliflozin to patients treated with U-500&#xD;
      insulin may result in significant reduction in insulin dose due to improved insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Eligible subjects are&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes treated with ≥200 units per day of U-500 insulin with or&#xD;
      without other antihyperglycemic medications. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to one of the following 2 study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Intervention Group: Subjects in this group will take canagliflozin in addition to their&#xD;
      regular U-500 insulin dose and other antihyperglycemic medications. Canagliflozin dose will&#xD;
      be titrated after 2 weeks from 100 mg once daily to 300 mg once daily. This dose will&#xD;
      continue for 22 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Control Group: Subjects in this group will take a matched placebo in addition to their&#xD;
      regular U-500 insulin dose and other antihyperglycemic medications for 2 weeks then another&#xD;
      matched-placebo for 22 weeks.&#xD;
