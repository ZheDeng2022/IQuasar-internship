  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of repeat dosing of JNJ-56021927 on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics for single-dose multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9,&#xD;
      CYP2C19, CYP2C8) and transporter (P-gp and BRCP) substrates in participants with&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study in participants with CRPC. The study will&#xD;
      consist of a Screening Phase to determine eligibility, a Pretreatment Phase, a Treatment&#xD;
      Phase, and a Follow-up Phase. The study is designed to estimate the magnitude of the effects&#xD;
      of JNJ-56021927 on the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates. In vitro studies have indicated&#xD;
      that JNJ-56021927 and its active metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3) have the potential to affect&#xD;
      multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8) and drug&#xD;
      transporters proteins (P-glycoprotein [P-gp] and breast cancer resistance protein [BRCP]) via&#xD;
      inhibition or induction. In human hepatocytes, JNJ 56021927 and JNJ-56142060 (M3) were found&#xD;
      to be inducers of CYP3A4. The induction of CYP3A4 suggests that JNJ-56021927 and M3 will&#xD;
      induce other CYP isozymes and drug transporters (eg, CYP2C and P-gp via activation of&#xD;
      pregnane X receptor). The study is designed to confirm the in vivo significance of these&#xD;
      non-clinical findings.&#xD;
