      Establish electrophysiological benchmarks, using the Diopsys Visual Evoked Potential/ Pattern&#xD;
      ERG (VEP/PERG) protocols of populations with Glaucoma following: 1) Baseline VEP/ERG prior to&#xD;
      treatment; and 2) VEP/PERG after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VEP and PERG have been proven and accepted as a viable clinical tool in the assessment of&#xD;
      diseases of the retina ganglion cells. The Diopsys® Neuro Optic Vision Assessment Vision&#xD;
      (NOVA) Testing System generates a battery of retinal responses evoked by viewing&#xD;
      horizontal/checkerboard grating patterns with optimized contrast levels and visual field&#xD;
      sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrophysiological tests evaluate the function of the different structures constituting the&#xD;
      visual nervous pathways (retina, optic nerve, optic tract, and chiasm, radiation and cerebral&#xD;
      cortex). Among the various electrophysiological examinations, two very important tests are&#xD;
      Electroretinograms (ERGs), which study the various retinal components, and Visual Evoked&#xD;
      Potentials (VEPs) which study the visual pathway. These tests provide objective information&#xD;
      on the function of the visual system even in those cases in which opacities of dioptric means&#xD;
      (cataract, corneal leukoma) do not allow the direct observation of the retina and optic&#xD;
      nerve, and may provide functional information in advance of structural changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maculopathy and neuropathies are included in the long list of diseases of the visual pathway&#xD;
      that permanently impair visual function. As there are considerable evidences related to the&#xD;
      nature and evaluation of maculopathy and glaucomatous neuropathy, objective and reliable&#xD;
      techniques are needed for visual function evaluation. By using PERG recordings, doctors are&#xD;
      able to differentiate between normal subjects and subjects with ocular hypertension&#xD;
      notwithstanding a normal optic disc and VF. PERG can provide important diagnostic information&#xD;
      regarding the functional integrity of the macula and ganglion cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a longitudinal study from Bascom Palmer Eye, abnormal retina function was recorded&#xD;
      by PERG eight years before structural damage to the RNFL was detected. The study suggests&#xD;
      that for glaucoma suspects it takes two years for a 10% change in PERG amplitude while it&#xD;
      takes ten years for 10% change in RNFL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Diopsys® NOVA-pERG is a retinal biopotential that is evoked when a temporally&#xD;
      phase-reversed horizontal/checkerboard grating pattern of constant total luminance is viewed.&#xD;
      The contrast and viewing angle of the stimulus is optimized to elicit detection of&#xD;
      dysfunction of the macula or the retinal ganglion cells selectively. The two NOVA-PERG&#xD;
      reporting protocols are Contrast Sensitivity (CS) and Concentric Stimulus Fields (CSF). CS is&#xD;
      optimized to detect dysfunctions of the retina that are sensitive to discrimination between&#xD;
      different contrast levels while the CSF is optimized to localized pathologies in specific&#xD;
      regions of the retina such as central vision and macula. Currently both protocols utilize&#xD;
      steady-state technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of the Diopsys ERG as compared to traditional PERG is that it is non-invasive&#xD;
      electrodes are attached to the eyelid and not the conjunctiva, and takes ten minutes to&#xD;
      perform instead of 45. Patients do not been to be dark-adapted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEPs will be generated using a commercially available Diopsys NOVA System utilizing a fixed&#xD;
      protocol. The stimulus will be presented on a 17-inch LCD monitor, running at 75 frames/s.&#xD;
      Commercially available skin preparation and EEG paste will be used for recording of the&#xD;
      SD-tVEP. Synchronized single-channel VEPs will be recorded, generating a time series of 1024&#xD;
      data points per analysis window. The room luminance will be maintained at scotopic conditions&#xD;
      (&lt;0.3 NITS). Preadaptation will be unnecessary for the SD-tVEP recordings. Multiple tests are&#xD;
      run to comprise one SD-tVEP protocol. One complete NOVA-VEP (FP) presents a stimulus for a&#xD;
      maximum of 1 minute and 46 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases, the display will be viewed through natural pupils (undilated) with optimal&#xD;
      refractive correction in place. The viewing distance will be set to 1 m, yielding a total&#xD;
      display viewing angle of 15.5 degrees. The square black/white checkerboard pattern reversal&#xD;
      stimulus has a height and width of 27 cm with a red circular ring used as a fixation target.&#xD;
      The diameter of the target is approximately 1.5 cm with a ring thickness of 1.5 mm. The&#xD;
      target ring will be centered on the stimulus. The check size will be 29.0 minutes of arc. Two&#xD;
      pattern contrasts will be used in the study, based on earlier studies that suggested that&#xD;
      differential contrast stimulation could affect the NOVA-VEP (FP) waveforms. The first pattern&#xD;
      will have a Michelson contrast of 15%. The second pattern will have a Michelson contrast of&#xD;
      85%. These two patterns are referred to as LC (Low contrast) and HC (High contrast)&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a recording session, the contrast polarity of each stimulus check will be temporally&#xD;
      modulated at a reversal frequency of 1 Hz (2 pattern reversals equates to 1 reversal cycle);&#xD;
      therefore, each reversal occurs at 2 Hz or twice per second. This stimulus is termed a&#xD;
      pattern reversal stimulus and has a duty cycle of 50%. The 15% and 85% contrast stimuli will&#xD;
      be presented for each eye (the fellow eye was covered) for 15 seconds. The right eye will be&#xD;
      the first one to be tested for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for recording, the skin at each electrode site will be scrubbed with Nuprep&#xD;
      using a cotton gauze pad. Electrodes will be fixed in position with Ten20 conductive paste&#xD;
      and secured with a small gauze pad with conductive paste applied. Electrode impedance will be&#xD;
      maintained below 10 kohm and typically kept below 5 kohm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pattern Electroretinogram (PERG) will be recorded using a commercially available system&#xD;
      Diopsys® NOVA (Diopsys, Inc. Pine Brook, New Jersey). The testing protocol will include the&#xD;
      Concentric Stimulus Field (CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be fitted with the appropriate correction for a viewing distance of 24 inches&#xD;
      and will be instructed to fixate on a target at the center of stimulus monitor. The test will&#xD;
      be performed in a dark room to standardized environment luminance, free of visual and audible&#xD;
      distractions. The subject will be comfortable seated facing the stimulus monitor. The&#xD;
      patient's seated height will be adjusted so the eye stays in a horizontal plane with the&#xD;
      center of the monitor. The test will be performed without pupil dilation and subjects will be&#xD;
      allowed to blink freely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PERG will be recorded from the study eye by means of hypoallergenic skin sensors&#xD;
      Silver/Silver Chloride ink (Diopsys® proprietary Skin Sensor) on the lower eyelids. The&#xD;
      reference sensor will be located in the contralateral eyelid and ground sensor in the central&#xD;
      forehead area (Fz). The skin will be prepared by cleaning with eyelid cleanser (OCuSOFT®) to&#xD;
      ensure good and stable electrical conductivity, keeping the impedances bellow 5 kohm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulus will be presented on a gamma corrected Acer V173BM 17-inch LCD monitor, having a&#xD;
      refresh rate of 75 frames / second. The CSF pattern stimulus will consist of black/white&#xD;
      horizontal gratings (24° and 16° circular field, 98% contrast and 102.28 candelas/m2 mean&#xD;
      luminance), reversing at 15 reversals/second) with a duration of 25 seconds. A red spinning&#xD;
      ring will be used as a fixation target with a diameter of 1 cm and 1 mm of thickness. This&#xD;
      target ring will be at the corner of four checks, centered on the stimulus field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A test will be categorized as non-reliable if Phase Variance is greater than 0.4 and/or if&#xD;
      the Magnitude Variance to Magnitude Ratio (VMR) is greater than 2.9 and/or if more than 4&#xD;
      artifacts are detected. The FERG test results will be saved in an SQL database and presented&#xD;
      in a report form to be used for analysis.&#xD;
