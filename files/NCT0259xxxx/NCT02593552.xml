      This pilot study was done to assess the feasibility and possible efficacy of a video feedback&#xD;
      intervention to improve the safety of cognitively impaired older drivers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this pilot study were to demonstrate that 1) g-force technology can effectively&#xD;
      detect unsafe driving events by older adults, and 2) cognitively impaired older adults can&#xD;
      improve their driving safety with an in-car video feedback intervention. Unsafe driving&#xD;
      events were triggered by g-forces leading to capture of a video record that was then&#xD;
      transmitted wirelessly to a remote office where the events were analyzed and scored. During&#xD;
      the baseline phase (3 months), there was no feedback. During the intervention phase (4-6&#xD;
      months), participants received a weekly progress report in the mail along with DVD of&#xD;
      recorded unsafe driving events with recommendations. The research team then contacted the&#xD;
      participant and informant weekly to provide additional coaching, and verify that participants&#xD;
      reviewed the information and videos. During the post-intervention monitoring phase (7-9&#xD;
      months), there was no further feedback. The primary quantitative outcomes were total number&#xD;
      of unsafe driving events/1,000 miles and total safety driving score/1,000 miles. Secondary&#xD;
      qualitative outcomes included the types and severity of unsafe driving events that were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
