  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Socioemotional processing dysfunctions (i.e., disruptions in affective, cognitive, and neural&#xD;
      processes that encode, interpret, and respond to socially and emotionally relevant stimuli)&#xD;
      have been implicated in tobacco smoking and relapse, however this potential target for&#xD;
      medication development has not been systematically examined. Evidence from animal and human&#xD;
      laboratories indicate that administration of intranasal oxytocin enhances socioemotional&#xD;
      processing and may be efficacious for the treatment of drug addiction, including nicotine&#xD;
      dependence. In order to evaluate the potential efficacy of intranasal oxytocin for smoking&#xD;
      cessation, this laboratory-based proposal will examine whether intranasal oxytocin attenuates&#xD;
      smoking lapse, nicotine withdrawal, and socioemotional processing disruptions in regular&#xD;
      smokers following overnight abstinence.&#xD;

    <measure>Smoking Lapse Analogue Task (Delay Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 hours after nasal spray administration</time_frame>
    <description>This task measures ability to resist the temptation to initiate smoking under conditions in which it is advantageous to remain abstinent. The &quot;delay score&quot; is the number of minutes before participants begin smoking (minimum = 0 minutes to maximum = 50 minutes). A higher number is better.</description>

    <measure>Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes before nasal spray, and 30, 60, and 90 minutes after nasal spray</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU) is a 10-item self-report questionnaire measures desire, intention, urge, and need to smoke. The QSU was assessed 30 minutes before the nasal spray, and again 30, 60, and 90 minutes after the nasal spray during each session. Scores at each assessment time are calculated as the mean of all 10 items (minimum = 0 to maximum = 5). Each session's scores are then calculated as the mean scores of post-spray assessments. A lower score is better.</description>

    <description>Systolic blood pressure (SP) was assessed 30 minutes before the nasal spray, and again 30, 60, and 90 minutes after the nasal spray during each session. Each session's values are calculated as the mean of post-spray assessments.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes before nasal spray, and 30, 60, and 90 minutes after nasal spray</time_frame>
    <description>Diastolic blood pressure (DP) was assessed 30 minutes before the nasal spray, and again 30, 60, and 90 minutes after the nasal spray during each session. Each session's values are calculated as the mean of post-spray assessments.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate (Bpm)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes before nasal spray, and 30, 60, and 90 minutes after nasal spray</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate (HR) was assessed 30 minutes before the nasal spray, and again 30, 60, and 90 minutes after the nasal spray during each session. Each session's values are calculated as the mean of post-spray assessments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Profile of Mood States (Anxious Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes before nasal spray, and 30, 60, and 90 minutes after nasal spray</time_frame>
    <description>The Profile of Mood States (POMS) lists 72 affective adjectives that are rated on 0 to 4-point. The main measure for this study is the Anxious scale, calculated as the mean of 6 anxiety-related items. The POMS was assessed 30 minutes before the nasal spray, and again 30, 60, and 90 minutes after the nasal spray during each session. Each session's scores are calculated as the mean scores of post-spray assessments. Lower scores are better.</description>

        <title>Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU)</title>
        <description>The Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU) is a 10-item self-report questionnaire measures desire, intention, urge, and need to smoke. The QSU was assessed 30 minutes before the nasal spray, and again 30, 60, and 90 minutes after the nasal spray during each session. Scores at each assessment time are calculated as the mean of all 10 items (minimum = 0 to maximum = 5). Each session's scores are then calculated as the mean scores of post-spray assessments. A lower score is better.</description>

        <title>Profile of Mood States (Anxious Scale)</title>
        <description>The Profile of Mood States (POMS) lists 72 affective adjectives that are rated on 0 to 4-point. The main measure for this study is the Anxious scale, calculated as the mean of 6 anxiety-related items. The POMS was assessed 30 minutes before the nasal spray, and again 30, 60, and 90 minutes after the nasal spray during each session. Each session's scores are calculated as the mean scores of post-spray assessments. Lower scores are better.</description>

            <description>Participants received a single 40 IU dose of Pitocin (oxytocin, USP; concentration = 10 IU/1 mL; PAR Pharmaceuticals, NY, USA) during the first or second experimental session. The second experimental session was completed at least 72 hours after the first.
