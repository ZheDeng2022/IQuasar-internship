  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infrared meibography is a useful technique in the evaluation of meibomian gland disease&#xD;
      (MGD). MGD is a major cause of dry eye symptoms, affecting a large number of patients seen in&#xD;
      the Corneo-Plastic Unit (CPU). Many parameters have been used to evaluate MGD including tear&#xD;
      film break-up time, lid margin abnormalities, and Schirmer tear test values. Direct&#xD;
      visualization of meibomian glands by infrared meibography has been shown to correlate well&#xD;
      with these parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although infrared meibography was developed more than 30 years ago, it is not widely used.&#xD;
      This has probably been due to the need for special equipment, examiner time and expertise and&#xD;
      patient discomfort during the examination. Analysis of the acquired images also needed to be&#xD;
      from video review with extraction of video stills - a time-consuming process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to pilot a rapid non-contact (non-painful) method of obtaining infrared&#xD;
      images of meibomian glands using equipment already available at QVH. This pilot study will&#xD;
      validate the technique and check patient acceptability. Investigators are hopeful this test&#xD;
      could be used as a useful tool for future research into dry eye conditions and MGD.&#xD;

      Patients will receive a patient information sheet in the post with their Eye Clinic&#xD;
      appointment letter. To be clear, the points listed below would form the standard of care for&#xD;
      a dry eye patient attending the clinic, apart from the additional infrared photographic image&#xD;
      taken for the study (point 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Consultation room, the study will be explained to participants by one of the&#xD;
      investigators. If they agree to participate, a consent form will be signed by the participant&#xD;
      and an investigator. They will be questioned regarding the absence or presence of ocular&#xD;
      symptoms using a previously validated and accepted scoring scale (Ocular Surface Disease&#xD;
      Index - OSDI). This questionnaire will allow patients to score their degree of dry eye&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Schirmers tear test of production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical slit lamp examination to look for abnormalities of the upper and lower lid&#xD;
           margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fluorescein staining of the ocular surface (divided into 3 zones comprising nasal&#xD;
           conjunctival, corneal, and temporal conjunctival areas).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Observation of tear film break-up time (TBUT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Digital pressure was applied to the upper tarsus, and the degree of ease with which&#xD;
           meibomian secretion (meibum) is induced, evaluated semi-quantitatively. Eversion of&#xD;
           upper and lower eyelids in the clinic is part of the standard ocular examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In the photography department, the upper and lower eyelids will then be everted and&#xD;
           non-contact infrared photographs taken. Partial or complete loss of Meibomian glands&#xD;
           will be scored according to the meiboscore for each eyelid. After the image is taken,&#xD;
           patient experience will be gathered on a five-point Lickert scale score sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures To examine for a correlation between morphologic changes in meibomian glands&#xD;
      visible on infrared photography and both clinical examination findings and questionnaire&#xD;
      scores regarding eyelid and tear film function in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess patient experience and acceptability of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Selection and withdrawal of Subjects 4.1 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending the CPU will be offered the opportunity to take part if they comply with&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to give their informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients under the age of 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poor understanding of language&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ocular allergies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of contact lens wear&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of eye or eyelid surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic or ocular diseases that may interfere with tear film production or function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of systemic medication with tetracycline derivatives, antihistamines, isotretinoin,&#xD;
           or nutritional supplements for MGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of topical ciclosporin-A or steroids beginning within the last month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refusal for patient's own GP to be informed of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Treatment of subjects Participants will undergo the standard of care in the&#xD;
      Corneo-Plastic Unit, but will also be examined and photographed by the infrared technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Assessment of Efficacy Through the assessment described above, a statistical analysis&#xD;
      between OSDI score, ocular surface and Meibomian gland score will be possible. We will&#xD;
      analyse the findings to see if there is any relationship between the patient symptoms and&#xD;
      level of Meibomian gland dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 Assessment of Safety Any side effects reported by the patient and/or observed by the&#xD;
      clinician will be recorded. Data regarding patient experience of the test will also be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;

    <description>To examine for a correlation between morphologic changes in meibomian glands visible on infrared photography and both clinical examination findings and questionnaire scores regarding eyelid and tear film function in the population. Schirmer 1 Tear Test A Schirmer 1 test evaluates baseline secretion.&#xD;
0.5% proxymetacaine eye drops are administered to achieve topical anaesthesia.&#xD;
Schirmer strips are then inserted into the lower conjunctival sac at the junction of the lateral and middle thirds, avoiding corneal touch.&#xD;
All patients are seated at rest with their eyes closed.&#xD;
The length of wetting strips in millimeters is recorded after 5 minutes.&#xD;
The Schirmer Test is interpreted after 5 minutes as follows:&#xD;
Normal aqueous tear production is supported by measurements of &gt; 15 mm.&#xD;
Mild-moderate reduction of aqueous production: 5mm-14mm.&#xD;
Severe dryness due to reduced tear production is &lt; 5mm.</description>
