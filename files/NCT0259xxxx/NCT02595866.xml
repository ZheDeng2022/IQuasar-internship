    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab in treating patients with human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malignant neoplasms that have come back (relapsed), do not&#xD;
      respond to treatment (refractory), or have distributed over a large area in the body&#xD;
      (disseminated). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in HIV-infected patients&#xD;
      on effective antiretroviral therapy and with relapsed/refractory or disseminated acquired&#xD;
      immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining or non-AIDS defining malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety and feasibility of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) administration as first&#xD;
      systemic therapy for HIV associated Kaposi sarcoma in patients on effective antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary insights into clinical benefit (e.g., tumor shrinkage or&#xD;
      stabilization &gt;= 24 weeks) across a variety of tumors in patients infected with HIV and on&#xD;
      effective antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the response rate in Kaposi sarcoma impacting physical and/or psychological&#xD;
      wellbeing and not amenable to local therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the correlation of pre-therapy tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)&#xD;
      expression and T-cell infiltration on clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on circulating HIV and the HIV viral&#xD;
      reservoir in patients on effective combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART), as measured by&#xD;
      plasma HIV single copy ribonucleic acid (RNA), cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ T-cell&#xD;
      associated HIV unspliced RNA, CD4+ T-cell associated integrated HIV deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) provirus, ratio of HIV unspliced RNA/DNA, &quot;Tat/Rev induced limiting dilution assay&quot;&#xD;
      (TILDA), and phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 molecular evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on host gene expression in circulating&#xD;
      blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on circulating HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell&#xD;
      cytotoxicity against autologous HIV infected CD4+ T-cells in patients on effective&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on circulating lymphocyte and monocyte&#xD;
      numbers and phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess biopsied tumors from participants that progress by immunohistochemistry arrays&#xD;
      and gene expression analysis to evaluate potential reasons for the lack of response to&#xD;
      MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) or progression such as a lack of T cells within or around tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate the effect of pembrolizumab on Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)&#xD;
      viral load in the blood, KSHV seroreactivity and KSHV specific CD8+ T-cell activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients continue&#xD;
      receiving their recommended combination antiretroviral therapy orally daily. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

             baseline or grade =&lt; 1 at enrollment (with the exception of alopecia), neuropathy, and&#xD;
             ototoxicity (i.e., AEs that are not expected to improve within the washout period)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On an effective combination cART regimen, generally a 3-drug regimen based on&#xD;
             Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) treatment guidelines&#xD;

                  below&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: if cART is modified during the screening period, patients must be on an&#xD;
                  effective new regimen for &gt;= 2 weeks and otherwise meet eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Most patients have viral loads that are suppressible to &lt; 50 copies/mL, but about&#xD;
                  25% of patients will occasionally have blips up to 400-500 copies/mL, which do&#xD;
                  not appear to correlate with lack of viral suppression in most studies; thus, an&#xD;
                  HIV viral load of =&lt; 400 copies/mL for an occasional &quot;blip&quot; will be allowed, if&#xD;
                  there is documentation of an HIV viral load &lt; 200 on the same regimen and no&#xD;

                  applied to all patients, except the following: the grade of any abnormal&#xD;
                  laboratory (lab) value allowed by the protocol principal investigator (P.I.) at&#xD;
                  enrollment will be considered the patient's baseline for potentially resuming&#xD;
                  therapy after modification/holding of therapy when off treatment criteria are&#xD;
                  applied&#xD;

             creatinine or CrCl) &gt;= 30 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 2.5 X&#xD;
             institutional ULN&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 72 hours before receiving the first dose of study medication; if the&#xD;
             urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will&#xD;
             be required&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: the effects of MK-3475 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this&#xD;
                  reason and because anti-PD-1 agents may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
                  potential must agree to use 2 methods of birth control, or be surgically sterile,&#xD;
                  or abstain from heterosexual activity beginning with the screening visit and for&#xD;
                  the duration of study participation, through 120 days beyond last dose of MK-3475&#xD;
