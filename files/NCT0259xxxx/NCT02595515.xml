  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infantile colic is condition that affects more than 10% of babies and their families. The&#xD;
      reason, and hence proper treatment, for this condition is unknown and many causes have been&#xD;
      suggested. One of the treatments that parents choose is chiropractic manipulation. In&#xD;
      Denmark, almost 10,000 babies are each year treated by chiropractors, and a high proportion&#xD;
      is due to colic. However, the effect of chiropractic treatment of infantile colic has not&#xD;
      been properly scientifically evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of chiropractic treatment on infantile colic needs to be investigated, since this&#xD;
      is a very common disorder with no known effective treatment, but with good empirical evidence&#xD;
      of the value of chiropractic treatment. Although it is usually considered to be a benign and&#xD;
      self-limiting condition, some studies suggest there might be long-term effects in terms of&#xD;
      psychomotor problems. In worst case, the infants' crying may also lead to violence and&#xD;
      'shaken baby syndrome'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: There is no effect of chiropractic treatment on the course of infantile&#xD;
      colic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a controlled, clinical trial where infants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      for colic will be randomized into two groups. One group will receive treatment and the other&#xD;
      won't. This will determine the overall effect and furthermore, subgroup analyses will be&#xD;
      performed to identify possible subgroups of infants, who will benefit the most from the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To investigate the effect of chiropractic treatment on infantile colic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: to investigate if infants with suspected musculoskeletal problems respond&#xD;
      differently to the treatment than those without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled single blind multicenter clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is to be carried out on the island of Funen, Denmark. Recruitment of babies with&#xD;
      symptoms of infantile colic is based on contact by the parents of the babies to the project&#xD;
      manager. Information about the existence of the study is given to health visitors, general&#xD;
      practitioners, midwifes and to women who have given birth on the maternity ward in the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Odense. For infants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for colic the&#xD;
      parents will register amount of crying using a valid instrument for at least three days&#xD;
      before the first visit at the chiropractor Clinic (baseline registration). The babies will be&#xD;
      randomized to chiropractic treatment or no treatment. The parents will be unaware of the&#xD;
      child's allocation. All children have four visits during two weeks at the chiropractor. All&#xD;
      children will be taken to the chiropractor's treatment room, while the parents stay in the&#xD;
      reception areas. Before treatment, the chiropractors will note, whether they suspect&#xD;
      musculoskeletal involvement or not. The parents register the amount of crying continuously&#xD;
      during the two weeks and up to and including three days after the fourth visit. Three days&#xD;
      after the the fourth visit, the parents are informed by the chiropractor about the child's&#xD;
      allocation. Children in the control group will afterwards have the opportunity to have four&#xD;
      free visits with chiropractic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parents will be asked to give consent that the medical journal regarding pregnancy and&#xD;
      birth is reviewed in order to obtain information on specific measures (e.g. duration of&#xD;
      pregnancy, duration of labor, delivery presentation, vacuum extractor delivery or caesarean&#xD;
      section). Subgroup analyses will be performed to investigate associations with symptoms of&#xD;
      colic and suspected musculoskeletal involvement. All analyses will be adjusted for known&#xD;
      confounders, registered by the project manager at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERSPECTIVE FOR HEALTHCARE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of all, the study will evaluate the effect of chiropractic treatment of infantile&#xD;
      colic. Secondly, it will clarify if the treatment effect differs between children with&#xD;
      suspected musculoskeletal involvement and those without.&#xD;
