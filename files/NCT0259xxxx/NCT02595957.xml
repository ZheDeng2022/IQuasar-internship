      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genes are the instructions a person s body uses to function. Genome sequencing is a new way&#xD;
      to look at genes that your main research team is using to learn the causes of the condition&#xD;
      they are studying. When a new cause is found this way, it is called a primary variant. Each&#xD;
      person has many variants. Most do not cause disease. Sequencing can also find secondary&#xD;
      variants. These are not related to the condition your main research team is studying, but may&#xD;
      show a person to be at high risk for cancer or another condition. Researchers want to learn&#xD;
      more about what it means to have a secondary variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find new gene changes that lead to certain medical conditions. To better understand the&#xD;
      causes of certain diseases. To learn about how people understand their genetic test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with rare diseases who have already consented to and enrolled in another protocol run&#xD;
      by a group other than the National Human Genome Research Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA samples that were already collected will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to send in a second DNA sample (blood or saliva). These will be&#xD;
      used to verify any findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a primary variant for the participant s health condition is found through genome&#xD;
      sequencing, this will be shared with the participant by their primary research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant has a secondary finding, it will be shared by phone call or&#xD;
      videoconference by this research group in the National Human Genome Research Institute. Some&#xD;
      participants may get their results in person at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months after getting their secondary findings, participants will do an online survey&#xD;
      and phone interview. They will be asked about how they have used the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people who do not receive a secondary finding from genome sequencing will be asked to do&#xD;
      an online survey three months after the get that result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have a secondary finding can get genetic counseling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The implementation of genome and exome sequencing creates challenges and opportunities,&#xD;
      particularly with respect to the return of medically-actionable secondary findings (SF). This&#xD;
      study seeks to investigate the utility and effectiveness of returning SF generated via&#xD;
      research or clinical sequencing by studying individuals who have received such findings. Our&#xD;
      objectives with this protocol have evolved over time and have been substantially informed by&#xD;
      our experiences in returning SF through sequencing initiatives such as the ClinSeq study, the&#xD;
      Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity (CCGO), and the Secondary Genomic Findings Service&#xD;
      (SGFS). Our work with these studies/initiatives suggests that much remains unknown about how&#xD;
      recipients of SF understand these findings, communicate them to their health professionals&#xD;
      and families, and whether they adhere to recommended health-preserving actions in both the&#xD;
      short and long-term. As well, recipients of SF are an unselected population in which to&#xD;
      investigate penetrance of disorders associated with SF genes. Thus, this protocol aims to&#xD;
      explore important questions of clinical utility associated with SF return and penetrance of&#xD;
      SF-related disorders. Healthcare actions and family communication (clinical utility) are&#xD;
      assessed by interviews and surveys with SF recipients. This protocol also includes a pilot&#xD;
      program in which selected participants will be invited to the NIH for bespoke phenotyping to&#xD;
      uncover the presence of disease and explore avenues to develop interventions to enhance&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any English- or Spanish-speaking recipient of a SF. The circumstances under which SF&#xD;
             are generated (either clinically or as part of research studies) indicate that these&#xD;
             individuals may represent a wide range of ages of patients, children and&#xD;
&#xD;
        adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For minors or decisionally-impaired adults, one parent/guardian, typically the self&#xD;
             designated primary health care support parent, will be enrolled. If the parents claim&#xD;
             equal roles, whichever of the parents selects to participate in the interview/survey&#xD;
             will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is important to emphasize that we will not ask minors or decisionally impaired&#xD;
             adults to participate in the social and behavioral components of the study. Because&#xD;
             validated instruments for our surveys largely do not exist in languages other than&#xD;
             English, we cannot administer these measures to non-English speakers.&#xD;
