    <textblock>
      Autism is a disorder characterized by social deficits, and among others by changes in&#xD;
      communication. The diagnosis of this disorder remains accomplished by direct assessment the&#xD;
      individual's behavior, according to specific clinical criteria present the classification&#xD;
      systems of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV).&#xD;
      Therapists teach autistic to communicate with the help of symbols and auxiliary anticipation&#xD;
      and communication routines, usually using the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS),&#xD;
      or photos. However these are presented in transition PECS cards and do not follow the&#xD;
      children in activities that develop outside the school environment. The objective of this&#xD;
      work is to develop an application to run on a mobile device Android tablet that features the&#xD;
      visual routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way the routines can be accessed outside the school environment. This technology is&#xD;
      easy to use and facilitates data entry by touching the screen, was developed using the&#xD;
      Unified Modeling Language (UML), Javascript, Apache Web server and Web browser Chrome. The&#xD;
      application validation, will be held with 10 autistic and 2 teachers from the center of&#xD;
      inclusion and support for autistic. Teachers should insert the activities programmed for each&#xD;
      autistic student. Tablet in student performance in communicating with this tablet will be&#xD;
      measured. Parents or guardians knowledge with the PECS system will be trained and will be&#xD;
      evaluated on their autonomy inserting images, audio and subtitles. The application should aid&#xD;
      communication, cause the autistic understand the sequence of events in daily life, decreasing&#xD;
      their aggression because of not knowing what will be their next activity. Participation in&#xD;
      this research poses no risk or harm the concerned person. If during the research participant&#xD;
      decides not anymore have the freedom to do so without incurring any damage you. The technical&#xD;
      validation proposal is necessary for it to be used by people with autism. If validated in a&#xD;
      positive way, the technique could improve the quality of life of these people and their&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
