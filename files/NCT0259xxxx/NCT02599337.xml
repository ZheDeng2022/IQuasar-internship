    <measure>Assessment of the bioequivalence of sorafenib tablet (Test)and Nexavar(Reference), on day 4.</measure>
    <time_frame>96 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the rate and extent of absorption of sorafenib 200 mg tablet (Test) versus Nexavar (Reference), administered as 1 x 200 mg tablet under fasting conditions. Evaluate whether has the bioequivalence between the Test and the Reference.Criteria as follows: for a primary parameter (AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, or Cmax), if&#xD;
the point estimate of the Test-to-Reference ratio must be within 80.00% 125.00%, and&#xD;
the 95% upper confidence bound for the scaled average bioequivalence criterion must be equal to or less than zero (≤0) to conclude in favor of BE for that parameter.</description>
