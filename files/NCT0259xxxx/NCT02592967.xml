  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JNJ-64041757&#xD;
      a live attenuated double deleted (LADD) Listeria monocytogenes (bacteria in which two&#xD;
      virulence genes, which encode molecules that help cause disease, have been removed) when&#xD;
      administered intravenously to participants with advanced (Stage IIIb) or metastatic (Stage&#xD;
      IV) NSCLC (adenocarcinoma).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, multicenter and 2-part study in&#xD;
      participants with advanced (Stage IIIb) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) (adenocarcinoma). Part 1 of study will be Dose Escalation phase to determine the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on safety and pharmacodynamic assessments and Part 2&#xD;
      will be Dose Expansion Phase to evaluate 2 expansion cohorts (Cohort 2A and 2B) after the&#xD;
      RP2D for JNJ-64041757 is determined in Part 1. The study will consist of a Screening Period&#xD;
      (from signing of informed consent until immediately before the first dose), an open-label&#xD;
      Treatment Period (from the first dose of study drug until the End-of-Treatment Visit); and a&#xD;
      Post treatment Follow-up Period (after the End-of Treatment Visit until study&#xD;
      discontinuation). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in part 1, antigen-specific T-cell response in&#xD;
      part 2 and incidence of adverse events in both the parts will be primarily evaluated.&#xD;
