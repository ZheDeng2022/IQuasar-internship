      Obesity has become one of the most common risk factors in obstetric practice with serious&#xD;
      anaesthetic implications. Obese pregnants have limited physiological reserves and&#xD;
      cardiovascular co- morbidities when compared to non-obese pregnant women. Spinal anaesthesia&#xD;
      is the anaesthetic technique of choice for caesarean section. The haemodynamic changes&#xD;
      associated with spinal anaesthesia pose the greatest hazard to the mother and the foetus and&#xD;
      are exaggerated in obese pregnant women. However differences in the changes in haemodynamic&#xD;
      variables such as cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and systemic vascular resistance&#xD;
      (SVR) between obese and non-obese pregnant women having caesarean section (CS) under spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia have not been studied before. This study compares the haemodynamic changes after&#xD;
      spinal anaesthesia for CS in non-obese and obese parturients in a single centre, prospective&#xD;
      case control study, using LiDCOrapidV2. This LiDCOrapidV2 device is a noninvasive method of&#xD;
      measuring haemodynamic variables. It is a single centre, prospective, case control study. The&#xD;
      primary outcome compares the differences and variability in CO, SV and SVR between obese and&#xD;
      non-obese parturients. The secondary outcomes include comparison of the correlation between&#xD;
      changes in blood pressure (BP) and CO in each patient and the difference in BP between&#xD;
      conventional intermittent oscillometric device and continuous LiDCORapidV2in each patient&#xD;
      with a view to assess the need for measurement of cardiac output in obstetric anaesthesia&#xD;

      Pregnancy is a state of physiological alteration as a result of increased oxygen demand and&#xD;
      involves significant haemodynamic changes including sustained rises in cardiac output (CO)&#xD;
      (by up to 30- 60%) and stroke volume (SV) (up to 30%) by virtue of increase in the blood&#xD;
      volume This is associated with decrease in the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and&#xD;
      enhanced myocardial performance. When pregnancy is associated with obesity the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system is further stressed. Obese pregnant women with a body mass index (BMI) more than&#xD;
      35kg/m2 pose significant health issue and are at risk for anaesthesia related maternal&#xD;
      mortality. Several cases of sudden cardiac arrests of unexplained cause in obese pregnants&#xD;
      have been reported. Obesity induced pathological changes have profound effects on cardiac&#xD;
      endothelial and vascular function. Thus in pregnancy, obesity leads to further increase in&#xD;
      blood volume and cardiac output proportionate to the amount of fat thus causing further&#xD;
      volume overload of the heart. A study conducted with transthoracic echo showed a mean&#xD;
      increase of around 550mls in cardiac output between obese and non-obese parturients in the&#xD;
      third trimester. In contrast to the decrease in SVR that occurs in normal pregnancy, obesity&#xD;
      by itself is associated with increased SVR by virtue of the increased sympathetic activity&#xD;
      due to the effects of hormones including leptin, insulin and inflammatory mediators. This&#xD;
      causes an increase in afterload 6, 8 thus offsetting the advantage of reduced afterload of&#xD;
      normal pregnancy affecting the CO further. This combination of volume and pressure overload&#xD;
      leads to systolic dysfunction. Furthermore the increase in heart rate of pregnancy in line&#xD;
      with elevated cardiac output will decrease the diastolic interval and time for myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion causing diastolic dysfunction. Thus obese pregnant patients may present with a&#xD;
      systolic, diastolic or both systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle.&#xD;
      Associated obstructive sleep apneoa (OSA) and pulmonary hypertension may lead to right&#xD;
      ventricular failure. These changes are further compromised in the third trimester due to&#xD;
      aortocaval compression thus reducing cardiac output and placental perfusion. The large&#xD;
      abdominal panniculus in obesity will further add to the uterine and vascular compression. It&#xD;
      is thus evident that obese parturient women pose an increase in risk for cardiovascular&#xD;
      compromise. As obesity is considered a global health care problem especially in women,&#xD;
      anaesthetists are increasingly faced with the care of this high risk group of&#xD;
      patients.9However there is paucity of evidence to quantify this cardiovascular compromise on&#xD;
      obese pregnant women and guide provision of best care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anaesthesia has been the preferred technique of anaesthesia, especially in obese&#xD;
      pregnant patients. Induction of spinal anaesthesia will cause profound haemodynamic changes&#xD;
      that represent the greatest hazard to the mother and the foetus. Evidence suggests these&#xD;
      haemodynamic changes are common after spinal anaesthesia and results in hypotension causing&#xD;
      unconsciousness, maternal nausea and vomiting, dizziness including deleterious effects on the&#xD;
      foetus like neonatal acidaemia and lower APGAR score. However because of the changes in&#xD;
      peripheral vascular resistance, changes in maternal arterial pressure do not necessarily&#xD;
      reflect changes in maternal cardiac output. These changes in cardiac output and associated&#xD;
      oxygen delivery pose the greatest risk to the foetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent review of cardiovascular alterations in the parturient undergoing caesarean delivery&#xD;
      with neuraxial anaesthesia showed that induction of spinal anaesthesia will lead to decrease&#xD;
      in CO by 10-35% as measured by various invasive techniques. Although the patho-physiology of&#xD;
      pregnancy and obesity and echocardiography findings gives us an understanding that these&#xD;
      patients are more prone for severe hypotension and cardiovascular compromise the extent of&#xD;
      alteration of haemodynamic variables in obese pregnant patients during spinal anaesthesia has&#xD;
      not been studied previously. Our primary aim therefore is to investigate the haemodynamic&#xD;
      alterations in obese parturient during spinal anaesthesia and compare it with those in&#xD;
      non-obese parturient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally clinicians and researchers have used heart rate (HR)and BP as surrogate markers&#xD;
      of cardiac output during spinal anaesthesia. Managing maternal BP was considered as safe&#xD;
      optimization of foetal wellbeing. Recent publications have emphasized that keeping BP at&#xD;
      baseline is not an optimal strategy and maintaining CO is superior in maintaining uterine&#xD;
      blood flow. In addition the correlation of the foetal compromise in the form of umbilical&#xD;
      artery pH and umbilical artery pulsatality index was better related to SV and CO than BP and&#xD;
      heart rate. 19 Thus measurement of CO is considered a better approach than BP in optimising&#xD;
      oxygen delivery to the foetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although pulmonary artery catheterization is a gold standard for measuring cardiac output it&#xD;
      is not desirable to use routinely because of its invasiveness, patient compliance and its&#xD;
      potential complications. Minimally invasive CO monitors like LiDCO plus has been validated&#xD;
      and successfully used for this purpose, but still require an arterial line and is complex for&#xD;
      routine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LiDCOrapidV2(LiDCO Group plc, LiDCO Limited, United Kingdom), incorporates the CNAPTM&#xD;
      (continuous noninvasive arterial pressure) module that derives CO, SV, and SVR from a&#xD;
      continuous noninvasive arterial waveform and analysed by the PulseCOTM algorithm avoiding&#xD;
      invasive blood pressure measurements. This study studies the clinical application of the&#xD;
      LIDCOrapidV2 and compares the haemodynamic variables in obese and non-obese pregnant women&#xD;
      having CS under spinal anaesthesia.&#xD;
