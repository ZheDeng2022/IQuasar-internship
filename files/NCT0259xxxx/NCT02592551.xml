  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether MEDI4736 or combination therapy with&#xD;
      MEDI4736 + tremelimumab are associated with favorable alterations of the intratumoral&#xD;
      immunologic environment in subjects undergoing resectional surgery for Malignant Pleural&#xD;
      Mesothelioma MPM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with MPM will undergo surgical mediastinal lymph node biopsy (cervical&#xD;
      mediastinoscopy) and simultaneous surgical biopsy of the pleural tumor by thoracoscopy, at&#xD;
      which time tumor tissue (at least 2 g) and peripheral blood will be collected for the study.&#xD;
      These procedures are performed as standard of care in the treatment of these subjects. The&#xD;
      subject will be randomized. Three days to three weeks after the biopsy, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly treated with either MEDI-4736 (15 mg/kg once intravenously) or MEDI-4736 (1500 mg&#xD;
      once intravenously) plus tremelimumab (75 mg once intravenously) or a control group in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled study design. There will be two treatment arms (MEDI4736 only and&#xD;
      combination MEDI4736+tremelimumab) and one untreated arm (control). Randomization, stratified&#xD;
      by receiving previous chemotherapy or not, will be performed and will help to minimize&#xD;
      patient selection biases between three arms. Subjects under 30 kg will be treated with&#xD;
      weight-based dosing for both MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab combination therapy. These patients&#xD;
      are excluded from fixed based dosing to limit endotoxin exposure from the drug preparations.&#xD;
      One to six weeks after the infusion, subjects will undergo resectional surgery, including&#xD;
      extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) or pleurectomy/decortication (P/D), at which time the tumor&#xD;
      will be removed (typically 200-1000 g) and obtained for study. Four patients that do not&#xD;
      undergo treatment with MEDI-4736 or tremelimumab will be included as controls. Blood will be&#xD;
      obtained after the induction of general anesthesia for both the thoracoscopy procedure and&#xD;
      the EPP or P/D resectional procedure, as is routinely done in these procedures. The sixth rib&#xD;
      will be obtained at the time of the resection. After the removal of the tumor, standard&#xD;
      protocol includes intraoperative heated chemotherapy using a lavage of intracavitary&#xD;
      cisplatin in the presence of conserved renal function (Sugarbaker et al., 2013, 2014;&#xD;
      Richards et al., 2006).&#xD;
