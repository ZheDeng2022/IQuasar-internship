  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication adherence is defined as the extent to which a patient takes his or her medication&#xD;
      as prescribed by their healthcare provider. One third to one half of all patients in the&#xD;
      United States do not take their medication as directed, resulting in nearly $100B in&#xD;
      avoidable hospital costs per year. Recent efforts to improve medication adherence in patients&#xD;
      with multiple comorbidities have turned to case management and disease management programs.&#xD;
      Connected monitoring devices offer an alternative- or supplement- to frequent nurse visits&#xD;
      and outreach. These devices enable frequent monitoring and intervention but can also generate&#xD;
      large volumes of data that can be difficult for care teams to manage. The present study&#xD;
      explores the use of one such device- a technology-enabled, connected pillbox. Given the&#xD;
      continued emphasis on bending the cost curve in US healthcare, clinical validation of tools&#xD;
      that may improve the management of costly chronic diseases, such as diabetes, is essential.&#xD;

      Randomized Control Trial Patients in the research treatment group receive pre-filled, 3x7&#xD;
      disposable trays that separate their medication by dose and time (e.g. morning, afternoon,&#xD;
      evening). These pre-filled trays are inserted into a connected, weekly pillbox that detects&#xD;
      when pills are removed from its wells. Using this information, TowerView Health system is&#xD;
      able to send automated text messages or phone reminders to patients to take forgotten or&#xD;
      ignored medication doses. Medication adherence data from deployed pillboxes populates a&#xD;
      software platform, which a research coordinator can access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who miss 3 consecutive doses or 5 doses out of 12 over a 4-day period trigger an&#xD;
      alert for the study research coordinator who can contact the patient via phone call. The&#xD;
      research coordinator follows a scripted motivational interview in his or her outreach to&#xD;
      determine the etiology of non-adherence. Patients reporting worrisome symptoms will be&#xD;
      instructed to contact their provider directly and/or go to the emergency room for immediate&#xD;
      attention. The investigator acknowledges that the current study actually involves multiple&#xD;
      interventions: 1. The pre-filled medication trays are provided by a pharmacist, which&#xD;
      overcomes medication access issues as well as the inconvenience of manually organizing&#xD;
      medications. 2. The electronic pillbox, which monitors adherence that triggers text message&#xD;
      or phone reminders in instances where patients forget or ignore medication doses 3. Research&#xD;
      coordinator alerts, which trigger outreach events that employ a motivational interview in&#xD;
      order to improve patient adherence.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of interest in the present study is improvement in adherence. We will determine if a multi-modal intervention focused on improving medication adherence among adults who were previously non-adherent results in improved medication adherence over a 6-month interval averaged across months 1 to 6. This will be reported as the percent persistent on therapy at 6 months across the three conditions (diabetes, HTN, hyperlipidemia)</description>

        <description>The primary outcome of interest in the present study is improvement in adherence. We will determine if a multi-modal intervention focused on improving medication adherence among adults who were previously non-adherent results in improved medication adherence over a 6-month interval averaged across months 1 to 6. This will be reported as the percent persistent on therapy at 6 months across the three conditions (diabetes, HTN, hyperlipidemia)</description>

Pre-filled trays: Randomized Control Trial Patients in the research treatment group receive pre-filled, 3x7 disposable trays that separate their medication by dose and time (e.g. morning, afternoon, evening). These pre-filled trays are inserted into a connected, weekly pillbox that detects when pills are removed from its wells.</description>
