  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine whether a combination of positive and negative commitment devices&#xD;
      is effective at inducing long-term smoking cessation in smokers from a low-to-moderate income&#xD;
      background. Investigators will randomly assign patients of a multi-site clinic in Connecticut&#xD;
      to receive one or both of a succession of two commitment contracts. First, a two-month reward&#xD;
      contract will pay participants for (a) engaging in clinic and web-based activities that&#xD;
      support smoking cessation and (b) quitting smoking, as measured at period end. Second, a&#xD;
      four-month deposit contract will invite participants to commit funds which they forfeit&#xD;
      unless they abstain from smoking over the entire period. A random subset of participants will&#xD;
      also have the option to pre-commit to the deposit contract at study enrollment. Reward payout&#xD;
      and deposit recovery will be conditional on biochemical verification of self-reported&#xD;
      abstinence. Investigators will conduct follow-up biochemical verification at 12 months to&#xD;
      observe whether abstinence persists after removal of incentives. The primary outcome of&#xD;
      interest will be continuous abstinence from smoking between months 2 and 12, i.e.&#xD;
      biochemically verified abstinence at all three measurements. A short baseline and endline&#xD;
      survey will also be administered to measure characteristics and outcomes related to smoking&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When patients arrive at the enrollment meeting, research staff will walk them through the&#xD;
      informed consent form to explain and answer questions about the study. Patients who sign the&#xD;
      consent form enroll in the study. Those who choose not to enroll are thanked for their time&#xD;
      and encouraged to use CHCI smoking cessation services, regardless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing written consent to participate in the study, patients will complete a short&#xD;
      (15 minute) baseline survey assessing their smoking habits. Patients will complete the survey&#xD;
      on their own or with the assistance of a research staff member. See Appendix B for the survey&#xD;
      instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following the survey, randomization will occur, corresponding to the two phases&#xD;
      of the intervention. Patients will be blinded to randomization. Randomization is done offsite&#xD;
      using Stata. The research staff will enter basic, unidentifiable information about the&#xD;
      patient into a web interface designed specifically for the purpose of this study and receive&#xD;
      a treatment assignment for that participant. In this way, the enrollment staff does not deal&#xD;
      directly with the randomization process. Patients are assigned to one of four study arms:&#xD;
      Control, Treatment 1: Rewards Only, Treatment 2: Rewards w/ pre-commitment for deposit&#xD;
      contract, Treatment 3: Rewards w/ commitment for deposit contract at 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soon after enrollment, patients will receive an automated call verifying participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I runs from study enrollment through the first biochemical verification of abstinence&#xD;
      from smoking (&quot;biochemical test&quot;), at 2 months. Study participants assigned to the treatment&#xD;
      group, but not the control, will receive rewards in the form of gift cards for engaging in&#xD;
      the smoking cessation activities (&quot;process&quot;) and for a negative result on the biochemical&#xD;
      test (&quot;outcome&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five process activities will be rewarded for treatment group members:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One-time sign up reward for stickK.com&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. submitting a weekly self-report of smoking abstinence on stickK&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. writing a stickK journal entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. enlisting family and friends to register as stickK &quot;Supporters&quot; to track progress and&#xD;
           provide positive reinforcement,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. utilizing CHCI group or individual counseling services provided by a nurse or behavioral&#xD;
           health provider&#xD;
&#xD;
      When possible, initial appointments with counseling services will be offered on the same day&#xD;
      as the enrollment visit using CHCI's &quot;warm handoff&quot; behavioral health appointments.&#xD;
      Participants will be encouraged to log their completion of these visits on stickK, and&#xD;
      research staff will verify on stickK that the patient attended and completed a valid smoking&#xD;
      cessation clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each completed and verified process activity, treatment group participants accrue points&#xD;
      on stickK that can be redeemed for a gift card to a retail store at Phase I end, conditional&#xD;
      on biochemical verification of smoking cessation. If the participant fails to demonstrate&#xD;
      abstinence, s/he forfeits all accrued process points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the control group will not receive information about stickK or a stickK account&#xD;
      associated with the study, though they may sign up for the online service independently. The&#xD;
      control group will receive information about and have access to CHCI's full menu of smoking&#xD;
      cessation services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical verification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biochemical tests will be conducted two months after study enrollment. Research staff&#xD;
      will contact patients via phone and/or email to schedule visits to complete these tests.&#xD;
      Investigators will ask all control group members to take the test and compensate them for&#xD;
      doing so, regardless of test result (&quot;measurement incentive&quot;). Only treatment group members&#xD;
      who self-report not smoking during the last week, or from whom investigators were unable to&#xD;
      procure a self-report, will be asked to take the test. This group will not receive a&#xD;
      measurement incentive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will first complete a CO breathalyzer test. Those that test positive will have&#xD;
      no further testing. Those testing negative will have a urine verification test at the&#xD;
      in-house Quest Diagnostics. Test results will be sent to the EHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process and outcome changes are rewarded according to the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I end: redemption of rewards or adoption of deposit contract. The majority of&#xD;
      participants will receive confirmation of their smoking status at the clinic within a few&#xD;
      minutes of taking the test. Research staff will verify the confirmatory test result on stickK&#xD;
      and assist participants as they adopt the deposit contract or redeem their rewards. The&#xD;
      deposit contract is a commitment device that allows users to voluntarily &quot;deposit&quot; rewards&#xD;
      that they can only recover if they succeed in achieving a predetermined goal, which, in this&#xD;
      case, is maintaining smoking abstinence over the four-month Phase II period. In other words,&#xD;
      participants who elect to use the deposit contract risk losing some or all of the rewards&#xD;
      they accrued during the &quot;rewards phase&quot; if they fail to test negative for smoking at Phase II&#xD;
      end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol by biochemical test result, randomized assignment, and take-up decision:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test positive for smoking -&gt; lose accrued process rewards; not eligible for deposit&#xD;
           contract&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test negative for smoking, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No deposit contract -&gt; redeem process and outcome rewards&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deposit contract-pre-commitment and pre-committed -&gt; confirm, adjust, or opt-out of&#xD;
           commitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deposit contract-pre-commitment and did not pre-commit -&gt; receive deposit contract offer&#xD;
           one final time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deposit contract- No pre-commitment -&gt; receive deposit contract offer for the first and&#xD;
           final time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who are eligible for but decline the deposit contract redeem 100% of their rewards. The&#xD;
      intervention ends after Phase I for these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who adopt the deposit contract redeem the percentage of their rewards that they did not&#xD;
      invest in the deposit contract. The rest is automatically rolled into the deposit contract,&#xD;
      and the contract period, i.e. Phase II of the intervention, begins immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Deposit contract, months 3 through 6. Phase II lasts 4 months, from month 3 through&#xD;
      6. The majority of study participants won't hold a deposit contract and thus won't experience&#xD;
      an active intervention during this time. Participants who do hold a deposit contract will be&#xD;
      free to engage with stickK as they like (e.g. write journal entries, share progress on social&#xD;
      media), but will not receive rewards for doing so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months, investigators will ask all study participants to take the second confirmatory&#xD;
      test. Participants without a deposit contract will receive a measurement incentive to take&#xD;
      the test but no performance incentives contingent on the test result. For deposit contract&#xD;
      holders, recovery of the deposit will be contingent on testing negative for smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of long-term smoking abstinence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At month 12, all study participants will be asked to visit the clinic for a final&#xD;
      confirmatory test, and all will receive a measurement incentive. No incentives are contingent&#xD;
      on smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An endline survey will be administered at this time. The endline survey will be&#xD;
      self-administered by participants either via email, mailing, or in person depending on the&#xD;
      availability of participants.&#xD;
