    <textblock>
      This Phase II trial evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of the Folate&#xD;
      Receptor Alpha (FRα) peptide vaccine mixed with GM-CSF as a vaccine adjuvant, with or without&#xD;
      a immune priming with cyclophosphamide, as a consolidation therapy after neoadjuvant or&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment of patients with Stage IIb-III triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) occur in approximately 20-25% of all patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer and are associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with TNBCs derive no benefit&#xD;
      from targeted therapies. Excluding those patients who demonstrate a pathologic complete&#xD;
      response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which is a minor fraction (i.e. 15%), overall&#xD;
      survival is only 45% at 7 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following standard of care, there are windows of opportunity to further and safely treat&#xD;
      patients to prevent recurrence. Stimulating the immune system to produce T cells immunity&#xD;
      specific for tumor antigens may significantly delay recurrence and cure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed vaccine is intended to induce T cells to survey for the reemergence of TNBCs and&#xD;
      to prevent recurrence in the adjuvant setting. The vaccine strategy is antigen-specific and&#xD;
      targets the Folate Receptor Alpha (FRα). FRα is an ideal target because of its limited&#xD;
      expression in the healthy tissues and it high expression in 86% of TNBCs. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that it is a biologically important marker that is associated with poorer clinical outcome&#xD;
      and is retained in metastatic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FRα vaccine include a pool of 5 peptides that are immunogenic epitopes and safely&#xD;
      generate tissue-surveying CD4 T cell immune responses in patients tested in a recently&#xD;
      completed phase I clinical trial.&#xD;
