  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, Intensive Medicine is carried out in three types of structures: intensive care&#xD;
      units, intensive care unit and units Continuous Monitoring (USC). Created in the 90s as&#xD;
      intermediate structures between conventional care units and intensive care units, these units&#xD;
      are assigned to the care of patients whose conditions and treatment are fear the occurrence&#xD;
      of one or more critical failures requiring to be monitored, or whose condition, at the end of&#xD;
      one or more critical failure is too severe or unstable to allow a return to a classical&#xD;
      inpatient unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, USC represent a milestone in the journey of patients whose condition is critical:&#xD;
      patients from the emergency services, patients in the immediate postoperative period, coming&#xD;
      out of intensive care patients, or finally in conventional hospitalization patients whose&#xD;
      condition s 'worse. The creation of the USC is not subject to authorization but must be&#xD;
      contractualized between the hospital and the Regional Health Agency (ARS) because it is&#xD;
      resource intensive. Organizations and their operating modes are guided by the recommendations&#xD;
      of the French Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care (SFAR), and the Society of French&#xD;
      Language Resuscitation (SRLF) published in 2005.The US establishment has a beneficial effect&#xD;
      on the quality of care and the care pathway of patients at risk shown by the reduction in&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, the rate of admission and / or USC readmission of length of stay and&#xD;
      hospital stay costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to objectify provided first establish an inventory on the activity of these&#xD;
      units and the patient base supported. To judge the benefit of the assumption by the USC, it&#xD;
      is necessary to assess the adequacy of patients managed with an updated specification and&#xD;
      defined by a group of experts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      4600 adult patients will be enrolled in the study with the primary objective to quantify in&#xD;
      terms of mortality reduction, &quot;the benefit&quot; of using USC on the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      treatment and patient care pathway that present Medical eligibility criteria to supervision&#xD;
      USC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology of the study is organized into 5 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of candidate criteria that justify the presence in USC and validation by a&#xD;
           panel of experts according to the Delphi method&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selection of a representative sample of 100 institutions with USC stratified by major&#xD;
           regions (North, Ile-de-France, Southeast, Southwest), the activity of the USC (number&#xD;
           admissions / year), method of financing the establishment, presence or absence of an&#xD;
           operating theater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observational Cohort study, prospective, multicenter. In each selected center will be&#xD;
           collected the data during consecutive patients 1-2 weeks depending on the activity&#xD;
           centers on USC sectors, post-operative, post-resuscitation and post emergency. Data&#xD;
           collection will be done on the ground and from Medicalization Programme of Information&#xD;
           Systems extraction . An external quality control will be organized on 10% of stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of eligibility for hospitalization USC will be conducted by a group of&#xD;
           professionals representing different companies analysis in pairs and independently&#xD;
           stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modelling and economic evaluation: development and validation of the score (ASIC&#xD;
           Activity Score for Intermediate Care) and medico-economic analysis.&#xD;
