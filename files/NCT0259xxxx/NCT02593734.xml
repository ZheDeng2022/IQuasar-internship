      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a bundled intervention of psychotropic drugs and&#xD;
      daily contact with a nurse for people with mental health disorders in a prayer camp and&#xD;
      secondly to assess whether the attitudes of the prayer camp staff toward mental health&#xD;
      disorders and conventional medicines remain the same after the intervention.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a bundled intervention of psychotropic drugs and&#xD;
      daily contact with a nurse for people with mental health disorders in a prayer camp and&#xD;
      secondly to assess whether the attitudes of the prayer camp staff toward mental health&#xD;
      disorders and conventional medicines remain the same after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study, residents of the sanatorium at the Mount Horeb Prayer Center located&#xD;
      in Mamfe, Ghana will be screened for psychiatric disorders by a psychiatrist. Those who are&#xD;
      diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder requiring treatment (schizophrenia, or mood disorder)&#xD;
      and who meet the other inclusion criteria (see below) will be randomly assigned to receive a&#xD;
      daily dose of the appropriate psychotropic drug (according to standard procedures of care) as&#xD;
      well as regular prayer camp treatment (intervention group) or to receive only regular prayer&#xD;
      camp treatment (control group). After randomization, the patients in the intervention group&#xD;
      will receive the bundled treatment for 6 weeks, while control group patients will receive&#xD;
      regular prayer camp treatment, e.g. encouragement to pray. Psychiatrists blinded to group&#xD;
      assignments will assess outcomes over a 6 - 8 week period. Following this, patients will be&#xD;
      referred for continued care with health care facilities as close to their homes as possible&#xD;
      on discharge and if they so desire. At the start of the intervention, pastors and attendants&#xD;
      at the prayer camp will be qualitatively assessed through a semi-structured interview&#xD;
      concerning their attributions of mental illness causation. They will be assessed -0, -6 weeks&#xD;
      after and again -12 weeks after intervention. The investigators hypothesize that patients who&#xD;
      receive the bundled intervention will have improved mental health outcomes and functioning&#xD;
      and that prayer camp staff will develop more positive attitudes toward conventional medicine&#xD;
      and will begin to conceptualize mental health disorders as treatable illnesses, rather than&#xD;
      only as a spiritual disorder. The results will provide empirical evidence for or against an&#xD;
      integrated model of community based care which encompasses the medical and spiritual. This is&#xD;
      the first intervention study in Sub-Saharan Africa to promote the use of psychotropic drugs&#xD;
      in a traditional or spiritual healing setting. Its findings may inform the implementation of&#xD;
      national policies governing collaboration between primary health care and faith healing&#xD;
      centers, expanding access to and improving the quality of mental health care services.&#xD;
