    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination product (URG101) is safe and&#xD;
      effective versus its individual components (Heparin Sodium and Lidocaine Hydrochloride) for&#xD;
      the treatment of Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome. The study is randomized and&#xD;
      double-blinded such that neither the subject nor doctor will know which drug or placebo is&#xD;
      received.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, single-dose,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination&#xD;
      product (URG101) compared with its individual components (Heparin Sodium and Lidocaine&#xD;
      Hydrochloride).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects exhibiting moderate to severe symptoms of bladder pain associated with&#xD;
      their diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome who have signed informed&#xD;
      consent, will be screened and provisionally enrolled for intravesical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of study drug administration subjects will be randomized (2:1:2:1;&#xD;
      URG101:placebo:lidocaine:heparin) and will receive a single administration of one of four&#xD;
      intravesical treatments in a blinded fashion, based on random assignment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. URG101 (buffered lidocaine-heparin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo (phosphate buffer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lidocaine hydrocholoride buffered alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Heparin sodium buffered alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy and safety assessments will be completed for 24 hours after study drug&#xD;
      administration. End of Study Follow-up will be completed by telephone 48 to 72 hours after&#xD;
      study drug administration.&#xD;

          1. Pregnant or breastfeeding. For females of child bearing potential and males, if&#xD;
             sexually active, must be willing to commit to an acceptable method of birth control&#xD;
             for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a known hypersensitivity to heparin or lidocaine&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have used any local anesthetic by any route within 24 hours prior to study drug&#xD;

             (gabapentin or pregabalin) unless taking the medication for ≥ 3 weeks. The stable dose&#xD;
             of gabapentin may not exceed 1,200 mg per day, and the stable dose of pregabalin may&#xD;
             not exceed 150 mg per day.&#xD;
