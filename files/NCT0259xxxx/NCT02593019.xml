  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD1775 (previously known as MK-1775 in earlier studies) is an inhibitor of Wee1, a protein&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase. Wee1 phosphorylates and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases 1 (CDK1) and 2&#xD;
      (CDK2), and is involved in regulation of the intra-S and G2 cell cycle checkpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CDK1 (also called cell division cycle 2, or CDC2) activity drives a cell from the G2 phase of&#xD;
      the cell cycle into mitosis. In response to DNA damage, Wee1 inhibits CDK1 to prevent the&#xD;
      cell from dividing until the damaged DNA is repaired (G2 checkpoint arrest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibition of Wee1 is expected to release a tumor cell from chemotherapeutically-induced&#xD;
      arrest of cell replication. In vitro experiments demonstrate that AZD1775 has synergistic&#xD;
      cytotoxic effects when administered in combination with various DNA damaging agents that have&#xD;
      divergent mechanisms of action. Therefore, the primary objective of the clinical development&#xD;
      of AZD1775 is its use as a chemosensitizing drug in combination with a cytotoxic agent (or&#xD;
      combination of agents) for treatment of advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CDK2 activity drives a cell into, and through, S-phase of the cell cycle where the genome is&#xD;
      duplicated in preparation for cell division. Inhibition of Wee1 is expected to cause&#xD;
      aberrantly high CDK2 activity in S-phase cells which, in turn, leads to unstable DNA&#xD;
      replication structures and ultimately DNA damage. Therefore, it is anticipated that AZD1775&#xD;
      will have independent anti-tumor activity in the absence of added chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor suppressor protein p53 regulates the G1 checkpoint. As the majority of human&#xD;
      cancers harbor abnormalities in this pathway they become more dependent on S- and G2- phase&#xD;
      checkpoints. Thus, S- and G2-checkpoint abrogation caused by inhibition of Wee1 may&#xD;
      selectively sensitize p53-deficient cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred percent of Small cell lung cancer has TP53 mutation, therefore we can expect that&#xD;
      most of Small cell lung cancer have lost G1 checkpoint and has high probability of WEE1&#xD;
      dependency for proper DNA repair and cell cycle progression. For this reason, Small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer could be a good clinical trial target disease for WEE1 inhibitor.&#xD;
