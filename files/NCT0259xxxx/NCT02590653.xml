&#xD;
      â€¢ To assess the effect of atorvastatin in patients treated since the first 24-96 hours of the&#xD;
      disease on the parameters of global and regional myocardial deformation in the infarcted area&#xD;
      and the structural and functional properties of arteries at day 7, at 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary goals. To evaluate the effect of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on the parameters of the global and regional myocardial deformation in the intact area&#xD;
           on day 7, on 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on the parameters of the global and regional myocardial deformation depending on the&#xD;

           (TIMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on systolic and diastolic left ventricular function in the presence of initial&#xD;
           impairments, or absence of the negative dynamics of these parameters in case of normal&#xD;

      1. Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Atorvastatin therapy directly results in improved deformation characteristics of&#xD;
           hibernating myocardium due to its pleiotropic effects on endothelial dysfunction and&#xD;
           atherosclerotic plaque stability, as well as stimulation of angiogenesis in ischemic&#xD;
           zones of myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Long-term atorvastatin therapy improves the morphofunctional properties of large&#xD;
           arteries and decreases the severity of endothelial dysfunction in patients with a&#xD;
           history of myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Atorvastatin causes an anti-ischemic effect, if used for a long time. 2.1. Primary&#xD;
           objective To evaluate the effect of atorvastatin, when started between 24 and 96 hours&#xD;
           after disease onset, on the parameters of global and regional myocardial deformation in&#xD;
           the zone of infarction, as well as morphofunctional properties of arteries, on Day 7 and&#xD;
           Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48 of the treatment; 2.2. Secondary objectives. To evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on the parameters of global and regional myocardial&#xD;
                deformation in the zone of intact myocardium on Day 7 and Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48&#xD;
                of the treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on the parameters of global and regional myocardial&#xD;
                deformation depending on TIMI blood flow grade;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle in&#xD;
                patients with impaired left ventricular function at baseline, as well as the&#xD;
                ability of this treatment to prevent deterioration of left ventricular function in&#xD;
                patients with normal left ventricular function at baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on heart failure development and progression as assessed&#xD;
                using the corresponding clinical diagnostic criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on duration and time course of myocardial ischemia using 24&#xD;
                hour ECG monitoring on Day 7 and Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48 of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on the appearance of new prognostically significant&#xD;
                disorders of cardiac rhythm;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on pulse wave velocity and cardio-ankle vascular index&#xD;
                (CAVI);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on intima-media thickness (IMT);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on the results of automated quantitative vascular&#xD;
                elasticity measurements, pulse wave and pulse pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on endothelial function using the reactive hyperemia test;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on the time course of blood chemistry parameters (i.e.,&#xD;
                total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
                alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and creatinkinase (CK);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the safety of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the effect of treatment on patient's well-being and quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  patient compliance with the therapy. 2.3. Scientific novelty of the study It is&#xD;
                planned to study, for the first time, the effect of long-term aggressive statin&#xD;
                therapy on the functional status of myocardium in the zone of ischemia, lesion and&#xD;
                necrosis in patients with STEMI using the two-dimensional strain procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned, for the first time, to comprehensively study the effect of aggressive statin&#xD;
      therapy on the status of vasculature, with measuring multiple parameters characterizing the&#xD;
      morphofunctional status of elastic and muscular arteries in patients with documented coronary&#xD;
      heart disease (CHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Clinical significance of study results. If the proposed hypotheses are confirmed after&#xD;
      the primary endpoints described in Section 3 have been reached, new convincing evidence&#xD;
      supporting the use of long-term aggressive treatment with Atorvastatin starting from the&#xD;
      early stages of myocardial infarction will be obtained. Obviously, the clinical benefits will&#xD;
      include the improved prognosis and decreased risk of repeated vascular events. Favorable&#xD;
      effects of this therapy on the morphofunctional status of arterial vasculature will play an&#xD;
      important role in the treatment of these patients. Positive results of this study can form&#xD;
      the basis for planning and conducting larger studies on pleiotropic effects of Atorvastatin&#xD;
      in patients with a history of myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Statistically significant differences in spatial and velocity parameters of myocardial&#xD;
           deformation in the zone of previous STEMI as compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Statistically significant differences in spatial and velocity parameters of myocardial&#xD;
           deformation in the intact zone after STEMI as compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistically significant differences in intima-media thickness (IMT) according to echo&#xD;
           tracking data as compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistically significant differences in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and CAVI as&#xD;
           compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Planning and conducting the study. It is planned to include 200 patients in this&#xD;
      randomized, open-label, single-center, prospective, controlled clinical study; these patients&#xD;
      will be recruited at the Department of Therapy of the Penza State University Medical&#xD;
