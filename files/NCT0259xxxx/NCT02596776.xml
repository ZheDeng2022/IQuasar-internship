  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An adaptation to a cold environment is a tendency to generate heat within our body. Some of&#xD;
      this heat comes from our fat tissue. Although most fat tissue is &quot;white fat&quot;, there are&#xD;
      pockets deep within the body that are called &quot;brown fat&quot;, which are specially adapted to&#xD;
      burning fat and making heat. The investigator believes that our white fat, just underneath&#xD;
      the surface of our skin, also has this property to burn fat and make heat, although not at&#xD;
      the high level of brown fat. This study is to examine this fat-burning property of the white&#xD;
      fat under the skin in response to seasons and to cold. Many such studies have been done in&#xD;
      mice, but little has been done in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of factors, including age, weight, and medical history, that may make a&#xD;
      person eligible or ineligible to participate in this study. Certain medications could make a&#xD;
      person ineligible, but if these medications can be safely altered, the individual may become&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is a condition involving elevated levels of fat in the blood, a tendency&#xD;
      towards diabetes, hypertension, and too much fat around the abdomen (an increased waistline).&#xD;
      Individuals with metabolic syndrome often have impaired glucose tolerance, which is a&#xD;
      condition where blood sugar is normal before a person eats, but is too high after drinking a&#xD;
      sugary drink. This is due to an abnormality in the body's sensitivity to insulin (insulin&#xD;
      resistance), which is due in part to an inability of muscle to take up glucose. People with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome have inflammation in their fat tissue and this inflammation in the fat&#xD;
      tissue may impair the ability of the white fat to burn fat and continue to promote obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves three arms. A propranolol with biopsy arm, a heavy water with biopsy arm,&#xD;
      and a biopsy only arm. The goal is to understand the response of fat to cold, either acutely,&#xD;
      or after repeated cold exposure, or in response to a change in seasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals (subjects) accepted into the study will report to the UK Center for Clinical and&#xD;
      Translational Science (CCTS) research unit for baseline testing and repeated procedures.&#xD;
      Participants will then be asked to have the same procedures done approximately 6 months&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled into the study will need to come to the CCTS Unit for multiple visits. Most&#xD;
      of these visits will be less than 1 hour, but 6 visits will involve procedures and will vary&#xD;
      in time ranging from 4 hour to 6 hours. If a subject participates in all aspects of the study&#xD;
      (fat biopsy from multiple depots, short term, long term, and seasons, then their total&#xD;
      participation will be approximately 28 visits over 6-7 months. However, for most subjects,&#xD;
      their participation will involve fewer visits, at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit will involve the consent process, followed by baseline fasting blood samples&#xD;
      and the oral glucose tolerance test. If the subject passes these screening procedures, then&#xD;
      subsequent visits will involve the fat biopsies, DEXA, and other visits described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat biopsies (Visits 2, 14, 17 and 28). Regardless of the study arm assigned to all subjects&#xD;
      will present to the CCTS fasting and a baseline fat biopsy will be performed on the thigh and&#xD;
      lower abdomen. Abdominal and thigh subcutaneous adipose tissue will be removed by incision&#xD;
      under local anesthesia. An ice pack will then be placed on the opposite thigh and lower&#xD;
      abdomen for 30 min; 4 hr later, an adipose biopsy will be obtained from the iced area. The&#xD;
      subject will then report to the CCTS daily for repeated 30 min ice pack procedures. However,&#xD;
      at the discretion of the PI, participant may be able to perform the 30 min ice pack procedure&#xD;
      at home. On day 7 and on day 14, subjects will report to the CCTS fasting and the above&#xD;
      procedure will be repeated: an ice pack will be placed on the thigh and abdomen for 30 min,&#xD;
      and fat biopsies will be taken from the iced area and from the non-iced area 4 hr later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propranolol Arm: Subjects who qualify for this subgroup will be given propranolol 10 mg three&#xD;
      times per day. If they tolerate the medication well with no side effects, after 5 days, they&#xD;
      will then increase the dose to 20 mg three times per day. If they tolerate the 20 mg dose&#xD;
      well with no side effects, after another 5 days (day 10), they will then increase the dose to&#xD;
      40 mg three times per day and stay on this for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heavy Water Arm: Subjects who qualify for this subgroup will be given heavy water (at visit&#xD;
      2) every 3 hours for the next 12 hours while at the CCTS. They will then be sent home with&#xD;
      doses of heavy water in sealed sterile vials, and will take one vial of heavy water twice per&#xD;
      day for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following test and procedures will be performed on subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose tolerance test (Visits 1 and 15). This will be a standard oral glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      using 75 g of glucose, with blood for glucose and insulin drawn at times 1, 30, 60, 90, and&#xD;
      120 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting metabolic rate. The investigator will measure resting metabolic rate (RMR). RMR is&#xD;
      measured early in the morning, fasting, in a room on the CCTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEXA. Body composition will be measured with DEXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-Lead ECG: To examine heart rhythm and heart rate and any evidence of previous heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine Collection: Females who are capable of becoming pregnant will also be given a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test. If the test results show that they are pregnant they will not be able to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled Visits: During the study if either the subject or the PI feel that that the&#xD;
      subject should be seen for an additional visit due to an adverse event, the study staff will&#xD;
      arrange for this visit. This visit should take no more than 30 minutes. During this visit the&#xD;
      investigator will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review subject's current medication use, including over the counter medications and&#xD;
           herbals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask the subject questions about their health or any problems they may have had since&#xD;
           their last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If necessary, take a blood sample (about 1 tablespoon) and urine sample (about 6&#xD;
           teaspoons) to monitor the subject's general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If necessary, perform a ECG and measure blood pressure and pulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If necessary, ask questions about how study drug dosing at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the above procedure, the subject will be asked to come back for the same set&#xD;
      of procedures the following season (i.e. winter, if original procedure was summer, or vice&#xD;
      versa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, if the subject completes all the procedures in both seasons, a total of 16&#xD;
      biopsies will be performed. Following initial studies, the investigator may refine the&#xD;
      protocol and take fewer biopsies. For example, if early experiments determine that abdominal&#xD;
      fat is not responsive to seasons, the investigator may discontinue this procedure. The&#xD;
      investigator may determine that the baseline fat biopsy (prior to icing) is unnecessary.&#xD;
