    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of osteopathic treatment as an adjunct to standard&#xD;
      medical treatment in reducing child functional abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sample that includes no more than 30 patients per study group (n = 60) are&#xD;
      being recruited. As an exploratory study the investigators did not proceed to make any sample&#xD;
      size calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a comparative study of two quasi-experimental interventions (standard treatment vs.&#xD;
      standard treatment + Osteopathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-blind trial where only the evaluator will be blinded. The principal&#xD;
      outcome will be pain measured by a visual analog scale. A version with more appropriate&#xD;
      pictograms for pediatric patients is used. Measurements will be taken at baseline (baseline&#xD;
      measurements) at 4, 8 weeks (the duration of interventions) and 6 months post-study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the functional or structural disease can be identified by physicians and sometimes&#xD;
      cured by medical technology, non-structural or functional symptoms, those without an&#xD;
      identified organic cause and associated with a high rate of response to placebo are yet&#xD;
      enigmatic and less susceptible to explanation or effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often considered as non-pathological, there are physiological and sociocultural factors,&#xD;
      nociceptive, psychic that expand the perception of these symptoms which are experienced as&#xD;
      serious, problematic and threatening with the consequent impact on daily activities. Although&#xD;
      it represents the most frequent cause of consultation in the specialty of Pediatric&#xD;
      Gastroenterology there is currently no drug therapy that has demonstrated its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these cases, unnecessary diagnostic studies can be performed to find an organic cause,&#xD;
      resulting in increased health care costs and possibly in an inappropriate patient care. These&#xD;
      types of beliefs and behaviors can delegitimize the DFG and the suffering of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are studies that say that 35% of patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (no&#xD;
      organic cause but if organic effect) use complementary therapies, but in the absence of&#xD;
      clinical trials, it is emphasized the need for more controlled studies to advise and / or&#xD;
      direct the patient from the medical community to which of these therapies could be more&#xD;
      adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the General Osteopathic Council (UK) and the Osteopathic International Alliance&#xD;
      (OIA), Osteopathy is a health profession that is dedicated to the diagnosis, treatment and&#xD;
      prevention of problems of the musculoskeletal and its effects on the nervous system and&#xD;
      global health. It is based on the theory that well-being depends on a good relationship&#xD;
      between the skeleton, muscles, ligaments and connective tissue. The lack of this good&#xD;
      relationship can lead to symptoms and musculoskeletal problems but also visceral. Health is&#xD;
      seen as a complex process involving all parts and systems of the body. Palpatory techniques&#xD;
      are used to diagnose dysfunction and physical manipulation is used to improve the functioning&#xD;
      of joints, relax muscle tension, promote the innervation and blood supply to tissues and help&#xD;
      the healing mechanisms of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are studies in the field of Osteopathy evaluating the efficacy of this approach in&#xD;
      different intestinal dysfunctions and diseases. Da Silva et al demonstrated the usefulness of&#xD;
      increasing the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter in the osteopathic approach in&#xD;
      patients with gastroesophageal reflux. Attali et al suggested that visceral osteopathy&#xD;
      improves short and long term bloating and rectal sensitivity in patients with irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome. Florance et al reported improvements in quality of life and symptomatic improvement&#xD;
      in patients with irritable colon with a pilot study and Piche et al showed reduced severity&#xD;
      of symptoms associated with irritable bowel in patients with Crohn's disease in remission.&#xD;
      The positive effect of osteopathic treatment in the management of symptoms caused by&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome was confirmed in a couple of systematic reviews recently published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, all these studies were performed with adult patients. On a pediatric level, most of&#xD;
      the literature focuses on infant colic. The most notable reference is the Cochrane review in&#xD;
      2012 in which several manipulative therapies are evaluated in the. One of the weaknesses&#xD;
      identified in this review is that parents entrusted to objectify the improvements were not&#xD;
      blinded. This defect is corrected in a subsequent study in the chiropractor field. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of osteopathic treatment for infantile colic has also been studied but always&#xD;
      with small samples or methodological flaws. An example is the study by Hayden et al. Silva et&#xD;
      al which shows that the use of physical therapy (muscle exercises, breathing and abdominal&#xD;
      massage) is effective in pediatric chronic constipation with defecation increasing frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of osteopathic treatment on digestive&#xD;
      disorders in both adults and pediatric patients is limited and constrained. At the same time,&#xD;
      there are no studies in the pediatric setting on approach through manual therapy in abdominal&#xD;
      painful functional disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of osteopathic treatment as an adjunct to&#xD;
           standard medical treatment in reducing child functional abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the influence of osteopathic treatment in children and&#xD;
           adolescents with functional abdominal pain related to absenteeism, the number of&#xD;
           emergency room visits, quality of life and the need for rescue medication. The potential&#xD;
           adverse effects were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design: Controlled clinical trial single-blind&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Site where the study is conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be recruited in the following pediatric services where medical&#xD;
           intervention is carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hospital del Mar de Barcelona Hospital Sant Joan de DÃ©u de Barcelona Participants in the&#xD;
           experimental group (standard medical treatment + osteopathic treatment) will be referred&#xD;
           to d'Osteopathy Clinic of Barcelona for the realization of osteopathic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A convenience sample that includes no more than 30 patients per study group (n = 60) are&#xD;
           being recruited. As an exploratory study the investigators did not proceed to make any&#xD;
           sample size calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria: The sample consists in patients of school age (6-16 years old)&#xD;
           diagnosed with functional abdominal pain (Functional Abdominal Pain-Related Disorders)&#xD;
           according to the diagnostic criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders ROME&#xD;
           guide III.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria: Patients diagnosed with digestive disease, patients who have or are&#xD;
           receiving medical aids and patients who are not studying physical treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a comparative study of two quasi-experimental interventions (standard treatment vs.&#xD;
      standard treatment + Osteopathy). The allocation of the patients in each group will be held&#xD;
      (after obtaining informed consent) through a system of randomization plus a matching system.&#xD;
      Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive one or other&#xD;
      intervention in the first instance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This allocation to the study groups will be marked and induce the pairing (&quot;matching&quot;) to a&#xD;
      new subject of study that meets the same characteristics as the previously randomized. To do&#xD;
      this, during random award, 3 specific characteristics of the subjects will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. age (from 6 years to 10 years and 11 to 16 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. type of functional abdominal pain and severity (ROME III). When a new patient with the&#xD;
           same characteristics previously patients randomized to a study group, it will be&#xD;
           assigned paired to form another study group without going through a randomization&#xD;
           process again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this design the investigators intend to balance study groups given that the&#xD;
      investigators will have a small sample and with a pragmatic inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f) Masking: This will be a single-blind trial where only the evaluator will be blinded. The&#xD;
      characteristics of the studied intervention is not possible to mask nor the therapist or the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      g) Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard medical treatment: organic cause has to be discarded through complementary&#xD;
           examinations, depending on the symptoms of each patient. Subsequently, the appropriate&#xD;
           standard pharmacological treatment for each type of functional abdominal pain will be&#xD;
           applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional dyspepsia: proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole 1 mg / kg / day vo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal migraine -Treatment: sumatriptan 50 mg PO&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional abdominal pain: antispasmodics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Irritable colon: methylcellulose + antispasmodics&#xD;
&#xD;
           * There are few studies to define the precise standard treatment of functional abdominal&#xD;
           pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osteopathic treatment (BMT) description collecting the items of the interventions guide&#xD;
           report tidier. The TMO is a 100% manual intervention applied individually with direct&#xD;
           contact between therapist and patient. For this study 5 sessions are set with a&#xD;
           fortnightly interval between sessions and lasts between 45 and 60 'each (total 2 months&#xD;
           of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both on the first visit and other physical examination prior to treatment consisting will be&#xD;
      held:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Quadrant abdominal palpation ii. Rating excursion tone and respiratory and pelvic&#xD;
      diaphragm iii. Palpation and mobility tests of the spine (especially high thoracic and lumbar&#xD;
      segments) iv. Test listening in skull base and cranial sacral following the model of William&#xD;
      G. Sutherland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanning is performed to detect the presence of somatic dysfunction (DS). The term DS is part&#xD;
      of osteopathic terminology and is defined as &quot;alterations in the function of the components&#xD;
      related to the somatic system: skeletal structures, joint and myofascial and vascular&#xD;
      elements, neural and lymphatic related&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scan results will determine the treatment that will be adapted to each particular case&#xD;
      but within the framework and following techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  See the complete description of the techniques Glossary of Osteopathic Terminology,&#xD;
           2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Indirect Techniques for working the abdominal and pelvic diaphragm Objective: To work&#xD;
           on the influence on the pressure distribution in the (especially abdominal) body&#xD;
           cavities and consequently on the viscera contained therein, proper arterial supply and&#xD;
           venous drainage and linfÃ¡tico.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osteopathic models to justify this approach and other related references. 2. Functional&#xD;
           Techniques for visceral dysfunctions Objective: visceral relaxation techniques. Listen&#xD;
           and treatment of visceral motility by functional techniques applied directly to the&#xD;
           viscera and their supporting tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osteopathic models to justify this approach and other related references. 3. Direct&#xD;
           Techniques (articulatory) and / or indirect spine dysfunctions 4. Treatment by cranial&#xD;
           sacral approach to dysfunction and skull Objective: Work on visceral autonomic&#xD;
           innervation (sympathetic and parasympathetic) to the different digestive organs in order&#xD;
           to improve vascularization and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who will perform the intervention ?:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A unique osteopath (DM) will carry out all interventions to avoid as far as possible biases&#xD;
      among different therapists. DM is a Physiotherapist and Osteopath with over 10 years of&#xD;
      clinical experience in both adults and pediatric patients. She is specialized in pediatric&#xD;
      Osteopathy through postgraduate training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies to ensure adherence to treatment and co-interventions such as telephone reminder&#xD;
      scheduled visits for osteopathic treatment. Special care will be taken to avoid&#xD;
      co-interventions. To do so participants at baseline was duly informed through a special&#xD;
      paragraph in the informed consent h) Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Principal outcome: Pain Measured by a visual analog scale. A version with more&#xD;
           appropriate pictograms for pediatric patients is used. Measurements will be taken at&#xD;
           baseline (baseline measurements) at 4, 8 weeks (the duration of interventions) and 6&#xD;
           months post-study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Truancy: a record of truancy during the 6 months follow-up study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of visits to the emergency: a registry of emergency room visits during the 6&#xD;
                months follow-up study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life: Patients will fill out the form Kidscreen quality of life in its&#xD;
                translation into Spanish (at the beginning and end of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Calendar symptoms: Patients have to fill out a schedule of symptoms 6 months&#xD;
                follow-up study with the following variables: days of onset of pain, pain&#xD;
                intensity, pain location, triggers, associated symptoms and need taking rescue&#xD;
                medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse effects: a record of the adverse effects that might occur during the study&#xD;
