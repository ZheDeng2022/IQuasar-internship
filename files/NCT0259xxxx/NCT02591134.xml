    <textblock>
      The effects of non-nutritive sweetened (NNS) beverages on weight management and psychological&#xD;
      indices of appetitive behaviour have not been assessed in both weight loss and maintained&#xD;
      weight loss phases over the long term to determine whether NNS beverages may assist in&#xD;
      efforts to lose weight and maintain weight loss and how this affects appetite expression&#xD;
      (satiety, food choice, craving, ease of dieting etc.). Thus the present research will&#xD;
      determine the impact of NNS beverages as compared to water on weight loss and weight loss&#xD;
      maintenance, satiation, satiety, cravings for sweet, exercise efforts and mood state across&#xD;
      both a period of weight-loss as well as a weight-maintenance phase. To determine if the&#xD;
      effects of NNS on appetite are beneficial or detrimental to successful weight management, the&#xD;
      study will also systematically compare the effects of NNS beverages, water and caloric&#xD;
      beverages (CBs) on appetite (hunger, satiety, liking and wanting) and energy intake&#xD;
      (including food choice and caloric compensation) across the whole day during active weight&#xD;
      management in a subset of participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use a parallel randomized design with two arms; participants will either be&#xD;
      randomized to a non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) beverage condition (active) or a water&#xD;
      condition (control). A total of 432 overweight and obese participants (Body Mass Index; BMI&#xD;
      range: 27-35 kg/m2) will be enrolled in the study. A 3-month weight loss diet phase will&#xD;
      initially be completed, with participants receiving nutritional advice at weekly group&#xD;
      sessions whilst additionally incorporating the active or control products into their diet&#xD;
      (weeks 0-12). This programme is based on a model successfully used in an American sample&#xD;
      (Peters et al., 2014) which will be adapted for a UK sample. This will be followed by a&#xD;
      9-month weight maintenance phase (weeks 13-49) in which participants will be advised to&#xD;
      follow a general healthy diet in accordance with dietary guidelines (continuing to&#xD;
      incorporate the active or control beverages) but will only attend monthly group sessions.&#xD;
      This will be followed by a one year post assisted weight maintenance period in which&#xD;
      participants will continue to consume the active or control beverages every day and will be&#xD;
      asked to complete questionnaire measures, cognitive tasks, biomarkers of health (blood&#xD;
      samples, if willing) and body composition data (weight, sagittal diameter and hip and waist&#xD;
      circumference measures; DXA (for Subset 2)) at the end of this period. A subset of&#xD;
      participants (Subset 1) will additionally undergo appetite probe days (n = 116), attending&#xD;
      the Study Centre at 15 points throughout the trial (3 sessions at baseline, 3 sessions at the&#xD;
      start of the weight loss programme, 3 sessions at the end of the weight loss programme, 3&#xD;
      sessions at the end of assisted weight maintenance and 3 sessions at the end of the one year&#xD;
      post assisted weight maintenance period). A separate subset (Subset 2) will complete&#xD;
      biological assessment measures (n =50) involving body composition (DXA) scans at 4 points&#xD;
      throughout the trial (at baseline, end of weight loss, end of assisted weight maintenance,&#xD;
      and at a year post assisted weight maintenance visit) and all participants will be asked to&#xD;
      provide blood samples at these four points but will not be excluded from the trial should&#xD;
      they not wish to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be asked to ensure that they consume at least two servings (330 ml) of their&#xD;
      elected beverages dependent on condition (NNS vs. water). All beverages will be picked by&#xD;
      participants (from a permitted range) and then delivered to them in bi-weekly batches using&#xD;
      an online delivery-style system. Primary study visits for body weight, waist circumference,&#xD;
      hip circumference, sagittal diameter, and blood pressure assessments will be carried out at&#xD;
      various stages throughout the trial. Initial assessments will be at baseline (week -2),&#xD;
      monthly over the weight loss period (weeks 4, 8 and 12), monthly over the assisted weight&#xD;
      maintenance period (weeks 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 and 48) and at a 1 year post&#xD;
      assisted weight maintenance visit with Subset 2 additionally providing body composition (DXA)&#xD;
      scans at baseline, at the end of the weight loss period, at the end of the assisted weight&#xD;
      maintenance period and at a 1 year post assisted weight maintenance visit. During the weight&#xD;
      loss phase, participants will meet in groups (10-12 participants) with a dietician-trained&#xD;
      researcher every week (12 visits) followed by monthly meetings during the assisted weight&#xD;
      maintenance phase (9 visits). Participants will additionally be asked to complete a series of&#xD;
      questionnaires throughout the intervention period and complete a series of diet diaries&#xD;
      (3-day diet diaries and food frequency questionnaires; FFQs) to assess compliance throughout&#xD;
      the trial. Furthermore, empty product packaging (labels or bottles) will be collected as an&#xD;
      additional compliance measure. The probe days to be completed by Subset 1 will involve&#xD;
      participants attending the Study Centre at various times over an 8-hour day period for 3&#xD;
      meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and 1 drink (NNS, sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) or&#xD;
      water) for a total of 15 sessions. Adverse events and concomitant medicine will be registered&#xD;
      continuously throughout the study in relevant forms. For each participant, the total study&#xD;
      duration is 100 weeks (not including recruitment and screening) and includes a total of 39&#xD;
      visits (with additional visits for Subsets 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-week weight loss programme. The 12-week Weight Loss Programme (WLP) will be based on the&#xD;
      current successful UK-based dietician-designed nutritional knowledge and group work programme&#xD;
      used within the Kissileff Laboratory, the content of which will be enhanced by a social&#xD;
      cognition based programme currently used in Colorado. This employs a group based approach&#xD;
      (10-12 participants) with frequent meetings (one per week) for a one hour session with a&#xD;
      dietician trained researcher who will supervise the sessions and who will provide materials&#xD;
      and 'home work' for the participants to complete before their next session. This programme&#xD;
      will be tailored for the UK and specific behavioural components such as advice on&#xD;
      self-monitoring, stimulus control, stress management, slow eating rate and related behaviours&#xD;
      will be covered. An exercise component will also be included in which exercise activities are&#xD;
      noted in a log and an additional online daily drinking log will also be included. The&#xD;
      exercise log will be completed weekly and brought to each session as a means of monitoring.&#xD;
      Weight will be measured at the start and end of this phase and weekly during the WLP as part&#xD;
      of group sessions (at the end of the group session) and will be conducted privately with each&#xD;
      participant in a separate room. Participants will also be asked to complete food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaires (FFQs) once per month and online 3-day diet diaries before beginning the WLP&#xD;
      and at the end of the WLP and will be given instructions on how to do so. In week 12 a&#xD;
      further visit (independent from group sessions) will be scheduled individually with each&#xD;
      participant to complete additional questionnaire and cognitive measures (Visit 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      36-week assisted weight maintenance phase. Participants will be asked to attend one hour&#xD;
      monthly group sessions with a dietician-trained researcher (10-12 participants per group)&#xD;
      during the 36-week assisted weight maintenance phase running from week 13-48. These meetings&#xD;
      will provide an opportunity for participants to discuss any concerns and to provide further&#xD;
      reminders of nutritional advice. Body weight will be measured at the end of each group&#xD;
      session and will be conducted privately with each participant in a separate room.&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete a series of questionnaires measuring appetite&#xD;
      control and ease of dieting and measures of dietary compliance alongside providing the online&#xD;
      daily beverage log and weekly paper exercise log. Participants will also be asked to complete&#xD;
      FFQs monthly during this period. At the end of this phase further visits (independent from&#xD;
      group sessions) will be scheduled to complete the final measures of appetite and food choice&#xD;
      and to provide their final online 3-day diet diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting blood samples will be analysed for glucose, insulin, lipids, triglycerides, high&#xD;
      density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol profiles and&#xD;
      Hba1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One year post assisted weight maintenance and visit After the final study visit&#xD;
      post-maintenance (week 48), participants will continue to be provided either NNS or water&#xD;
      beverages for a 12-month duration. They will be asked to return their empty beverage&#xD;
      packaging monthly during this phase (weeks 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96)&#xD;
      and will complete retrospective appetite questionnaires alongside additional questionnaires&#xD;
      upon returning their packaging. They will also complete daily online beverage logs online&#xD;
      over the duration of the 12-month period and will complete a final online 3-day food diary&#xD;
      which they present at Visit 39 (week 100). Participants in Subset 1 will additionally undergo&#xD;
      a final set of probe days in weeks 98-99 (Visits 38a, 38b, and 38c). Subset 2 will also&#xD;
      provide their final DXA scan at the one year post assisted weight maintenance period visit&#xD;
      (Visit 39). At this final visit participants will be asked to provide a fasting blood sample&#xD;
      as well as complete a range of computer tasks, questionnaires and food diaries. Their body&#xD;
      weight will be measured and their waist, hip and sagittal diameter will be taken in a&#xD;
      separate room along with their blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsets Subset 1 - Appetite Probe Days A voluntary subset of randomly selected participants&#xD;
      (n=116) will be invited to participate in the appetite probe day sessions to assess changes&#xD;
      in appetite response to caloric and non-caloric beverages (water, NNS and caloric beverages;&#xD;
      CB). These probe days will be measured at baseline (Visits 2a, 2b &amp; 2c; weeks -2 to 0), at&#xD;
      the start of the weight loss programme (Visits 3a, 3b and 3c; weeks 1 to 2), at the end of&#xD;
      the weight loss period (Visits 13a, 13b and 13c; weeks 11 to 12) at the end of the assisted&#xD;
      weight maintenance period (Visits 24a, 24b, 24c; weeks 47 to 48) and at the end of the 1 year&#xD;
      post assisted weight maintenance period (Visits 38a, 38b, &amp; 38c). These sessions will be&#xD;
      scheduled a minimum of 3 days after one another (minimum completion of 2 weeks) and must all&#xD;
      be completed within a maximum of 3 weeks. At each point one probe day will examine the&#xD;
      response to a caloric beverage (ie a sugar sweetened beverage; SSB) and then the second and&#xD;
      third the response to NNS and water (the order of all three drinks will be counterbalanced&#xD;
      across participants and probe days). These will be provided after breakfast and 1 hour before&#xD;
      lunch (approximately 12pm). Compensation will then be tracked at an ad libitum test lunch and&#xD;
      an evening meal. Participants will be blinded to the study condition (no information will be&#xD;
      provided about the drinks during the probe days) however the sensory characteristics of the&#xD;
      beverages may be evident. Cognitive and sensory cues cannot be matched but are important&#xD;
      determinants of real world appetite responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard 8-hour design will be used. The appetite probe day will be conducted at the&#xD;
      Kissileff Laboratory study centre and will involve participants attending the centre for a&#xD;
      fixed breakfast (breakfast is calibrated based on weight bands which will be determined at&#xD;
      the Screening session; prior to the end of WLP and prior to the end of the assisted weight&#xD;
      maintenance phase to ensure accurate weight banding), the study beverage, ad libitum lunch&#xD;
      and ad libitum dinner as well as a take-home snack pack for the remainder of the evening.&#xD;
      Participants will complete appetite VAS pre- and post- each meal as well as completing these&#xD;
      ratings at hourly intervals throughout the test day. They will be free to leave the Study&#xD;
      Centre after consuming their meals and will be provided with water as well as a specified&#xD;
      time to return for their next meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subset 2 - DXA Scans In addition to trial participation, Subset 2 (n = 50) be asked to&#xD;
      provide fasting full body DXA scan at dedicated visits 1d, 14a, 25a, and 39 (weeks 0, 12, 48&#xD;
      and the one year post assisted weight maintenance visit respectively). The DXA scan will be&#xD;
      used to assess changes in body composition during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be reminded during the Screening session that they do not have to take part&#xD;
      in the additional testing (Subsets 1 or 2) or provide blood samples to be eligible for&#xD;
      enrolment in the trial.&#xD;
