  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) are usually provided guidance on how best to control&#xD;
      glycaemia around meal times through adjusting their rapid-acting insulin dose according to&#xD;
      the carbohydrate content of the meal (e.g. 1 IU per 10/15 g of carbohydrate; Schmidt et al.,&#xD;
      2014). However, a potential issue around this method is the role of dietary fat in the&#xD;
      calculation of insulin requirements (Wolpert et al., 2013). The fat component of the meal has&#xD;
      the potential to influence the insulin dose requirement to normalise postprandial glycaemia&#xD;
      (Wolpert et al., 2013). Although normalising postprandial glycaemia is vital, postprandial&#xD;
      lipaemia is also an important consideration for long-term health, and at present there is&#xD;
      scant data in this area in T1DM. In addition, changing the macronutrient composition of foods&#xD;
      and altering insulin doses may carry important implications for vascular function and&#xD;
      prospective appetite regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will examine the glycaemic and lipaemic responses after consuming a mixed meal&#xD;
      similar in carbohydrate content, but differing in fat content. Moreover, this research will&#xD;
      assess whether acute postprandial reductions in insulin sensitivity can be offset through&#xD;
      increasing the dose of rapid-acting insulin for such meals. Venous blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected before and for 6 hours after meals, for the determination of glycaemic and lipaemic&#xD;
      responses, as well as metabolite and hormonal parameters. In addition this study will assess&#xD;
      the impact of mixed meals and adjusting insulin dose on vascular function and subjective&#xD;
      ratings of appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study will benefit patients with type 1 diabetes by the provision of&#xD;
      more refined self-management strategies for insulin dosage around meal-times.&#xD;

      Study design and Methodology General Design: 18 male or female type 1 diabetes (T1DM)&#xD;
      individuals aged between 18 and 50 years old will be invited to attend four laboratory&#xD;
      sessions, each separated by 7 days. Participants will be recruited in clinic and through&#xD;
      advertising in local media. Participants will complete four main trials in a randomised and&#xD;
      counter balanced fashion. Main trials will involve the manipulation of both the meal&#xD;
      composition (fat content) and rapid-acting insulin dose. During each visit blood samples will&#xD;
      be measured over a 6 hour postprandial period to determine glycaemic, lipaemic, hormone, and&#xD;
      metabolite parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size requirement was estimated using Eq. 1 Hopkins (2000):&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 8s2/d2 [Eq. 1] Where n is the sample size, s is the typical error in measurement and d is&#xD;
      the meaningful effect size. The magnitude of d was derived from 0.8 of the between subject&#xD;
      variation, which was calculated using existing data. The postprandial incremental area under&#xD;
      the curve (AUC) for triglyceride concentrations following a mixed-macronutrient meal in&#xD;
      people with T1DM is typically 0.74 mmol.l-1.hour-1, with a between-subject standard deviation&#xD;
      of 0.99 mmol.l-1.hour-1 (Levetan et al. 2003). Therefore d was calculated as 0.79&#xD;
      mmol.l-1.hour-1. The CV of this measure derived from repeated trials is 23% (Weiss et al.&#xD;
      2008), giving a typical error in the region of 0.18 mmol.l-1.hour-1. These data indicate a&#xD;
      sample size of 18 participants provides greater than an 80% chance of detecting a&#xD;
      statistically significant effect with a P value of &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria Participants: For inclusion in the study, volunteers will be&#xD;
      either male or female and aged 18-50 years old, free from any diabetes complications apart&#xD;
      from background diabetic retinopathy, not taking any prescribed medication other than&#xD;
      insulin, and be treated with a stable insulin regimen composed of a combination of slow/long&#xD;
      acting insulin glargine/determir and a fast acting insulin analogue (lispro or aspart,&#xD;
      glulisine), and have a HbA1c of &lt;9.5% (80 mmol/mol). Participants will be currently using the&#xD;
      carbohydrate counting method for administering meal time rapid-acting insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to main trials: Participants will be instructed to follow a recommended diet plan for&#xD;
      48 hours prior to testing. Participants will be required to read and sign an informed consent&#xD;
      form and medical questionnaire which will be reviewed during each visit to the laboratory. 24&#xD;
      hours prior to each trial, participants will be fitted with a real-time continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring system (CGM). The CGM consists of a sensor which is inserted into subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue which is secured in place with a waterproof adhesive dressing. Sensor readings are&#xD;
      obtained and stored in the memory of the monitor which is attached to the indwelling sensor.&#xD;
      Glucose readings are provided on the screen of the monitor in real-time. Alarms will be set&#xD;
      on the monitor to notify participants if glucose levels are low (&lt;3.9 mmol/L) or high (&gt;14&#xD;
      mmol/L) during the pre-trial period. For calibration purposes, the participant will be&#xD;
      required to input blood capillary blood glucose values a minimum of 4 times per day (at meal&#xD;
      times and before bed) using their blood glucose finger-prick meter. The CGM will be removed&#xD;
      on the day after the trial at a time convenient for the participant, so that late-evening and&#xD;
      nocturnal glycaemia can be captured. The CGM monitor will also act as a safety measure to&#xD;
      alert participants to glycaemic excursions following the intervention. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed not to use real-time CGM glucose values to determine corrections to blood glucose&#xD;
      (additional carbohydrate / insulin administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main trials: All trials will be conducted in a randomised and counter-balanced fashion. For&#xD;
      each visit, the participants will be required to arrive at the NIHR Clinical Research&#xD;
      Facility laboratory on a morning (~07:00 - 09:00 AM). On the first visit, anthropometric&#xD;
      variables will be collected (mass, stature, BMI) prior to experimentation. On each visit, the&#xD;
      participant will assume a seated and rested position whilst an 18 gauge cannula is inserted&#xD;
      into the antecubital vein of their non-dominant arm for collection of venous blood. This will&#xD;
      be kept patent with periodic infusion of saline. After cannulation is complete, a 12 ml&#xD;
      resting blood sample will be collected. Participants will then perform one of four trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 1) Carbohydrate only meal: Participants will consume a standardised carbohydrate meal&#xD;
      (80 g of carbohydrates, 25 g protein, 0 g fat: meal composition, white rice, chicken, curry&#xD;
      sauce; 420 kcal) and will self-administer (into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen, as&#xD;
      per their regular routine) a rapid-acting insulin dose calculated as per the&#xD;
      carbohydrate-counting ratio (e.g. 1 IU of insulin per 10 g of carbohydrates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 2) Participants will replicate Trial 1, but on this occasion the meal consumed will&#xD;
      have an additional 50 g of fat (via addition of Ghee). This fat will be added to the sauce&#xD;
      within the meal (80 g of carbohydrates, 25 g of protein, 50 g of fat; 735 Kcal). Participants&#xD;
      will administer their rapid-acting insulin as per the carbohydrate counting method (i.e. the&#xD;
      same IU of insulin as per Trial 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 3) Participants will replicate Trial 2, but will administer a rapid-acting insulin dose&#xD;
      that has been increased by 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 4) Participants will replicate Trial 2, but will administer a rapid-acting insulin dose&#xD;
      that has been increased by 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants have consumed the meal, they will then remain at rest for 6 hours, with&#xD;
      12ml blood samples per hour to capture the time-course changes in glycaemia, lipaemia,&#xD;
      hormone, and metabolite concentrations. During the first 2 hours, an additional 1ml sample&#xD;
      will be taken at 15 and 45 minute time periods to determine blood glucose and lactate only.&#xD;
      Thus, total amount of whole blood collected within each trial is 160ml, which is less than&#xD;
      half a typical soft drinks can.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling process For each blood sample, 1 ml of whole blood will be collected and used&#xD;
      for the immediate quantification of glucose and lactate (Biosen C, EKF Diagnostics, UK). On&#xD;
      samples where the additional 11 ml of blood is taken, the remaining blood will be transferred&#xD;
      into tubes designed to collect blood plasma and serum. Both containers will then be&#xD;
      centrifuged at 3000 x g for 15 minutes to obtain plasma and serum, which will be stored at&#xD;
      -80 C° for later analysis of insulin (Invitron, UK), triglycerides (Randox Labs, UK),&#xD;
      Apoliopoprotein-B48 (Oxford Biosystems, UK), Apolipoprotein-B-100 (Oxford Biosystems, UK),&#xD;
      non-esterified fatty acids (Randox Labs, UK), TNF-α (Sigma Aldrich), GLP-1 (Oxford&#xD;
      Biosystems, UK), PYY (Sigma Aldrich, UK), Total Antioxidant capacity (Eagle Biosciences, UK),&#xD;
      and Human Myeloperoxidase (Eagle Biosciences, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each blood draw, participants will be asked to complete a 10 point Likert Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS) to determine subjective feelings of hunger and fullness. Following the&#xD;
      blood sample and completion of the VAS at 6 hours post-meal, participants will be discharged&#xD;
      from the laboratory.&#xD;
