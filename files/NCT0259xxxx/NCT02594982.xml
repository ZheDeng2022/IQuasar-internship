      Abstract Background Studies have shown that delirium in medical and surgical intensive care&#xD;
      units (ICUs) increases mortality, length of stay (LOS) as well as the risk of dementia&#xD;
      symptoms and cerebral atrophy after discharge. Only few studies have investigated delirium in&#xD;
      the neurointensive care unit (N-ICU). Delirium is most often assessed by one of two&#xD;
      instruments: Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) or the Confusion Assessment&#xD;
      Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the effect of a systematic intervention (sedation, sleep, mobilization and&#xD;
           pain) on delirium symptoms in patients with acute acquired brain injury in N-ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate the ICDSC and CAM-ICU to patients with acute acquired brain injury Method&#xD;
           The design of the study is a two-phase interventional trial. Based on a power&#xD;
           calculation, 56 patients will be enrolled both in the baseline and the intervention&#xD;
           group (n=112).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: A baseline investigation will be conducted to establish prevalence, duration and type&#xD;
      of delirium symptoms in patients with acute acquired brain injury before implementing the&#xD;
      intervention bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: A systematic Intervention protocol will be implemented in the N-ICU. The Intervention&#xD;
      elements consist of a sedation, sleep, mobilization and pain treatment regimen based on the&#xD;
      newest available evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be contacted 12 months after discharge for a follow-up including a&#xD;
      quality of life with (EuroQoL-5D) questionnaire, a cognitive test measuring their cognitive&#xD;
      end point (Repeatable Battery for Assessment of the Neuropsychological Status) and a short&#xD;
      test for dementia symptoms (MMSE, Mini Mental State Examination).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background It has been established that in medical and surgical intensive care units (ICUs)&#xD;
      that delirium increases mortality and length of stay (LOS), as well as the risk of dementia&#xD;
      and cerebral atrophy after discharge. There is a lack of studies into delirium in the&#xD;
      neurointensive care unit (N-ICU) population, and no studies have addressed the association&#xD;
      between delirium, quality of life, dementia symptoms and cerebral atrophy in patients with&#xD;
      acquired brain injury after discharge from N-ICU. A recent study has demonstrated a&#xD;
      correlation between delirium symptoms in stroke patients and quality of life, and functional&#xD;
      levels at 3, 6 and 12 months after N-ICU discharge, suggesting that delirium during the acute&#xD;
      phase effects the long-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium screening has not been introduced systematically in N-ICUs in Denmark or&#xD;
      internationally, and validated instruments are lacking in this population. The Confusion&#xD;
      Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist&#xD;
      (ICDSC) are internationally most recommended and best validated delirium screening tools for&#xD;
      non-psychiatric health care staff. Neither of the two instruments, however, has been fully&#xD;
      validated in patients with acquired brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies and guidelines suggest that delirium is potentially preventable by minimizing&#xD;
      sedation, and ensuring systematic pain management, early mobilization and adequate sleep. The&#xD;
      present study therefore aims to investigate if delirium is preventable in an N-ICU setting by&#xD;
      introducing a multi-modal intervention bundle optimizing management of sedation, pain,&#xD;
      mobilization and sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the effect of the intervention bundle on prevalence, duration and type of delirium&#xD;
      symptoms using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and Confusion&#xD;
      Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) in N-ICU patients with acute acquired brain injury&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim: To validate ICDSC and CAM-ICU for adult N-ICU with acute acquired brain&#xD;
      injury, and investigate if delirium symptoms are negatively correlated with quality of life,&#xD;
      cognitive function and dementia symptoms at 12-month follow-up post N-ICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Study design: A controlled two-phased before-and-after trial. Phase I: Baseline study&#xD;
      (4 months), Phase II: Intervention study (4 months). This design was chosen as the most&#xD;
      appropriate, because a randomized clinical trial would have a large spill-over effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is duration of delirium symptoms with ICDSC and CAM-ICU in the N-ICU&#xD;
      based on a hypothesis that it is possible to decrease time with delirium in the N-ICU 20% or&#xD;
      more. Power calculation: 56 patients will be enrolled during a 4-month period, in the&#xD;
      baseline and the intervention group respectively, yielding a total of 112 patients (20%&#xD;
      drop-out rate, 5% significance, 80% power).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria All Danish speaking adults (18 years or above) with an expected N-ICU&#xD;
      length of stay (LOS) more than 48 hours and admitted with acute brain injury from spontaneous&#xD;
      or traumatic bleeding, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)&#xD;
      or traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Patients not expected to survive 48 hours, or continues Richmond&#xD;
      Agitation-Sedation Score (RASS) of -4 or -5 during the stay in the N-ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Demographics: age, gender, primary diagnosis, marital status and living&#xD;
      situation, education, BMI, and alcohol consumption. Clinical data include: Glasgow Coma Score&#xD;
      (GCS), Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS), ICDSC, CAM-ICU, Acute Physiology and&#xD;
      Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II),&#xD;
      intubation status, sedation agent and dose, type of mobilization and pain status. Follow-up&#xD;
      includes EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D), Repeatable Battery for Assessment for the Neuropsychological&#xD;
      Status (RBANS) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire at 12 months after&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Baseline study (4 months). A baseline investigation will be conducted to establish&#xD;
      the prevalence, duration and type of delirium symptoms in patients with acute acquired brain&#xD;
      injury. Usual care will be provided at this time. For validation a psychiatric team will rate&#xD;
      included patients usingThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth&#xD;
      Edition (DSM-V) and The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as the gold&#xD;
      standard. The psychiatric team assesses patients the first and second day after the patient&#xD;
      has a RASS -2 or above for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Intervention study (4 months). After full implementation of the intervention bundle,&#xD;
      the study will be conducted to establish the prevalence, duration and type of delirium&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with acute acquired brain injury. The psychiatric team assesses patients&#xD;
      the first and second day after the patient has a RASS -2 or above for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of intervention An all day workshop introducing the multi-modal intervention&#xD;
      bundle will be held for all nurses in the unit. The study nurses will be specially trained to&#xD;
      maintain study protocol. Physicians will be informed and trained on a weekly morning meeting&#xD;
      during phase II, and some will participate in the all day workshop. Journal audits will be&#xD;
      used as monitoring the implementation. The Intervention bundle consist of a sedation, sleep,&#xD;
      mobilization and pain treatment regimen based on the newest available evidence in the four&#xD;
      areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation: Sedatives will be kept to a minimum by daily orders for target RASS sedation level&#xD;
      and titration of sedatives by primary nurse. Dose and agent will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep: Sleep will be optimized by systematic use of earplugs at night, dim lighting,&#xD;
      visitation restrictions, and midday rest periods. Procedures (e.g. blood samples) will be&#xD;
      carried out in the day time instead of night time. Hours of activity/rest will be assessed by&#xD;
      an actiwatch (actigraph).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain: A strategy of multi-modal pain management combining pharmacological and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological interventions will be implemented. Pain will be assessed by Critical-Care&#xD;
      Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) for unresponsive patients and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for&#xD;
      patient-reported pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobilization: Systematic early mobilization will be implemented by daily orders for&#xD;
      mobilization level and a mobilization guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Follow-up will be conducted on all possible patients in the two study groups at&#xD;
      twelve months post N-ICU discharge. Patients will come to the hospital for the EQ-5D for&#xD;
      self-rated health, RBANS for cognitive function and the MMSE questionnaire for dementia&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The study includes an observational and an interventional part&#xD;
      introducing optimized treatment and care according to current best international evidence.&#xD;
      The intervention items will be implemented in the entire unit as standard care for all&#xD;
      patients. Most patients will be unable to give initial consent to the study due to their&#xD;
      cerebral status. Relatives and general practitioner will be contacted and informed verbally&#xD;
      and in writing to provide consent by proxy. The study is approved by the Regional and&#xD;
      national ethics committees and the Danish Data Protection Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Prevalence, type and duration of delirium symptoms in the baseline group will&#xD;
      be compared to the intervention group. Furthermore the two groups will be compared on LOS and&#xD;
      mortality. Patients ICDSC score are compared with EQ-5D, RBANS and MMSE in order to&#xD;
      investigate possible associations between delirium and self-rated health, cognitive function&#xD;
      and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be coded and plotted in Excel and SPSS for the statistical data analysis.&#xD;
      Hardware and worksheets are handled and stored as prescribed by the Danish Data Protection&#xD;
      Agency. There will be used descriptive and analytical statistics. Categorical variables will&#xD;
      be described as frequency and percent. Continuous variables will be described as mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD). The two groups will be compared by correlation analysis, univariate&#xD;
      and multivariate regression analyzes and questionnaires are analyzed by a paired t-test to&#xD;
      compare the two groups' average score.&#xD;
