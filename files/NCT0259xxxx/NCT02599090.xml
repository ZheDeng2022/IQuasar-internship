      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of sorafenib&#xD;
      that can be given in combination with temozolomide. The safety of this combination will also&#xD;
      be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib is designed to stop the cell growth and to block the formation of new blood vessels&#xD;
      (the tubes that carry blood around the body), which are involved in the growth and&#xD;
      development of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide is designed to kill cancer cells by damaging DNA (the genetic material of&#xD;
      cells). The damaged DNA may cause tumor cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 4&#xD;
      groups based on when you joined this study. You will remain in the same group for the entire&#xD;
      study. In this study, the dose of the study drugs is different from group to group, and the&#xD;
      doses are also different during and after radiation. During radiation, the study drugs and&#xD;
      doses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will take temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Groups 2 or 3, you will take temozolomide and the lower dose of sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 4, you will take temozolomide and the higher dose of sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During radiation, all the groups will take the same dose of temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Groups 1 or 2, you will take the higher dose of temozolomide on a shorter&#xD;
           cycle and the higher dose of sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 3, you will take the lower dose of temozolomide on a longer cycle&#xD;
           and the lower dose of sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 4, you will take the lower dose of temozolomide on a longer cycle&#xD;
           and the higher dose of sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of study drugs you receive may change if you experience side effects. If at any&#xD;
      time you experience any intolerable side effects, tell the study doctor right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a part of standard of care, you will receive radiation therapy Monday-Friday for a total&#xD;
      of 30 radiation treatments (about 6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day while you are receiving radiation, you will take the temozolomide by mouth once a&#xD;
      day (up to a maximum of 7 weeks). On Monday-Friday, you will take temozolomide 1 hour before&#xD;
      radiation therapy. On Saturday and Sunday, you will take temozolomide in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should swallow temozolomide whole, one right after the other, without chewing them. If&#xD;
      you vomit while taking temozolomide, you cannot take more capsules before the next scheduled&#xD;
      dose. They should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after&#xD;
      eating) with 1 cup (about 8 oz.) of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day while you are receiving radiation, you will take sorafenib by mouth 2 times a day&#xD;
      (in the morning and evening) (up to a maximum of 7 weeks). You should take sorafenib without&#xD;
      food (1 hour before or 2 hours after eating), with at least 1 cup (8 oz.) of water. If you&#xD;
      are in Group 1, you will not take sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will not take the study drug(s) for about 4 weeks after the radiation therapy ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1 or 2, on Days 1-5 of every 28-day study cycle, you will take&#xD;
           temozolomide by mouth once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 3 or 4, on Days 1-21 of every cycle, you will take temozolomide by&#xD;
           mouth once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day of each cycle, all groups will take sorafenib by mouth 2 times (in the morning and&#xD;
      evening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week while you are receiving radiation therapy, you will be asked about any drugs you&#xD;
      may be taking and if you have experienced any side effects. Your blood pressure will be&#xD;
      measured. Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 3-4 weeks after the end of radiation therapy, you will have a MRI scan to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every cycle, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 7, 14, and 21 of Cycle 1 and on Days 7 and 14 (or 21) of Cycles 2 and beyond, blood&#xD;
      (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every other cycle (Cycles 3, 5, 7, and so on), you will have a MRI scan to check&#xD;
      the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week of Cycle 1, your blood pressure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for about 15 months total. You will be taken off study early if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you go off study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Temozolomide is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of brain tumors. Sorafenib is FDA approved and commercially available for the&#xD;
      treatment of kidney cancer, but it is experimental for use in brain tumors. In addition, the&#xD;
      combination of temozolomide and Sorafenib is experimental for use in brain tumors. At this&#xD;
      time, the combination is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 51 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
