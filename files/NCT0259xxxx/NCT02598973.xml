  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately&#xD;
      80,000 Veterans, representing a priority area for VA research. Current medicines for PD only&#xD;
      improve symptoms, treatments that slow disease progression are needed, and earlier diagnosis&#xD;
      of PD may be the key to their development. PD symptoms can be mimicked by medicines (most&#xD;
      commonly antipsychotic drugs that block dopamine), and some of these patients actually have&#xD;
      underlying &quot;prodromal&quot; PD that was &quot;unmasked&quot; years before it would have caused symptoms.&#xD;
      This problem is increasing as these medicines are now used for common conditions including&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. The investigators will identify prodromal PD&#xD;
      in patients with drug-induced symptoms using brain scans. These patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      a randomized clinical trial of aerobic exercise which slows progression in animal models of&#xD;
      PD and has other health benefits. The investigators will measure the effect of exercise on&#xD;
      symptoms, disease progression (using brain scans) and markers of PD risk (using blood tests).&#xD;
      These studies will improve early PD diagnosis and potentially identify a way to slow&#xD;
      progression of PD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 1&#xD;
      million US adults and about 80,000 Veterans. PD causes significant morbidity due to motor and&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms across its prolonged course with an annual economic burden of $14 billion&#xD;
      in the US alone. Motor symptoms associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD may be&#xD;
      temporarily improved with dopamine replacing medicines, but disease-modifying therapies that&#xD;
      delay or prevent neuronal loss are lacking and sorely needed. Exercise is promising as a&#xD;
      disease-modifying therapy because it protects dopaminergic neurons in animal models of PD and&#xD;
      has been associated with measures of neuroplasticity in PD patients. Unfortunately, more than&#xD;
      half of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra are lost before motor symptoms occur&#xD;
      making it difficult to identify patients early enough to benefit from potentially&#xD;
      disease-modifying therapies. Early &quot;prodromal&quot; PD can be identified using non-motor features&#xD;
      including olfactory dysfunction and other biomarkers such as dopamine transporter (DaT) brain&#xD;
      imaging abnormalities that are apparent years before motor symptoms. However, these&#xD;
      strategies would be difficult and costly to implement on a population level without first&#xD;
      identifying high-risk individuals for screening. Commonly prescribed dopamine blocking&#xD;
      antipsychotic drugs cause debilitating PD-like motor dysfunction that is difficult to treat,&#xD;
      and in some patients this finding may serve as a &quot;stress test&quot; for failing dopaminergic&#xD;
      networks unmasking symptoms long before they would normally appear. Identifying prodromal PD&#xD;
      among drug-induced parkinsonism patients offers a unique and unexplored opportunity for early&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed studies, the investigators will employ a tiered screening strategy with&#xD;
      inexpensive and non-invasive olfactory testing in drug-induced parkinsonism patients followed&#xD;
      by DaT imaging in individuals with olfactory impairment to identify a cohort of patients with&#xD;
      presumed prodromal PD. Subjects with presumed prodromal PD will then be randomized to a&#xD;
      home-based exercise intervention ({5} times weekly aerobic walking confirmed by remote&#xD;
      activity monitors) or no intervention. In this cohort, the investigators will assess: 1)&#xD;
      Short-term symptomatic effects of exercise on motor function in drug-induced parkinsonism&#xD;
      using standard clinical measures (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) and quantitative&#xD;
      gait assessments after 8 weeks of intervention; 2) a potential disease-modifying effect after&#xD;
      52 weeks of exercise by comparing the rate of change in quantitative DaT imaging; and 3) the&#xD;
      mechanisms and biochemical correlates of exercise-induced changes using a panel of serum&#xD;
      biomarkers implicated in exercise and/or PD risk including brain-derived neurotrophic factor,&#xD;
      uric acid, and apolipoproteinA1. Differences in the rate of change between groups will be&#xD;
      assessed using independent samples t-tests and linear mixed-effects models adjusting for age&#xD;
      and gender. The investigators' preliminary data demonstrates a strong association between&#xD;
      olfactory impairment and abnormal DaT imaging in drug-induced parkinsonism. Based on power&#xD;
      calculations allowing for 20% dropout, the investigators will screen approximately 250&#xD;
      drug-induced parkinsonism subjects using olfactory testing, with the expectation that&#xD;
      approximately 88 will have abnormal DaT imaging and agree to participate in the intervention&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antipsychotic drugs are widely prescribed for a growing list of approved indications and&#xD;
      off-label uses including bipolar disorder, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.&#xD;
      Studying drug-induced parkinsonism patients with prodromal PD will allow us to identify which&#xD;
      individuals are at risk, characterize the natural history of progression and evaluate&#xD;
      appropriate management strategies at the earliest stages of PD. Exercise as a putative&#xD;
      disease-modifying therapy offers significant advantages including cost, ease of access and&#xD;
      lack of toxicity compared with unproven pharmacologic interventions especially if offered&#xD;
      early enough to have meaningful clinical impact.&#xD;
