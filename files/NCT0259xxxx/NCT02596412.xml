    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy may benefit from treatment with botulinum toxin injections to&#xD;
      decrease spasticity for improve function and quality of life. These injections cause repeated&#xD;
      pain throughout childhood and may be the cause of post-traumatic stress despite drug and&#xD;
      non-drug pain management. The Mini-Docs project of the French Red Cross has a module based on&#xD;
      a digital device with augmented reality. Distracting the child, the use of this module on a&#xD;
      tablet would reduce pain felt during botulinum toxin injections.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of the use of a module with augmented reality (Mini-Docs)&#xD;
      on pain during botulinum toxin injections in children with cerebral palsy aged from 3 to 8&#xD;
      years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Randomized controlled trial comparing a group of children receiving the module with&#xD;
      augmented reality of the Mini-Docs and drug pain management (nitrous oxide and medications),&#xD;
      with a group of children receiving the usual care of pain management that combines drug pain&#xD;
      management (nitrous oxide and medications) and distraction techniques. The device with the&#xD;
      augmented reality module allows the child to add virtual content to the real images of the&#xD;
      care. The pain will be assessed for each child 10 minutes after the injections, using a&#xD;
      self-assessment scale (the Faces Pain Scale - Revised) or a heteroevaluation scale (the Face&#xD;
      Legs Activity Cry Consolability scale given by the nurse). The study will be conducted in two&#xD;
      centers of physical medicine and pediatric rehabilitation of the French Red Cross (Paris and&#xD;
      Lyon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreasing children's pain during botulinum toxin injections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreasing anxiety in children and parents during injections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing coping skills in children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Facilitating of the achievement of the therapeutic goal during injections&#xD;

    <description>Standardized pain scores will be calculated on a scale from 0 to 10 points using validated tools adapted to the age of the child: the Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) and the Face Legs Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC).

Pain scores for 3-4 year olds and non-verbalizing children will be calculated using the Faces Legs Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) scale&#xD;
