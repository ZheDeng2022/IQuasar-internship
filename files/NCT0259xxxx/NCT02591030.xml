  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bile duct tumours are rare. They are the 6th most common type of digestive cancer. Their&#xD;
      therapeutic management is complex and must be multidisciplinary in nature. Most of the time,&#xD;
      an endoscopic or radiological biliary drainage is necessary before any tumour treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their prognosis is poor due to the fact that they are normally diagnosed late, which makes&#xD;
      curative surgery impossible. A population study in the Côte d'Or region of France reported a&#xD;
      survival rate at 5 years of approximately 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the locally advanced or metastatic forms, treatment has not been properly codified. With&#xD;
      respect to chemotherapy, prospective studies, most often phase II, are difficult to interpret&#xD;
      due to a limited number of patients and due to the heterogeneity of this type of tumour (bile&#xD;
      duct and pancreas tumours). Treatment with 5FU alone provides an objective response in&#xD;
      approximately 10% of cases. In combination with mitomycin or carboplatin, the objective&#xD;
      response rate is 20%, with a median survival period of 5 months. Interferon combined with 5FU&#xD;
      has a better response rate (30%), but occurrences of different types of toxicity are more&#xD;
      frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, gemcitabine and the 5FU-cisplatin combinations demonstrated objective tumour&#xD;
      control in 50% of patients with a median survival period of 10 months. Gemcitabine combined&#xD;
      with oxiplatin or with cisplatin has shown the same response rate but a median survival&#xD;
      period of approximately 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit of this combination has been confirmed in a phase III trial that compared the&#xD;
      gemcitabine-cisplatin combination to gemcitabine alone, in 410 patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      unresectable and/or metastatic bile duct cancer. The results were in favour of the combined&#xD;
      treatment with a median survival period of 11.7 months (versus 8.1 months - HR 0.64 [0.52 -&#xD;
      0.80]). This combination is currently the reference first-line treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the same time as these results, triple therapies involving 5FU + oxiplatin + irinotecan&#xD;
      have objectively shown a significant increase in overall survival of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared to gemcitabine alone (median of 11.1 months versus 6.8&#xD;
      months, HR = 0.57 [0.45 - 0.73] p &lt; 0.0001). The response rate and progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) have also been improved with these triple therapies; the response rates were 31.6%&#xD;
      versus 9.4% p &lt; 0.001 and the median PFS 6.4 months versus 3.3 months p &lt; 0.001,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adverse events observed with the triple therapy occurred more frequently, for febrile&#xD;
      neutropaenia (5.4%), with the need to treat with growth factors (G-CSF for 42.5% of&#xD;
      patients). Haematological and digestive toxicity was also higher: grade 3-4 neutropaenia was&#xD;
      observed for 45.7% of patients in the FOLFIRINOX arm and 18.7% of patients in the gemcitabine&#xD;
      arm (p = 0.0001); vomiting was noted for 14.5% of patients in the FOLFIRINOX arm and 4.7% in&#xD;
      the gemcitabine arm (p = 0.002). Quality of life was improved in the FOLFIRINOX arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the histological, therapeutic and prognostic similarities between pancreatic and bile&#xD;
      duct cancer, it is interesting to assess this triple therapy compared to the current&#xD;
      reference treatment in bile duct cancers: gemcitabine combined with cisplatin (GEMCIS). Due&#xD;
      to the known higher levels of toxicity for this triple therapy (digestive and&#xD;
      haematological), the investigators modified the conventional FOLFIRINOX regimen (mFOLFIRINOX)&#xD;
      by removing the 5-FU bolus at D1 of each cycle. This modification to the regimen would appear&#xD;
      not to decrease the efficacy of the treatment.&#xD;

    <description>In phase II, the primary endpoint is the percentage of patients alive without radiological progression (assessed according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria) at 6 months (after randomisation).&#xD;
Patients who are in radiological progression or who have died before the 6 months have elapsed will be considered a failure for the primary endpoint at 6 months (after randomisation).&#xD;
A medical review will be conducted to decide on patients without radiological progression at 6 months; in the light of their entire medical file, they may be considered a failure (i.e. in progression) or they may be considered to be truly non-assessable (a 5% surplus of patients has been planned for this situation).</description>
