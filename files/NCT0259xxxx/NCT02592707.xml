             the last dose. Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, or double&#xD;
             contraception: steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected) in&#xD;
             conjunction with a barrier method (intrauterine device, condom etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male patients must use a medically accepted method of contraception and must agree to&#xD;

             heart disease, etc.) or laboratory findings that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             might jeopardize the patient's safety or that would limit compliance with the&#xD;
             objectives and assessments of the study. Note: the patient should be able to tolerate&#xD;
             high volume load.&#xD;
&#xD;
