      In this study, the investigators aim to increase the liver tissue level of GSH in NAFLD&#xD;
      patients by short-term dietary serine supplementation and improve their liver function by&#xD;
      lowering the oxidative stress resulting from hepatic steatosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong correlation between major adverse health consequences of obesity and&#xD;
      development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is characterized by abnormal&#xD;
      hepatic accumulation of triglycerides and other lipids. It has become a worldwide health&#xD;
      problem that accelerates cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and especially premature&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma level of glutathione (GSH) is typically depleted in individuals with metabolism&#xD;
      related disorders. However, cellular GSH levels cannot be increased by supplementing GSH and&#xD;
      it must be synthesized within the liver either de novo or by salvation pathway. The&#xD;
      investigators found that the level of GSH is not enough to maintain and regulate the thiol&#xD;
      redox status of the liver in subjects with high hepatic steatosis at fasting stage due to the&#xD;
      depletion of glycine. Glycine can be synthesized via the interconversion of serine through&#xD;
      serine hydroxymethyl transferases (SHMT1 and SHMT2) with concomitant conversion of&#xD;
      tetrahydrofolate (THF) into 5,10-methylene-THF (CH2-THF). It has been shown that the serine&#xD;
      synthesis is downregulated in patients with NAFLD and supplementation of serine has&#xD;
      attenuated alcoholic fatty liver by enhancing homocysteine metabolism in mice and rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to increase the liver tissue level of GSH in NAFLD&#xD;
      patients by short-term dietary serine supplementation and improve their liver function by&#xD;
      lowering the oxidative stress resulting from hepatic steatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten obese patients (BMI 30 - 39.9 kg/m2) with ultrasound and CT-verified non-alcoholic fatty&#xD;
      liver disease (NAFLD). Subjects will be recruited from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage&#xD;
      Study (SCAPIS) in Gothenburg. The participants in this study (50-65-year-old men and women)&#xD;
      are randomly recruited from the Swedish Population and Address Register. Currently, 1050&#xD;
      subjects have been analyzed and 5000 additional subjects will be analyzed over the next 2&#xD;
      years. By January 2015, over 2000 subjects have been analyzed. Each subject is extensively&#xD;
      phenotyped over two days. This includes extensive blood samples, anthropometry, carotid and&#xD;
      liver ultrasound, and a CT examination that includes coronary calcium score, CT angiography&#xD;
      of coronary arteries, thoracic aorta, and assessment of epicardial fat, liver fat, and&#xD;
      subcutaneous abdominal fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary analysis of the first 1050 subjects indicates that approximately 20% fulfill the&#xD;
      criteria for NAFLD, consistent with data in other western populations.&#xD;
