      The purpose of this open-label pilot study is to determine the tolerability and applicability&#xD;
      of outpatient long-acting injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol) treatment in individuals age 16-25&#xD;
      (&quot;older youth&quot;) with opioid use disorder. Outpatient treatment will consist of a 7-day&#xD;
      outpatient detoxification / naltrexone induction procedure followed by 8-weeks of treatment&#xD;
      with Vivitrol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rates of opioid use in youth are rising. Long-acting injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol), a&#xD;
      medication that blocks the effects of opioid drugs, has been shown to be effective for&#xD;
      treatment of opioid dependence in adults. Vivitrol is an important option for individuals not&#xD;
      wanting agonist treatment (e.g. buprenorphine, methadone). Vivitrol may be particularly&#xD;
      appealing to youth who have difficulty reaching their opioid use goals with daily oral&#xD;
      medications as it is a monthly injection and therefore eliminates the problem of daily&#xD;
      medication non-adherence. Vivitrol may also be appealing to families as it reduces conflicts&#xD;
      around issues of adherence and thus supports positive parenting. Whereas Vivitrol has been&#xD;
      used clinically in minors, it has not been studied in a prospective outpatient trial.&#xD;
      Starting naltrexone, however, can be challenging in opioid-dependent individuals because&#xD;
      detoxification is required prior to treatment with this medication.There are no standard&#xD;
      outpatient detoxification protocols for opioid-dependent youth. Therefore, more studies are&#xD;
      needed to support broader and approved use of Vivitrol in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this open-label pilot study is to determine the tolerability and applicability&#xD;
      of outpatient long-acting injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol) treatment in individuals age 16-25&#xD;
      (&quot;older youth&quot;) with opioid use disorder. We aim to have 16 older youth complete this trial.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo an outpatient detoxification / induction procedure that has been&#xD;
      honed over the past 13 years of work with this medication by others in our Division and is&#xD;
      currently being used safely in opioid-dependent adults in an ongoing clinical trial. The&#xD;
      detoxification / induction procedure consists of a single day of buprenorphine followed by a&#xD;
      washout day and 4 days of ascending oral naltrexone doses prior to administering a dose of&#xD;
      injectable naltrexone, typically at Day 8. Participants will then receive an additional&#xD;
      Vivitrol injection 4 weeks after the first; they will also receive weekly medication&#xD;
      management therapy with a research psychiatrist. Following the 9 week trial, participants and&#xD;
      are eligible for an additional third injection followed by up to 4 weeks of therapy while&#xD;
      proper follow-up treatment is arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To determine the tolerability and applicability of outpatient Vivitrol treatment&#xD;
      in individuals aged 16-25 (&quot;older youth&quot;) with opioid use disorder as determined by retention&#xD;
      in treatment across the study. Outpatient treatment will consist of a 7-day detoxification /&#xD;
      naltrexone induction procedure followed by 8-weeks of treatment with Vivitrol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 1:To determine the tolerability of 7-day outpatient detoxification / naltrexone&#xD;
      induction for older youth as assessed by retention through first administration of Vivitrol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2:To determine the tolerability of initial (4-week) treatment with Vivitrol as&#xD;
      assessed by receipt of the second Vivitrol injection at week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 3:To determine the safety and tolerability of Vivitrol treatment as assessed&#xD;
      with measures of adverse events.&#xD;
