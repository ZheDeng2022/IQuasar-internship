  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Adolescence is an important period for brain development as a result of increased&#xD;
      synaptic plasticity. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are essential nutrients&#xD;
      for brain development and protection against oxidative stress. Walnuts have the highest n-3&#xD;
      PUFA concentrations of all edible plants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators hypothesize that walnut intake will increase n-3 PUFA&#xD;
      availability in the body to a level that enhances the development of the brain during&#xD;
      adolescence. The technicians will conduct a long-term (6 months) population-based randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in teenagers (n=400 in each arm), and determine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention (30 g of walnut kernels per day, ~1.5g of n-3 PUFA) in enhancing brain&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Fieldwork team will contact teenagers and families in collaboration with 20 high&#xD;
      schools. Families will receive a basic guide on following a healthy diet in order to ensure&#xD;
      implementation and adherence. Brain development outcomes will be measured at baseline and&#xD;
      after the intervention. The use of computerized neuropsychological tests will provide the&#xD;
      precision required to detect even subtle changes in brain development resulting from the&#xD;
      nutritional intervention. Behavioral (socio-emotional) development will be assessed in order&#xD;
      to cover a wider picture of brain development. Blood samples will be collected to measure n-3&#xD;
      PUFA levels before and after the intervention in a randomized subsample from both groups&#xD;
      (control/ intervention). Linear regression models adjusted for baseline neuropsychological&#xD;
      scores will be used to analyze the intervention effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: The outcomes of this Project are expected to be a greater understanding of the&#xD;
      role of n-3 PUFA intake (walnut) in brain development. A major goal in public health research&#xD;
      is to develop cost-effective health recommendations to teenagers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adolescence, an important window of opportunity and vulnerability for brain development&#xD;
      Although less well studied, adolescence is also a critical period of brain development. The&#xD;
      brain undergoes important organizational changes, with the re-emergence of&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone triggering a cascade of hormone dependent processes. Other&#xD;
      biological processes involve epigenetic factors, which are highly sensitive to the&#xD;
      environment and may therefore make this period of growth more vulnerable to external insults&#xD;
      (Morrison, 2013). Moreover, the prefrontal cortex, which carries out important functions such&#xD;
      as internally guided behaviors (control of emotion), logical thinking, working memory and&#xD;
      organizing skills (executive function), is the last region of the brain to mature&#xD;
      (early-twenties). The synaptic plasticity of the prefrontal cortex is accentuated during&#xD;
      adolescence, a process that involves loss of grey matter density, and an increase in white&#xD;
      matter volume, cerebral blood flow and synaptic pruning. Adolescence is also a time of&#xD;
      refinement of brain connectivity and complex behaviors (Selemon, 2013). It is widely&#xD;
      recognized that the synaptic plasticity of the brain decreases with age (Morrison, 2013;&#xD;
      Selemon, 2013), but this pattern does not seem to follow a linear trend, and adolescence is&#xD;
      an important period during which brain development can be enhanced and protected from&#xD;
      environmental hazards with long-term consequences (everything from air pollution to social&#xD;
      stress). There is a need for greater understanding of the biological pathways through which&#xD;
      the environment affects human brain development, particularly during adolescence, when the&#xD;
      most complex behaviors are refined to adulthood sophistication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, walnuts and brain development Nutrition during&#xD;
      pregnancy, lactation, childhood and adolescence has a fundamental influence on overall&#xD;
      development. Essential fatty acids are long chain polyunsaturated acids (LCPUFAs) that the&#xD;
      body cannot synthesize by itself, and must be obtained through the diet (mainly from oily&#xD;
      fish, seeds and nuts). Three of these fatty acids play an essential role in brain&#xD;
      development: omega-3 (docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids) and omega-6&#xD;
      (arachidonic acid (AA)) (McCann, 2005). LCPUFAs comprise approximately 15 to 30% of the&#xD;
      brain's dry weight (Hallahan, 2005), and are involved in the function and architecture of the&#xD;
      central nervous system throughout various stages of life. Studies show that DHA regulates&#xD;
      neurotransmission systems such as serotonergic, dopaminergic, norepinephrinergic, and&#xD;
      acetylcholinergic systems (Fontani, 2005). Of all edible plants, walnuts have the highest&#xD;
      level of the omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). ALA is the precursor for DHA and&#xD;
      EPA, the two most essential fatty acids for the brain (Carey, 2013). Walnuts are also rich in&#xD;
      fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other bioactive substances, such as phenolic antioxidants and&#xD;
      phytosterols (Bao, 2013). Several studies have confirmed an increment in blood n-3 PUFA&#xD;
      levels and improvements in lipid profile after a short-term intervention of a few walnuts per&#xD;
      day (Marangoni, 2007; Maranhao, 2011). While most human studies have shown the cardiovascular&#xD;
      benefits of walnut intake (Poulose, 2014), there is a need to investigate the potential&#xD;
      beneficial effects on brain development, some incipient research on adults show positive&#xD;
      results in cognition, these results are further described in Background section (Pribis,&#xD;
      2012; Sánchez-Villegas, 2011). These findings in adults provide a proof of concept for the&#xD;
      potential brain development benefits of walnuts, which never has been studied among young&#xD;
      teenagers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This question could be investigated by using a population-based randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      to assess whether walnut intake shows beneficial effects on teenage brain function (using&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessments). It is ethical and feasible to recommend and facilitate&#xD;
      walnut intake (30 g/day; Marangoni, 2007; Maranhao, 2011) over a long period of time (e.g. 12&#xD;
      months; de Ruyter, 2012). A Californian walnut contains ~0.40g of n-3 PUFAs (USDA National&#xD;
      Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, 2012), such that a few walnuts (kernel 30g) per day&#xD;
      would meet recommendations to consume at least 1g of n-3 PUFAs per day (Food and Nutritional&#xD;
      Board, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, US, 2014). Young Spanish adults&#xD;
      (16-25 years) eat about 10g of nuts per day on average (Salas, 2013). Sea food also contains&#xD;
      high n-3 PUFA concentrations, but sea food interventions are contra-indicated due to their&#xD;
      methylmercury content, an important neurotoxic environmental pollutant (Grandjean, 2014). A&#xD;
      limitation of using walnuts is that intake is less consistent than with a daily pill&#xD;
      supplement of 1g of DHA, although this specific food recommendation is socially&#xD;
      cost-effective and would be complied with by a wider range of people in the global health&#xD;
      context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological and behavioral assessment, using repeated measurements Recent experience&#xD;
      in incorporating neuropsychological assessment into our cohort studies from INMA (Environment&#xD;
      and Childhood, Guxens, 2012) has resulted in fruitful exchanges of knowledge between&#xD;
      neuropsychologists and epidemiologists. Computerized neuropsychological tests performed in&#xD;
      repeated exams are the most sensitive tool for studying high-order brain function and&#xD;
      development in the general population (Julvez, 2010). Moreover, these tests have been shown&#xD;
      in population-based studies to be very sensitive to the effects of environmental and&#xD;
      nutritional determinants (Julvez, 2013). The investigators will build on this experience to&#xD;
      efficiently select the appropriate range of tests to cover the complex neurofunctions that&#xD;
      rapidly develop during adolescence, such as computer tests of working memory, executive&#xD;
      function, motor speed, visual reasoning, selective and sustained attention and inhibitory&#xD;
      functions (Selemon, 2012). Furthermore, the neuropsychological tests will be complemented by&#xD;
      behavioral rating scales aimed at covering the socio-emotional endpoints that are so&#xD;
      important during early adolescence (Selemon, 2012; Morrison, 2013). The fact to evaluate&#xD;
      other behavioral areas (i.e., social competence and ADHD symptoms) may enrich the&#xD;
      interpretation of the findings, and, possibly it contributes to further understand the&#xD;
      intrinsic mechanisms. One limitation is the risk of losing outcome consistency because of&#xD;
      selecting much dispersed behavioral areas without taking into account the link between them.&#xD;
      The best option is a careful selection of neuropsychological and behavioral tools that&#xD;
      efficiently embrace several areas of teenage brain development. Only a few trials of n-3 PUFA&#xD;
      among adolescents over 11 years have used computer-based neuropsychological tests (Janssen,&#xD;
      2014). A recent large randomized controlled trial among healthy young adults using&#xD;
      computerized cognitive tests found that reaction time latencies and working memory were&#xD;
      improved after 6 months of DHA supplementation (Stonehouse, 2013). A double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial among children with ADHD (7-12 years) found no treatment&#xD;
      associations, but in the observational data, a positive association between DHA levels and&#xD;
      computerized test scores of divided attention (Milte, 2012) was reported. Large trials&#xD;
      measuring neuropsychological functioning using repeated computerized tests within the same&#xD;
      subjects have not yet been carried out among healthy young adolescents, and this is required&#xD;
      to better understand 'normal' brain development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Walnut intake intervention for six months will enhance neuropsychological development&#xD;
           among teenagers from general population. The investigators expect to find differences&#xD;
           between the two groups (control/walnut) after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Walnut intake intervention for six months will enhance behavioral (socio-emotional)&#xD;
           development among teenagers from general population. The investigators expect to find&#xD;
           differences between the two groups after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Walnut intake intervention for six months will increase n-3 PUFA availability in the&#xD;
           body that will be measured in a blood subsample of 200 teenagers at least. The&#xD;
           investigators expect to find differences between the two groups (100/100) after the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. n-3 PUFA levels in blood will be associated with brain development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global Objective The global objective of this population-based randomized controlled trial is&#xD;
      to investigate whether the intake of 30 g of walnut kernels (or ~1.5g of n-3 PUFA) per day is&#xD;
      beneficial for brain development among teenagers. The combination of sophisticated tools for&#xD;
      assessing brain functions, such as computerized neuropsychological tests, will provide the&#xD;
      precise data required to detect even subtle changes in brain development resulting from the&#xD;
      effects of the nutritional intervention. Further assessments using behavioural rating scales&#xD;
      will give us a wider look of the potential effects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effectiveness of long-term intervention (30g of walnut kernels per day for&#xD;
           6 months) in enhancing neuropsychological development. This project will provide a new&#xD;
           understanding of the role of walnut intake (as a surrogate of n-3 PUFA intake) in the&#xD;
           brain development of teenagers. This has an important impact for global health&#xD;
           interventions due to the affordability of such interventions in diverse societal groups.&#xD;
           A major goal in public health research is to develop effective, cost-effective and&#xD;
           feasible health recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effectiveness of long-term intervention (30g of walnut kernels per day for&#xD;
           6 months) in enhancing behavioural development. In combination with neuropsychological&#xD;
           (or cognitive) development, teenage behavioural (socio-emotional) development is&#xD;
           essential for a wider assessment of brain development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate the effect of the intervention to n-3 PUFA levels in blood and investigate&#xD;
           the association between n-3 PUFA levels and brain development. The importance here&#xD;
           relies on understanding the potential biological pathway between the intervention and&#xD;
           brain development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives To assess the association of diet measured by FFQ and adolescent&#xD;
      neuropsychological function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the association of lifestyle habits assessed by general health questionnaire and&#xD;
      adolescent neuropsychological function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the association of ambient air pollution estimated by LUR models and adolescent&#xD;
      neuropsychological function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the association between different behavioral areas during adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the association between the walnut intervention and biomarkers related to pathways&#xD;
      of oxidative stress and inflammatory system and brain function. These biomarkers are related&#xD;
      to candidate circulating miRNAs from brain and a panel of metabolites from 5 different&#xD;
      classes (acylcarnitines, amino acids, hexoses, phospho-, and sphingolipids and biogenic&#xD;
      amines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY WALNUTB scientific approach consists of an ambitious randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      in a large population-based sample. Sample: The trial will include 400 healthy teenagers in&#xD;
      each arm (12-15 year old) from Barcelona city (1,900,000 inhabitants), the participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to two groups (intervention &amp; control) and followed up for 6 months (de&#xD;
      Ruyter, 2012) with two identical series (before and after the intervention) of multimodal&#xD;
      assessments of brain function, and biomarkers of n-3 PUFA. Power calculation for&#xD;
      neuropsychological outcomes: Assigning 400 participants each to the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups, and six primary outcomes were considered, with a correlation between them of 0.25.&#xD;
      The outcomes were considered to have mean 100 and standard deviation 15, as many&#xD;
      neuropsychological scores in the general population. The intervention effect to be detected&#xD;
      was 3 points. We considered a type-I error of 0.05 and corrected calculations for&#xD;
      multiplicity using Benjamini-Hochberg method. A 10% loss of follow-up was assumed.&#xD;
      Additionally, we assumed the final models had an R2 of 20%. With all these considerations,&#xD;
      the resulting study would have 95% power to detect the association with at least one outcome,&#xD;
      90% to detect at least two, 80% to detect at least 3, 70% to detect at least 4, 55% to detect&#xD;
      at least 5 and 31% to detect the association with all six outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP 1: The walnut intervention: Design and setting: This trial cannot be blinded due to the&#xD;
      nature of the intervention. The control group will receive no intervention, apart from&#xD;
      general healthy eating recommendations (as in the intervention group) and follow-up&#xD;
      assessments. Recruitment: Nurses will recruit teenagers (n=400 in each arm) in collaboration&#xD;
      with 20 high schools from Barcelona. Implementation and Adherence: The investigators will&#xD;
      perform age- and gender-stratified random sampling to assign subjects to one of the two&#xD;
      groups. All families will receive a basic guide on following a healthy diet in order to&#xD;
      ensure implementation and adherence. Families in the intervention group will receive&#xD;
      additional instructions on how to encourage the adolescent to eat 30 g of walnuts per day&#xD;
      during 6 months, which the investigators will supply for free. The nurses will contact the&#xD;
      families every 3 months for a short checking-interview and to administer a food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire (FFQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP 2: Fieldwork and neuropsychological assessment: The investigators will validate and&#xD;
      standardize computerized tests to reduce inter-observer variability during assessment and&#xD;
      ensure that data are recorded automatically without errors. Moreover, self-reported and&#xD;
      internationally validated psychometrical scales will be used to further assess adolescent&#xD;
      socio-emotional behaviour. In this project, the investigators will exploit the interaction&#xD;
      between neuropsychologists and epidemiologists to test a range of neuropsychological&#xD;
      functions that cover the various complex behaviours that are under development during&#xD;
      adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP 3: Study the intervention effects and the role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: In&#xD;
      order to investigate the effects of the intervention, valid measures of the outcomes are&#xD;
      necessary (WP2), as are valid measures of the intermediate factors, in this case plasma n-3&#xD;
      PUFA levels. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and after the intervention,&#xD;
      centrifuged, and plasma samples stored at -80°C until analysis. Statistical Analysis: The&#xD;
      following statistical analyses will be carried out: 1) Assess the effect of the intervention&#xD;
      on the ratio of n-6 PUFA to n-3 PUFA (n6-n3 ratio) using linear regression models adjusted&#xD;
      for baseline levels. 2) Assess the effect of the intervention on brain development, using the&#xD;
      method described in 1) above; 3) Assess the effect of n6-n3 ratio on brain development at&#xD;
      baseline, and of n6-n3 ratio change on brain development change from baseline to follow-up.&#xD;
      4) Assess the proportion of the effect of the intervention on brain development that is&#xD;
      mediated by n6-n3 ratio change. This proportion can be calculated by comparing results from&#xD;
      models with and without the mediator. Analyses 1), 2) and 3) (i.e. those involving the&#xD;
      intervention) will be based on intention-to-treat, i.e. using intervention (no/yes)&#xD;
      regardless of compliance, in order to estimate the effects of the policy (i.e. to encourage&#xD;
      eating 30 g of walnuts per day), rather than the effect of walnut consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Frame: The investigators expect to do the recruitment and design the intervention and&#xD;
      perform a pilot during the first 12 months (ongoing since January 2015), and to implement the&#xD;
      intervention and perform follow-up during 12-24 months. The baseline and final assessments&#xD;
      will be completed after 24 months (if the investigators include 2015), the total duration of&#xD;
      fieldwork is two years and a third year will be needed to perform data analyses.&#xD;
