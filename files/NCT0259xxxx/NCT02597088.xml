  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human milk (HM) is more than a food complex; in addition to micronutrients and human-coded&#xD;
      bioactive complexes it also includes many antioxidants, antibacterial, prebiotics,&#xD;
      probiotics, immune-boosting constituents, and many other bioactive components. Some of these&#xD;
      components may deteriorate during storage, and expressed EHM starts deteriorating as soon as&#xD;
      it leaves the breast. Nevertheless, whenever nursing at the breast or feeding of fresh EHM is&#xD;
      not possible, feeding of stored EHM is considered the next best thing to feeding at the&#xD;
      breast. Efficient heat transfer abilities affect both heating and cooling processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators wish to test a new device that permits rapid heating and&#xD;
      cooling processes. The investigators plan to measure some thermolabile constituents of HM in&#xD;
      order to determine whether they might be protected by a more gentle warming process. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to collect milk from mother, to mix it and to test the effect of storage&#xD;
      and heating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment is design to test the feasibility and the efficiency of the device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exclusive breastfeeding is the normative model against which all alternative feeding methods&#xD;
      must be measured with regard to infant growth, health, development, and all other short and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations for what is &quot;safe&quot; storage of Expressed HM have been developed, mainly for&#xD;
      use by HM banks, but what constitutes optimal storage is less evident. Optimal handling of&#xD;
      Expressed HM (EHM) should include proper storage as well as proper heating and thawing prior&#xD;
      to use, in order to reduce damage to its nutritional and bioactive components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficient heat transfer abilities affect both heating and cooling processes. In a previous&#xD;
      work , the investigators showed that overheating of EHM is highly probable when using&#xD;
      commercially available electrical water-based bottle warmers, even if the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations are followed . Besides warming process, EHM stability can also be affected by&#xD;
      container composition and shape, storage temperature and whether or not sterilization was&#xD;
      effected prior to storage. Following our previous study, the investigators hypothesized that&#xD;
      a non-standard storage and warming process may increase EHM preservation. The investigators&#xD;
      therefore designed a novel device with larger surface area and narrower milk width in order&#xD;
      to minimize temperature gradients within the milk volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to store and heat HM in regular baby bottle and in our device and test&#xD;
      thermolabile properties of HM, such as certain proteins and microbiological cultures, to&#xD;
      asses if the new device can indeed protect the milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to obtain EHM from mothers, the investigators will collected freshly pumped milk The&#xD;
      pumped milk will be pooled into a single container. A milk samples will be taken to define&#xD;
      the reference values then it will equally divide into three study containers and into six&#xD;
      control containers (C-container, regular baby bottles). After filling, all containers will be&#xD;
      placed in a dark refrigerator at the temperature of 4ºC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will last for 5 days. On the first day, one S-container and two C-containers&#xD;
      will be taken out of the refrigerator and tested: the milk in each container will be warmed&#xD;
      to feeding temperature in the container; it was then stirred gently and a sample of the&#xD;
      warmed milk was obtained and stored at -20ºC until analyzed. This procedure was repeated on&#xD;
      days 3 and 5 of the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The warming procedure used on the C-containers was as follows: the C-container will be warmed&#xD;
      in standard electric water-based bottle warmer. Usually the warmer has three heating options;&#xD;
      fast, medium, and slow. Investigators plan to test the fastest option on three of the six&#xD;
      bottles and the slowest option on the remaining three bottles. The heating process will be&#xD;
      terminated once the temperature of the heated milk reached 37ºC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The warming procedure used on the S-containers was as follows: the S-container was placed in&#xD;
      a bowl containing water at approximately 40ºC and gently moved in circles until the EHM&#xD;
      reached 37 ºC.&#xD;
