      This study aims to compare the pain degree between primary cesarean section and repeated&#xD;
      cesarean section, and investigate the role of flurbiprofen axetil in postoperative analgesia,&#xD;
      so as to provide reference for clinical practice.&#xD;

      No premedication was given. The temperature of the operating room was maintained at 22˚ C.&#xD;
      Patients were positioned supine with 15° left lateral tilt achieved using a wedge under the&#xD;
      right buttock. Electrocardiograph(ECG), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate&#xD;
      (HR) were monitored by one anesthesiologist (S/5 Anesthesia Monitor, GE Healthcare, Helsinki,&#xD;
      Finland). Peripheral vein catheterization on the right hand was then performed, but no&#xD;
      prehydration was given. A fixed volume of 500 ml hydroxyethyl starch solution was infused at&#xD;
      the rate of 0.2 ml•kg-1•min-1, then Lactated Ringer's solution was infused at the same rate&#xD;
      to the end of surgery. Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was administered with patients in&#xD;
      the left lateral position at the L3-4 vertebral interspace. A 16-gauge Tuohy needle was&#xD;
      placed in the epidural space using loss of resistance to saline, then a 25-gauge Whitacre&#xD;
      spinal needle was inserted through the Tuohy needle until the dura mater was punctured. Once&#xD;
      free flow of clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was observed in the spinal needle, 10 mg (2 mL)&#xD;
      of isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% was diluted with CSF to 2.5 mL, then injected over 15-30 s.&#xD;
      After placement and fixation of an epidural catheter, the patients were positioned supine&#xD;
      with 15° left lateral tilt, and oxygen was given via nasal catheter at 2L.min-1. The sensory&#xD;
      block level to cold was monitored every three minutes (1, 4, 7 and 10 min) with alcohol swabs&#xD;
      and was recorded at the time point of 10 min. Hypotension was defined as SBP lower than 80%&#xD;
      of the baseline value, and was treated with intravenous phenylephrine 100 µg as required.&#xD;
      Intravenous atropine 0.3 mg was given for severe sinus bradycardia (HR &lt; 50 beats/min).&#xD;
      Surgery was allowed to start after the sensory block reached the T6 level; if this level was&#xD;
      not achieved, patients were excluded from the study. For patients with inadequate sensory&#xD;
      block, 1.5% lidocaine was given through the epidural catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four groups were divided based on surgical types and postoperative analgesia regimens, with&#xD;
      20 cases in each group: primary cesarean section + postoperative analgesia with sufentanil&#xD;
      plus flurbiprofen axetil group(Group SF1), primary cesarean section+postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      with sufentanil group (Group S1), repeated cesarean Section + postoperative analgesia with&#xD;
      sufentanil plus flurbiprofen axetil group(Group SF2), and repeated cesarean section+&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia with sufentanil group(Group S2). Analgesia regimen: PCIA,100 ml;&#xD;
      sufentanil 100 ug, ramosetron 0.3 mg, flurbiprofen axetil 100 mg (varied in groups);&#xD;
      backgroup dosage 2 ml/h, PCA 2 ml each time, lock time 20 min. The scores of incision pain&#xD;
      and uterine contraction pain 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after operation and the dose and pumping&#xD;
      times of analgesia pump 24 h after operation were recorded.&#xD;
