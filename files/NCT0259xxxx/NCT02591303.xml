  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is characterized by rumination and worry over stressful events affecting nighttime&#xD;
      sleep. Emotional reactions while stressful events are ongoing have not often been&#xD;
      investigated in insomnia. In the current study stress reactions will be measured during a&#xD;
      real-life simulation experiment with stressful events and investigate not only how previous&#xD;
      sleep patterns affect emotional reactivity to the event but also how the emotional events&#xD;
      affect sleep patterns the following night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-six female subjects (age 25-45 years) without sleep complaints (n=18) or with insomnia&#xD;
      (n=18) will enroll in a interventional study measuring the reaction to and effects of either&#xD;
      neutral or stressful events during driving. Through questionaires and intake polysomnography,&#xD;
      clinical levels of depression and anxiety will be excluded as well as sleep medication use&#xD;
      and alternative sleep disorders than insomnia. Stress levels will be measured through skin&#xD;
      conductance and heart rate variability during events and through nighttime polysomnography&#xD;
      (PSG). Effects on sleep architecture and arousal levels will be measured through nighttime&#xD;
      PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that subjects with insomnia, compared to subjects without sleep&#xD;
      complaints, show stronger emotional reactions to stressful events and stronger effects of&#xD;
      stress on sleep quality the following night. Results will facilitate a model for emotional&#xD;
      reactivity in chronic sleep disruption which may aid to prevent short term sleep disruption&#xD;
      converting into chronic insomnia and aid in developing customized insomnia treatment.&#xD;
