  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plague is a potentially fatal infection in humans caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis.&#xD;
      Pneumonic plague is typically diagnosed in humans with high mortality. It has a long history&#xD;
      for plague as an agent of biowarfare, and poses a serious threat to international security.&#xD;
      Althought the killed whole-cell plague vaccine and live attenuated vaccine have been&#xD;
      licensed, they are rarely used today because of toxicities, limited evidence for efficacy to&#xD;
      prevent plague, and limited commercial availability. In the last twenty years,the recombinant&#xD;
      subunit vaccines comprised by fraction 1 capsule(F1)and virulence-associated (V)antigens as&#xD;
      the main composition have caused widely attention with providing greater protection than&#xD;
      vaccines comprised of either subunit alone. This study was aimed to explor the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a new type plague subunit vaccine which comprised natural F1 antigen and&#xD;
      recombined V antigen (F1+rV).&#xD;

      Plague is a potentially fatal infection in humans caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis,&#xD;
      transmitted naturally from rodent reservoirs to humans via fleas. Human diseases may also&#xD;
      result from contact with blood or tissues of infected animals or exposure to aerosolized&#xD;
      droplets containing bacteria. Pneumonic plague is typically diagnosed in humans with with&#xD;
      high mortality. It has a long history for plague as an agent of biowarfare, and poses a&#xD;
      serious threat to international security. In human history, there were three outbreaks of&#xD;
      plague all over the world, about 200 million people died from the disease. The increasing&#xD;
      trend of plague epidemic in recent years, some regions and countries in the world still have&#xD;
      the outbreak of the plague. It implies that safe and effective vaccine is urgently to&#xD;
      developing. Althought the killed whole-cell plague vaccine and live attenuated vaccine have&#xD;
      been licensed, these vaccines cause significant adverse reactions, including fever, headache,&#xD;
      malaise, lymphadenopathy, erythema and induration at the injection site with high degree of&#xD;
      immune variability. They are rarely used today because of toxicities, limited evidence for&#xD;
      efficacy to prevent plague, and limited commercial availability. Based on the researches in&#xD;
      the last twenty years,the recombinant subunit vaccines comprised by fraction 1 capsule(F1)and&#xD;
      virulence-associated (V)antigens as the main composition have caused widely attention with&#xD;
      providing greater protection than vaccines comprised of either subunit alone. This study was&#xD;
      aim to exploring the safety and immunogenicity of a new type plague subunit vaccine which&#xD;
      comprised by native F1 antigen and recombined V antigen (F1+rV).&#xD;
