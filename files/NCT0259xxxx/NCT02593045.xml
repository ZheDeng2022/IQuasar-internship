      The primary objective of this first in human study is to assess the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of increasing intravenous (IV) doses of single agent IPH4102 administered to patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory CTCL to characterize the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and identify a&#xD;
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).&#xD;

               -  ≥4 weeks for monoclonal antibodies (≥8 weeks for alemtuzumab),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥3 weeks for local radiation therapy, systemic cytotoxic anticancer therapy,&#xD;
                  treatment with other anti-neoplastic investigational agents&#xD;

                  imiquimod) Topical steroids (maximum strength: medium potency) and oral steroids&#xD;
                  (≤10 mg prednisone equivalent/day) are allowed, if the patient has been on a&#xD;
                  stable dose with stable symptoms for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status of ≤2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adequate baseline laboratory data: hemoglobin &gt;9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&#xD;
             ≥1,000/µL, CD4+ T-cells ≥200/µL, platelets ≥50,000/µL, bilirubin ≤1.5 X upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN) or ≤3 X ULN for patients with Gilbert's disease, serum creatinine ≤1.5 X&#xD;
