  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal bacterial infection remains a serious pathology in industrialized countries despite&#xD;
      the use of prophylaxis measures for group B streptococcus (GBS) (peri-partum antibiotic in&#xD;
      women with GBS colonization), which was implemented in the United States in 1996 and in&#xD;
      France in 2001 and has led to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of neonatal bacterial&#xD;
      infections. However, early onset neonatal infection (EONI), which is defined as an infection&#xD;
      occurring during the first 6 days after birth (as opposed to late onset neonatal infections&#xD;
      (LONI) occurring between days 7-89), is still one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Physicians consider EONI a significant diagnostic and therapeutic emergency&#xD;
      due to the potential for sudden onset and rapid evolution of sepsis in newborns with immature&#xD;
      immune systems. Currently, in France, detection of EONI is based on national consensus&#xD;
      guidelines published in 2002 (ANAES recommendations). There are broad indications to provide&#xD;
      empirical antibiotic treatment pending diagnostic confirmation through different&#xD;
      complementary exams. To ensure that every infected newborn is diagnosed, biological&#xD;
      assessments are often repeated and result in the use of invasive and painful procedures,&#xD;
      anemia and financial concerns. Moreover, in cases of abnormal biological results, many&#xD;
      newborns are subjected to intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatments requiring hospitalization&#xD;
      and separation from their mother. However recent studies have shown that antibiotics can have&#xD;
      a potentially deleterious effect on the neonatal digestive microbiota and result in the&#xD;
      appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, with possible long-term consequences on the&#xD;
      health of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procalcitonin (PCT) is a calcitonin prohormone secreted from the parenchymal tissues. This&#xD;
      marker of inflammation has been shown to be a valuable diagnostic marker for bacterial&#xD;
      infection in adults and in children. It also seems to be a reliable marker for neonatal&#xD;
      bacterial infection, which would make it useful in the detection of EONI. Because&#xD;
      physiological levels of PCT vary during the first days of life, possibly due to postnatal&#xD;
      intestinal bacterial colonization, levels of this marker are difficult to interpret in the&#xD;
      early neonatal period. However, in a study of 2151 newborns with suspected EONI, Nicolas&#xD;
      Joram et al. found that PCT obtained from the umbilical blood cord, prior to newborn&#xD;
      intestinal colonization, bypasses this postnatal physiological peak of PCT and effectively&#xD;
      constitutes a discriminant marker to distinguish between infected and healthy infants using a&#xD;
      cutoff value of 0.6 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent to this pilot study, several studies on PCT in umbilical blood cord confirmed its&#xD;
      good diagnostic performance for EONI, particularly when included in a diagnostic algorithm.&#xD;
      This marker could contribute to a better estimation of EONI risk in order to limit the use of&#xD;
      unnecessary complementary exams and prescription of antibiotics and their associated short-&#xD;
      and long-term side effects in healthy newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, the investigators propose to test the diagnostic value of a&#xD;
      PCT-based algorithm in newborns suspected of having EONI. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      this algorithm is as efficient as those currently used (ANAES), but will limit coinciding&#xD;
      biological exams and exposure to antibiotics during the neonatal period.&#xD;

    <measure>Primary outcome is a composite outcome including: death from any cause, intensive care unit admission for any reason, disease-specific complications, diagnosis of EONI after maternity discharge, need for antibiotics with hospital readmission</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days after birth</time_frame>
    <description>The primary noninferiority endpoint is a composite of overall adverse outcomes induced by EONI occuring within 6 days following birth. It includes death, Neonatal Intensive care Unit (NICU) admission, or hospital readmission. The investigators chose this primary endpoint because the French definition of EONI diagnostic is subjective, specifically in case of possible EONI in case of gastric fluid positivity, and is finally rarely objectivated. Moreover, the new PCT-based algorithm do not require any gastric fluid analysis and modify the usual French definition of possible EONI, impossible to use in this context. Focusing on serious adverse event outcomes seems a very pragmatic and efficient methodologic strategy.</description>
