      The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of systemic treatments on genomic&#xD;
      profiles in patients with breast cancer and to compare genomic profiling between&#xD;
      premenopausal and postmenopausal women by systemic treatments in breast cancer.&#xD;

      Prospective single arm trial using three patients' cohorts. One-hundred patients for each&#xD;
      cohort and a total of 300 patients (600 biopsy samples) will be entered to this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that genomic alterations measured by CancerSCAN and cfDNA, Whole exome&#xD;
      sequencing (WES), Whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), FACS(Fluorescence-Activated Cell&#xD;
      Sorting), cytokine and immunologic signature analysis would be different between pre- and&#xD;
      post-menopausal women and would be predictive biomarkers for each cohort according to pre-&#xD;
      and post-menopausal status. Three groups of patients will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patients who receive neoadjuvant systemic treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patients who have distant metastatic sites at first and recur from surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patients who are going to receive first-line chemotherapy&#xD;
