      Traditional treatment options for optic nerve sheath meningiomas (ONSM) include observation,&#xD;
      surgery and radiotherapy, but to date none of these has become the clear treatment of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the radiotherapy remained uncertain because of the concern about radiation&#xD;
      related optic neuropathy In the recent past two large series of patients treated with a&#xD;
      fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy confirmed these positive experiences in tumour control&#xD;
      and greatly reduced the concern about the treatment related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the light of successful meningiomas treatment, radiosurgery, had proposed as a&#xD;
      treatment option. Single session, high conformality, frame based radiosurgery systems are&#xD;
      seldom if ever proposed as ONSMs treatment due to the known dose tolerance of the optic&#xD;
      nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first experience in ONSMs treatment with multisession radiosurgery treatment was quite&#xD;
      promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      multisession radiosurgery in ONSMs treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate multisession radiosurgery 50 patients will be enrolled in the present&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated by using multisession radiosurgery, with 5 fractions of 5 Gy&#xD;
      each to a total dose of 25 Gy prescribed to the 75-85% isodose line. Patients were evaluated&#xD;
      both for tumor growth control and visual function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Optic Nerve Sheath Meningiomas (ONSMs) are rare tumours. They represent&#xD;
      approximately the 2% of all orbital tumours, 1-2% of intracranial meningiomas and one third&#xD;
      of the optic nerve lesions (23, 32, 42, 43). Usually these tumour are monolateral but 5% have&#xD;
      a bilateral development (33) On the base of the growth pattern these tumours can be&#xD;
      classified in primary and secondary forms. The former type arise from the arachnoid cap cell&#xD;
      of the fibrous dural capsule of the optic nerve and they usually growth circumferentially&#xD;
      along the nerve. Primary ONSMs can be further subdivided in orbital and intracanalicular&#xD;
      forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary ONSMs usually arise from the sphenoid ridge or the tuberculum sellae and&#xD;
      subsequently spread into the optic canal and the orbit (14, 42).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often the pathological studies show meningotheliomatous or transitional histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Middle aged woman are the most often affected (4, 36, 44). The most frequent presentation&#xD;
      symptom is a visual loss, both in acuity or visual field. This is nearly an expression of an&#xD;
      optic nerve direct compression and of the vascular rearrangement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optic nerve atrophy is common. Optociliary shunts are a late and rare sign but they are the&#xD;
      direct expression of compressive optic neuropathy and it can be pathognomonic for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ONSM (35, 43).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally treatment options include observation, surgery and radiotherapy but, until now,&#xD;
      any of these had assumed as the treatment of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the development of the new technology improved the interest in radiotherapy&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative treatment can be considered due to the benign nature of the meningiomas and&#xD;
      their slow growth pattern. Nevertheless this unavoidably leads to a visual deterioration or&#xD;
      complete blindness (18, 33, 43, 44).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is advocate for tumour administration, particularly in case of a progressive visual&#xD;
      loss or complete blindness, tumour progression and intracranial involvement. Anyway because&#xD;
      of their intimate relationship to the optic nerve, ophthalmic artery and central retina&#xD;
      artery ONSMs complete removal is extremely challenging. Moreover post-operative course is&#xD;
      often characterized by symptoms worsening (4, 8, 9, 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recent past, the role of the radiotherapy remained uncertain: many author reported a&#xD;
      positive experience, but the concern about complication and secondary effects strongly&#xD;
      limited its acceptance (4, 5, 16, 21, 22, 26, 29, 31, 32). Radiation optic neuropathy has&#xD;
      been described following conventional radiotherapy treatments (45 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction)&#xD;
      (40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently two large series of patients treated with a fractionated stereotactic&#xD;
      radiotherapy confirmed these positive experiences in tumour control and greatly reduced the&#xD;
      concern about the treatment related toxicity (6, 27).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the light of successful meningiomas treatment, radiosurgery had proposed as a treatment&#xD;
      option. Single session, high conformality, frame based radiosurgery systems are seldom if&#xD;
      ever proposed as ONSMs treatment due to the known dose tolerance of the optic nerve (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of the radiosurgery technology, starting in 1994, introduced a new and&#xD;
      effective therapeutic option (3, 11, 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way it is possible to exploit the different recovery speed of normal and pathological&#xD;
      tissues to optimize the tumour control and at the same time to spare the surrounding&#xD;
      structure avoiding damage to the visual pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, the comparison between various fractionation regimens resulting in roughly&#xD;
      equivalent biologically equivalent dose (BED) for tumour control and normal tissue late&#xD;
      effects (assuming that tumour and normal tissue late effect have a similar α/β ratio). In&#xD;
      this way the acute (early) reactions would be reduced with larger fractions size (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first experience in ONSMs treatment with multisession radiosurgery treatment was quite&#xD;
      promising (32).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      multisession radiosurgery in ONSMs treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be evaluated both in terms of tumour growth control and sparing for&#xD;
      vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient's population. XX patients affected by an Optic Nerve Sheath&#xD;
      Meningioma (ONSM), both orbital and intra-canalicular will be considered for a multisession&#xD;
      radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusions criteria are a significant visual impairment at presentation, progression of&#xD;
      visual dysfunction during the observation period, disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the histological diagnosis imply an invasive and hazardous procedure, no biopsies will&#xD;
      be performed and the diagnosis will be exclusively radiological.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment evaluation. All patients, before treatment, will be collectively evaluated by&#xD;
      Neurosurgeon, Radiation Oncologist and Neuro-Ophthalmologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical investigation includes a full neurological examination. Particularly the I, III, IV,&#xD;
      V and VI pair of cranial nerve will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual acuity, visual field will be also investigated by the same Neuro-ophthalmologist.&#xD;
      Visual acuity will be investigated using best correct Snellen visual acuity. A standardized&#xD;
      automated perimetry by humphrey Visual 30-2 field testing will be performed in order to&#xD;
      define the presence of visual field deficits Dose selection and radiobiology considerations.&#xD;
      The dose selection is based on previous experience with Radiosurgery and Stereotactical&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (1, 2, 23, 28, 30), but also on the previous studies concerning the dose&#xD;
      tolerance of the anterior visual pathways (38).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumed these considerations we plan multisession radiosurgery: all patients will be treated&#xD;
      with a maximum dose of 25 Gy (5 Gy/fraction; 5 fractions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total dose plans in this study is comparable to the doses delivered with the conventional&#xD;
      fractionated regimens (50,4 - 56 Gy). In fact, assumed that the meningioma's α/β ratio is&#xD;
      approximately 3,7-3,8 Gy (34, 41).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the equivalent dose formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EQD2 = D * [(d + α/β)/(2 + α/β) = 38,2 Gy where D is the altered schedule total dose, d is&#xD;
      the altered daily dose. Then, considering the differences between the overall treatment time&#xD;
      between conventional fractionated and hypofractionated treatment (28 fractions, 5 fractions&#xD;
      per week, 38 total days and 5 fractions, 5 days respectively), assumed Dprolif = 0,7 as for&#xD;
      the most of the tumours (7, 17), where Dprolif is the dose recovered daily owning to&#xD;
      proliferation: EQD2,T = EQD2,t - [(T - t) * Dprolif ] = 61 Gy Treatment planning. Patients&#xD;
      will have a 1.25 mm thickness MRI, including fat suppression sequence, T1with Gadolinium&#xD;
      sequence and a contrast-enhanced CT scans. The images will then merged in order to optimize&#xD;
      the definition of the target volume and the intra-extraorbital segment of the optic nerve,&#xD;
      and the organ at risk (i.e. retina) An inverse planning software will be adopted to optimize&#xD;
      the target coverage and at the same time to achieve the maximum of conformality and&#xD;
      homogeneity of the prescription dose. The treatment plan used for each treatment will be&#xD;
      based on an analysis of the volumetric dose including dose-volume histogram (DVH) analyses of&#xD;
      the PTV and critical normal structures. The number of paths and beams used for each patient&#xD;
      will vary and will be determined by the selected individual treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Volumes The target volume will consist of the tumor outlined in the treatment planning&#xD;
      software seen on planning CT and/or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planning target volume (PTV) is planned to encompasses the 75-85% isodose line. All&#xD;
      organs at risk will be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up. Following multisession radiosurgery, patients will be evaluated for tumour&#xD;
      progression and visual function by a multidisciplinary team (Radiation Oncologist,&#xD;
      Neurosurgeon; Neuro-Ophthalmologist). The patients will be evaluated 3 months after&#xD;
      treatment, every 6 months during the first two years and then once per years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every follow-up includes Neurological, Radiological and neuro-ophthalmological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuro-Ophthalmologic assessment includes a comprehensive evaluation of the visual acuity,&#xD;
      visual field, extrinsic eyes movements, and proptosis. Visual acuity will be investigated by&#xD;
      using the same tests at base line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment radiographic evaluation includes an MRI scan every 6 months. Primary end point&#xD;
      Primary end points are local growth control and maintenance or improvement of visual acuity&#xD;
      at base line Response criteria The partial response is defined as a tumour reduction more&#xD;
      than 20 %. Progression disease is defined as any increase in the tumour dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity Ocular toxicity will be described with reference to CTCAE 3 version criteria. DATA&#xD;
      COLLECTION Patients will be allocated a number and their data will be collected on a Case&#xD;
      Report Forms. Data will include information from each protocol visit and will be completed on&#xD;
      a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Analysis will be conducted to check if tumor control is correlated&#xD;
      to clinical symptoms improvement by using short course radiotherapy treatment in relation to&#xD;
      previous described radiobiological considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical improvement will be measured specific ophthalmological tests.&#xD;
