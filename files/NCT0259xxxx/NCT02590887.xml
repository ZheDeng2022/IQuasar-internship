  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the health effects of the 4 weeks daily intake of a&#xD;
      drink manufactured from lupine protein hydrolysates in healthy volunteers. For that, blood&#xD;
      markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, carbohydrate, lipid, protein and liver metabolism,&#xD;
      together with general hematology and blood coagulation will be assessed at baseline time (day&#xD;
      0) and after drink ingestion (day +14 and +28).&#xD;

      The main objective of the present study is to verify the hypothesis that the intake of the&#xD;
      drink based on lupine peptides is safe and has beneficial effects on the immune and oxidative&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the effect of the drink on biological parameters of the carbohydrate, lipid,&#xD;
           renal and hepatic metabolism as well as hematology analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess whether the new product is well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of the drink on the general health of the volunteers through the&#xD;
           Short Form-36 health survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the degree of drink acceptability through the acceptability Likert test.&#xD;
