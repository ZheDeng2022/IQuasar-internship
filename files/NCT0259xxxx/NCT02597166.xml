  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are now several licensed drug treatments for patients with HCV infection. These&#xD;
      medications have been shown to be very effective in getting rid of the virus in patients with&#xD;
      HCV infection including those with early stages of cirrhosis without complications known as&#xD;
      compensated cirrhosis, with a greater than 90% cure rate. At present, there are very little&#xD;
      data to show that treating patients with HCV infection and decompensated cirrhosis will give&#xD;
      the same effects. However, patients with decompensated cirrhosis as a result of hepatitis B&#xD;
      infection who received treatment to control their virus show improvement of their overall&#xD;
      liver condition, and the liver complications of many of these patients disappeared. Also,&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis due to excess alcohol and who stopped drinking also showed&#xD;
      improvement in liver function and their complications of cirrhosis coming under control.&#xD;
      Therefore, treatment of patients with HCV infection and decompensated cirrhosis is expected&#xD;
      to show the same positive effects, because the underlying cause of cirrhosis is coming under&#xD;
      control. Harvoni is a combination of two direct-acting antivirals (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir)&#xD;
      that prevents the hepatitis C virus from copying and multiplying themselves, allowing the&#xD;
      body to clear the virus from their systems and be cured of HCV infection. This study is being&#xD;
      conducted to find out if treatment with Harvoni will lead to clearance of HCV infection in&#xD;
      patients with decompensated cirrhosis giving rise to improvement in liver function, together&#xD;
      with improvement of quality of life and survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most common causes of liver cirrhosis worldwide. The&#xD;
      progression of liver cirrhosis can lead to a myriad of complications including ascites,&#xD;
      variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. The development of these complications or decompensation can lead to a dismal&#xD;
      survival of 50% at 6 months, especially if the underlying cause of the liver cirrhosis is not&#xD;
      treated. The cost of caring for these patients with decompensated cirrhosis is extremely&#xD;
      high. Despite this, every effort is being made to maintain these patients in reasonable&#xD;
      health until liver transplant becomes available for them. Yet these patients continue to have&#xD;
      poor quality of life because of the various symptoms related to decompensated cirrhosis, and&#xD;
      spend much time visiting health care facilities for both outpatient and inpatient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent availability of potent and effective anti-viral therapy has revolutionized the&#xD;
      management of patients with hepatitis C infection. With a &gt;90% cure rate, many patients with&#xD;
      compensated cirrhosis, once treated, will not progress further to develop decompensation.&#xD;
      With the passage of time, the liver cirrhosis may even regress to a non-cirrhotic state.&#xD;
      Published data on treatment of decompensated cirrhosis with hepatitis C infection is still&#xD;
      scanty. However, patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis B infection who&#xD;
      received effective anti-viral therapy not only improved their overall clinical status, many&#xD;
      of these patients reverted from a decompensated to a compensated state, associated with&#xD;
      improved survival. Likewise, patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who abstain from alcohol will&#xD;
      also have improvement in liver function and reduction in complications of cirrhosis.&#xD;
      Therefore, treatment of decompensated cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C is expected to show&#xD;
      the same beneficial effects, because the underlying cause of cirrhosis is coming under&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of anti-viral therapy on the&#xD;
      clinical status, quality of life and survival of patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of all initial investigations, patients will be started on Harvoni 90 mg&#xD;
      ledipasvir/400 mg sofosbuvir (one tablet) daily. The course of treatment will be 24 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients will be reviewed at monthly intervals as per standard of care. At each clinic visit,&#xD;
      patients with have blood tests including complete blood count, renal function, electrolytes,&#xD;
      liver enzyme and liver function tests, HCV RNA will be done at week 4, week 12, week 24&#xD;
      during treatment, and then again at week 12 post completion of treatment. Annual ultrasounds&#xD;
      and surveillance gastroscopies will be organized as per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be followed for 1 year post completion of treatment, and have repeat quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaires at end of treatment, and thereafter at 6 and 12 months. Patients will&#xD;
      also be monitored for the development of further complications of cirrhosis (if any),&#xD;
      hospital admissions, reasons for hospital admissions, lengths of hospital stays, survival,&#xD;
      and liver transplantation.&#xD;
