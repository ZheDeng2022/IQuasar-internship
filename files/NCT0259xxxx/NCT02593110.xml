    <textblock>
      The TELEX trial will establish whether telmisartan alone improves walking performance in&#xD;
      people with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The TELEX trial will also determine whether&#xD;
      telmisartan plus supervised exercise improves walking performance more than either therapy&#xD;
      alone. TELEX is a randomized controlled clinical trial (2 x 2 factorial design) of 112&#xD;
      participants with PAD randomized to one of four arms: Group A: telmisartan + supervised&#xD;
      exercise therapy; Group B: telmisartan + a &quot;no exercise&quot; control group; Group C: placebo +&#xD;
      supervised exercise therapy; and Group D: placebo + a &quot;no exercise&quot; control group.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants will have PAD. PAD will be defined as follows. First, an ABI &lt;= 0.90 at&#xD;
        the baseline study visit is an inclusion criterion for PAD. Second, potential participants&#xD;
        who have an ABI &gt; 0.90 but â‰¤ 1.00 and experience a 20% or higher drop in ABI after&#xD;
        heel-rise exercise will be eligible. Third, potential participants with an ABI &gt; 0.90 who&#xD;
        have vascular lab evidence of PAD or angiographic evidence of PAD will be eligible.&#xD;
        Finally, potential participants with a history of lower extremity revascularization who do&#xD;
        not meet the criterion above and have an ABI &gt; 0.90 with a 20% or higher drop in ABI after&#xD;
        heel-rise exercise will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Above or below knee amputation, critical limb ischemia, wheelchair confinement,&#xD;
             inability to walk without a walker, or current foot ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Walking is limited by a condition other than PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. &gt; Class II NYHA heart failure or angina, increase in angina, angina at rest, or&#xD;
             abnormal baseline treadmill stress test. Potential participants may become eligible&#xD;
             following an abnormal baseline treadmill stress test if they have evidence of an&#xD;
             absence of coronary ischemia based on testing with their own physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Currently taking an angiotensin receptor blocker or an ACE inhibitor or use of these&#xD;
             medications in the past three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Currently taking aliskiren (Tekturna).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Blood pressure &lt; 100/50 at baseline or potassium &gt; 5.0 meq/L at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Blood pressure &lt; 100/50 after run-in or potassium &gt;= 5.5 meq/L at the end of run-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Severe hepatic impairment defined by two or more liver function enzyme values greater&#xD;
             than 2.5 the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Acute decline in renal function on telmisartan, defined as a 30% or greater decline in&#xD;
             eGFR following the two-week run-in as compared to baseline. If the participant had a&#xD;
             baseline eGFR performed by his/her physician within two months of the baseline eGFR&#xD;
             for the TELEX trial, the participant's physician's eGFR may be considered the baseline&#xD;
             measure, at the study principal investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Allergy to ARBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Failure to successfully complete the 2-week study run-in, defined as failing to attend&#xD;
             the health education and treadmill exercise run-in sessions and/or failing to take the&#xD;
             study medication daily for 10 or more days in the two-week period (i.e. one pill per&#xD;
             day for &gt; 10 days out of the 14 day run-in period).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Surgery including lower extremity revascularization, coronary revascularization with&#xD;
             stenting, or orthopedic surgery during the past 3 months or anticipated in the next 6&#xD;
             months or myocardial infarction or stroke in the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Major medical illness including renal disease requiring dialysis, lung disease&#xD;
             requiring oxygen, Parkinson's disease, a life-threatening illness with life expectancy&#xD;
             less than six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. [NOTE:&#xD;
             potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an early stage&#xD;
             cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent. Participants who only use&#xD;
             oxygen at night may still qualify.]&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. MMSE score &lt; 23 or dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Currently walking regularly for exercise at a level similar to the study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Participation in another clinical trial or cardiac rehabilitation or completion of a&#xD;
             clinical trial or cardiac rehabilitation in the previous three months. [NOTE: after&#xD;
             completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will become eligible&#xD;
             after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or gene therapy study so long&#xD;
             as at least six months have passed since the final intervention administration. After&#xD;
             completing an exercise intervention or a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem&#xD;
             cell or gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final study follow-up&#xD;
             visit as long as at least three months have passed since the final intervention of the&#xD;
             trial.]&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Non-English speaking, a visual impairment that limits walking ability, or a hearing&#xD;
             impairment that interferes with study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction &lt;40.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine&#xD;
             if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.&#xD;
