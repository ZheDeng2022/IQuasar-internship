      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza A H3N2 is a flu virus. Symptoms include fever, cough, and runny nose. It can also&#xD;
      be more serious. Researchers want to know more about how influenza causes disease in people.&#xD;
      They hope to develop new vaccines and treatments for flu infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find the smallest amount of Influenza A H3N2 virus that causes a mild to moderate flu&#xD;
      infection in healthy people. Also, to study the body s immune response to this virus and how&#xD;
      the infection develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18 50 who are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-smokers or non-habitual smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Willing to not smoke for at least 9 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under NIAID protocol #11-I-0183&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay at an isolation unit at the clinic for at least 9 days. They will&#xD;
      remain in the isolation unit except for study-specific activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influenza virus will be sprayed into the nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored 24 hours a day. They will have tests, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily questionnaires about symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal wash and swab: A small tube of salt water is placed in the nose to wash it. It then&#xD;
      collects the&#xD;
&#xD;
      fluid. Or the inside of the nose is rubbed with a swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG: Measures the heart s electrical signals&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECHO: Sound waves take pictures of the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFTs/Spirometry: They will blow into a machine that measures the air they blow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be discharged after they test negative for influenza A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinic for 4 follow-up visits over 8 weeks. They may complete&#xD;
      questionnaires at home.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The high morbidity and mortality associated with both pandemic and seasonal influenza, and&#xD;
      the anticipation of future influenza pandemics, puts influenza front and center in infectious&#xD;
      disease research. Because the natural history and pathogenesis of human influenza has not&#xD;
      been well characterized and cannot be adequately studied in animal models or with current in&#xD;
      vitro techniques, important questions about influenza pathogenesis can only be approached&#xD;
      through human challenge studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although studies of influenza in healthy volunteers have played an important role in&#xD;
      addressing aspects of the natural history of influenza disease and developing novel&#xD;
      antivirals, prior to recently these important studies had not been performed in the US in&#xD;
      over a decade. The H1N1 challenge studies we have performed since 2012 have sought to improve&#xD;
      upon the studies done in the past and address many of the limitations due to the scope of the&#xD;
      studies and/or the scientific techniques available at that time. We have successfully&#xD;
      developed an H1N1 model that had been used to address important questions regarding&#xD;
      correlates of protection and is now being implemented to develop new drugs and vaccines. We&#xD;
      hope to develop H3N2 models that can be just as useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the dose of influenza A H3N2 human&#xD;
      challenge virus that will induce a mild to moderate uncomplicated influenza infection in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. This protocol will examine some of the basic questions that remain&#xD;
      unanswered regarding the pathogenesis of H3N2 influenza in humans, namely, a detailed&#xD;
      clinical and immunological characterization of uncomplicated influenza viral pathogenesis in&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will evaluate clinical disease, length of viral shedding, and&#xD;
      pathogenesis in those with influenza infection including identification of clinical markers&#xD;
      of the disease. Notably, the exploratory objectives will seek to discover viral factors&#xD;
      necessary for human infection/adaptation and to evaluate host immune response, viral&#xD;
      replication, viral fitness, and the intrahost evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaboration between NIAID investigators and outside scientists will generate opportunities&#xD;
      to further develop and expand areas of clinical influenza research based on the proposed H3N2&#xD;
      challenge model.&#xD;
