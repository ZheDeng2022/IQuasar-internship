  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the mass balance recovery from excreta of carbon 14&#xD;
      labelled BI409306 ([14C] BI 409306) in healthy, CYP2C19 genotyped subjects and to provide&#xD;
      plasma, urine and faecal samples for metabolite profiling and structural identification.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy male genotyped as CY2C19 poor metabolizer (PM) or extensive metabolizer (EM)&#xD;
             according to the investigator's assessment, based on a complete medical history&#xD;
             including a physical examination, vital signs (BP - Blood Pressure, PR - Pulse Rate),&#xD;
             12-lead ECG (Electrogardiogramm), and clinical laboratory tests. PM is defined as&#xD;
             carrier of two non-functional alleles *2 and *3 of the CYP2C19 gene (diplotypes *2/*2;&#xD;
             *2/*3; *3/*3). EM is defined as carrier of two functional alleles of the CYP2C19 gene&#xD;
             (absence of *2, *3, *17; diplotype *1/*1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age of 30 to 65 years (incl.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. BMI (Body Mass Index) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in&#xD;
             accordance with GCP and local legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A history of regular bowel movements (averaging 1 or more bowel movements per day;&#xD;
             subjects with regular bowel movements of &gt;3 per day will be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who are sexually active must use, with their partner, 2 approved methods of&#xD;
             highly effective contraception from the time of IMP administration until 90 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any finding in the medical examination (including BP - Blood Pressure, PR - Pulse Rate&#xD;
             or ECG - Electrocardiogramm) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically&#xD;
             relevant by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the&#xD;
             range of 45 to 90 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be&#xD;
             of clinical relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,&#xD;
             immunological or hormonal disorders. Any significant history of ocular or eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the trial&#xD;
             medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia repair)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of&#xD;
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders&#xD;
