    <textblock>
      Two radiation therapy techniques are commonly used for the treatment of intermediate and high&#xD;
      risk prostate cancer: brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). However, both&#xD;
      have limitations. Brachytherapy, in which radioactive seeds are inserted into the prostate,&#xD;
      produces excellent outcomes but is invasive and not all patients are eligible or willing to&#xD;
      receive this treatment. EBRT, while gentle at the time of delivery, tends to be very&#xD;
      prolonged and may have poorer outcomes than brachytherapy. This study will examine the use of&#xD;
      stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), in which patients are given only a few, high dose&#xD;
      radiation treatments. Treatments are short, non-invasive, applicable to patients not able to&#xD;
      do brachytherapy, and may be more effective than conventional EBRT. This study will compare&#xD;
      SABR with EBRT in terms of the rates of acute and late toxicities for each treatment,&#xD;
      disease-free survival, and health-related quality of life measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a randomized phase II study comparing high speed, single arc,&#xD;
      LINAC-based prostate stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with conventional external&#xD;
      beam radiation treatment (EBRT), along with androgen suppression (AS), in men with&#xD;
      intermediate and high risk prostate cancer, who are either unsuitable for or unwilling to&#xD;
      have brachytherapy. The two primary objectives of the study are to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      randomization, and to compare the rates of acute and late toxicities. Should randomization&#xD;
      prove feasible, and toxicities comparable, a future phase 3 trial will be pursued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the proportion of eligible patients who are willing to be randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate and compare the proportions of acute and late toxicities, focussing on grade&#xD;
           3 and 4 complications of the treatment interventions as delivered in the British&#xD;
           Columbia (BC) Cancer Agency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the disease free survival as reflected in biochemical relapse free survival&#xD;
           at five years between the two interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the health related quality of life as reflected in changes on the EPIC&#xD;
           questionnaire between the two interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To quantify the degree of intra-fraction motion with the proposed SABR technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the willingness of eligible patients to be randomized, a screening log&#xD;
      documenting the number of eligible subjects approached for participation will be maintained.&#xD;
      Subjects who are approached but who decline participation will undergo a short interview by&#xD;
      the Clinical Research Associate as to the reason for non-participation. The Clinical Research&#xD;
      Associate will read from a script with statements to make sure that subjects who refuse the&#xD;
      trial know that they are free to provide or not provide the reasons for declining the trial&#xD;
      and that their answers will not affect the care they will receive. They will be asked to list&#xD;
      up to five reasons for non-participation in the trial. At the conclusion of the trial,&#xD;
      qualitative analyses will be done for the reason of non-participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two radiation treatment protocols, conventional EBRT and SABR, will be compared in a&#xD;
      randomized, phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with biopsy-proven intermediate or high risk prostate cancer will be accrued. T3 or&#xD;
      T4 disease, men with International Prostate Symptom Score &gt;20 and prostate volume &gt; 90 cc are&#xD;
      not eligible. Men with high risk disease must have a &lt;15% risk of pelvic lymph node&#xD;
      involvement to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be identified by the treating oncologist and enrolled through the&#xD;
      clinical trials unit of the participating regional cancer centre. Once the consent form is&#xD;
      signed, a Study Entry Form will be sent to the trial administrative centre located at the&#xD;
      Vancouver Island Centre of the BC Cancer Agency. A Patient Identification Number will be&#xD;
      assigned and the patient will be randomized to a treatment arm. This study proposes that&#xD;
      eighty (80) patients be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to Arm 1 (conventional EBRT) will receive 73.68 Gy in 28 fractions (5&#xD;
      treatment days per week over 5.5 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to Arm 2 (SABR) will receive a prescribed dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions&#xD;
      over 5 weeks (one treatment day per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to the SABR arm will undergo an additional procedure prior to radiation&#xD;
      treatment to place gold seed fiducials (placement of gold seed fiducials is optional in the&#xD;
      EBRT arm and is at the discretion of the treating centre).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgen-Deprivation Therapy (ADT) will be administered to all patients on both treatment&#xD;
      arms. ADT will consist of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist monotherapy,&#xD;
      but total androgen blockade is also permitted at the discretion of the treating oncologist.&#xD;
      The total duration of ADT will be 6 months for men with intermediate risk disease, and 18&#xD;
      months for those with high risk disease. ADT is to be initiated prior to the start of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT ASSESSMENTS AND FOLLOWUP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-radiotherapy assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must have a biopsy indicating prostate adenocarcinoma within 365 days of trial&#xD;
      registration. A full history and physical examination, with digital rectal examination, must&#xD;
      be done within 60 days of registration. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and nuclear&#xD;
      medicine bone scan must be done within 60 days of registration. Baseline PSA and testosterone&#xD;
      must be done not more than 60 days before registration and repeated in the week before&#xD;
      radiotherapy to document response to androgen deprivation therapy. Physician assessment must&#xD;
      be done within 60 days of randomization. Baseline QOL assessment (EPIC), prostate symptom&#xD;
      score (IPSS), and sexual health inventory (SHIM) are to be done prior to the start of&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments during radiotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be seen by a radiation oncologist (or clinical associate) weekly during&#xD;
      radiotherapy. QOL assessment (EPIC), IPSS/SHIM, and adverse events assessment (CTCAEv4,&#xD;
      modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/SOMA) will be done during week 5 of&#xD;
      radiotherapy for both Arms 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-radiotherapy assessment and follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assessed 2 weeks and 8 weeks post-radiotherapy, then every 6 months&#xD;
      until 2 years, and then yearly until year 5. At each of these time points patients will&#xD;
      undergo physician assessment, PSA/testosterone, QOL assessment (EPIC), IPSS/SHIM, and adverse&#xD;
      events assessment (CTCAEv4, modified RTOG/SOMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actuarial rates of acute (defined as occurring ≤ 6 months after initiation of treatment) and&#xD;
      late (defined as occurring &gt; 6 months after initiation of treatment) as well as the&#xD;
      prevalence of late toxicities at 1, 2 and 5 years will be determined. Grade 3 and 4&#xD;
      toxicities will be compared between intervention groups using exact test statistics (SAS FREQ&#xD;
      procedure, SAS Gary, NC). Stratified analyses will also use the SAS FREQ procedure and&#xD;
      Zelen's exact test for equal odds ratios, exact confidence limits for the common odds ratio,&#xD;
      and an exact test for the common odds ratio. Quality of life scores and EPIC scales will be&#xD;
      compared between interventions using the t-test statistic.&#xD;
