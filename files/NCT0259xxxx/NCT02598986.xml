  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glycemic index (GI) of food is known to be positively associated with the development of&#xD;
      several diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration. Modest dietary changes from high-GI foods to low-GI foods have shown beneficial&#xD;
      effects. These findings have been translated to recommendations for increased dietary intake&#xD;
      of whole grains. However, the inverse relationship between whole grain consumption and risk&#xD;
      of the different components of metabolic syndrome has not been explained by their fiber&#xD;
      content. Trials of added cereal fiber have failed to induce a protective effect and fiber has&#xD;
      thus been proposed to be a marker of other components of whole grains that impart health&#xD;
      advantages. Whole wheat grains are known to be a rich source of several minerals (phosphorus,&#xD;
      potassium and magnesium) that play a role in glucose metabolism, and are depleted during the&#xD;
      process of refinement. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that the benefits of whole grains&#xD;
      previously ascribed to their fiber content are in fact due to these minerals. The proposed&#xD;
      research aims to restore or fortify white bread with these minerals and determine the&#xD;
      resulting glycemic index of mineral-fortified bread. With much evidence that most people&#xD;
      prefer the taste and color of white bread, a low GI, mineral fortified white bread has the&#xD;
      potential to reduce the risk of Metabolic Syndrome in those who consume it.&#xD;

      The production of white flour requires the milling of the wheat grain and extraction of a&#xD;
      proportion of the grains. The level of 80% extraction is the most-commonly used in the&#xD;
      production of white flour in the market and this process leads to a substantial loss of&#xD;
      vitamins and minerals (Table 1). These vitamins and minerals are known to affect energy&#xD;
      metabolism. For example, thiamin is known to affect carbohydrate metabolism and low thiamin&#xD;
      intake is known to cause Beriberi. This has led to the establishment of an acceptable&#xD;
      carbohydrate and energy: thiamin ratio (0.4mg of thiamin/1000 kcal) and many countries are&#xD;
      fortifying their white wheat flour with thiamin to sustain an acceptable ratio. Although&#xD;
      several minerals are known to affect energy and carbohydrate metabolism no clear ratio has&#xD;
      been put in place yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: the effect of milling on mineral content of wheat flour Mineral content Wheat flour&#xD;
      (white) Wheat flour (whole grain) Loss (%) Phosphorus (mg/100g) 108 346 69 Potassium&#xD;
      (mg/100g) 107 408 74 Magnesium (mg/100g) 22 138 84&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the acceptability of mineral fortified white bread. White flour&#xD;
      will be supplemented with minerals to produce mineral-fortified bread. The acceptability of&#xD;
      the bread will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White wheat flour (80% extraction) will be fortified with minerals. Potassium phosphate will&#xD;
      be used as the source of phosphorus and potassium to fortify white flour. From previous&#xD;
      experience, the addition of potassium phosphate to glucose solution was found to minimally&#xD;
      affect the organoleptic properties. Unlike that of sodium phosphate that was not well&#xD;
      tolerated by subjects due to development of unfavorable flavor (fishy flavor). At the same&#xD;
      time, magnesium chloride will be used as the source of magnesium. Magnesium chloride is known&#xD;
      to be highly soluble and is commonly used as a supplement or fortificant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locally produced white wheat flour (80% extraction) and whole grain wheat flour will be&#xD;
      purchased and stored at the department. White and whole flour samples (n=3) will be analyzed&#xD;
      for their content of phosphorus, magnesium and potassium according to standard procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      White Bread Restoration (WB-R): A quantity of white flour will be fortified with minerals to&#xD;
      a level that restores its content of minerals to that of whole grain wheat flour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data from the above table, white flour restoration requires the addition of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      250 mg of P/100g white flour (total P =358mg/100g) and 100 mg of Mg/100g white flour (total&#xD;
      Mg =122mg/100g)&#xD;
&#xD;
      White Bread Fortification (WB-F): A quantity of white flour will be fortified with minerals&#xD;
      to a level that is 100% higher than that of whole grain wheat flour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data from the above table, white flour fortification requires the addition of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      580mg of P/100g white flour (total P= 688mg/100g) 250mg of Mg/100g white flour (total Mg= 272&#xD;
      mg/100g)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Making of bread:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four different types of bread will be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
      White bread (WB) White bread with mineral restoration (WB-R) White bread with mineral&#xD;
      fortification (WB-F) Whole grain bread (WGB)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability of bread:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bread samples (white bread and whole wheat bread controls and the 2 experimental samples)&#xD;
      will be tested for acceptability. Panelists (n= 60) will be recruited based on their&#xD;
      willingness to participate in the study and their consumption of Arabic bread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panelists will be asked to fill a questionnaire and to rate the served samples on a 9-point&#xD;
      hedonic scale with 1 representing dislike extremely and 9 representing like extremely for&#xD;
      overall acceptability, acceptability of appearance, texture and taste. The order of&#xD;
      presentation of the samples will be counterbalanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mineral and carbohydrate content of bread:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphorus, potassium and magnesium and starch contents of the bread will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Assess any sensory differences between the different bread treatments. The&#xD;
      bread making step will be the same as the above. Panelists who are regular consumers of white&#xD;
      bread will be recruited to assess any sensory differences between the white bread control and&#xD;
      the white bread mineral supplemented experimental samples. The triangle test will be used in&#xD;
      the difference tests. All subjects will be asked to sign human subjects consent forms and&#xD;
      answer demographic information. Demographic information that will be requested will be: 1)&#xD;
      age, 2) gender, 3) frequency of bread consumption, 4) type of bread typically consumed, and&#xD;
      5) what factors influence the panelists' bread purchase. Twenty four panelists will&#xD;
      participate in three triangle test, comparing the white bread control vs. each of the three&#xD;
      experimental samples in each test. In the session, subjects will be debriefed about a) the&#xD;
      products they will consume, b) the procedures for the testing, c) instructions on how to&#xD;
      sample the beverages, and d) how to use the score card. All samples will be presented in a&#xD;
      random, balanced order .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Determine the glycemic index of the mineral supplemented bread. Glycemic&#xD;
      index of the above four different types of bread will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experiment, healthy subjects (n=12) will be asked to maintain their regular dietary&#xD;
      and physical activity habits during the entire study course, avoid alcohol consumption as&#xD;
      well as any unusual strenuous exercise 24 hours prior to the study. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      include: any significant medical diseases; pregnancy or lactation; regular use of medication&#xD;
      that affects body weight; a weight loss of 3% or more in the preceding 3 months. Following a&#xD;
      12 hour (overnight) fast, they will be taken to the testing facility [Faculty of Agriculture&#xD;
      and Food Sciences/Department of Nutrition or the Central research unit (CRU)/ American&#xD;
      University Hospital] where: anthropometric measurements (height, weight) will be taken. A&#xD;
      catheter will be inserted for blood withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycemic index of food will be determined. In brief, overnight fasted subjects will be given&#xD;
      the bread (50 g of carbohydrate) to ingest within 10-15 min and drink 250ml of water. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken immediately before the meal and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes&#xD;
      after meal ingestion. Blood will be withdrawn by a trained practitioner and will be used for&#xD;
      the determination of glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose area under the curve (AUC) will be calculated. The GI value of each food will be&#xD;
      calculated as the mean value of : 100 x (AUC test food)/(AUC reference food) in the same&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, mineral content of the blood will be determined and several metabolites&#xD;
      (glucose, Tg, FFA, P), K, Mg and hormones (insulin) will be measured.&#xD;
