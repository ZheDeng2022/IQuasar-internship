  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PERHAPS project aims to fill two gaps in the scientific literature: on the one hand,&#xD;
      studying the clinical and cognitive particularities of poker-related problems, and on the&#xD;
      other hand, studying poker skill as a combination of multiple cognitive and emotional&#xD;
      abilities. The underlying clinical aim is to develop a cognitive remediation therapy program&#xD;
      dedicated to pathological gamblers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, although compulsive poker players undoubtedly share similarities with the&#xD;
      compulsive gamblers of other gambling games, clinicians have observed significant&#xD;
      specificities in these patients, in terms of personality profile, gaming practices and&#xD;
      associated troubles. These specificities could influence the effectiveness of treatment and&#xD;
      prevention strategies in many ways. However, there are very few studies focused on the&#xD;
      specific poker-related problems, particularly compared to other practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, skill at poker has often been treated as a unique and general ability. This&#xD;
      binary vision is now considered widely insufficient and most researchers recommend exploring&#xD;
      the individual cognitive abilities at play in poker skill. To the investigators knowledge, no&#xD;
      study has done this to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the PERHAPS project aims to fill two gaps in the scientific literature: on the&#xD;
      one hand, studying the clinical and cognitive particularities of poker-related problems, and&#xD;
      on the other hand, studying poker skill as a combination of multiple cognitive and emotional&#xD;
      abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three profiles of poker players will be studied, depending on their gambling practices and&#xD;
      whether or not they are addicted: a control group of 30 non-poker players, a group of 30&#xD;
      expert unproblematic poker players, and a group of 30 pathological poker players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three groups will be compared with one another on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive and emotional abilities (for expert players) or deficits (for pathological&#xD;
           gamblers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical particularities of poker-related problems&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily (ancillary study), pathological poker gamblers will be compared with pathological&#xD;
      gamblers of other gambling games (pure chance games n=30 and quasi-skill games n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PERHAPS project aims to improve knowledge of gambling addiction, particularly as regards&#xD;
      poker, in order to optimise prevention and care strategies. The clinical aim is especially to&#xD;
      construct a cognitive remediation therapy program. It also intends to discuss the legal&#xD;
      framework applied to poker under the gambling regulation.&#xD;
