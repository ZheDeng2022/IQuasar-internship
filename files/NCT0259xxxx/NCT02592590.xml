    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the individual and combined effectiveness of two&#xD;
      smartphone-based tools for improving physical activity. The first is an individualized and&#xD;
      guided goal-setting module, and the second uses &quot;points&quot;, &quot;levels&quot;, and &quot;badges&quot; to provide&#xD;
      instant positive feedback throughout the program. It is hypothesized that both components&#xD;
      will be effective, and greater effects will be noted for those receiving both components.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of individual components of a&#xD;
      smartphone application designed using theories of human behavior to promote physical activity&#xD;
      in low-active adults. Smartphones have become commonplace: approximately two-thirds of adults&#xD;
      own a smartphone. They allow for wireless internet connectivity and the ability to&#xD;
      communicate via voice and text message at any time. Perhaps most importantly from the&#xD;
      perspective of behavior change, the devices are often carried on the person at all times. In&#xD;
      recent years researchers have attempted to use these devices to promote physical activity,&#xD;
      but continue to encounter a number of barriers. Notably, development in the commercial sector&#xD;
      far outpaces the standard randomized controlled trial (RCT) cycle. As a result, researchers&#xD;
      utilizing RCT designs find it difficult to publish findings that are relevant to current&#xD;
      technology. Additionally, this approach typically examines a full application that includes a&#xD;
      package of features, making it difficult to draw conclusions about single intervention&#xD;
      components. This has resulted in a commercial sector that produces a large number of physical&#xD;
      activity applications that are not evidence based. The present study uses a factorial design&#xD;
      to study the individual and combined efficacy of two theory-based modules: A guided&#xD;
      goal-setting module, and a points-based feedback system. If successful, the results of this&#xD;
      study will help to guide a fast-moving commercial sector toward the development&#xD;
      evidence-based applications, which has the potential to yield a large public health impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these aims, adults will be recruited from Champaign-Urbana, IL, and surrounding&#xD;
      communities to participate in a 12-week home-based and self-guided physical activity program.&#xD;
      Eligible individuals will complete baseline questionnaires and informed consent online, and&#xD;
      will wear an activity monitor for one week. Upon completion of questionnaires, participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . The Base-App (BA) condition (i.e., Group D; so named due to the factorial design used&#xD;
           in this study) will receive only a base-level smartphone app that contains three&#xD;
           components common in computerized behavioral interventions: physical activity-related&#xD;
           educational content (i.e., weekly videos, additional resources, easy weekly quiz&#xD;
           questions), manual physical activity tracking, and instantaneous graphical feedback. As&#xD;
           the physical activity program is goal-directed, these individuals will also receive&#xD;
           printed goal setting worksheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . The BA+PT condition (i.e., Group C) will receive the Base-App plus an instantaneous&#xD;
           points-based feedback module (PT) that provides &quot;program points&quot; for every task in the&#xD;
           application (e.g., tracking physical activities, watching educational videos), and these&#xD;
           are weighted by difficulty of the task. Points accumulate to earn &quot;levels&quot;, and every&#xD;
           fifth level brings a new motivational prompt and &quot;badge&quot; depicting an initially unfit&#xD;
           character becoming increasing fit. Every tenth level will earn the participant a new&#xD;
           &quot;title&quot; (e.g., &quot;Intermediate Exerciser&quot;). These points, levels, badges, and titles serve&#xD;
           to provide instant positive feedback on progress within the program. These individuals&#xD;
           will also receive printed goal setting worksheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . The BA+GS condition (i.e., Group B) will receive the Base-App plus a fully guided&#xD;
           goal-setting module (GS). This module is based upon health behavior theory, emphasizing&#xD;
           gradual exercise progression and highly specific, realistic, and measurable goals. The&#xD;
           module will guide participants in setting both long and short term goals: each week,&#xD;
           those with access to the GS module will be prompted to revisit and reset their goals. At&#xD;
           this time, participants will select several aerobic and non-aerobic activities for the&#xD;
           week, and will set a frequency (days per week) and duration (minutes per session) for&#xD;
           each type of activity. To emphasize gradual progression, participants will receive a&#xD;
           minimum, maximum, and recommended frequency and duration, and these will be calculated&#xD;
           automatically within the app based upon performance in previous weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . The BA+GS+PT condition (i.e., Group A) will receive all application components (i.e.,&#xD;
           Base-App, goal setting, instantaneous feedback). In addition to the features described&#xD;
           above, program points accompany goal-related tasks (i.e., setting goals, revisiting&#xD;
           goals, achieving goals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of questionnaires, all participants will attend a group-specific&#xD;
      orientation session. During this session, trained research staff will provide an introduction&#xD;
      to the smartphone application used in the study and all relevant features, as well as a&#xD;
      one-on-one physical activity counseling session in which staff members will work with&#xD;
      participants to set initial aerobic and non-aerobic physical activity goals. During this&#xD;
      time, participants will also be introduced to the goal-directed nature of the MAPS physical&#xD;
      activity program. Short term (i.e., weekly) goals will specify the types of aerobic and&#xD;
      non-aerobic activities that the individual will engage in, as well as the frequency and&#xD;
      duration with which they will engage in these activities. Each participant's initial&#xD;
      long-term goal will reflect federal physical activity recommendations. Accordingly, each&#xD;
      participant will work toward achieving 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity,&#xD;
      and at least two days of full-body muscle strengthening exercises within the 12-week&#xD;
      intervention period. Staff will work with participants to modify these long-term goals based&#xD;
      upon the participant's current abilities and physical activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program will begin on the Sunday following the orientation session. On each Sunday of the&#xD;
      program, a new educational module related to basic health and health behavior concepts will&#xD;
      be released, and participants will receive a brief email containing information related to&#xD;
      the weekly educational content with a reminder to watch the new video. With the exception of&#xD;
      the first week, these emails will also provide specific feedback (i.e., minutes of exercise,&#xD;
      average intensity, and average enjoyment) from the previous week, and for those with access&#xD;
      to guided goal setting the email will also provide feedback and advice based on whether or&#xD;
      not the previous week's goals were met. Finally, each email will prompt the participant to&#xD;
      revisit their short and long term goals, and adjust them as necessary. At this time,&#xD;
      participants with the guided goal setting module will be brought immediately to that module&#xD;
      upon entering the app, and will be asked to revisit and reset their short term goals. This&#xD;
      process will include a recommended frequency and duration based upon previous performance in&#xD;
      the program. Participants will also be prompted to set a new long term goal in the event that&#xD;
      they achieved their previous long term goal during the week. For those without guided goal&#xD;
      setting, this process will be carried out using traditional printed goal setting worksheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each week, participants will utilize application features to track exercises as they&#xD;
      do them, view their feedback, review their weekly goals, and view educational content. On&#xD;
      each Thursday, participants will receive a text message update based upon their progress&#xD;
      during the week. For those who have not accessed the app during the week, and for those who&#xD;
      have not yet tracked activity during the week, a brief prompt will remind them to do so. For&#xD;
      those who have tracked activity, a brief message will provide for them an update on the&#xD;
      number of sessions and minutes of activity for the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the final week of the program, participants will once again receive the activity&#xD;
      monitor via mail and will be asked to wear it for one week. On completion of the 12-week&#xD;
      program, participants will receive an email informing them that the program has completed.&#xD;
      This email will also provide a link to follow-up questionnaires. At this time, research staff&#xD;
      will also contact the participant to schedule a follow-up appointment, which will take no&#xD;
      more than 60 minutes. During this appointment, participants will return the activity monitor&#xD;
      and will complete a post-study survey assessing their experiences with the MAPS program and&#xD;
      with the MAPS research staff.&#xD;
