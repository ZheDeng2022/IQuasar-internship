  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advent of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) technologies represents one of the most&#xD;
      significant developments in the last several decades, and provides a novel and promising&#xD;
      strategy for substantially reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with smoking.&#xD;
      However, serious concerns have been raised regarding the possibility that e-cigarettes will&#xD;
      sustain a dependency on nicotine and that they may lead to continued use of conventional&#xD;
      cigarettes known to be extremely harmful to health. Cigarette addiction critically involves a&#xD;
      dependence on nicotine, but it is likely that other tobacco constituents contribute to&#xD;
      dependence as well. Recent evidence suggests that non-nicotine tobacco alkaloids, or NNTAs&#xD;
      (including anabasine, anatabine, nornicotine, and myosmine) may play a role in tobacco&#xD;
      dependence. These alkaloids have been shown to augment the reinforcing effects of nicotine in&#xD;
      animal models and to affect cravings in human smokers. E-cigarettes contain variable&#xD;
      quantities of nicotine and NNTAs, but there is virtually no information available concerning&#xD;
      the role of e-cigarette nicotine or NNTA content in influencing the concurrent use of&#xD;
      cigarettes and e-cigarettes, when smokers attempt to switch from conventional combustible&#xD;
      cigarettes to e-cigarettes. Additionally, it is not known whether the presence of nicotine&#xD;
      and NNTAs in e- cigarettes may sustain dependence, making it difficult to relinquish these&#xD;
      products. The proposed project will assess the acceptability, extent of switching behavior,&#xD;
      and degree of dependence maintained when smokers are provided with e-cigarettes containing&#xD;
      nicotine and NNTAs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single group of thirty smokers will be recruited for the study to provide initial data to&#xD;
      inform follow-up randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependence and concurrent use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes will be assessed by a battery of&#xD;
      self-report, biochemical, and behavioral indices. This is not a tobacco cessation study and&#xD;
      there is no intent to use e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation treatment. Smokers will be&#xD;
      asked to use the e-cigarettes instead of their regular cigarettes during the study.&#xD;
      E-cigarettes will not be used for the purpose of reducing urges, withdrawal or nicotine&#xD;
      dependence; and e-cigarettes will not be described or used as a medical device or therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess the extent of switching from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes&#xD;
      delivering nicotine along with NNTAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Switching will be assessed by self-report diaries and by reductions in expired air carbon&#xD;
      monoxide, an index of combustible cigarette use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To assess the acceptability of e-cigarettes delivering nicotine along with&#xD;
      NNTAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ratings of user satisfaction and other subjective effects will be collected from&#xD;
      participants, for both their customary brand of cigarettes and the e-cigarette to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine the extent of dependence maintained during use of e-cigarettes&#xD;
      delivering nicotine with NNTAs, as well as the relationship between dependence and&#xD;
      self-reported use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes.&#xD;
