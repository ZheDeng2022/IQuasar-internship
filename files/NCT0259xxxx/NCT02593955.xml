  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled interventional study is to determine the effects&#xD;
      of a high intensity exercise training program on objective sleep measures, daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness, mobility, and brain health/functional connectivity in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome measure is the change in sleep efficiency (the number of minutes asleep&#xD;
      divided by the number of minutes in bed), as measured by polysomnography. In addition,&#xD;
      because patients with Parkinson's disease have excessive sleepiness/impaired vigilance&#xD;
      (alertness) and impaired motor function, and because these might be expected to improve with&#xD;
      the exercise intervention, this study will also assess vigilance and motor outcomes.&#xD;
