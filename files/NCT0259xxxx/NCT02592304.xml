    <textblock>
      Background Long-term survival for patients with cancer of the rectum (RC) is through the last&#xD;
      20 years dramatically improved from about 30% to 65% . Overall focus on disease with the&#xD;
      creation of multidisciplinary teams, national quality databases certification of surgeons,&#xD;
      etc. have contributed to the development especially in the last 10-15 years . The&#xD;
      introduction of pre-operative Oncology, known as neoadjuvant treatment increased the survival&#xD;
      rate by up to 10% in certain patient series. However, the prognosis remains poor for advanced&#xD;
      cases, qua risk of metastasis and local cancer relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment remains the cornerstone of curative treatment of RC. Total mesorectal&#xD;
      excision (TME) includes resection of both the tumor and the surrounding mesorectal fat. TME&#xD;
      is currently used as the gold standard for surgical treatment of RC. The use of TME has&#xD;
      reduced local relapse rate to less than 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TME surgery combined with preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy if the cancer is in&#xD;
      an advanced stage (T3), and often with high-dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the most&#xD;
      advanced cases of T-stage 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of TME are present in more than 40% of patients. Most often in the form of&#xD;
      wound dehiscence, infection, sexual dysfunction, bowel disorders and the necessity of a&#xD;
      stoma. More than 50% of patients have permanently reduced quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally invasive therapies (trans-anal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM)) for the curative&#xD;
      treatment of early rectal cancers, is well-validated. The complication rate is low, and above&#xD;
      all, the operative mortality of less than 1% even in the elderly and patients with&#xD;
      comorbidities, opposed to 10% at standard surgery. The use of TEM surgery early in the rectum&#xD;
      cancers in selected patients will thus be able to reduce the risk of complications and&#xD;
      improve the overall long-term survival. Even though the disease-specific survival is reduced&#xD;
      due to a less radical procedure. The Danish screening program for colorectal cancer will&#xD;
      result in a significant increase in the detection of early cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, over the past 10-15 years, there is developed a complex treatment algorithm with&#xD;
      tailored surgery, in combination with oncological treatment if necessary. The full benefits&#xD;
      of the available treatment options require that you pre-treatment, stage classify the disease&#xD;
      so the patient can be allocated to the proper treatment. The tumor extent of ingrowth into&#xD;
      the different layers in the rectum (T-stage) can now be carried out with great certainty&#xD;
      preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with tumor stage T1 may be candidates for TEM surgery because only 10% of these&#xD;
      patients have metastases to the lymph nodes. Cancers of the stage T2 may be candidates for&#xD;
      TEM if they have increased operative mortality risk. A local resection of the cancer is of&#xD;
      course undesirable, in the lymph node metastases as they are not included in the resection.&#xD;
      Distant metastases can with certainty be detected with CT and MRI scans. Preoperative&#xD;
      assessment of lymph node involvement is difficult and uncertain for daring to use it to&#xD;
      allocate candidates for local resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indication for TEM treatment of rectal cancers can potentially be extended if you could&#xD;
      allocate patients independent of tumor stage - based on lymph node stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection of disease spread to the lymph nodes has a decisive impact on the choice of&#xD;
      treatment modality. Moreover the impact on prognosis and local recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Local resection performed only for N0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of involved lymph nodes has a prognostic value for the outcome of surgery for&#xD;
           RC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Detection of tumor cells in the lymph nodes at the mesorectal fascia (which forms&#xD;
           circumferential resection margin CRM) increases the risk of recurrence. Patients must&#xD;
           have neoadjuvant oncological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lymph nodes located outside the mesorectal fascia may require extended lymphadenectomy,&#xD;
           to achieve a good oncological outcome and avoid relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, magnetic resonance scan (MRI) and trans rectal ultrasound (TRUS) is used as the gold&#xD;
      standard in the imaging staging of RC. Studies have demonstrated high specificity for the&#xD;
      assessment of T stage and CRM using the preoperative MRI. Comparative high specificity is&#xD;
      obtained in the intermediate hands with TRUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to T stage and CRM classification, the MR and TRUS have shown poor results&#xD;
      compared to N-staging of RC. Even worse results arise for the use of conventional Computed&#xD;
      Tomography Scan (CT) for lymph node diagnostics, with a median sensitivity of 80% (from 62.5&#xD;
      to 91.9%) and median specificity of 77.8% (50- 87.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research should be directed towards improvement of lymph node diagnostics by RC, in order to&#xD;
      take full advantage of the differentiated treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual Energy Computed Tomography (DECT) is an imaging modality, which in recent years has&#xD;
      gained a foothold in the diagnosis of several types of micro-lesions. DECT provides&#xD;
      information on a tissue reaction when it is affected by different energy levels. This gives&#xD;
      you information about its composition, based on the known K-edge value of different&#xD;
      substances. K-edge is defined by the maximum visual attenuation of a substance in a DECT scan&#xD;
      when it is affected by a certain amount of energy. The energy required to achieve a given&#xD;
      k-edge depends on the individual substances atomic size, and therefore increases with the&#xD;
      atomic mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique is known from, for example, kidney stones diagnosis, pancreatic cancer staging,&#xD;
      vascular anomalies such as classification of aortic aneurysms, detection of coronary plaques&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study from 2013 by Zalai Pan et al investigated the association between histologically&#xD;
      confirmed gastric cancer, and the discovery of metastatic lymph nodes by DECT. Ninety-six&#xD;
      patients were included. Two groups of radiologists were blinded to the endoscopic and&#xD;
      histological findings. Lymph nodes of 6 mm were included in the N-staging. They found a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 85.4% for N0, 84.4% N1, 91.7% N2. Furthermore, it showed a significant&#xD;
      difference in the uptake of iodine (from the iodine-containing contrast) with the K-edge&#xD;
      value of 33.20 keV, in malignant and non-malignant lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, there is the hope of both iodine and Gadolinium found in X-ray contrast agent, is&#xD;
      absorbed in cancer tissues, and gives a recognizable signal in dual energy CT scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It is possible to develop a standardized method for DECT scanning of the rectum&#xD;
           specimens, removed during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Metastatic lymph nodes suspected by DECT can be verified histopathological.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. DECT can increase the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of lymph node&#xD;
           compared to other imaging modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The effect of chemo-radiotherapy to the lymph nodes can be detected by DECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study is a prospective observational study, based on patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed rectum cancer at the Surgical Department A, Odense University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will automatically be divided into 3 groups according to the preoperative&#xD;
      stratification, in a group which will refer to the direct operation either TEM (group 1) or&#xD;
      TME (GROUP2) after the preoperative imaging staging, and a group of 3 which will undergo two&#xD;
      imaging phases, before and after the radio or chemo-radiotherapy before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Subproject 1: In Vitro DECT scan of rectal specimens. Subproject 1 scan without&#xD;
      contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 procedure: 3 patients with visible lymph nodes in the perirectal fat tissue by MRI are&#xD;
      selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scenario 1 - after TME the specimens will be transported to the pathological institute for&#xD;
      the preparation of 3mm. thick sections from the distal to the proximal resection rim.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The product is placed in an aluminum lattice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All cuts of 3 mm gets numbered and photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ex-vivo specimen scan is done; this is done in three different ways to determine the&#xD;
           ideal technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. specimen is scanned between 2 gel plates&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. specimens is scanned in the air&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. specimens is scanned in flooded container&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All sections of 3 mm which is photographed and numbered, gets coupled with its DECT-scan&#xD;
           image.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The specimens are placed in formalin, and the same scans will be made 24 hours later.&#xD;
           This is to compare the effect of formalin on the DECT scans of specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ideal technique for the in vitro DECT scan of specimens will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scan with contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second part procedure: Nine patients with visible lymph nodes in the perirectal fat tissue by&#xD;
      MRI will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the preparing meeting with the patients in KA (surgical day center, Svendborg), the&#xD;
           patients will receive information about the study, provided written material, and&#xD;
           consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  questions in time from the information in KA, to participation in the study to time of&#xD;
           surgery, may be directed to the investigator. The investigator is present at the time of&#xD;
           surgery, and can take questions from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon written consent from the patients the following procedure will be completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 5 min. before the default central ligating of a. mesenteric inf. three patients&#xD;
                will receive iv, iodine-containing contrast media, Omnipaque 350 mg iodine / ml, a&#xD;
                total of 10 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 3pt: intra venous Gadovist (Gadobutrol) 1.0 mmol / ml total 0.1 mmol / kg For 3pt: using&#xD;
      rectoscope and a needle 5 ml of 1 mmol / ml Gadovist will be administered, for examination of&#xD;
      the sentinel node.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. After TME the specimens are prepared and DECT scanned according to the ideal technique&#xD;
      found by part-1 procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. All lymph nodes, designated normal or pathological by DECT scan will be analyzed by a&#xD;
      pathologist, who is blinded to the scan results. The lymph nodes will be assessed under the&#xD;
      gold standard for pathological assessment of these (38). In this process it is possible to&#xD;
      remove the lymph node for histopathological validation, as they are numbered according to&#xD;
      photograph and scan images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Pathologist fills in Annex 2 5. Investigator assesses DECT scan pictures, together with&#xD;
      the radiologist. 6. Investigator fills in Annex 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subproject 2: assess the sensitivity and specificity of benign / malignant differentiation in&#xD;
      DECT scanning of in Vitro rectal specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All included patients under the standardized preoperative imaging staging, by written&#xD;
           consent, will get an additional DECT scan of the pelvis, either with Gadovist 1.0 mmol /&#xD;
           ml, 0.1 mg / kg iv, or after administration of standard CT contrast Omnipaque. DECT&#xD;
           scans can be performed in the same scanner and at the same session as the conventional&#xD;
           CT of the thorax and abdomen. Images should result in ongoing 3mm thick sections of the&#xD;
           pelvis, perpendicular to the rectum wall, from the anorectal transition to promontory&#xD;
           level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional CT scan of the thorax and abdomen, and MRI of the rectum will be used as&#xD;
           usual, for the stratification of patients to appropriate treatment cf. Figure 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopist informs about the study and provides written material for signature when the&#xD;
           detection of a rectal cancer is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions from patients about participation in the study during the period between&#xD;
           endoscopy and scanning can be directed to the investigator. The investigator is present&#xD;
           at the time of the planned preoperative imaging staging, and accept any questions from&#xD;
           the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written acceptance delivered to the investigator in the preoperative imaging staging. A&#xD;
           Copy of the acceptance will be provided the radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Item 2-6 from subproject 1 second procedural element is repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subproject 3: Best protocol during subproject 2, compared with standard MRI of malignant&#xD;
      lymph nodes in the mesorectum in patients who have not received neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As mentioned above, the aim is the inclusion of a total of 100 pts. With RC. After the&#xD;
           1-year inclusion period analyzed the scanning images. All the preoperative in vivo&#xD;
           images is reviewed by dedicated radiologists, with a particular focus on lymph node&#xD;
           detection. Morphological criterions as used in MRI is used to determine whether a lymph&#xD;
           node is malignant or not (39), both in the preoperative MR and DECT scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiologists are blinded to the results of the preoperative MRI staging and the&#xD;
           histopathological results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy will be included in the subproject&#xD;
           3, radiologist fills in Annex 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator compares in vivo scan results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator compares in vivo scanning results with in vitro scan results and pathology&#xD;
           results. The results are calculated as N0, N1 or N2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subproject 4: Evaluate DECT ability to follow changes in lymph node status of malignancy&#xD;
      after adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have received adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the same procedure as subproject 2 the patients are scanned a second time&#xD;
           after adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rescans are described according to the description procedure in subproject 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Annex 1 is filled in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Annex 1 from before and after adjuvant radio chemotherapy will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prerequisites for patient collection, for in Vitro DECT scanning after the administration of&#xD;
      Gadovist as a contrast agent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Median figures for the diagnosis of lymph nodes on MRI in patients with RC are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  70% of patients with RC have no visible lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15% of patients with RC have visibly benign lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15% of patients with RC have visibly malignant lymph nodes (40). 5 shows an in average 5&#xD;
           lymph nodes are seen per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size analysis showed that a number of visible nodes 150 in total were needed to&#xD;
      achieve a sensitivity of 70% (95% CI 56% -80%). Knowing that 5 Iymph nodes are seen in&#xD;
      average per patient would necessitate a population of 100 pts. Included. (15% of 100) x5&#xD;
      Iymph nodes= 75 visible benign Iymph nodes + (15% of 100) x5 Iymph nodes = 75 visible&#xD;
      malignant lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of Iymph nodes = 150&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The project must is approved by the research ethics committees in the&#xD;
      Region of Southern Denmark and by the Data Inspectorate in Odense university hospital&#xD;
      /Svendborg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First contact with the patient before inclusion in the project will take place on the day&#xD;
      when, after having endoscopic examination, found a malignant tumor in the rectum. The patient&#xD;
      will then be informed about the project by one of the doctors of the department, in an&#xD;
      uninterrupted interview rooms designed for the information of patients and their relatives.&#xD;
      Written information will be disclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a minimum of 3 days of reflection before accepting participation in the&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient accepts the participation in the project it will only be medically relevant&#xD;
      information that will be obtained in the patient's chart. This will include age, gender,&#xD;
      pregnancy, other diseases, allergies and information on details of the patient's cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DECT scan is a painless procedure that can be done in line with the preoperative scans.&#xD;
      Disregarding the known risks of administering the contrast agent in the form of anaphylactic&#xD;
      reactions, patients are not exposed to medical risk. Using gadolinum based contrast agents&#xD;
      are suspected to be contributing to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), but there is no case&#xD;
      of this by the recent report of Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in&#xD;
      2007. Allergic reactions to iodinated contrast agents are described with a frequency of 0.2%,&#xD;
      most commonly in the form of hives. Serious adverse reactions, as anaphylactic shock is&#xD;
      described with a frequency of 0.01%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in sub-project 1 are under the administration of contrast agent preoperatively under&#xD;
      close surveillance by the anesthesiologists, and any possible allergic reaction could be&#xD;
      treated immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be exposed to increased radiological radiation, equivalent to 1-10 mSv&#xD;
      and therefore only one additional CT scan of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected specimens will be treated in exactly the same way as it is legally described in&#xD;
      that matter. The investigator will, in the usual pathological preparation of the specimens,&#xD;
      photograph the specimens and categorize them in the project gradient time. After completing&#xD;
      the project, the picture material will be made anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be emphasized that the results of the experiments related to the scans will not to&#xD;
      have a therapeutic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective In the event that the study shows that DECT enhances the quality of the imaging&#xD;
      staging of patients with RC, the consequences will be substantial. If the accuracy of lymph&#xD;
      node positive for RC reaches 90%, a local resection would be possible for the 10% of the&#xD;
      lymph nodes positive T1 tumors. Furthermore you may be able to offer local resection for the&#xD;
      75% of T2 and T3 early cancers that have not spread, and who otherwise meet the criterions&#xD;
      for local resection. With secure node diagnostics, the surgical oncological treatment will&#xD;
      improve in terms of prognosis and the rate of local relapse. Furthermore, one with better&#xD;
      lymph node diagnostics one can avoid unnecessary neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy to the&#xD;
      previous false-positive patients. They are between 25 and 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical oncology one will be able to assess the effect of chemotherapy on RC patients, with&#xD;
      the possibility of optimizing the oncological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opportunities for practical implementation: We have access to dual-CT and contrast. The&#xD;
      feasibility study is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design problems:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a risk of categorizing some of the lymph nodes seen on the preoperative DECT scan as&#xD;
      false positive, if they are not found in the in-vitro scans, due to the effect of radiation&#xD;
      therapy. However this is a fact for both MRI and DECT.&#xD;
