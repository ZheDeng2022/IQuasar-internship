      This is a single-center, randomized, two treatment groups, open, phase IV clinical study in&#xD;
      subjects with atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus. At Visit 0 (Screening Visit)&#xD;
      subjects with left atrial thrombus established in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are&#xD;
      eligible to entry in the study. If the subjects fulfill all other in- and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      and undersign the informed consent the baseline cranial magnet resonance imaging (MRI) can be&#xD;
      performed followed by randomization to one of the two treatment groups (Phenprocoumon or&#xD;
      Dabigatran) at Visit 1 (Baseline Visit). The subjects will be treated for 12 months with&#xD;
      Phenprocoumon (INR adjusted once daily) or Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. Routinely clinical&#xD;
      follow up visits will be done at week 4, month 3, month 6, month 9 and month 12. Follow up&#xD;
      TEE will be performed after 4 weeks and after 12 months also the follow up cranial MRI at&#xD;
      this visit. If the subject was randomized in the VKA group routinely INR measurements will&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

      Bakground and study rationale: Left atrial (LA) thrombi are found in 2.5 - 18% of subjects&#xD;
      with atrial fibrillation (AF) depending on the subject population. Subjects with LA thrombi&#xD;
      have a particularly increased risk for cerebral and peripheral embolism. Consequently, oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation is recommended in those subjects. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is&#xD;
      suited and is capable of visualizing and deecting LA thrombi. Cranial magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) has a high accurancy for detecting ailent cerebral mircoembolism. However,&#xD;
      under continued effective anticoagulation with the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) Phenprocoumon&#xD;
      we have shown that only 56% of LA thrombi resolve during a 12 months TEE observational&#xD;
      period. At 1 month only 16% of the thrombi disappeared. However, cureent treatment guidelines&#xD;
      recommend 4 weeks of effective anticoagulations prior cardioversion, independent of LA&#xD;
      thrombus. In our subject population 84% of LA thrombi would have still been presented at 4&#xD;
      weeks VKA therapy and thus, would have had an increased risk of thromboembolism, if&#xD;
      cardioversion, in accordance with current guidelines, would have performed. It is well known&#xD;
      that thrombin plays a central role in the formation, growth, maintenance, and consolidation&#xD;
      of thrombus. Direct thrombin inhibition has been shown to block these processes and leads to&#xD;
      inhibition of thrombus. In vivo, it has been shown to reduce 90% of the preformed,&#xD;
      half-hour-old-thrombus. This effect is probably due to better inhibition of the catalytically&#xD;
      active clot-bound thrombin. Newer oral anticoagulants, like the direct thrombin inhibitor&#xD;
      Dabigatran are therefore very promising for resolution of LA thrombi in comparison to VKA,&#xD;
      which has not been investigated previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy variables: Expliration of possible differences for the reduction of left atrial&#xD;
      thrombus size evaluated by TEE (primary) and silent cerebral embolism (secondary) detected by&#xD;
      cranial MRI at baseline anf after a 12 month treated period with Phenprocoumon or Dabigatran&#xD;
      in order to gain mire detailed information and to generate valid hypotheses for further&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview: This is a single-center, randomized, two treatment groups, open, phase IV clinical&#xD;
      study in subjects with atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus. At visit 0 (Screening&#xD;
      visit) subjects with left atrial thrombus established in TEE are eligable to entry in the&#xD;
      study. If the subjects fulfill all other in- and exclusion criteria and undersign the&#xD;
      informed consent the baseline cranial MRI can be performed follwoed by randomization to one&#xD;
      of the two treatment groups (Phenprocoumon or Dabigatran) at Visit 1 (Baseline visit). The&#xD;
      subjects will be treated for 12 months with Phenprocoumon (INR adjusted once daily) or&#xD;
      Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. Routinly clinical follow up visits bill be done at week 4,&#xD;
      month 3, month 6, month 9 and month 12. Follow up TEE will be performed after week 4 and&#xD;
      month 12 also the follow up cranial MRI at this visit. If the subject was randomized in the&#xD;
      VKA group routinely INR measurements will performed.&#xD;
