    <textblock>
      Individuals aged 55 and older may experience negative effects of cognitive decline. The&#xD;
      proposed research seeks to evaluate the benefits of different types of interventions:&#xD;
      reasoning training following transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and reasoning&#xD;
      training following sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on frontal- lobe&#xD;
      mediated cognitive measures of executive control in adults with memory complaints, in the&#xD;
      absence of dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of reasoning training on individuals with&#xD;
      complaints of changes in memory or thinking in the absence of dementia, when combined with&#xD;
      transcranial current stimulation (tDCS). The reasoning training being studied is a strategy&#xD;
      based program where individuals are taught strategies designed to engage the frontal lobes.&#xD;
      Participants will randomly be placed into one of two groups (1) reasoning training following&#xD;
      transcranial current stimulation (tDCS) as compared to (2) reasoning training following sham&#xD;
      tDCS. The study will be done with adults between the ages of 50 and 80 with consistent memory&#xD;
      complaints or lower baseline performance on memory measures. The primary hypothesis is that&#xD;
      individuals receiving tDCS prior to brain training will have a stronger response to brain&#xD;
      training than those in the sham tDCS group. Response to training will be measured by improved&#xD;
      cognitive function and neural changes as measured by neuropsychological testing, MRI, and&#xD;
      EEG. MRI will be used to evaluate the impact of reasoning training on brain blood flow,&#xD;
      structure and function, and to measure changes in brain energy metabolism and&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate intervention outcomes. The reasoning training program&#xD;
      will be conducted in small groups at the Center for BrainHealth.&#xD;

Participants will receive 20 minutes of tDCS using 2mA or less targeting the inferior frontal gyrus prior to each of their 8 reasoning training sessions for a total of 160 total combined minutes. This time does not include set up time which should take no more than 5 minutes. A brief engaging film is shown to participants during the 20 minute session.</description>

            <description>This group will receive 20 minutes of &quot;sham&quot; tDCS, 8x over four weeks immediately followed by reasoning training 8x over four weeks.&#xD;
Sham tDCS: For the sham tDCS group, the device will be turned off after 30s. The only reported sensations from tDCS is an itching or a tingling when the device turns on but disappears quickly. Thus, those receiving sham tDCS will be unaware that the device has turned off, and will experience an initial tingling similar to that received in the tDCS group.</description>

          <description>To examine short-term and long-term effects of treatment on cognition and real-life outcomes. The participant will undergo neuropsychological testing at baseline, post-training (4 weeks), as well as 3-months post-training.&#xD;
Scores on the scale range from 0 to 16 on the California Verbal Learning Task. Higher the values are better their memory.</description>
