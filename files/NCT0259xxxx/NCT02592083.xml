  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this neoadjuvant trial is to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of the cdk 4/6&#xD;
      inhibitor palbociclib when added to standard endocrine treatment. Initially, patients receive&#xD;
      endocrine treatment for 4 weeks. In case of decrease of proliferation (Ki67) patients are&#xD;
      then randomized between either continuous endocrine therapy (arm A) or the same treatment&#xD;
      with addition of palbociclib (arm B). Patients with no change of proliferation are allocated&#xD;
      to endocrine treatment + palbociclib without randomization (arm C). During the 12-weekly&#xD;
      treatment period, clinical and radiological evaluations are performed repeatedly. Switch&#xD;
      between the treatment arms A and B is allowed in case of lack of response or due to toxicity.&#xD;
      A translational subprotocol is a mandatory part of the study protocol, except for use of&#xD;
      PET-CT evaluations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre- or perimenopausal women are treated with tamoxifen, alternatively with an LHRH analogue&#xD;
      in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (only women). Postmenopausal women receive an&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor.This treatment is given for 4 weeks. In cases with uncertain menopausal&#xD;
      status (previous hysterectomy and equivocal gonadotropins), postmenopause age limit is&#xD;
      defined as 55 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ki67 is determined by FNA or core biopsy before start and after 2 weeks of treatment. After&#xD;
      the initial 4-week period, patients with signs of response in terms of decrease of Ki67 by&#xD;
      â‰¥20% are randomized to endocrine treatment either alone or in combination with the cdk 4/6&#xD;
      inhibitor palbociclib (arm A and B). Patients with tumors with stable disease, defined as&#xD;
      &lt;20% decrease or increase of Ki67 and without radiological indication of tumor progression at&#xD;
      the 4-week evaluation are offered continuous endocrine treatment with the addition of&#xD;
      palbociclib (arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose regimen after 4 weeks of endocrine pretreatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Pre- or perimenopausal women are treated with tamoxifen, alternatively with an LHRH&#xD;
      analogue in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (only women). Postmenopausal women&#xD;
      receive an aromatase inhibitor. The preoperative treatment is continued for further 12 weeks,&#xD;
      provided that re-evaluation after 6 and 10 weeks of the preoperative treatment does not&#xD;
      indicate progression. Upon progression (PD), individualized management, preferentially&#xD;
      surgery, is the primary option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Patients receive the same endocrine treatment as in arm A together with palbociclib&#xD;
      125 mg orally days 1-21, followed by a 7-days rest period. The combined treatment is&#xD;
      continued for further 12 weeks, if re-evaluation after 6 weeks, week 10 of the preoperative&#xD;
      treatment, does not indicate progression. Upon progression (PD), individualized management,&#xD;
      preferentially surgery, is the primary option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm C: Treatment according to the schedule as described for arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative chemotherapy is recommended to patients with either residual lymph node&#xD;
      metastases &gt;2mm (macro metastases) or primary tumor size &gt;30mm in combination with Ki67&gt;15%.&#xD;
      Adjuvant endocrine treatment and radiotherapy is offered according to standard guidelines.&#xD;
      Structured follow-up visits yearly for five years include reporting of persistent&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicity, HRQoL, recurrence and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are recommended adjuvant endocrine treatment for at least 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial contains also a translational subprotocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PET-CT using FDG, confined to the chest, is performed before start of the first&#xD;
           treatment period and after 10 weeks, i.e. 6 weeks after treatment allocation (functional&#xD;
           imaging, optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Core biopsies from the tumor are collected before start of the first treatment period&#xD;
           and after 10 weeks, i.e. 6 weeks after treatment allocation. Further tissue samples are&#xD;
           collected from the surgical specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood samples are collected repeatedly during the ongoing treatment and yearly&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. FNAs from metastases in case of recurrence during follow-up.&#xD;
