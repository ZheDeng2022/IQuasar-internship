  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to assess, by near infrared spectroscopy with INVOS&#xD;
      oximeter during vascular occlusion test (VOT), the influence of cardiopulmonary bypass on&#xD;
      tissue saturation in thenar muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to compare the effects of propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia on tissue&#xD;
      saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective, randomized, open-label study. Sixty cardiac surgery patients will&#xD;
      receive either propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia. Three-minute VOT will be performed at the&#xD;
      following time points: 30 minutes after anaesthesia induction, directly after sternotomy, 20&#xD;
      and 40 minutes after aortic cross-clamping, 20 minutes after aortic cross-clamp removal, and&#xD;
      45 minutes after weaning of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group and time effects on tissue saturation will be analysed with ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's&#xD;
      test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a modern technique for cardiac surgical patient&#xD;
      monitoring. The NIRS method is based on Lambert-Beer's law, which defines the relationship&#xD;
      between the concentration of a substance and reduction of the intensity of electro-magnetic&#xD;
      radiation. This reduction results from photon absorption by chromatophores, including&#xD;
      haemoglobin, myoglobin and cytochrome P1. Absorption at the given wave-length depends on the&#xD;
      degree of chromatophore oxygenation, and hence allows for its assessment. NIRS is currently&#xD;
      commonly used for the assessment of brain oximetry in thoracic aorta surgery and,&#xD;
      increasingly often, in open-heart surgery. Algorithms for sustaining adequate brain&#xD;
      saturation were reported to decrease the incidence of neurological complications following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. In recent years, NIRS was proposed as a tool for the assessment of muscle&#xD;
      saturation under short-term ischaemia and reperfusion, referred to as the vascular occlusion&#xD;
      test (VOT). VOT is a provocative test in which tissue saturation (StO2) is measured at a&#xD;
      peripheral site, such as the thenar eminence, while blood flow is transiently occluded with&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer. After reaching a predefined ischaemia time or minimal StO2 threshold, the&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer tourniquet is rapidly deflated and blood flow in the muscle is restored.&#xD;
      Tissue saturation measurement during VOT can identify early disturbances in tissue metabolism&#xD;
      and perfusion. The speed of the decrease in tissue saturation on ischaemia was proposed to&#xD;
      reflect the local metabolic rate, while the lowest tissue saturation was proposed to reflect&#xD;
      the extent of ischaemia. The speed of tissue saturation recovery on reperfusion in shock&#xD;
      patients was proposed as a measure of microvascular capacity to increase blood flow after&#xD;
      transient ischaemia. The results of recent studies indicated that the speed of the fall of&#xD;
      muscle saturation during VOT is reduced in septic shock, while a decreased speed of&#xD;
      saturation recovery on reperfusion is related to disturbed microcirculation, for example in&#xD;
      hypovolemic shock. An understanding of anaesthetics and of the influence of cardiac surgical&#xD;
      procedures on tissue saturation profile during VOT is essential for the future use of this&#xD;
      tool for the assessment of the condition of patients during CPB cardiac surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Thenar muscle tissue saturation was continuously monitored using an INVOS NIRS monitor (INVOS-YM 5100C Cerebral Somatic Oximeter, Covidien, Mansfield, USA).&#xD;
Thenar muscle saturation was measured during VOT 30 minutes after anaesthesia induction, which will be regarded baseline value.&#xD;
At five another timepoints VOT was performed and changes in thenar muscle saturation were measured:&#xD;
directly after the sternotomy,&#xD;
during CPB - 20 minutes after aortic cross-clamping,&#xD;
40 minutes after aortic cross-clamping,&#xD;
20 minutes after the release of the aortic cross-clamp,&#xD;
45 minutes after weaning of CPB.</description>
