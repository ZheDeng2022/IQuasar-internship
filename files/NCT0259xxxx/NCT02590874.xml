  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Cymbalta (duloxetine) is effective to&#xD;
      improve cognition in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct a proof of concept clinical trial using antidepressant&#xD;
      therapy to improve cognition. This study will utilize a randomized, double blinded, placebo -&#xD;
      controlled trial design. The investigators will recruit up to 100 patients. Patients will be&#xD;
      screened multiple times to determine eligibility. Patients will be randomized into one of two&#xD;
      study groups (placebo control group and Duloxetine group). Patients in the Duloxetine group&#xD;
      will receive up to 60 mg of an FDA approved antidepressant, Duloxetine. Patients in the&#xD;
      control group will receive a placebo that is the exact shape and size of the study drug. The&#xD;
      patients, primary investigators, and research personnel will be blinded to the study&#xD;
      condition. The investigators will designate one on-site personnel to serve as data and safety&#xD;
      monitor. This person will not be blinded and will randomize patients to condition, work with&#xD;
      the pharmacy, and can un-blind condition if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential patients will be invited to a screening visit. This visit is designed to ensure&#xD;
      that the patients meet study criteria and that it is safe for them to participate in the&#xD;
      study. The screening visit will consist of physical examinations, medical and psychological&#xD;
      history, cognitive and functional testing, interviews, questionnaires, research/clinical&#xD;
      venipuncture, and a meeting with the study doctor. If a patient is accepted to the trial,&#xD;
      he/she will be expected to stay in the study for a minimum of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening visit, the study team will meet to determine if the patient will continue&#xD;
      to remain in the study. If a patient does remain in the study, he/she will be invited to a&#xD;
      randomization visit. Patients will be randomized into either the Duloxetine group or the&#xD;
      placebo control group. The data and safety monitor will use a randomization software. This&#xD;
      program allows the researcher to enter in the number of subject, and condition, and will&#xD;
      generate a table of randomly assigned patients to condition. The patients and study personnel&#xD;
      will be blinded to the condition. The data safety monitor will randomly assign patients to&#xD;
      condition and work with the pharmacy to properly label the study drugs. Only the data&#xD;
      monitoring personnel will be un-blinded and will generate the table of random numbers. After&#xD;
      randomization, patients will undergo vitals, interviews, testing, and the study drug will be&#xD;
      dispensed to them. First dosage will consist of 30 mg of Duloxetine or placebo, and the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to take the first dose at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to a 2 week post randomization visit that will consist of a meeting&#xD;
      with the study doctor to discuss concerns or side effects. Medication dosage will be raised&#xD;
      to 60 mg of Duloxetine or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen monthly for the next three months. During these visits the patients&#xD;
      will receive their study drugs, have their vital signs measured, and be questioned about&#xD;
      adverse events or any health changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month later, patients will have a follow up visit. This visit will consist of follow up&#xD;
      interview and neuropsychological testing, clinical/research blood draw, and study doctor&#xD;
      visit. This will be the final data collection study visit. The investigators will reduce the&#xD;
      dosage of the study drug to 30 mg at this visit. The patients will be instructed that the&#xD;
      investigators will be weaning off the study drug at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last study visit will be 2 weeks after the follow-up visit. This visit will consist of a&#xD;
      study debriefing with the patient. At this visit the investigators will discontinue the study&#xD;
      drug. The investigators will also arrange for the data monitoring personnel to un-blind the&#xD;
      study at this time. No data will be collected at this visit. The participants will be&#xD;
      informed of whether or not they were on the study drug or placebo. If a patient in the study&#xD;
      drug group wishes to remain on Duloxetine, the patients will be advised to discuss it with&#xD;
      their personal healthcare provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research data will be stored and managed in a secure manner following NIH guidelines and&#xD;
      according to state and institutional policies. Only authorized key personnel shall have&#xD;
      access to research related documents. All personnel will be properly trained and supervised&#xD;
      regarding the management and handling of confidential materials. The Principal Investigator&#xD;
      assumes full responsibility for such training, supervision, and conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be stored in locked file cabinets behind locked doors in the PIs research&#xD;
      laboratory until entered into the research database. Computer-based data entry will not&#xD;
      require hard copy storage. All data collected via paper-pencil will be double entered into&#xD;
      the research database by independent research assistants and results checked for quality&#xD;
      control (QC). Once all hard copies have been entered, they will be scanned into PDF files for&#xD;
      storage; all hard copies will be shredded. We will maintain the original signed consent forms&#xD;
      for our records (these documents will not be shredded and will be kept in a locked file&#xD;
      cabinet). Electronic scanned files will be stored in password protected files for security&#xD;
      purposes. All discrepancies will be validated by chart review before the data are merged into&#xD;
      the larger database. The database will contain item-level data to avoid the need for&#xD;
      subsequent data entry processes as potential data analyses arise. Periodic QC checks will be&#xD;
      conducted by our IT personnel and provided to the PI. All electronic records will be&#xD;
      maintained on password protected computers behind locked doors in the PI's office space. All&#xD;
      files will be backed up weekly on an independent external hard drive, which is also password&#xD;
      protected.&#xD;
