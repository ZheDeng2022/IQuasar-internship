  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of molar incisor hypomineralization is relatively high. It has been reported&#xD;
      that MIH-affected children experience a wide range of negative impacts because of having&#xD;
      visible enamel opacities on their incisors whether these teeth show post eruptive breakdown&#xD;
      or not. The management of MIH is challenging with a broad spectrum of treatment modalities&#xD;
      being available. However, there are no clear guidelines available to aid in clinical decision&#xD;
      making. Possible treatment options for anterior teeth with MIH include: Microabrasion, resin&#xD;
      infiltration, tooth bleaching, etch-bleach and seal technique and composite restorations or&#xD;
      veneers. It is believed that these methods could be used alone or in a combination of methods&#xD;
      to achieve better aesthetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For MIH affected-incisors microabrasion and resin infiltration are acceptable treatment&#xD;
      options which could be used alone or in a combination. Accordingly, the aim of this study is&#xD;
      to compare the clinical outcomes of using resin infiltration either alone or combined with&#xD;
      microabrasion for the management of MIH affected incisors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted on a dental unit in postgraduate clinic of Pediatric Dentistry&#xD;
      and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University, Egypt.The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis of this study is that a resin infiltration and microabrasion combined&#xD;
      treatment will result in better clinical outcomes than using resin infiltration alone. All&#xD;
      treatment procedures will be carried out by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 patients will be included in the study. The teeth will be randomized into two groups&#xD;
      according to the intervention. The study involves two types of interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (resin infiltration):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will follow the manufacturer's instructions (Icon, DMG, Hamburg, Germany). The&#xD;
      procedure involves the application of Icon-Etch, Icon-Dry as well as Icon-Infiltrant.&#xD;
      Followed by removal of excess and then polishing of the treated surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (Micro-abrasion followed by resin infiltration):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Micro-abrasion agent (Opalustre, Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) will be applied to the&#xD;
      tooth for 60 seconds using a standard rubber cup attached to a low speed hand piece followed&#xD;
      by rinsing the tooth surface with water for 20 seconds. This procedure will be repeated up to&#xD;
      5 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resin infiltration will then be carried out as discussed before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vita Easyshade Advance® spectrophotometer (Vita Zahnfabrik, Sackingen, Germany) will be used&#xD;
      to evaluate the masking color of the teeth selected in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken before, immediately after, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12&#xD;
      months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized Photograph will be taken at 5 different times (before treatment, immediately&#xD;
      afterwards, one month, 6 months and 12 months after treatment with the exact same camera and&#xD;
      conditions. The images collected will be analyzed and evaluated by 2 different dentists.&#xD;

    <description>Vita Easyshade Advance® spectrophotometer (Vita Zahnfabrik, Sackingen, Germany) will be used to evaluate the change in color of the teeth selected in the study before and after the treatment. L*, a*, and b* values will be recorded for each tooth based on the CIEL*a* b* color space. The value of color differences or color masking (∆E) will be clinically evaluated by the formula ∆E=[(∆L*)2+(∆a*)2+(∆b*). Color readings will be taken before, immediately after, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change in the patient's oral health related quality of life following the treatment: Child Perceptions Questionnaire CPQ 8-10/11-14</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It includes evaluating the patient's Oral Health Related Quality of life (OHRQoL) before and after treatment which is measured as difference in the scores of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire CPQ 8-10/11-14 before and after treatment. There are 36 items included in the questionnaire covering four different domains: oral symptoms, function related limitations as well as emotional and social well-being. The participants should answer regarding the frequency of certain events in the last six months. There are 5 responses to choose from: 0 = Never, 1 = Once or twice, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often and 4 = Every day or almost every day. The total score should range from 0 to 144. Higher scores indicate low oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL).</description>
