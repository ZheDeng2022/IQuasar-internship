  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical restraints (PR) are widely used in ICU around the world. Many institutions have&#xD;
      suggested that the use of PR should be reduced. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are a&#xD;
      convenient way of packaging evidence and presenting recommendations to healthcare decision&#xD;
      makers. There are currently no CPGs on PR in China, while other countries had, so we hope to&#xD;
      be able to adapt existing guidelines to apply in Chinese context. We use the CAN-IMPLEMENT&#xD;
      approach to adapt and implement the guidelines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) often need more invasive&#xD;
      operations (e.g.mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis), due to the needs from their&#xD;
      condition, which can also lead to acute pain, discomfort, sleep deprivation, agitation and&#xD;
      delirium. Agitation, for example, can propel patients to resist the ventilator, thus&#xD;
      increasing the oxygen consumption, causing them to accidentally remove various devices and&#xD;
      catheters on them and even posing life-threatening risks. Therefore, the main reason for the&#xD;
      use of physical restraints (PR) around ICU is to prevent patients from accidentally removing&#xD;
      the catheters or devices needed to protect their safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although PR was used to prevent Unplanned extubation (UE), there were many studies proved&#xD;
      that PR is one of the risk factors that account for UE and can not protect patient safety.&#xD;
      Indeed, its use has been proven to cause pressure injuries, worsen agitation, delirium and&#xD;
      neurovascular complications. But PR is widely used in ICU around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many institutions have suggested that the use of PR should be reduced, for example, the&#xD;
      Government of Ontario released the Patient Restraints Minimization Act in 2001 to &quot;minimize&#xD;
      the use of restraints on patients and to encourage hospitals and facilities to use&#xD;
      alternative methods, whenever possible, when it is necessary to prevent serious bodily harm&#xD;
      by a patient to himself or herself or to others. Registered Nurses Association of Ontario&#xD;
      (RNAO) issued clinical practice guidelines on the alternatives to PR in February 2012, aimed&#xD;
      to help nurses reduce the use of PR, or use it in a more reasonable and standardized way, and&#xD;
      to provide effective alternatives of PR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are a convenient way of packaging evidence and presenting&#xD;
      recommendations to healthcare decision makers. But the development and updating of&#xD;
      high-quality CPGs require substantial time, expertise and resources. Guideline adaptation is&#xD;
      the systematic approach to the endorsement and/or modification of a guideline(s) produced in&#xD;
      one cultural and organisational setting for application in a different context. Where high&#xD;
      quality guidelines are already available, adaptation may be used as an alternative to de novo&#xD;
      guideline development to customise the existing guideline to the needs of local users. There&#xD;
      are currently no CPGs on PR in China, while other countries had, so we hope to be able to&#xD;
      adapt existing guidelines to apply in Chinese context. We use the CAN-IMPLEMENT approach to&#xD;
      adapt and implement the guidelines.&#xD;
