  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners create a strong magnetic field around the body&#xD;
           to produce a detailed picture of parts of the body. This can provide a lot of useful&#xD;
           information about how the heart looks and works.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different strengths of magnets can be used in an MRI scanner and this can affect the&#xD;
           pictures that are produced. To scan the heart, two different magnet field strengths (1.5&#xD;
           tesla (T) and 3T) are mainly used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is currently unclear if when the heart is scanned using these different field&#xD;
           strengths, if the measurements that tell us how well the heart squeezes and relaxes&#xD;
           (known as 'myocardial strain') will be the same between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is investigating if myocardial strain measurements using 1.5T and 3T MRI&#xD;
           scanners are different or if they can be used interchangeably.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twenty healthy people without heart disease will be recruited to have two MRI scans on&#xD;
           the same day. The order that they have their scan (either on a 1.5T MRI scanner first or&#xD;
           a 3T MRI scanner first) will be decided randomly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All images will then be analysed using specialist software to provide measurements of&#xD;
           myocardial strain. These measured can then assessed to see if there is agreement between&#xD;
           the myocardial strain results at the two MRI field strengths.&#xD;

      -  This is a single-centre, randomised, cross-sectional, cross-over observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twenty healthy volunteers, aged 18 years and over will be recruited and will undergo&#xD;
           cardiovascular magnetic resonance scans for long axis and short axis cine imaging at&#xD;
           1.5T and 3T.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation will involve one single visit where participants will be consented,&#xD;
           randomised and then undergo scanning at both field strengths; the order of scanning at&#xD;
           1.5T and 3T will be randomised. There will be no follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will undergo balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging at&#xD;
           3T and 1.5T. Tagging images will also be acquired at both field strengths. Participants&#xD;
           will also be randomized to either have cine or tagging images obtained first on each&#xD;
           scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All scans at both field strengths will be anonymised and analysed offline by a single&#xD;
           experienced observer to determine inter-field strength agreement of left ventricular&#xD;
           systolic and diastolic strain measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further imaging analysis will take place for secondary outcomes, including analysis&#xD;
           using other software vendors, tagging images and aortic cine images.&#xD;
