  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the burden and impact of ADHD impairment in the&#xD;
      early morning and late afternoon/evening hours for adolescents and young adults. Functional&#xD;
      impairments will focus on the currently identified areas of functional impairment in the&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5, American Psychiatric&#xD;
      Association, 2013) - namely, social, academic, and occupational functioning. This is&#xD;
      necessary for two reasons: (1) the current literature on ADHD impairment and functioning is&#xD;
      concentrated within elementary school children; and (2) studies of intervention effectiveness&#xD;
      are typically concentrated during the school day. This current state of the literature&#xD;
      ignores the obvious - as ADHD is a chronic disorder, it needs to be addressed as children&#xD;
      grow into adolescence and young adulthood, and it needs to be remediated at times outside of&#xD;
      the school day such as in the morning and late afternoon/evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the specific areas assessed in the present study will relate to driving, school,&#xD;
      work, and family functioning. These are important areas to study, as the research literature&#xD;
      has typically focused on elementary school and school-day behavior in assessments of symptom&#xD;
      presentation, impairment, and treatment outcome. As individuals with ADHD grow older, the&#xD;
      entire day becomes relevant in determinations of functioning (e.g., workdays may begin in the&#xD;
      very early morning or last into the evening/night), and productivity can be assessed across&#xD;
      waking hours rather than just across the elementary school day. Once areas of functional&#xD;
      impairment in these times of day are determined, for this age group, treatment candidates can&#xD;
      aim to address these treatment targets.&#xD;

      Study aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the impairment present in the morning and late afternoon/evening for&#xD;
           individuals with ADHD, relative to a non-ADHD group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Hypothesis: Individuals with ADHD will illustrate more impaired functioning in the&#xD;
           morning and late afternoon/evening, relative to a non-ADHD group in the following&#xD;
           domains: i. Risky Driving ii. School/Workplace related behavior (e.g., time on-task in&#xD;
           the evening, management of weekly schedule) iii. Family and social functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop a set of recommendations for the evidence-based assessment of morning and late&#xD;
           afternoon/evening behavior of individuals with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that a multi-method, multi-domain assessment of&#xD;
                impaired functioning will yield the most clinically defensible assessment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rolling enrollment will be used in this study. Participants will attend an intake visit to&#xD;
      provide informed consent for participation in the study, and collect baseline and diagnostic&#xD;
      information. The targeted population will be youth and young adults between the ages of 16-30&#xD;
      with a valid driver permit or license. To determine eligibility for the study, participants&#xD;
      will complete (1) a self-report of ADHD symptoms (Molina, Smith, &amp; Pelham, 2001; Pelham,&#xD;
      Gnagy, Greenslade, &amp; Milich, 1992), (2) the Impairment Rating Scale (Fabiano et al., 2006;&#xD;
      Sibley et al., 2012a); and (3) a semi-structured Disruptive Behavior Disorders interview with&#xD;
      a clinician to obtain contextual information on symptoms and impairment over the last six&#xD;
      months (Hartung et al, 2005). Participants will also complete the WASI-2 to ascertain an&#xD;
      estimate of IQ. Additionally, a collateral rater (i.e., parent or significant other; Sibley&#xD;
      et al., 2012a, 2012b) will report on the participant's ADHD symptom ratings for the past six&#xD;
      months and retrospectively provide a report on childhood symptoms. The collateral rater will&#xD;
      also complete an Impairment Rating Scale based on the last six months. Participants will be&#xD;
      classified as ADHD if there are at least 4 symptoms of inattentive and/or&#xD;
      hyperactive-impulsive behaviors endorsed at clinically significant levels, evidence of onset&#xD;
      of ADHD prior to age 12, and current psychosocial impairment (Sibley et al., 2012a, 2012b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce variability between the ADHD and non-ADHD groups, we will match participants on age&#xD;
      (+/- 2 years), sex, and whether they are employed or unemployed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants in either the ADHD or non-ADHD group will then have a meeting with the&#xD;
      research team to initiate data collection methods over a two-week time period (i.e., 14 early&#xD;
      morning and 14 late afternoon/evening assessments; N=28 assessments/participant total). This&#xD;
      amount of repeated measurement should be adequate for detecting differences in participants&#xD;
      (e.g., Ferguson et al., 2012). To accurately capture the diverse array of potential&#xD;
      functional impairments in the early morning and late afternoon/evening hours, a multi-method&#xD;
      approach to data collection will be utilized. The keystone of the data collection process&#xD;
      will be via the adolescent/young adult's smart phone. In our data collection approach we will&#xD;
      use commercially available and commonly employed (e.g., smartphones) measurement tools to&#xD;
      develop a method of data collection that may be eventually appropriate for scale in the&#xD;
      adolescent/young adult population. Using an application that permits geo-location,&#xD;
      information on driving, and timestamps for location (e.g., Life360.com), the participants'&#xD;
      self-management within key functional domains will be assessed. The following data will be&#xD;
      collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morning and Evening Routine. Participants will provide a weekly schedule for the upcoming&#xD;
      week. Using this information, mobile technology will be used to determine success with&#xD;
      meeting expectations for morning routine (e.g., waking up; leaving for school/work; falling&#xD;
      asleep). Mobile technology will track sleeping habit and time of wakening, and geo-fencing&#xD;
      will set an alert when the participant leaves the home. Using an idiographic list of&#xD;
      responsibilities for work/school/home, we will monitor performance toward goal attainment as&#xD;
      we have done in related studies in the natural and laboratory setting (Fabiano et al., 2010;&#xD;
      Fabiano et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Driving. Early morning and late afternoon/evening driving will be monitored using the&#xD;
      participants' smartphone application, which includes the Driver Protect feature. Driver&#xD;
      Protect includes driving reports that include potentially unsafe behaviors (phone use to text&#xD;
      while driving, speeding, hard braking, collisions) as well as 30 days of location history. We&#xD;
      will collect companion driving performance information using the Life360 app which will log&#xD;
      all trips conducted by the driver, total miles traveled, record top speed for each trip, and&#xD;
      record frequency counts of hard/extreme braking and acceleration. Similar tools have been&#xD;
      successfully used in prior studies (Fabiano et al., 2011; Fabiano et al., 2016) and they are&#xD;
      well-tolerated by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family and Social Functioning. Ecological, momentary assessment will be used to assess family&#xD;
      and social functioning based on report from both the participant and identified&#xD;
      collateral(s). Ecological, momentary assessment is an approach that uses a smartphone based&#xD;
      prompt (i.e., in a text message) to ask the participant about behavior/functioning/mood at&#xD;
      that moment (e.g., Miguelez-Fernandez, et al., 2018). Participants and collaterals will be&#xD;
      contacted in the early morning and late afternoon/evening hours to obtain information on&#xD;
      typical activities, individuals they are interacting with, and to obtain a brief rating of&#xD;
      functional impairment using the Impairment Rating Scale (Fabiano et al., 2006). Participants&#xD;
      and collaterals will be contacted at least once each morning and once each afternoon/evening&#xD;
      daily, for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD Symptoms and Impairment. As part of the assessment of family and social functioning&#xD;
      probes, we will also administer a brief probe of ADHD symptoms and impairment. We will&#xD;
      include the six symptoms from the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (Kessler, et al., 2007) and&#xD;
      the overall impairment item on the Impairment Rating Scale (Fabiano et al., 2006). Data for&#xD;
      this measure will be collected during both the early morning and late afternoon/evening&#xD;
      assessment periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our prior work illustrated little reactivity with observations of behavior, even in&#xD;
      high-profile situations such as driving. Indeed, when teenagers with ADHD (16-18) had their&#xD;
      cars outfitted with on-board cameras facing the cabin and the roadway, there was no&#xD;
      difference in rates of risky driving during the first and last weeks (Fabiano et al., 2016),&#xD;
      and collaterals (parents) and teens illustrated coercive interactions strategies during these&#xD;
      on-board assessments (Schatz, Fabiano et al., 2014). In addition, parenting and teen&#xD;
      behaviors in the laboratory regarding a conflictual topic yielded sufficient behavioral&#xD;
      variability across positive and negative parent/teen behaviors (Fabiano et al., 2016); it is&#xD;
      expected that in-home, ecological, momentary assessment will be even more effective at&#xD;
      generating information on social functioning. These results suggest that there will be&#xD;
      acceptable rates of behavioral variability during the two-week assessment period and this is&#xD;
      also an assessment period of reasonable length to prevent attrition.&#xD;
