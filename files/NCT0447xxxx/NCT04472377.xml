  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hygeia Touch Inc. developed a safe and comfortable vaginal self-sampling device &quot;Hygeia Touch&#xD;
      Self Sampling Kit for Women&quot; to self-collect the vaginal discharge sample for high-risk Human&#xD;
      Papillomavirus (hrHPV) detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial aimed to evaluate the agreement of hrHPV detections between vaginal&#xD;
      self-sampling using &quot;Hygeia Touch Self Sampling Kit for Women&quot; and physician sampling, and&#xD;
      these results will be applied for TFDA registration approval.&#xD;

      Primary end-point:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Agreement of hr-HPV types, including types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58,&#xD;
           59, 66, and 68, between the physician-collected sample and self-collected sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Agreement of the presence of hr-HPV between the physician-collected sample and&#xD;
           self-collected sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-point:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. percentage of the valid sample between self-collected and physician-collected specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Agreement of all (N = 27) HPV types between the paired samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adverse events associated with sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Questionnaire of the appreciation and satisfaction of using self-collecting vaginal&#xD;
           discharge sample using &quot;Hygeia Touch Self Sampling Kit for Women&quot; through a short movie&#xD;
           and a brief illustration&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Correlation between histological diagnosis and HPV types&#xD;
