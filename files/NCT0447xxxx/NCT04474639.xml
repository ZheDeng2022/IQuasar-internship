      It is a prospective, controlled, single-center, non-randomized, observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From September 2019 to December 2020, the study plans to prospectively include 400 patients&#xD;
      aged 18 to 90 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of study is reveal single parameters of the electrocardiogram, which a good&#xD;
      correlation with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LV DD), discovered during&#xD;
      echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to assess the diagnostic effectiveness of the spectral analysis of&#xD;
      electrocardiograms obtained using a single-lead portable ECG monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo an echocardiographic examination of the heart with a determination&#xD;
      of diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle and will be divided into 2 main groups: with&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle, confirmed by the results of the echocardiography&#xD;
      and without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, for all patients single-lead ECG will be recorded (in turn of leads I) for&#xD;
      3 minutes with further spectral analysis of the data obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-lead ECG monitor CardioQvark is designed as an iPhone cover. It is registered with&#xD;
      the Federal Service for Health Supervision on February 15, 2019. RZN No. 2019/8124.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then a spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram will be performed using a continuous&#xD;
      wavelet transform, the principles of which are based on the Fourier transform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis implies an assessment of the following parameters (the parameters listed below&#xD;
      will be calculated as the median of the tact-cycle):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TpTe - time from peak to end of the T-wave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAT - time from the beginning of the QRS to the R-peak&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QTc - corrected QT interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QT / TQ - the ratio of QT length to TQ length (from the end of T to the beginning of the&#xD;
           QRS of the next complex).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRS_E - the total energy of the QRS wave based on the wavelet transform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T_E - T-wave total energy based on wavelet transform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TP_E- energy of the main tooth of the T-wave based on the wavelet transform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BETA, BETA_S - T-wave asymmetry coefficients (simple and smooth versions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BAD_T - flag of T-wave quality (whether expressed in the current lead&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRS_D1_ons - energy of the leading edge of the R-wave (based on the &quot;first derivative&quot;&#xD;
           wavelet transform)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRS_D1_offs - energy of the trailing edge of the R-wave (based on the &quot;first derivative&quot;&#xD;
           wavelet transform)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRS_D2 - peak energy of the R-wave (based on the &quot;second derivative&quot; wavelet transform)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRS_Ei (i = 1,2,3,4) - QRS-wave energy in 4 frequency ranges (2-4-8-16-32 Hz) based on&#xD;
           wavelet transform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T_Ei (i = 1,2,3,4) - T-wave energy in 4 frequency ranges (2-4-6-8-10 Hz) based on&#xD;
           wavelet transform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HFQRS - the amplitude of the RF components of the QRS wave&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally used parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TpTe, VAT, QTc - are duplicated to control the correctness of the record processing (the&#xD;
           value of the UCC should be approximately equal to the median of the tick-by-bar).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRSw - QRS width.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RA, SA, TA - the amplitudes of the R, S, T-waves, respectively, are used to normalize&#xD;
           the parameters listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical processing of results: SPSS Statistics Version 26 is a computer program for&#xD;
      statistical processing of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of this study will be the identification of ECG parameters that will correlate&#xD;
      with LV diastolic dysfunction, and by which it will be possible to determine its presence and&#xD;
      degree in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators also plan to analyze ECG parameters characteristic of patients with LV&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction in different population groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients suffering from high blood pressure with patients without the above pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with zones of a- and hypokinesis according to echocardiography as a result of a&#xD;
           coronary circulation disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients suffering from atrial fibrillation with patients without this pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  men / women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients of different age groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      During statistical processing of the data, the following will be calculated: sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, prognostic value of positive and negative results, likelihood ratio, area under&#xD;
      ROC - curve, correlation coefficient. it is planned to obtain data on the diagnostic&#xD;
      effectiveness of the proposed approach, as well as on individual parameters of the&#xD;
      electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle.&#xD;
