  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advancements with regional and local anesthesia, postoperative pain continues&#xD;
      to be a major concern for patients undergoing breast surgery. Opioids, often in combination&#xD;
      with NSAIDS and/or gabapentioids, have been the main pharmacologic pain control strategy in&#xD;
      the postoperative period. The pectoral nerve block is a regional anesthetic technique, which&#xD;
      is effective at providing postoperative anesthesia in breast surgeries. However, this has&#xD;
      only been studied in oncologic-related breast operations. It is our aim to study the effects&#xD;
      of pectoral regional nerve blocks in patients undergoing breast reduction for gender&#xD;
      affirmation. The overall goal is to establish an effective pain control regimen utilizing&#xD;
      regional anesthetic techniques in this patient population. The specific objective of this&#xD;
      proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of these blocks on perioperative and postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia. The hypothesis is that participants undergoing gender-affirmation breast surgery&#xD;
      who receive a pectoral nerve block will have less perioperative and postoperative pain as&#xD;
      well as reduced opioid consumption compared to those receiving a placebo. Participants who&#xD;
      are undergoing gender affirmation breast reduction surgery will be randomized to either&#xD;
      receive a preoperative nerve block or to receive a placebo. Intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      opioid requirements will be compared in addition to post-operative pain scores. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to fill out a pain diary during their first week postoperatively. They will&#xD;
      also be asked to document if, and when, narcotic pain medication was required for pain&#xD;
      control. The two groups will be compared to determine if there was any difference in pain&#xD;
      scores as well as narcotic medication requirements.&#xD;

      All participants will be seen in clinic with the attending surgeon anywhere from two weeks to&#xD;
      a few months prior to the date of surgery. Participants will also have a pre-op visit with&#xD;
      anesthesia a few weeks before surgery. They will undergo a standard anesthesia preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation, which will include a medical chart review, physical exam, and appropriate&#xD;
      laboratory studies. The preoperative evaluation will be identical for those participating in&#xD;
      the study and those who do not. If no contraindications to the Pectoralis Nerve Block (PECS I&#xD;
      and II block) are identified by the surgeon and/or anesthesiologist, participants will be&#xD;
      approved to participate. The participants will be introduced to the study either during their&#xD;
      clinic visit prior to surgery or over the telephone a few days prior to surgery. All&#xD;
      questions will be answered by one of the study investigators. A study consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the participants and they will then will be randomized into either control&#xD;
      (sham block) or experimental (PECS I and II block) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, as per standard of care, each participant will undergo a general&#xD;
      anesthetic in the same manner with conventional perioperative management. During induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia, up to 2mg of midazolam and/or up to 100mcg of fentanyl will be given. The above&#xD;
      protocol will be followed regardless of study participation and study group (if&#xD;
      participating). After induction of anesthesia, the nerve blocks, or control blocks, will be&#xD;
      performed. The regional anesthesia team will be involved in all patients, whether in the&#xD;
      control or intervention group. All patients will be come and go regardless of group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (control) will receive an injection of 20ml of saline between the pectoralis minor&#xD;
      and serratus anterior muscles bilaterally and 10ml of saline between the pectoralis minor and&#xD;
      pectoralis major muscles bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (treatment) will receive an injection of 20ml of 0.2% Ropivacaine between the&#xD;
      pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles bilaterally and 10ml of 0.2% Ropivacaine&#xD;
      between the pectoralis minor and pectoralis major muscles bilaterally. (Not to exceed 225mg&#xD;
      or 3.5mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PECS I and II Block Technique: Performed in the supine position with the arms abducted 90&#xD;
      degrees at the shoulder. Using an ultrasound transducer in the parasagittal plane, the&#xD;
      axillary artery and vein are identified just inferior to clavicle and medial to coracoid&#xD;
      process. Additionally, the 2nd rib is identified and the transducer is slid inferiorly until&#xD;
      the 3rd and 4th rib are identified. At this point the pectoralis major, minor, and serratus&#xD;
      anterior muscles are seen. Then the block needle is inserted through the skin and advanced&#xD;
      into the fascial plane between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles. After negative&#xD;
      aspiration, the anesthetic is injected into the plane watching for hydrodissection of the&#xD;
      muscles. A total volume of 20ml is injected. Then the needed is withdrawn until the tip is&#xD;
      located in the fascial plane between the pectoralis major and minor muscles. 10ml of&#xD;
      anesthetic is injected into this plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia is maintained in the standard fashion. The anesthesiologist will&#xD;
      administer Fentanyl as he or she feels necessary during the operation. Post operatively, in&#xD;
      the PACU, participants will be given IV hydromorphone as needed for pain. Pain scales will be&#xD;
      documented at set time points post operatively and participants will be given pain diaries to&#xD;
      document these pain scores as well as their opioid consumption. All patients will be sent&#xD;
      home with a prescription for 20 tablets of Norco 5mg/325mg. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      document their pain scores at the following post op time points: 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6&#xD;
      hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 1 week. Participants will return their pain&#xD;
      diaries at the 1 week post operative visit. This visit is a standard of care follow up visit.&#xD;
