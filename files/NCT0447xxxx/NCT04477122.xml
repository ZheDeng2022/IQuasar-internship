    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of radial shock wave therapy in the treatment&#xD;
      of temporomandibular joint syndrome. For this objective, subjects recruited will be allocated&#xD;
      in an experimental group or a placebo group. Both groups will receive one manual therapy and&#xD;
      radial shock waves therapy (real for experimental group, a sham device for placebo group)&#xD;
      session per week along one month. Pain, neck function and quality of life measured will be&#xD;
      performed before the intervention, after the last treatment and at one month follow-up.&#xD;

      Temporomandibular Disorders (TMDs) are a subgroup of painful orofacial disorders of the&#xD;
      stomatognathic system, characterized by TemporoMandibular Joint (TMJ) pain, fatigue of the&#xD;
      cranio-cervico-facial muscles (especially the masticatory muscles), limitation of mandibular&#xD;
      movement and the presence of a click or crackling sound in the ATM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main signs and symptoms associated with TMDs are bruxism (33%), myofascial pain (14%),&#xD;
      headache (96%) and functional limitation (93%), the latter being related to posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life of patients with TMD involvement is diminished in various facets of their&#xD;
      lives, leading to a private expense for the patient as well as a public expense resulting&#xD;
      from a poor referral due to the lack of adequate treatment for TMDs. This expense ranges in&#xD;
      Spanish public hospitals at € 146.9 with a minimum of € 52 and a maximum of € 425.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this study, we are going to carry out a non-invasive, analgesic, anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      treatment and without negative side effects for the patient through radial extracorporeal&#xD;
      shock waves (rESWT), and manual therapy (TM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the effects produced by shock waves we find that they improve circulation due to&#xD;
      increased blood flow and oxygenation, at tissue level the permeability of the membrane&#xD;
      increases and its metabolic process, therefore facilitating the activation of tissue&#xD;
      regeneration processes experiencing dystrophic changes. Furthermore, shock waves cause&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects and muscle relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the capacity of the shock waves to improve the&#xD;
      alterations due to temporomandibular disorders. To meet the above objective, a single-blind&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial study has been designed. The selected subjects will be of legal age&#xD;
      diagnosed with temporomandibular disorder and those subjects that due to their own&#xD;
      characteristics are not able to carry out the study will be excluded. Subjects will receive a&#xD;
      weekly physical therapy session for four weeks. Subjects will be randomly assigned to two&#xD;
      groups: T1 intervention group consisting of subjects who will receive manual therapy&#xD;
      treatment and shock waves and T2 placebo group in which the subjects will receive manual&#xD;
      therapy and placebo shock waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated using sociodemographic variables such as age, sex, weight, height,&#xD;
      Body Mass Index, educational level, work, smoking, alcohol and physical activity and function&#xD;
      tests and quality of life questionnaires will be used. Measurements will be made pre and&#xD;
      post-treatment, one month after the last evaluation, the measurements will be made again for&#xD;
      follow-up. The intervention will be one day a week for four consecutive weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected using a self-implementing questionnaire, these data will be&#xD;
      transferred to an excel table and then transferred to SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and&#xD;
      MedCalc 19.1 (MedCalc Software Bv, Ostend, Belgium, http: // wwww .medcalc.org; 2019) for the&#xD;
      subsequent statistical analysis, the data being stripped of any direct reference to the&#xD;
      subject to preserve confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The descriptive analysis will be carried out with means and standard deviations for&#xD;
      continuous variables, frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. The normality of&#xD;
      the continuous variables will be calculated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the&#xD;
      homocedasticity of the sample with the Levene test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the statistical analysis will be carried out with a confidence level of 95% (p &lt;0.05),&#xD;
      for the comparison of the two groups we will use the Student's t-test and the Chi-square&#xD;
      test. Comparisons between treatment group and placebo group will be made using repeated&#xD;
      measures analysis of variance and ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni to compare measures&#xD;
      replicated over time.&#xD;
