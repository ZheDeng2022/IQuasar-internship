  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare, in subjects with obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) treated&#xD;
      by long-term non-invasive ventilation (NIV), resting energy expenditure (REE) in spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing and under NIV. The hypothesise of this study is that REE will be lower under NIV&#xD;
      than under spontaneous breathing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational monocentric study in which each subject will be its own control.&#xD;
      Patients' resting energy expenditure will be measured at rest (&quot;spontaneous breathing&quot;&#xD;
      condition) and under its usual treatment (&quot;under NIV&quot; condition) in a cross-over fashion.&#xD;
      Conditions measurement order will be randomly generated by a computer algorithm such that&#xD;
      half of the patients will be measured under spontaneous breathing before under NIV and the&#xD;
      other half of the patients will be measured under NIV before under spontaneous breathing.&#xD;
      Resting energy expenditure will be monitored during a short-term elective hospitalization (24&#xD;
      hours). Albeit for measurements of REE, tests which will be performed are part of the regular&#xD;
      follow-up of patients under long term NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to compare in OHS patients the REE under spontaneous breathing and under&#xD;
      NIV, using their usual settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the intended procedures and stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment and screening of patients fulfilling inclusion criteria will be done among&#xD;
           patients with OHS under long-term NIV followed by our center (duration: 14 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Once informed written consent has been provided, patients will be included in the study&#xD;
           protocol (time provided for decision: 28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients are admitted for one night with overnight recording of nocturnal oximetry and&#xD;
           transcutaneous capnography using their noninvasive ventilation at usual settings, prior&#xD;
           to measurements of resting energy expenditure. Downloading of memorized data by&#xD;
           ventilator software will also take place and will cover the previous month and the night&#xD;
           of the study (duration: 12 hours). These procedures are part of the routine evaluation&#xD;
           of patients under long term NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Body weight will be measured, as well as body composition by bioelectrical impedance:&#xD;
           briefly, a very low intensity electric current is sent between 2 electrodes placed on&#xD;
           the dorsum of the foot and the ipsilateral hand. Measurement of resistance and reactance&#xD;
           allows estimation of body compartments (fat-free mass and fat mass) (duration: 30&#xD;
           minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients will undergo their first indirect calorimetric measurement. Prior to REE&#xD;
           measurements, patients must be fasting for at least 10 hours, in a supine position, or&#xD;
           if required for patient comfort, with a 30° inclination of head rest for at least 30&#xD;
           minutes. REE measurements are either performed with or without noninvasive ventilation&#xD;
           (conditions order will be randomized by a computer)(duration: 30 minutes of rest and&#xD;
           20-30 minutes of indirect calorimetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Interval between measurements of at least 1 hour, to avoid impact of noninvasive&#xD;
           ventilation on measurements. Between tests, they will perform pulmonary function tests&#xD;
           and have their arterialized capillary blood gases sampled at earlobe (duration: 1 hour).&#xD;
           These tests are part of the routine evaluation of patients under long term NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients will undergo their second indirect calorimetric measurement (see details in&#xD;
           section on indirect calorimetric). Prior to REE measurements, patients must be fasting&#xD;
           for at least 10 hours, in a supine position, or if required for patient comfort, with a&#xD;
           30° inclination of head rest for at least 30 minutes. REE measurements are either done&#xD;
           with or without noninvasive ventilation (randomized order by a software) (duration: 30&#xD;
           minutes of rest and 20-30 minutes of indirect calorimetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. These two tests will be performed in a randomized order (spontaneous breathing or&#xD;
           noninvasive ventilation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Information to the patient of the results, which will also be forwarded to physician and&#xD;
           nutritionist in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016-2017, seventy-four OHS patients treated at home by long-term NIV were identified in&#xD;
      our area. Expecting a participation rate of around 50%, at least 30 patients will be included&#xD;
      in the present study. With such a sample size, the study will have a power of 80% to detect&#xD;
      an effect size of 0.5.&#xD;
