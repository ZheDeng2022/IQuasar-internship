    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to compare subjective efficacy of trans vaginal mesh and&#xD;
      laparoscopic colposakropexy (CSP) in women with an apical prolapse. The CSP group is further&#xD;
      divided into two sub-groups; one where the mesh fixation is only at the apical part of the&#xD;
      vagina, and another where the fixation is also extended to the levator plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are safety (peri- and post-surgery complications, pain, erosion),&#xD;
      objective efficacy (simplified POP-Q), and re-operation rate. Subjective outcome also&#xD;
      includes the assessment of sexual satisfaction. Cost-effectiveness is studied by comparing&#xD;
      both direct costs and QALYs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is defined as an anatomical support defect of the pelvic viscera.&#xD;
      Women's POP is the descent of uterus or vaginal apex with or without concomitant descent of&#xD;
      the anterior (cystocele) or posterior (rectocele) vaginal wall. It is estimated that the&#xD;
      lifetime risk of POP surgery in women is approximately 10-13%, the incidence peak being 20-30&#xD;
      years after the first delivery, which is also the most important risk factor for POP. Other&#xD;
      risk factors include previous hysterectomy, obesity and genetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The typical POP symptoms are a feeling of bulge, accompanied with urinary incontinence,&#xD;
      defecation problems, and sexual dissatisfaction. First line treatments are conservative, but&#xD;
      if they fail, surgery is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Native tissue repair of the anterior and / or posterior vaginal wall (colporrhaphy anterior /&#xD;
      posterior) is commonly the first-line operation. The possible concomitant apical prolapse&#xD;
      needs to be suspended which is typically done by either by performing a hysterectomy with&#xD;
      shortening and suspension of the sacrouterine ligaments, or by amputation of the cervix with&#xD;
      suspension of the cardinale and sacrouterine ligaments (Manchester operation). An unsuspended&#xD;
      apical defect will double the relapse rate (20 vs 11%). In most of the apical recurrences&#xD;
      mesh is used to achieve sufficient support. The re-operation rate of any POP in Finland is&#xD;
      10.8% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In mesh operations the apex can be suspended either transvaginally (TVM) by anchoring the&#xD;
      mesh to the sacrospinosus ligaments, or by doing a colposacropexy (CSP) where the mesh is&#xD;
      attached to the sacrum, mostly via laparoscopy. The CSP techniques vary e.g. the mesh can be&#xD;
      attached only apically or also to the levator plane. If needed, colporrhaphies can be done&#xD;
      concomitantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of TVM has decreased due to the FDA-warnings and litigations concerning mainly the&#xD;
      risks of erosion and pain. This has lead to withdrawals of mesh products, despite&#xD;
      well-conducted clinical studies indicating that in well-chosen women light-weight small TVM&#xD;
      is not associated with major complications. Currently, no TVM with good quality clinical data&#xD;
      is available. Traditionally, CSP has been considered safer than TVM in regard of erosions and&#xD;
      pain, but the data is scarce. Furthermore, CSP has a longer learning-curve and is a more&#xD;
      time-consuming operation than TVM, whereas hospital stay is shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators knowledge, there is only one published study where TVM and CSP has been&#xD;
      compared, and in that study a large &quot;covering&quot; TVM was used which was thereafter withdrawn&#xD;
      from the market. In addition,in most studies, operation techniques, especially with CSP are&#xD;
      not standardized. Therefore, further head-to-head comparisons are needed. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a study comparing efficacy and safety when using the TVM or CSP approach in women&#xD;
      with an apical defect. The investigators will also evaluate whether, in CSP, apical fixation&#xD;
      alone is sufficient, or whether levator plane fixation provide a better outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to compare subjective efficacy (PFDI-20, question nro 3;&#xD;
      feeling of bulge) between TVM and CSP in women with an apical prolapse. The CSP group is&#xD;
      further divided into two sub-groups; one where the mesh fixation is only at the apical part&#xD;
      of the vagina, and another where the fixation is also extended to the levator plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are safety (peri- and post-surgery complications, pain, erosion),&#xD;
      objective efficacy (simplified POP-Q), and re-operation rate. Subjective outcome also&#xD;
      includes the assessment of sexual satisfaction. Cost-effectiveness is studied by comparing&#xD;
      both direct costs and QALYs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age over 18 years and capability to understand the study protocol either in Finnish or&#xD;
      Swedish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectively diagnosed symptomatic apical prolapse (leading apical prolapse (points C/D â‰¥-2)&#xD;
      and a history of previous POP operation including hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No need for any other concomitant operations except colporrhaphies and possible prophylactic&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy in CSP groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A history of previous serious or prolonged pain after any operation. Regular use of systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroid medication. Incapability to understand the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups, procedures, and randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are randomized into three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Transvaginal mesh: BSC mesh (A.M.I., Feldkirch, Austria) is attached to the sacrospinous&#xD;
           ligaments and to the apical part of the vagina. Briefly, 0,25% Lidocain solution with&#xD;
           adrenaline is injected to the anterior vaginal wall and towards the sacrospinous&#xD;
           ligaments bilaterally to reduce bleeding and aid dissection. A vertical incision to the&#xD;
           anterior vaginal wall is done from a point below the bladder neck to approximately 1cm&#xD;
           from the vaginal apex. A full-thickness blunt dissection is done leaving the vaginal&#xD;
           fascia laterally, with tunneling to the sacrospinous ligaments. The two arms of the mesh&#xD;
           are attached with an i-Stich instrument (A.M.I.) to the sacrospinous ligaments 1-2 cm&#xD;
           laterally from the ischial spines. The anterior edge of the mesh is attached to the&#xD;
           vaginal fascia with three Monocryl 3-0 sutures. If needed, the mesh may be shortened in&#xD;
           length and is so, the removed piece is measured and recorded. The arms of the mesh are&#xD;
           set to the stage that the vaginal wall is reduced to its natural position. Complete&#xD;
           vaginal wound closure is done with Vicryl 3-0 sutures. A roll of vaginal gauze for&#xD;
           compression is applied and foley catheter inserted until the following morning. A single&#xD;
           i.v. dose of 1.5g cefuroxime antibiotic is given at the time of anesthesia induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Colposacropexy with the apical fixation only: EndoGYNious (A.M.I., Feldkirch, Austria)&#xD;
           CSP mesh is attached laparoscopically to the apical part of the vagina. Briefly, a&#xD;
           single i.v. dose 1.5 g of cefuroxime is administered at the time of the anesthesia&#xD;
           induction. The umbilical entry is done optically by a 11 mm trocar and a&#xD;
           pneumoperitoneum up to 12 mmHg is created (then lowered to 8 mmHg, if possible, after&#xD;
           all trocars are inserted). A five mm trocar is placed to the left lower abdomen, a 11 mm&#xD;
           trocar on the left side superior to the previous and a 7.5 mm Airseal trocar to the&#xD;
           right lower abdomen. The promontory is visualized and the avascular space is dissected&#xD;
           by an advanced energy instrument (Thunderbeat, Olympus). The right ureter, the major&#xD;
           vessels and the right hypogastric nerve trunk are identified and avoided during the&#xD;
           dissection. Opening of the right pelvic peritoneum is done with dissection of the&#xD;
           pararectal space. The posterior vaginal peritoneum is opened below the level of the&#xD;
           insertions of the uterosacral ligaments (USL) and the opening is extended to the&#xD;
           peritoneum over the left pararectal area. The rectovaginal and the left pararectal&#xD;
           spaces are dissected to create a posterior peritoneal flap. Anteriorly, the peritoneum&#xD;
           below the vaginal apex is opened and dissected to create an anterior peritoneal flap. A&#xD;
           CSP mesh is fixed to the vaginal apex with five non-absorbable Surgilon 2-0 sutures&#xD;
           utilizing an extracorporeal knot-tying technique: three in a row to the apex and two to&#xD;
           the sides two centimeters posterior to the apex (or alternatively three sutures to the&#xD;
           cervix if it is present). A vaginal speculum examination is performed and any sutures&#xD;
           penetrating the vaginal mucosa are removed and replaced with new ones. The tension of&#xD;
           the mesh is controlled visually via a speculum examination. Anterior and/or posterior&#xD;
           colporraphy is introduced at this point if a vaginal wall prolapse exceeding -2 position&#xD;
           is seen after tensioning the mesh. The mesh is attached to the promontory with five&#xD;
           fasteners (CapSure, Bard). The peritoneum is closed by a running V-Loc Colposacropexy&#xD;
           with apical and levator fixation: EndoGYNious (A.M.I., Feldkirch, Austria) CSP mesh is&#xD;
           attached via laparoscopy to the apical part of the vagina with fixation reaching to the&#xD;
           level of levator plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Colposacropexy with the apical and the levator fixation: EndoGYNious (A.M.I., Feldkirch,&#xD;
           Austria) CSP mesh is attached laparoscopically to the apical part of the vagina with&#xD;
           fixation reaching to the level of the levator planes. Briefly, the technique is similar&#xD;
           to the apical fixation with the following exceptions: the pararectal spaces are&#xD;
           dissected deep to the level of the levator ani muscles and the CSP mesh is fixed with 11&#xD;
           sutures (figure) (two to the levator ani muscles, two to the insertions of the USLs and&#xD;
           two to the midline of the posterior vaginal wall; the apical fixation is done similar to&#xD;
           the former group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all groups concomitant colporrhaphies can be conducted. Anterior or posterior colporraphy&#xD;
      is done in the following fashion: a 0,25% lidocaine solution containing adrenaline is&#xD;
      injected under the anterior or posterior vaginal wall to provide haemostasis and&#xD;
      hydrodissection. The vaginal wall is incised and the fascia is separated from the vaginal&#xD;
      epithelium using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection. The fascia is plicated using a&#xD;
      running 3-0 PDS suture in two layers. Excess vaginal epithelium is excised and the vaginal&#xD;
      epithelium is closed with a running 3-0 Vicryl suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the operators have conducted at least ten surgeries with the mesh before taking part into&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is subjective success; defined as the absence of vaginal bulge, i.e.&#xD;
      negative response to PDFI-20, question 3 at one-year following the surgery. Previous&#xD;
      literature show various results. Altman et al (NEJM 2011) described that this outcome was&#xD;
      achieved in 61% of women following a transvaginal mesh surgery. A prospective study by Duraes&#xD;
      et al (2019) and Wei et al described an even higher success of 92% to 94%. Laparoscopic CSP&#xD;
      has shown a subjective success rate of 91% to 94%. Based on these findings we assumed that&#xD;
      the subjective success would be 80% following laparoscopic CSP and 75% following a TVM. The&#xD;
      TVM operation is the study population that is compared to the laparoscopic CSP performed in&#xD;
      two different technique (see methods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical power is based on a non-inferiority assumption with a binary outcome. On the&#xD;
      basis of previous studies we estimated that 96 patients are needed in each group for 80%&#xD;
      power to detect a 20% difference in the primary outcome measure, with a two-tailed error of&#xD;
      1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drop-out ratio of 10% is assumed and 106 women are needed in each group (transvaginal mesh,&#xD;
      laparoscopic colposacropexy type A and laparoscopic colposarcopexy type B). Thus, a total of&#xD;
      318 women are planned to be randomized for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom spesific: Pelvic floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20), Pelvic floor Impact&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PFIQ), Pelvic Organ Prolapse / Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PISQ-12) Overall quality of life: 15D and RAND-36 questionnaires Pain is evaluated by visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS; 0-10) scale. The questionnaires are filled preoperatively, and after 6&#xD;
      months, 12 months, and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the leading part of the apical point, and anterior and posterior vaginal walls&#xD;
      (cm in relation to the hymen level) preoperatively, and after 6 months, 12 months, and 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri- and postoperative (both short- and long-term) complications and possible re-operations&#xD;
      are recorded and classified according to the Claviend-Dindo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operation time, hospital stay, length of sick leave and costs of medications for operation&#xD;
      and possible complications are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct and indirect costs cover length of operation time, length of hospital stay, needed&#xD;
      pain medication at home, other needed medication, length of sick leave, costs of possible&#xD;
      further outpatient department visits or hospital stay with possible re-operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QALY calculations are based on 15D and RAND-36 questionnaires.&#xD;
