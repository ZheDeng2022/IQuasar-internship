      A Controlled Clinical Study of TC/PD-1 Inhibitors Combined With anlotinib as First-line&#xD;
      Treatment for Advanced ESCC&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence rate of esophageal cancer is high in China and mainly squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
      In recent years, although the level of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy of esophageal&#xD;
      cancer has improved, and studies have confirmed the role of anlotinib and PD-1 mAb in the&#xD;
      posterior line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the prognosis of esophageal&#xD;
      cancer is still not ideal. How to expand the clinical benefits of immunotherapy in esophageal&#xD;
      cancer has become a research hotspot. Recent studies have shown that PD-1 mAb combined with&#xD;
      other therapies with different mechanisms can improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. In the&#xD;
      impawer150 study, platinum containing dual drug chemotherapy plus anti angiogenesis therapy&#xD;
      combined with immunotherapy showed statistically and clinically significant PFS benefits in&#xD;
      the first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, which provides a new choice&#xD;
      for the first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. So far, there is no&#xD;
      report on the first-line treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with&#xD;
      platinum containing dual drug chemotherapy plus anti angiogenesis drugs combined with&#xD;
      immunotherapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cisplatin plus&#xD;
      cisplatin in the treatment of advanced esophageal cancer.&#xD;
