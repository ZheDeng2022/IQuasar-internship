  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the safety, tolerability and early signs of efficacy&#xD;
      of the antibody-cytokine fusion protein IL12-L19L19 in patients with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      solid carcinomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), after previous immune checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of IL12-L19L19 and to establish&#xD;
      MTD, as recommended dose (RD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to assess early signs of efficacy, the&#xD;
      determination of pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and the immunogenicity of IL12-L19L19.&#xD;

    <description>The study will take place in two stages:&#xD;
In the dose escalation part, participants will be enrolled in cohorts and will be treated with different doses of IL12-L19L19 in order to identify a RD to be further explored in the subsequent dose expansion part. In the dose escalation part, patients will be treated in cohorts of 1 to 6 patients with escalating doses of IL12-L19L19 until the MAD is reached.&#xD;
Following successful identification of the RD, the study will proceed with a dose expansion part and 40 patients will be treated at the RD dose level.</description>

    <description>Part I - The dose escalation is designed with an initial accelerated phase followed by a standard 3+3 design. Cohorts contain one patient until first instance of moderate toxicity or a DLT in the DLT observation period (28 days). With the second occurrence of moderate toxicity or occurrence of a DLT the accelerated phase will be terminated and the dose escalation will continue with a 3+3 dose escalation. Initiation of the study treatment for an individual subject will occur not less than 7 days after initiation of the study treatment for the previous patient. Not more than 2 patients are to be treated simultaneously within their DLT observation period (i.e., Day 1 to Day 28).&#xD;
Part II - Dose expansion: Once the dose escalation is completed, additional 40 patients will be enrolled at the RD to better understand the safety profile and to explore early signs of efficacy in different disease indications.</description>
