  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to assess the safety and effectiveness of isoquercetin to&#xD;
      reduce levels of soluble P-Selectin in patients with sickle cell disease. Isoquercetin is a&#xD;
      naturally occurring flavonoid-or vitamin. You will find quercetin and isoquercetin in fruits&#xD;
      and vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drug involved in this study are/is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Isoquercetin&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase 2 study in adults with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) to assess the&#xD;
      effect of oral isoquercetin on biomarkers of endothelial and platelet activation,&#xD;
      inflammation and ongoing blood coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
           including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The names of the study drug involved in this study are/is: Isoquercetin&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will receive study treatment for 1 year and will be followed for 30&#xD;
                days after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
           safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in&#xD;
           treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved isoquercetin as a treatment&#xD;
           for any disease.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible subjects require an established diagnosis of sickle cell disease/homozygous&#xD;
             hemoglobin S (SCD-SS) or sickle cell disease hemoglobin β0-thalassemia (SCD-Sβ0-thal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on other therapy including hydroxyurea will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have preserved organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes ≥2,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥75,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Estimated creatinine clearance ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with&#xD;
                  creatinine levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with no evidence of worsening over the last 4 weeks (e.g. any acute&#xD;
             complication of SCD including but not limited to VOC, acute chest syndrome and stroke,&#xD;
             that required unscheduled medical attention or intervention) as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on anticoagulation therapy will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of isoquercetin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of isoquercetin&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Please ensure exclusion criteria are clearly worded to describe participants who will&#xD;
             not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be concurrently receiving any other study agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with no evidence of worsening over the last 1 month (e.g. any acute&#xD;
             complication of SCD including but not limited to VOC, acute chest syndrome and stroke,&#xD;
             that required unscheduled medical attention or intervention) as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Familial bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently using daily use of aspirin (&gt;81mg daily), Clopidogrel (Plavix), cilostazol&#xD;
             (Pletal), aspirin-dipyridamole (Aggrenox) (within 10 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to isoquercetin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, cardiac arrhythmia,&#xD;
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit study compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because isoquercetin is a PDI inhibitor&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment&#xD;
             of the mother with isoquercetin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with isoquercetin. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
