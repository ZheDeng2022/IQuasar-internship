  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reinforcement learning is an advanced analytic method that discovers each individual's&#xD;
      pattern of responsiveness by observing their actions and then implements a personalized&#xD;
      strategy to optimize individuals' behaviors using trial and error. The goal of this pilot&#xD;
      study is to develop and test a novel reinforcement learning-enhanced text messaging program&#xD;
      to support medication adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is an&#xD;
      optimal condition in which to test this program, as it is one of the most prevalent chronic&#xD;
      conditions in the US adult population and requires most patients to be on daily or twice&#xD;
      daily doses of medications. This pilot study will be a parallel randomized pragmatic trial&#xD;
      comparing medication adherence and clinical outcomes for adults aged 18-84 with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes who are prescribed 1-3 daily oral medications for this disease. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two arms for the duration of the study period: (1) a reinforcement&#xD;
      learning intervention arm with up to daily, tailored text messages based on time-varying&#xD;
      treatment-response patterns; or (2) a control arm with up to daily, un-tailored text&#xD;
      messages. Our outcomes of interest will be medication adherence, as measured by electronic&#xD;
      pill bottles, and HbA1c levels.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the intervention arm will receive up to daily, tailored text messages based on their electronic pill bottle-measured adherence. Given the participants' baseline characteristics and time-varying responses to the messages, a reinforcement learning algorithm will deliver different text messages and adapt over time to determine which type of messaging works best for each individual participant.</description>
