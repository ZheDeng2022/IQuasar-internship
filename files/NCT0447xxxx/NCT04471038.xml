  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide despite available antivirals&#xD;
      and vaccines. SAB Biotherapeutics, Inc. has developed SAB-176, an anti-influenza human&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (transchromosomic [Tc] bovine-derived) intravenous therapeutic to treat past&#xD;
      and current strains of Type A Influenza and Type B Influenza. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of SAB-176 in healthy participants.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥18 years and ≤60 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body mass index (BMI) of 19-32 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have values in normal ranges for basic labs (i.e., CBC, PT/INR, Chem-7,&#xD;
             and LFTs), unless deemed not clinically significant by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥90 mL/min at screening, calculated using the&#xD;
             Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must agree to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Not take any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications with the exception of&#xD;
        acetaminophen, ibuprofen, vitamins, seasonal allergy medications, and/or contraceptive&#xD;
        medications, or others unless approved by the study investigator, for a period 7 days prior&#xD;
        to study drug administration (i.e., Day 0). Use one of the following in order to avoid&#xD;
        pregnancy: Females who are able to become pregnant (i.e., are not postmenopausal, have not&#xD;
        undergone surgical sterilization, and are sexually active with men) must agree to use at&#xD;
        least 2 effective forms of contraception from the date of the subject's signing of the&#xD;
        informed consent form through 60 days after the last dose of study drug. At least one of&#xD;
        the methods of contraception should be a barrier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Males who have not undergone surgical sterilization and are sexually active with women must&#xD;
        agree to use condoms plus have a partner use at least one additional effective form of&#xD;
        contraception from the date of the subject's signing of the informed consent form through&#xD;
        60 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neither females or males should donate oocysts or sperm for use in artificial insemination&#xD;
        through 60 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Any history of allergy, anaphylaxis, or severe reaction to beef products (including&#xD;
             milk and gelatin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any history of allergy, anaphylaxis, or severe reaction to IVIg or human blood&#xD;

             conditions that are treated with Tylenol, over-the-counter non-steroidal&#xD;
             anti-inflammatories, vitamins, seasonal allergy medications, or oral/transdermal/IUD&#xD;
             contraceptives, etc. The study investigator will make a determination to exclude a&#xD;
             subject based upon their medical history and the type and frequency of the drug&#xD;
             substance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of cardiovascular disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or unexplained&#xD;

             the day of infusion will be deferred until the infection is cleared in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator. Subjects that present with an active upper respiratory infection on&#xD;
             the day of infusion will be tested with an FDA licensed Influenza A/B Antigen Test.&#xD;
             Signs and symptoms constituting an upper respiratory infection include cough, sore&#xD;
             throat, or rhinorrhea with or without fever.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Positive urine drug screen (UDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Clinically significant results, including laboratory results, as determined by study&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;

             within 5 half-lives or 30 days, whichever is longer, prior to study drug&#xD;
             administration (i.e., Day 0) and until completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Participation in any other research study until the completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to study drug administration (i.e.Day&#xD;
             0)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Receipt of any vaccination within 30 days prior to study drug administration (i.e.Day&#xD;
             0)&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would limit&#xD;
