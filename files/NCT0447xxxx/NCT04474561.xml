      A)Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 44% of patients with Inflammatory bowel disease have Ulcerative colitis(UC)&#xD;
      which is a lifelong, chronic disease, starting in early adulthood, where the colon becomes&#xD;
      inflamed and ulcerated due to a complex interaction between genetics, altered immune&#xD;
      function, and environmental factors2such as dietary intake. While the etiology of UC is not&#xD;
      clear, it is hypothesized the abnormal immune response and chronic inflammation may be caused&#xD;
      by dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and decreased epithelial barrier function.&#xD;
      Substantial evidence suggests that higher than normal levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the&#xD;
      colon plays a role in the etiology of UC. The higher levels of H2S and sulfate-reducing&#xD;
      bacteria (SRB) found in the feces of patients with UC is likely caused by the reduced&#xD;
      conversion of H2S to thiosulfate by rhodanese (thiosulfate transferase enzyme)12, and&#xD;
      increased colonization or activity of SRB. For example, SRB has been identified as the&#xD;
      predominant bacterial group in patients with UC compared to the minority group in healthy&#xD;
      individuals, and SRB growth is stimulated by the presence of sulfur-rich amino acids. Dietary&#xD;
      intervention may help to repair the dysbiosis existing in the microbiome of the patient with&#xD;
      UC, but research about food and recurrence of UC is conflicting. Dietary components such as&#xD;
      sulfur and sulfates also appear to play a role in the recurrence of UC; although a recent&#xD;
      review of the relationship between sulfur-containing foods and UC calls for more randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs) examining a reduced sulfur diet in UC. With the body of evidence&#xD;
      described above, there is a compelling reason to consider that sulfur and sulfate-containing&#xD;
      foods contribute to developing severe UC. Thus, understanding how dietary modulation of&#xD;
      sulfur intake within the context of UC impacts disease status is the focus of this proposal.&#xD;

      A)Overview and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher than normal levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the colon plays an important role in&#xD;
      the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). Increased H2S impairs the colonic cell's ability to&#xD;
      oxidize butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids required for cell nutrition. Sulfur in the&#xD;
      human body is largely provided by diet; high intakes of sulfur and sulfate-containing foods&#xD;
      have been found to be associated with an increased risk of recurrence of UC. Hence, it is&#xD;
      only rational to identify whether foods high in sulfur or sulfate increase the risk of poor&#xD;
      outcomes in UC. To our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating the impact of a&#xD;
      reduced sulfur diet compared to conventional management on disease severity in patients with&#xD;
      UC. Our main objectives are to identify if a reduced sulfur diet added to conventional&#xD;
      management results in 1. improved disease severity, 2. reduced exposure of the host to&#xD;
      sulfur-containing compounds, and 3. alterations in the microbiome of the patients. To achieve&#xD;
      these objectives, we will randomly allocate the patients to either the conventional&#xD;
      management (CM) or reduced sulfur diet intervention group (INT) and obtain the Mayo score,&#xD;
      concentrations of fecal hydrogen sulphide (H2S), methanethiol (MT), and dimethyl sulphide&#xD;
      (DMS), and urinary dimethyl sulfone (DM202) and 3-indoxyl sulfate and fecal microbiome at&#xD;
      baseline and after 8 weeks. The INT group will also receive diet counselling by a registered&#xD;
      dietician (RD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B)Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reduced sulfur diet would result in improved disease severity compared to conventional&#xD;
      management in UC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C)Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To pilot-test the feasibility of a reduced sulfur diet added to conventional management&#xD;
      with oral and/or topical 5-ASA ± corticosteroid therapy to improve disease severity, measured&#xD;
      by a clinically meaningful improvement in Total Mayo Score &amp; partial Mayo Score from baseline&#xD;
      to week 8 compared to conventional management alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To pilot-test the feasibility of a reduced sulfur diet added to conventional management&#xD;
           with oral and/or 5-ASA ± oral corticosteroids to lower exposure of the host to&#xD;
           sulfur-containing compounds from baseline to week 8 measured by fecal hydrogen sulphide&#xD;
           (H2S), methanethiol (MT), and dimethyl sulphide (DMS), and; urinary dimethyl sulfone&#xD;
           (DM202), and 3-indoxyl sulfate concentration compared to conventional management alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the effect of a reduced sulfur diet on the microbiome of patients with UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify patient experience with a reduced sulfur diet using health related quality&#xD;
           of life (HRQoL), and patient experience with chronic disease care measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine the effect of a reduced sulfur diet on inflammatory cytokines in patients&#xD;
           with UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot randomized controlled trial will have an 8-week interventional design that will&#xD;
      take place at the University of Calgary (UofC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Raman, the principal investigator, will oversee recruitment of eligible patients. In&#xD;
      addition, Dr. Panaccione, Director of the IBD unit at the University of Calgary, and&#xD;
      co-investigator for this study who along with the eight physicians associated with the IBD&#xD;
      group at the University of Calgary will identify eligible study patients through dedicated&#xD;
      outpatient IBD clinics and refer to Dr. Raman and the study coordinator for recruitment. The&#xD;
      Calgary IBD unit assesses approximately 600 patients per month with at least 20 of them&#xD;
      meeting eligibility criteria for this research project. All patients with UC in the IBD&#xD;
      clinic who meet inclusion criteria will be approached for participation by the study&#xD;
      coordinator after approval from their gastroenterologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient consents to participate s/he will be randomly allocated to either the&#xD;
      conventional management (CM) or intervention group (INT). Randomization will be performed&#xD;
      using a computerised random number generator and group assignment will be concealed from the&#xD;
      study coordinator enrolling patients until the time of assignment using sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INT group will receive conventional management plus a reduced sulfur diet and diet&#xD;
      counselling by an RD. Implementation of the diet will be delivered directly by the RD and&#xD;
      will provide each patient with an individualized plan. A reduced sulfur diet includes&#xD;
      reducing foods, food additives (e.g., carrageenan) and beverages high in sulfate/sulfur&#xD;
      associated with increased severity of UC consuming drinking water low in sulfate (can be as&#xD;
      high as 500 mg/L in Alberta so identifying drinking water source is necessary)21, limiting&#xD;
      sulfur containing supplements (e.g., chondroitin sulfate), and consuming omega-3 fatty acid&#xD;
      supplements to potentially help control overgrowth of sulfur-reducing bacteria in the&#xD;
      colon14. Omega-3 fatty acid intake for cardiovascular disease prevention should be around 500&#xD;
      mg/d23. In a representative Canadian population, average intake was 291 mg/d and 85% of&#xD;
      adults were not meeting daily requirements23. After dietary assessment if patients are not&#xD;
      meeting their required daily intake of 500 mg/d of Omega-3, the RD will recommend increased&#xD;
      fish consumption to 200 g per week or 1 g/d of an Omega-3 supplement. This will ensure the&#xD;
      daily recommended intake of 500 mg/d is being met to reduce the chances of a deficiency;&#xD;
      however, a therapeutic dose for UC will not be recommended (i.e., &gt; 4 g/d18). The CM group&#xD;
      will receive one session with RD on reduced sulfur diet at the end of 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reduced sulfur diet eating plan, resources on reduced sulfur eating, and RD counselling&#xD;
      session will be designed and reviewed by experts in nutrition, dietary design, education&#xD;
      resources and dietary behaviour change. Both the INT and CM groups will receive conventional&#xD;
      management with visits to the clinic at 4 weeks to ensure completion of their 24-hour food&#xD;
      recalls and food frequency questionnaires, and to discuss disease course with their&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;

    <measure>Mayo Score: Change is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week -8</time_frame>
    <description>Mayo score is used for patients with active disease.Mayo Score is one of the most commonly used indices of UC severity. Score ranges from 0-12 with a score ≤ 2.5 indicating remission. Mayo Score includes ratings of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance at endoscopy and physician rating of disease activity. Higher score means worse outcomes.&#xD;
For the patients in remission disease activity will be measured using the non-invasive partial Mayo Score calculated at baseline and week 8. Partial Mayo score excludes mucosal appearance at endoscopy but includes stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician rating of disease .</description>
