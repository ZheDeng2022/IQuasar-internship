  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The applicant and research team partners have over the last years developed the WARD project&#xD;
      (Wireless Assessment of Respiratory and circulatory Distress), using wireless continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of vital signs in high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. An&#xD;
      important perioperative indicator not currently included in the WARD project is continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring (CGM), which may not only predict and identify hypo- and hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      but also utilize the information from variations in blood glucose in combination with other&#xD;
      changes in vital signs to predict surgical complications in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study involves the inclusion of 80 patients, scheduled for major abdominal,&#xD;
      orthopedic or vascular surgery, to be monitored with CGM in addition to the currently&#xD;
      measured vital signs. The project is a prospective, observational, clinical study, describing&#xD;
      and analyzing variations in perioperative blood glucose levels and vital signs, and the&#xD;
      relation to adverse clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for elective surgery will preferentially be recruited at the preoperative&#xD;
      assessment at a maximum of 30 days before surgery. CGM and monitoring of the remaining vital&#xD;
      sign modalities will commence on the day of surgery. Patients admitted for acute surgery will&#xD;
      be recruited preoperatively and CGM as well monitoring of the remaining vital sign modalities&#xD;
      will commence as soon as possible. The patients will be monitored with CGM for up to 10 days&#xD;
      and with the remaining modalities for up to 5 days or for all modalities until discharge or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
