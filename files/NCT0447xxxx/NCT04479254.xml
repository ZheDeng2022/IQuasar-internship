  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate nutritional support is an essential element for achieving favourable outcomes in&#xD;
      critically ill patients. Therefore, an accurate determination of patients' energy needs is&#xD;
      required to optimize nutritional support and reduce the harmful effects of under- and&#xD;
      over-feeding. Currently, indirect calorimetry is considered as a gold standard for measuring&#xD;
      energy expenditure during critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized study aims to investigate the impact of indirect calorimetry guided nutrition&#xD;
      therapy on clinical outcomes such as ICU. Mortality, hospital mortality, duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, length of I.C.U./hospital stay and mascle wasting. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesis that nutrition therapy guided by IC will improve clinical outcomes in severely ill&#xD;
      patients&#xD;

      This is a single-blind randomized control study. Eligible participants are randomly assigned&#xD;
      within 24 hrs of ICU. admission in two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention group: The calorie needs will be determined by indirect calorimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: a routine standard weight-based equation (20-25kcal/kg ideal body&#xD;
           weight/day) will be used to estimate the energy requirements of critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily energy and protein data will be recorded for a maximum of 12 evaluable days&#xD;
      (nutritional days) or until death or discharge from ICU.while outcome data will be collected&#xD;
      for a maximum of 28 days.&#xD;

    <description>Enteral Nutrition (EN) will be the preferred route of nutrition, and will be initiated within the first 24-48 hours of ICU admission. Caloric requirements will be measured by indirect calorimetry IC as soon as possible after recruitment and will be repeated in every 24 hrs. The amount of delivery is gradually increased to avoid the possibility of gastrointestinal intolerance. If EN fails to reach caloric goals or not feasible supplementary Parenteral nutrition(PN) will be initiated after 5-7days</description>

    <description>Enteral Nutrition (EN) will be initiated within the first 24-48 hours of ICU. Admission. Enteral nutrient delivery is gradually increased to avoid the possibility of gastrointestinal intolerance so that a few days are required to achieve the caloric target. PN will be started after 5-7 days if EN is not feasible. Energy and protein goals will be calculated by the standard weight-based equation of 25 kcal/kg BW body weight and 1.2-2.5 g/kg body weight, respectively.</description>

    <description>Enteral nutrition feeding formula is used in powder form and will be reconstituted by attending nurses, Continuous feeding is commonly used which will be prescribed by the attending clinicians, Energy and protein intake from EN will be estimated by multiplying the volume of feed given to energy (kcal) and protein (g) in 1 ml of standard dilution, and for Standard PN product, energy and protein intake will also be calculated based on the volume infused.</description>
