      The hypothesis is that the differential extent of microstructural damages in the affected&#xD;
      brain regions can be specific to the disease of interest and could reflect the clinical&#xD;
      severity. Therefore, we propose that the whole brain parcellation of diffusion MRI can be&#xD;
      used to improve the diagnosis and prediction of clinical outcomes in Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A regression model between clinical severity and two-year clinical outcomes and&#xD;
           diffusion properties from multiple parcellated regions will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blind validation will be performed.&#xD;

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by&#xD;
      resting tremor, bradykinesia, restricted mobility, and postural instability. Early diagnosis&#xD;
      of PD would be paramount for further treatment and prognosis. The most common&#xD;
      neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndrome is known as Parkinson's disease (PD) or idiopathic&#xD;
      Parkinson syndrome, if it occurs sporadically (not familial) and its lead clinical symptom is&#xD;
      a movement disorder after brainstem-predominant Î±-synuclein deposition. To distinguish them&#xD;
      from Parkinson's disease, other sporadic entities have been named atypical parkinsonian&#xD;
      syndromes or atypical parkinsonism. The present review article describes current standards&#xD;
      for the diagnosis and treatment of the most important disease entities in this latter group:&#xD;
      dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear&#xD;
      palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD is diagnosed mainly by neurologists, based on clinical symptoms. However, there are no&#xD;
      objective criteria available for their diagnosis. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      is often employed in conjunction with clinical judgment, the images are mostly used to&#xD;
      eliminate other diseases, rather than to confirm the diagnosis. Other imaging methods, such&#xD;
      as Positron Emission Tomography or Computed Tomography, may help in the diagnosis of PD but&#xD;
      have harmful effects on the human body. MRI image of patients with Parkinson's disease is&#xD;
      usually normal. Previous studies have also indicated that brain-related areas, such as the&#xD;
      atrophy of basal ganglia, are not observed until a period of disease progression. However,&#xD;
      the shrinkage of brain tissue cannot be used as a criterion for the diagnosis of Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, because many other diseases are accompanied by atrophy of brain tissue as well.&#xD;
      Furthermore, because human brain cells cannot regenerate, It is too late to diagnose or treat&#xD;
      when a large number of nerve cells are apoptotic. Since we expect the function of the&#xD;
      diseased cells to change first, therefore, if you can detect changes in the patient's brain&#xD;
      microenvironment, it is possible to achieve early detection of Parkinson's disease. Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging can detect functional images and display functional changes, thus providing&#xD;
      an opportunity to detect abnormalities and diagnose diseases early. One of the key&#xD;
      technologies in the measurement of functional images is diffusion magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion MRI has been widely utilized to investigate the patterns of neural connectivity.&#xD;
      Mean diffusivity (MD) and the directionality (fractional anisotropy (FA)) have been studied&#xD;
      in epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and noticeably in Parkinson's Disease. Owing to their&#xD;
      paramount pathogenetic role in Parkinson's disease, the basal ganglia in general and the&#xD;
      substantia nigra pars compacta, in particular, have been the subject of intense MRI&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan uses standard anatomic labeling (AAL) to perform whole-brain diffusion MRI to obtain&#xD;
      diffusion data for the whole brain parcellation. We will use statistical methods to identify&#xD;
      the areas affected by each PD's subtype, we will also identify areas that are likely to be&#xD;
      related to the severity of the disease, and then combine these areas for linear regression&#xD;
      analysis. We anticipate that diffusion magnetic resonance imaging can be used as a&#xD;
      differential diagnosis, as well as to define areas of high correlation with clinical&#xD;
      severity, and to be used for accurate disease prediction and future development, and to&#xD;
      provide physicians and patients with clinically important information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program uses diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to assess clinical status and prognosis&#xD;
      for Parkinson's disease. Our research goal is&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish objective and clear imaging diagnostic criteria of diffusion MRI for&#xD;
           idiopathic and atypical Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish objective and clear clinical severity and the prognosis prediction mode of&#xD;
           diffusion MRI for idiopathic and atypical Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
