      The primary goal of this research is to study the prevalence of the wearing-off effect and&#xD;
      possible risk factors for wearing-off symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis using&#xD;
      ocrelizumab with the use of questionnaires. Furthermore, the goal is to study whether&#xD;
      patients receiving extended dosing of ocrelizumab experience more wearing-off symptoms or&#xD;
      adverse events in general. Finally, we would like to extend knowledge on wearing-off symptoms&#xD;
      in general.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody very effective for the treatment of relapsing-remitting&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Ocrelizumab is usually&#xD;
      administered intravenous every six months. Natalizumab is another type of treatment used for&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and is administered every four weeks. Often patients&#xD;
      report MS-related symptoms just prior to their next infusion such as fatigue, coordination&#xD;
      problems or motor problems, the so-called wearing-off phenomenon. The exact etiology of this&#xD;
      phenomenon remains unknown. Although not studied before, patients do report similar symptoms&#xD;
      when using ocrelizumab. Furthermore, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some patients receive&#xD;
      extended dosing of ocrelizumab based on b-cell count. Whether this can increase wearing-off&#xD;
      symptoms is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to study the prevalence of wearing-off symptoms and possible&#xD;
      risk factors for wearing-off symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis using ocrelizumab.&#xD;
      All patients using ocrelizumab during one year or more that provided written informed consent&#xD;
      to participate in the study will be asked to complete three questionnaires before or during&#xD;
      their next treatment with ocrelizumab. The questionnaires that will be used are the MSIS-29,&#xD;
      the treatment satisfaction questionnaire and a questionnaire about wearing-off symptoms.&#xD;
      Exact weight of the participants will be measured. Information about age, gender, date of&#xD;
      diagnosis, start date of ocrelizumab, clinical and radiological disease activity, EDSS score,&#xD;
      b-cell count and the biomarker neurofilament light will be extracted from the patient files.&#xD;
      After two weeks, participants receive two additional digital questionnaires, the MSIS-29 and&#xD;
      a follow-up questionnaire about wearing-off symptoms.&#xD;
