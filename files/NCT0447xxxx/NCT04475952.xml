  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper digestive tract cancer (UDC) is a major disease burden worldwide encompassing all&#xD;
      cancers involving the digestive tract (from oral cavity to duodenum). A majority of patients&#xD;
      presenting with this disease are diagnosed late and have poor overall survival rates (&lt;20%).&#xD;
      NICE referral guidelines for diagnostic endoscopy are usually associated with late disease.&#xD;
      Exhaled breath testing is a non-invasive and acceptable technology utilising mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (MS) which has shown promise at diagnosing cancer at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has shown that products formed as a result of metabolism can be measured in&#xD;
      breath and saliva (biomarkers). This has the ability to accurately identify patients with&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers from breath. Our initial pilot data has demonstrated&#xD;
      that changes in the breakdown of metabolites release volatile organic compounds (VOC) which&#xD;
      can be measured with MS. This data is supported by other patient studies. However no previous&#xD;
      study has been performed utilising a non-invasive technique with breath and saliva. Thus the&#xD;
      aim of this study is to identify VOCs present in patients with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multi-centre study the investigators want to overcome the limitations of previous&#xD;
      work by utilising non-invasive samples (breath, saliva and urine) in patients in multiple&#xD;
      sites. The investigators aim to conduct a study in patients with UDC and those without. The&#xD;
      investigators hope that the results of this study will provide evidence for large scale&#xD;
      analysis of patients with this disease, demonstrate the feasibility of this technique and&#xD;
      move this valuable test forward into mainstream medical practice. The major advantage of this&#xD;
      test is that it is easy to undertake and painless for the patient. This study of products in&#xD;
      breath, saliva and urine will be useful for detecting UDC to allow treatment at an early&#xD;
      stage, improving overall survival.&#xD;

        Patients recruited from secondary care will have been referred by their responsible&#xD;
        clinician to undergo either a laryngoscopy (which involves visualisation of the highest&#xD;
        part of the oesophagus, larynx and vocal cords, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (which&#xD;
        involves a telescope test to visualise the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum) or a lower&#xD;
        gastrointestinal endoscopy (which involves a telescope test to visualise the colon) or&#xD;
        surgery. No other investigations will be required.&#xD;
