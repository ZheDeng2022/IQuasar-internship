      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) of single- and multiple-ascending doses (SAD (Part 1) and MAD (Part 2)) and food effect&#xD;
      (FE) of RO6953958 following oral administration in healthy male participants. Part 3&#xD;
      (Drug-drug interaction (DDI)) will assess the safety, tolerability, and effect of RO6953958&#xD;
      on the PK of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A substrate midazolam.&#xD;
