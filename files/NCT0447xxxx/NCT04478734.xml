      Evaluate the safety and tolerability of combined oral thiamine with biotin therapy in&#xD;
      patients with Huntington´s disease in mild to moderate stages and it is intended to evaluate&#xD;
      the biological effect of the treatment in the central nervous system of these patients using&#xD;
      as the main biomarker the increase in the level of thiamine monophosphate (TMP) in&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these patients with Huntington Disease (HD) during a follow-up&#xD;
      period of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main hypothesis is that combined thiamine-biotin oral therapy is a secure and&#xD;
      well-tolerated treatment, potentially capable of modifying the disease course or avoiding the&#xD;
      progression of symptoms in early-stages HD patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of the safety and tolerability of the combined oral thiamine and biotin&#xD;
      therapy in patients with HD will be performed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodic clinical examination and anamnesis directed by a neurologist during&#xD;
           face-to-face and non-contact visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The collection of adverse effects during interviews of face-to-face visits to assess&#xD;
           tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analytical monitoring with hematological and biochemical control (hepatic and renal&#xD;
           function) during the dose escalation period, subsequently being this periodic control&#xD;
           every 3 months, from signature of informed consent until the end the follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the biological efficacy of treatment with combined oral thiamine and biotin&#xD;
      therapy in increasing thiamine monophosphate (TMP) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of&#xD;
      patients with HD is to be performed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The determination of thiamine levels: free thiamine, TMP, and thiamine pyrophosphate&#xD;
           (TTP) in CSF and blood of patients at the beginning and after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of thiamine levels (free, TMP and TTP) between the start and the end of the&#xD;
           study in CSF and serum of patients with HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the biological efficacy of the treatment with combined oral thiamine and&#xD;
      oral biotin therapy in neurodegeneration produced in HD will be performed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) levels in CSF at the baseline&#xD;
           visit and after the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The obtained score in the motor and Total Functional Capacity (TFC) section of the&#xD;
           Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of bradykinesia through quantitative motion measurement techniques&#xD;
           (Quantitative motor assessment, Q-motor). Q-motor assessment relies on three-dimensional&#xD;
           position sensors and pre-calibrated force translators, for standardized movement&#xD;
           recording. This measurement will be made to patients in the pre-selection visit,&#xD;
           randomization, and quarterly face-to-face visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Score on the quality of life scale (SF-36).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variation in the overall clinical impression scale of the patient and the examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of the change in the volume of the caudate nucleus, white matter, and&#xD;
           cortical thickness, as well as in the change of the Combined cerebral atrophy score.&#xD;
           Measurements of cerebral structures will be acquired on magnetic resonance imaging scans&#xD;
           (3T) at the baseline visit and after the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the sample size required to examine secondary and exploratory objectives, we&#xD;
      based our estimations on the published thiamine-biotin treatment effects in preclinical HD&#xD;
      models, and on the reported differences in CSF thiamine levels between HD patients and&#xD;
      healthy subjects (Pico S, et al. 2021). According to the previous results, it is expected&#xD;
      that a medium-to-high effect size (0.6 ≤ Cohen's d ≥ 0.8) would be necessary to restore TPP,&#xD;
      TMP and Free-thiamine levels in CSF after treatment. Based on the parameter choices, for a&#xD;
      desired power of 0.80 and a Type I error rate of 0.05, we estimate that we would need 24 HD&#xD;
      patients to detect a standardized mean difference of 0.6. Sample size analysis was conducted&#xD;
      using GPower 3.1.9.7 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic data collection as well as the information related to all the variables&#xD;
      analyzed during the study will be done through an electronic data collection notebook. The&#xD;
      notification of adverse effects, severity, and relationship with study medication will be&#xD;
      done through an electronic data collection notebook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be conducted using SPSS v.26.0. IBM software and R studio&#xD;
      software package. Linear regression will be used when the variables are quantitative (eg,&#xD;
      scale measurements, CSF thiamine or NfL levels, among others) controlling for age, sex, CAG&#xD;
      repetitions and motor symptom severity (UHDRS and UHDRS-Total Functional Capacity) at&#xD;
      baseline as potential confounding variables. Logistic or multinomial regression when the&#xD;
      variables are groups (binary or multinomial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will examine the association between the severity of disease and CSF thiamine among HD&#xD;
      patients by fitting a linear mixed model for each clinical measurement, with age, sex, CAG&#xD;
      repetitions and disease severity (UHDRS-TFC) as the covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging performed during the study will be processed with specific&#xD;
      neuroimaging programs for volumetry, diffusion and cortical thickness.&#xD;
