  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and muscle wasting are common consequences of life-threatening, chronic diseases&#xD;
      of the gastrointestinal tract. Such diseases include liver cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis&#xD;
      and short bowel syndrome. Malnutrition and muscle wasting increase the risk of complications,&#xD;
      reduce the life expectancy and impair the quality of life. The development of malnutrition&#xD;
      and muscle wasting is different, as is the diagnosis and nutritional treatment. There are&#xD;
      also different mechanisms of origin for the underlying diseases. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      compare data related to nutrition and physical condition of patients with liver cirrhosis,&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis and short bowel syndrome. Malnutrition and muscle wasting within the&#xD;
      specific diseases will be characterized and possible correlations will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, malnourished and non-malnourished patients of the different diseases are compared&#xD;
      with controls patients with non-specific complaints of the gastrointestinal tract as well as&#xD;
      with healthy study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on food intake, physical activity, body composition and body measurements as well as&#xD;
      muscle strength and muscle function are recorded. Blood values as well as transport and&#xD;
      barrier properties of the intestine will also be examined.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and sarcopenia are consequences of life-threatening gastroenterological diseases&#xD;
      such as liver cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis and short bowel syndrome and are associated&#xD;
      with a poorer clinical outcome and a reduced quality of life. The diagnostic criteria of both&#xD;
      conditions differ, as do the consequences for adequate nutritional therapy. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      malnutrition and sarcopenia are often discussed in confusion in the literature. In addition,&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms of malnutrition and sarcopenia can differ in the various diseases.&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare nutrition-associated parameters from patients with liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis and short bowel syndrome, to characterize the&#xD;
      disease-specific phenotype of malnutrition and sarcopenia of the examined diseases and to&#xD;
      obtain information on mechanistic relationships. The pathophysiological understanding of the&#xD;
      clinical settings as well as the development of malnutrition and sarcopenia is important for&#xD;
      choosing specific nutritional therapies. For this, malnourished and non-malnourished patients&#xD;
      of each examined disease are compared with controls from patients with non-specific,&#xD;
      abdominal symptoms and healthy control subjects. Data on food intake, physical activity, body&#xD;
      composition and anthropometry as well as muscle strength and muscle function are recorded.&#xD;
      Clinical and chemical blood parameters, the plasma metabolome as well as transport and&#xD;
      barrier proteins of the intestine are also examined.&#xD;
