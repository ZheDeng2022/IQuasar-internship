      In clinical practice discrepancies between overnight SpO2 recordings performed by 2 devices&#xD;
      used simultaneously are regularly observed. However, this has not been systematically studied&#xD;
      or quantified. It is therefore important to determine if these discrepancies are anecdotic,&#xD;
      or frequent, and to what extent this may affect decisions in clinical practice such as&#xD;
      implementing (or withdrawing) oxygen in subjects under noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or adjusting NIV settings.&#xD;

      Pulse oximetry estimates oxygen saturation in the arterial blood by trans-illuminating a&#xD;
      translucent tissue (usually a fingertip, or an ear lobe) with light-emitting diodes at 2&#xD;
      specific wavelengths. Absorption of light at these different wavelengths (660 nm, red, and&#xD;
      940 nm, infrared respectively) differs between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. The&#xD;
      amount of light which is transmitted at both wave lengths is then quantified and processed by&#xD;
      an algorithm that displays a saturation value. The signals are corrected for the pulsatile&#xD;
      nature of arterial oxygen flow. Devices also provide pulse rate measured by plethysmography&#xD;
      (pulse-related changes in volume of fingertip or earlobe). Since its introduction in the&#xD;
      early 1980s, pulse oximetry has proven to be an essential tool for the non-invasive&#xD;
      assessment of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). The use of pulse oximeter is now widespread and&#xD;
      interests acute care settings as well as primary care settings. Although there have been&#xD;
      recent improvements in signal analysis such as increasing sampling frequency and improving&#xD;
      reflectance technology [4], the accuracy of commercially available oximeters differs. First&#xD;
      of all, there is variability in the way accuracy of pulse oximetry devices is reported within&#xD;
      2% (± 1 SD) or within 5% (± 2 SD) of reference measurements obtained by blood gases analysis&#xD;
      [5]. Secondly, there is a variability between commercially available devices, especially&#xD;
      below a SpO2 of 90%. This is partly explained by the fact that calibration of the different&#xD;
      algorithms employed in signal processing is limited by the range of saturations that can be&#xD;
      safely obtained in healthy volunteers. In respiratory medicine, it has been shown that such&#xD;
      variability of accuracy could affect the diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea&#xD;
      Syndrome (OSAHS) and impact on clinical decisions as the recorded number of apneas/hypopneas&#xD;
      varied between devices during nocturnal sleep studies [8] Nocturnal hypoxemia (NH) is&#xD;
      considered as one of the major determinants of adverse cardiovascular complications and&#xD;
      neurocognitive impairment in patients suffering of chronic respiratory failure (CRF). Because&#xD;
      of its simplicity, short set-up time and short time response, pulse oximetry is a valuable&#xD;
      screening tool for nocturnal hypoxemia despite its disadvantages such as motion artefacts or&#xD;
      sensitivity to perfusion. Therefore, definitions of NH rely solely on nocturnal oximetry&#xD;
      recording: for instance, in a consensus statement on noninvasive ventilation, spending &gt; 5%&#xD;
      of sleep time under 88% of SpO2 was considered as a relevant threshold. Definitions of NH&#xD;
      remain arbitrary and different expert-based thresholds have been suggested in the medical&#xD;
      literature [10]. Patients suffering from nocturnal hypoventilation, especially those with an&#xD;
      average daytime SpO2 close to the steep portion of the hemoglobin dissociation curve (SpO2&#xD;
      between 90-94%), are at higher risk for NH. Therefore, in these patients, device imprecision&#xD;
      could have a significant impact on medical decisions, such as deciding to adjust ventilator&#xD;
      settings in patients under noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and/or implementing nocturnal oxygen&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with CRF and NIV, after optimal adjustment of ventilator settings, prescription&#xD;
      of nocturnal oxygen supplementation is common practice although impact of nocturnal oxygen&#xD;
      supplementation on survival, patient comfort, or prevention of cor pulmonale has yet to be&#xD;
      demonstrated. Practically speaking, it increases considerably the burden of the treatment for&#xD;
      the patient and care givers (additional connections and tubings, noise of the oxygen&#xD;
      concentrator etc.). To our knowledge, no study has evaluated how the use of different pulse&#xD;
      oximeters could impact on this decision. Three types of devices are used in clinical&#xD;
      practice: pulse oximetry using a probe connected to the home ventilator device, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry combined with transcutaneous capnography, or using a &quot;wrist watch&quot; type of device.&#xD;
