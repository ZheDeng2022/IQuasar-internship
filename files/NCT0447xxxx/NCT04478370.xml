  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The characteristics of the humoral response directed against mosquito saliva antigens are not&#xD;
      known precisely. This is a major limitation for using immunological markers as an outcome in&#xD;
      epidemiological trials and as an indicator for operational deployment of interventions.&#xD;
      Recent advances in the assembly of the genome of some Anopheles and Aedes mosquito vector&#xD;
      species has facilitated the identification of new candidate peptides in silico, using the&#xD;
      sequences of orthologous salivary gland proteins and B-cell prediction algorithms. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the humoral immune response directed against candidate&#xD;
      peptides following controlled exposure to laboratory-adapted colonies of An. minimus, An.&#xD;
      maculatus and An. dirus, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will provide essential information to identify and validate immunological&#xD;
      markers of human exposure to malaria and dengue mosquito vectors in Southeast Asia.&#xD;
      Immunological markers would be useful to understand transmission dynamics and predict the&#xD;
      risk of transmission as part of a surveillance system, and to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      vector-control interventions in entomological trials or during operational deployment of&#xD;
      interventions in the region.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a human challenge model with five arms corresponding to controlled exposure to&#xD;
      bites of uninfected laboratory-adapted colonies of Anopheles minimus, An. maculatus, An.&#xD;
      dirus, Aedes. aegypti or Ae. albopictus. Following screening and eligibility assessment, 150&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in the study using a block-randomized design stratified on the&#xD;
      mosquito species and number of bites (35 or 305 bites in total) such as to constitute 10&#xD;
      groups of 15 individuals for each of the study condition. Participants will be in the study&#xD;
      for 112 days. The baseline will consist of 2 visits over 2 weeks (day 0 and day 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the low-exposure groups, participants will be exposed to 5 mosquito bites at weekly&#xD;
      intervals from day 14 to day 56 (seven challenges with 5 mosquito bites/challenge over six&#xD;
      weeks, yielding a total of 35 mosquito bites). In the high-exposure group, participants will&#xD;
      be exposed to 5 mosquito bites on day 14 and then to 50 mosquito bites at weekly intervals&#xD;
      from day 21 to day 56 (one challenge with 5 mosquito bites and six challenges with 50&#xD;
      mosquito bites/challenge over 6 weeks, yielding a total of 305 mosquito bites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of bites and modalities of the follow up used in this study were chosen based on&#xD;
      previous entomological investigation conducted in this area, published reports of human&#xD;
      challenge with mosquito bites and current knowledge on the characteristic of the humoral&#xD;
      response against saliva antigens. Both immediate and delayed skin reactions will be recorded&#xD;
      after day 14 and day 21 challenges, requiring additional visits at day 15 and day 22.&#xD;
      Participants with hypersensitivity to mosquito bites will be withdrawn from the study. Both&#xD;
      capillary and venous blood samples will be collected weekly from each study participant.&#xD;
      Eighteen venous blood samples will be collected including one sample of 2 mL drawn during&#xD;
      screening visit, 14 samples of 8.6 mL during visits 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16,&#xD;
      17, 18 and 19, and 3 samples of 18.6 mL during visits 4, 13 and 20 (178.2 mL of venous blood&#xD;
      per participant in total). Seventeen dry blood spot (DBS) samples will be made from of 300 μL&#xD;
      of capillary blood collected during visits 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,&#xD;
      18, 19 and 20 (5.1 mL of capillary blood per participant in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate peptides will be identified in silico using publicly available genomes sequences&#xD;
      and B-cell epitope prediction algorithms. The kinetic of antibody titers against candidate&#xD;
      biomarkers will be assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and mesoscale&#xD;
      screening performed with serum and DBS specimens. Briefly, the positivity threshold of the&#xD;
      assay will be determined using reference sera specimens from individuals not exposed to&#xD;
      mosquito bites, as described previously. The ELISA signal measured in 60 reference sera&#xD;
      obtained from unexposed individuals (30 Thai sera obtained from the Thai Red Cross and 30&#xD;
      Australian sera obtained from the Burnet Institute) will be used to define the positivity&#xD;
      threshold of the assay. The positivity threshold of the assay will be defined as three&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD) above the mean optic density (ΔOD) measured for the unexposed control&#xD;
      population. A test in the study population with a ΔOD above this cut-off will be considered&#xD;
      positive (i.e. an immune response). The specific antibody titer of study samples will be&#xD;
      determined by performing serial dilution experiments. Serial dilution will be made from study&#xD;
      samples and the ΔOD will be determined for each dilution. The antibody titer will be defined&#xD;
      as the highest dilution giving a positive signal. Results obtained with DBS and serum&#xD;
      specimens will be compared in order to assess the feasibility of using DBS samples to monitor&#xD;
      exposure to bites of mosquitoes during epidemiological studies. Serum specimens collected&#xD;
      during visits 4 (baseline), 13 (early after the end of exposure) and 20 (post-exposure) will&#xD;
      also be analysed with immuno-proteomic approach (2D gel electrophoresis of salivary gland&#xD;
      protein extracts, Western blot and mass spectrometry) yielding additional information on the&#xD;
      antigenic properties of mosquito salivary gland proteome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Sample Size: 150 participants followed-up for 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Identification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants are defined as healthy participants aged between 18 and 60 years old and&#xD;
      willing to participate in the study. This study will take place at the Shoklo Malaria&#xD;
      Research Unit (SMRU) research centre in Mae Sot.&#xD;
