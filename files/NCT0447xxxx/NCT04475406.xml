      Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the total amounts of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α),&#xD;
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL),&#xD;
      receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) and the&#xD;
      abundance of putative oral pathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis,&#xD;
      Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus oralis in&#xD;
      extra short and standard dental implants functioning in the posterior mandible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The implants were divided into two groups according to their lengths: standard&#xD;
      (intrabony length ≥8 mm) and extra short (intrabony length ≤ 6 mm). A total of 60 implants&#xD;
      were researched in 30 patients. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), presence&#xD;
      of bleeding on probing (BOP), 3-year survival rate (CSR), and bone loss (BL) were measured.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental implants are usually considered an alternative treatment option to replace lost teeth&#xD;
      in edentulous patients. The rate of implant placement in regions more difficult to&#xD;
      rehabilitate has increased with the increase in the success of osseointegration and survival.&#xD;
      However, besides implant placement in sites with insufficient crest width and height,&#xD;
      treatment times and costs have also increased with the use of grafting procedures.1 Various&#xD;
      surgical techniques, such as vertical bone augmentation, sinus floor elevation, and nerve&#xD;
      transposition, have been developed for the treatment of these bone volume insufficiencies.&#xD;
      However, these methods are technically sensitive and can cause significant postoperative&#xD;
      complications. Short dental implants have been suggested as a simpler, cheaper, and faster&#xD;
      alternative to prevent the disadvantages of surgical techniques and for the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      toothless areas.2,3 A large number of randomized controlled clinical trials demonstrated that&#xD;
      the long-term success and survival rates of short implants were similar to those of standard&#xD;
      long implants.4-6 Accumulation of microbial dental plaque around the implant is the most&#xD;
      important cause of implant loss. If the microbial attachment is not removed, diseases such as&#xD;
      peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis may occur and result in implant loss in the long&#xD;
      term. Peri-implant mucositis is a reversible inflammatory reaction in the soft tissue&#xD;
      surrounding the implant in function. Peri-implantitis is a microbial inflammatory disease&#xD;
      characterized by the resorption of the supportive bone surrounding the implant in function.7&#xD;
      Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria predominate around the implant sites affected by the&#xD;
      disease. While they resemble chronic periodontal infections, they have a more complex&#xD;
      microbiological character.8 Predominant species around a peri-implantitis implant are red&#xD;
      complex (P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia) and orange complex bacteria (F.&#xD;
      nucleatum and P. intermedia) described by Socransky.9 In 1989, Apse et al. reported a fluid&#xD;
      around the peri-implant sulcus with properties similar to those of the gingival crevicular&#xD;
      fluid, and they called this fluid peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF).10 The PICF is an&#xD;
      inflammatory exudate formed by osmotic pressure. Biochemical mediators in the PICF are highly&#xD;
      important to determine the health of tissues around the implant.11 Prostaglandins, especially&#xD;
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), are considered as a potent mediator of alveolar bone destruction in&#xD;
      periodontitis. A large number of studies reported an increase in PGE2 levels from healthy&#xD;
      state to periodontitis.12 Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is a proinflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      regulating the Gram-negative bacterial response. The TNF-α concentration is an indicator of&#xD;
      bacterial load and degree of inflammation.13 In areas where peri-implantitis is active, the&#xD;
      presence and activity of osteoclasts are necessary for bone destruction to occur. The&#xD;
      formation and activation of osteoclasts are regulated through the activation of three members&#xD;
      of the TNF family: receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), receptor&#xD;
      activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK), and osteoprotegerin (OPG). Osteoclast&#xD;
      differentiation and activation occur with the binding of RANKL to RANK over the surface of&#xD;
      osteoclasts and precursors. OPG, which is a soluble protein of TNF receptors, antagonizes&#xD;
      RANK-RANKL interaction and increases bone formation by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. The&#xD;
      levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and PGE2, and RANKL/OPG&#xD;
      rates, which allow the determination of osteoclastic activity, change in the case of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis.14 The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of TNF-α, PGE2, RANKL,&#xD;
      RANK, and OPG in extra short and standard dental implants functioning in the posterior&#xD;
      mandible. An additional aim was to investigate the levels of putative oral pathogens F.&#xD;
      nucleatum, P. gingivalis, T. denticola, T. forsythia, P. intermedia, and S. oralis in&#xD;
      submucosal biofilm samples from the studied sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was carried out by recalling individuals whose bilateral&#xD;
      partial tooth losses were treated with implant-supported fixed restorations and whose&#xD;
      implants had been functioning for at least 3 years after prosthetic rehabilitation. The study&#xD;
      was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines from the World Medical Association&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki (version 2013) (Clinical Researches Ethical Board with the 28. 09.&#xD;
      2016 and 2016/009 decision numbered approval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 31 patients met the inclusion criteria. One patient did not continue the study.&#xD;
      Further, 60 implants were researched in 30 patients (16 female and 14 male). The bilateral&#xD;
      regions of patients with a standard implant and an extra short implant were grouped into&#xD;
      two.16 Control group: Standard implant, intra-bone length ≥8 mm (30 implants) Test group:&#xD;
      Extra Short implant, intra-bone length ≤6 mm (30 implants)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of clinical data A single calibrated examiner performed all (full-mouth and&#xD;
      site-specific) clinical measurements (B.K.), including probing depth (PD), clinical&#xD;
      attachment level (CAL), presence of bleeding on probing (BOP), 3-year survival rate (CSR),&#xD;
      and bone loss (BL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The values of PD and BOP were measured from four sites of each implant (mesial, distal,&#xD;
      buccal, and lingual) with a Williams type (Hue Friedy, Switzerland) plastic periodontal&#xD;
      probe. The PD was recorded as the distance from the base of the peri-implant to the side of&#xD;
      the gum in millimeters. BOP was evaluated according to the presence (+) or absence (-) of&#xD;
      bleeding within the first 30 s following the measurement of PD.17 Control panoramic films of&#xD;
      all patients were taken, and differences in the marginal bone level between radiography&#xD;
      images after implant placement and 3 years later were evaluated. Original films and images&#xD;
      taken later were taken with the same angle for standardizaton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of PICF and subgingival plaque samples After the plaques and soft attachments&#xD;
      around the implants were removed, the implants were isolated using cotton rolls and dried&#xD;
      with an air spray. The PICF was collected from the mesio-buccal region of the implant using&#xD;
      periopaper strips (Oraflow Inc, NY, USA). Paper strips were placed 1-2 mm inside the&#xD;
      peri-implant sulcus and kept for 30 s. Paper strips were placed in sterile Eppendorf tubes&#xD;
      containing 200 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The tubes were kept at -80°C until the&#xD;
      analysis day. Paper strips contaminated with saliva or blood were excluded from the sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting the PICF,. the supragingival plaque was carefully removed using a sterile&#xD;
      scaler. Implants were isolated using cotton rolls and dried with an air spray. Subgingival&#xD;
      plaque samples were collected from the mesio-buccal region of the implant using a sterile&#xD;
      plastic Gracey curette (Hu-Friedy, Switzerland) for 30 s. The samples collected were&#xD;
      transferred to sterile Eppendorf tubes containing 200 µL of PBS. The tubes were kept at -80°C&#xD;
      until the analysis day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PICF analysis Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used for measuring the&#xD;
      levels of TNF-α, PGE2, RANKL, RANK, and OPG in accordance with the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations (Elabscience Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China). The measuring ranges were&#xD;
      as follows: TNF-α, 7.81-500 pg/mL; PGE2, 31.25-2000 pg/mL; RANKL, 0.16-10 pg/mL; RANK,&#xD;
      0.16-10 pg/mL; and OPG, 0.16-10 pg/mL. Optical density was measured at 450 nm, and the&#xD;
      samples were compared with standards. Biochemical data were measured as the total amount&#xD;
      (pg/30 s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic DNA preparation An extraction kit was used in accordance with the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations to purify the DNA in the collected plaque samples (GF-1 bacterial DNA&#xD;
      extraction kit, Vivantis, Malaysia). Standards were used for total DNA in the target&#xD;
      bacteria. Genomic DNA was obtained and stored at 4°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction Primary probes were determined to define each bacterium&#xD;
      and observe the proliferation curves using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Table&#xD;
      1). For the DNA amplification reaction, procedures were performed with a real-time PCR system&#xD;
      (Roche Light Cycler 480 Instrument II, Switzerland) using a master mix (SYBR Green Master&#xD;
      Mix; Life Technologies, CA, USA). PCR cycles were as follows: 10 min at 95°C, 40 cycles at&#xD;
      95°C for 30 s and 2 min at 60°C. DNA contents were calculated using standard curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 19.0 (IBM Inc., IL, USA).&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to examine whether the variables were&#xD;
      normally distributed. The level of significance was used as 0.05 while commenting on the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While examining the differences between the groups, the independent-samples t test was used&#xD;
      when the variables were normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used when the variables were not normally&#xD;
      distributed. The chi-square analysis was used while examining the relationships between the&#xD;
      groups of nominal variables. The survival rate (CSR) was calculated according to the number&#xD;
      of short and standard implants placed.&#xD;
