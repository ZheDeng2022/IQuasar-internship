      The purpose of this Cohort Treatment Plan is to allow access to alpelisib for patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with mutated&#xD;
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase who progressed on or after AI treatment. The patient's Treating&#xD;
      Physician should follow the suggested treatment guidelines and comply with all local health&#xD;
      authority regulations.&#xD;

    <description>Alpelisib is provided as 50 mg and 200 mg film coated tablets as individual patient supply, packaged in bottles. Alpelisib will be dosed on a flat scale of mg/day and not be adjusted to body weight or body surface area. Alpelisib will be administered at a starting dose of 300 mg orally once daily on a continuous dosing schedule and can be adjusted for toxicity per the recommendations in this treatment plan.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Patient is an adult male or female (≥ 18 years of age) with advanced (locoregionally&#xD;
             recurrent not amenable to curative therapy or metastatic) hormone receptor-positive,&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patient has documented evidence of a mutation in the PIK3CA gene as determined in&#xD;
             tumor tissue or plasma by a local laboratory.&#xD;

             by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;

                  aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3× ULN. If the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST&#xD;
                  ≤ 5 × ULN (elevated AST or ALT values must be stable for 2 weeks, without&#xD;
                  evidence of biliary obstruction by imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total serum bilirubin &lt; 2 x ULN (any elevated bilirubin should be asymptomatic at&#xD;
                  enrollment) except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome who may only be included&#xD;
                  if the total bilirubin is ≤ 3.0 × ULN or direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN&#xD;

                  content, high fiber, balancing carbohydrate intake over the course of the day,&#xD;
                  three small meals and 2 small snacks rather than one large meal) and exercise. A&#xD;
                  consultation with a diabetologist is highly recommended&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fasting Serum amylase ≤ 2 × ULN&#xD;
