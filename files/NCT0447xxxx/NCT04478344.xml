      Low back pain (LBP) is a common complaint in the clinical setting. Among all the differential&#xD;
      diagnosis for LBP, superior cluneal nerve (SCN) entrapment is the commonly omitted one. The&#xD;
      superior cluneal nerve is the terminal branch of the lateral branches of the posterior rami&#xD;
      of the L1-L3 spinal nerves, which passes through the osseous tunnel interposed between the&#xD;
      thoracolumbar fascia and iliac crest. This nerve can be entrapped due to poor posture, trauma&#xD;
      or stretching of the surrounding thoracolumbar fascia and osseous membrane. The cardinal&#xD;
      symptom of the superior cluneal nerve entrapment is buttock pain. Sometimes the pain may&#xD;
      radiate to the lower limb, which mimics sciatica, and makes the diagnosis difficult. Early&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of SCN entrapment is crucial, which can facilitate the improvement of&#xD;
      health related quality of life and decrement the socioeconomic loss due to disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims is (1) to scan the SCN and thoracolumbar fascia by ultrasound in patients with&#xD;
      LBP and normal subjects. The transcutaneous electrical stimulation will be used to confirm&#xD;
      the location of SCN by asking the subject to depict the sensory distribution after&#xD;
      stimulation; (2) to analyze the related factors of LBP with SCN entrapment, which may help in&#xD;
      setting up the diagnostic criteria of SCN entrapment; (3) to analyze the therapeutic effect&#xD;
      of perineural injection to SCN in SCN entrapment, and to find the factors that related&#xD;
      responsiveness.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superior cluneal nerve (SCN) entrapment is the commonly omitted diagnosis in chronic low back&#xD;
      pain. The superior cluneal nerve is the terminal branch of the lateral branches of the&#xD;
      posterior rami of the L1-L3 spinal nerves, which passes through the osseous tunnel interposed&#xD;
      between the thoracolumbar fascia and iliac crest. This nerve can be entrapped due to poor&#xD;
      posture, trauma or stretching of the surrounding thoracolumbar fascia and osseous membrane.&#xD;
      The cardinal symptom of the superior cluneal nerve entrapment is buttock pain. Sometimes the&#xD;
      pain may radiate to the lower limb, which mimics sciatica, and makes the diagnosis difficult.&#xD;
      Early diagnosis and treatment of SCN entrapment is crucial, which can facilitate the&#xD;
      improvement of health related quality of life and decrement the socioeconomic loss due to&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Adult patients (&gt;20 year old) with low back/buttock pain &gt; 4weeks or recurrent&#xD;
      low back/buttock pain &gt;2 times per year. The pain consists area of iliac crest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control : healthy adult subjects (&gt;20 year old) without low back&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: non-mechanical low back pain, referred low back pain (tumor, infection,&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis, Scheuermann disease,Paget disease, herpetic neuralgia), trauma, acute&#xD;
      compression fracture, acute herniated disc, underwent nerve block within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) To scan the SCN and thoracolumbar fascia by high-resolution ultrasound in patients with&#xD;
      LBP and normal subjects. The transcutaneous electrical stimulation will be used to confirm&#xD;
      the location of SCN by asking the subject to depict the sensory distribution after&#xD;
      stimulation; (2) to analyze the related factors of LBP with SCN entrapment, which may help in&#xD;
      setting up the diagnostic criteria of SCN entrapment; (3) to analyze the therapeutic effect&#xD;
      of perineural injection to SCN in SCN entrapment, and to find the factors that related&#xD;
      responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detail of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High-resolution ultrasound evaluation of buttock region to recognize the superior&#xD;
           cluneal nerve in patients with SCN entrapment and healthy control. The transcutaneous&#xD;
           electrical stimulation will be assisted device for confirming the diagnosis by&#xD;
           subjective response of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collecting the LBP-related information, including physical examination results ((SLRT,&#xD;
           Extension in one-leg standing, Gaeslen's test, Yeoman's test, compression test,&#xD;
           distraction test, FABER test and ROM), lumbosacral and pelvic X-ray. Compare the related&#xD;
           information with sonography(gray-scale/elastography) results and electrophysiological&#xD;
           test results (Sensory nerve conduction study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention: single arm experiment design. Ultrasound guided perineural injection with&#xD;
           5% dextrose 4 c.c. + 1% xylocaine 1 c.c. to site where SCN being entrapment, to evaluate&#xD;
           the clinical efficacy of perineural injection to SCN entrapment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Modified version of the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire used in the AAOS lumbar&#xD;
           cluster&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Short-Form-36 (SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visual analogue scale at baseline 4 weeks and 12 weeks after injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sonography (gray-scale/elastography)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Electrophysiological test (Sensory nerve conduction study) at baseline, 4 weeks and 12&#xD;
           weeks after injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Student's t test: fit assumption of normal distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mann-Whitney test: does not fit the assumption of normal distribution Categorical&#xD;
           variables (1) Chi-square test (2) Fisher exact test: sparse data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Linear regression&#xD;
&#xD;
