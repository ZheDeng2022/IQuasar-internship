  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BAY1817080 is currently under clinical development to treat pain related to unexplained&#xD;
      chronic cough or chronic cough not affected by a treatment (refractory and/or unexplained&#xD;
      chronic cough, RUCC), or a condition where the bladder is unable to hold urine normally&#xD;
      (overactive bladder, OAB) or a condition in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally&#xD;
      lines the inside of the womb grows outside the womb (endometriosis). Especially in elderly&#xD;
      patients with OAB or RUCC, renal impairment is frequent. Renal impairment which co-occurs in&#xD;
      especially in elderly patients with OAB or RUCC is a common condition in which the kidneys&#xD;
      are not filtering the blood as well as they should. End stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring&#xD;
      hemodialysis is a condition in which patients kidneys are no longer able to work as they&#xD;
      should and require treatment to filter wastes from the blood. The goal of the study is to&#xD;
      learn more about the safety of BAY1817080, how it is tolerated and the way the body absorbs,&#xD;
      distributes and excretes the study drug given in men and women with moderate renal impairment&#xD;
      and with those who have end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis compared with&#xD;
      matched participants with normal kidney function.&#xD;
