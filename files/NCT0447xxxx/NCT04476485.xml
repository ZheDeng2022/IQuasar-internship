    <textblock>
      Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer accounts for about 70% of all breast cancers.&#xD;
      Extended endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitor is the current main treatment for hormone&#xD;
      receptor-positive breast cancer. However, previous studies have shown a long-lasting risk of&#xD;
      the recurrence of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer at early stage, and disease&#xD;
      recurrence is considered inevitable only depending on a 5-year of adjuvant endocrine therapy.&#xD;
      Therefore, extended endocrine therapy is considered as a possible measure to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous clinical studies have focused on extended endocrine therapy in patients with&#xD;
      specific types of breast cancer. In 2017, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)&#xD;
      updated the recommends for extended endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitor, where&#xD;
      postmenopausal early-stage breast cancer patients wo have high risk factors may be considered&#xD;
      to be given an extended 5-year endocrine treatment with aromatase inhibitor after the initial&#xD;
      5-year treatment. In 2019, the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology also suggested that&#xD;
      postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive patients who have been well tolerated to the initial&#xD;
      5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy can be given the extended endocrine therapy under some&#xD;
      restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, extended endocrine therapy may also cause other risks in patients. Long-term&#xD;
      tamoxifen treatment can significantly increase the incidence of adverse reactions such as&#xD;
      endometrial cancer, thrombotic disease, and dyslipidemia, and long-term aromatase inhibitor&#xD;
      treatment can also increase the incidence of osteoporosis, fractures, dyslipidemia, and&#xD;
      hypertension. Although anti-cancer treatment can reduce cancer deaths, it may increase deaths&#xD;
      due to cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An attempt has been proposed to find out an indicator that can effectively determine the&#xD;
      necessity of extended endocrine therapy in such patients, not only improving the prognosis of&#xD;
      breast cancer patients, but also reducing treatment-related side effects. The author's team&#xD;
      recently discovered sj-subway, a possible factor with a long tubular structure in breast&#xD;
      cancer lesions. The authors found that the higher expression of sj-subway indicates the worse&#xD;
      patient's prognosis. So the positive expression of sj-subway may be a predictor of recurrence&#xD;
      and metastasis in high-risk hormone receptor-positive patients. However, whether this&#xD;
      predictor can be used clinically remains to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This real-world study intends to analyze the difference in the clinical efficacy of extended&#xD;
      endocrine therapy under different sj-subway expression in high-risk hormone receptor-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer patients, and to explore whether sj-subway can screen out the patients who can&#xD;
      benefit from extended endocrine therapy, thus providing a therapeutic help for hormone&#xD;
      receptor-positive breast cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer has been one of the most common malignant tumors in women, accounting for 23%&#xD;
      of all the malignancies. There are estimated 1,300,000 new cases of breast cancers and&#xD;
      400,000 deaths due to breast cancers every year in the world. Hormone receptor-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer accounts for about 70% of all breast cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since ovarian resection was first used in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in the late&#xD;
      19th century, with more than a century of development, endocrine therapy has become the most&#xD;
      important adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancers, especially for&#xD;
      advanced breast cancers. Increasing clinical trials of adjuvant endocrine therapy such as&#xD;
      ATAC, BIG1-98, and IES, which have been implemented since 2002, have ascertained the effect&#xD;
      of adjuvant endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitor, and the guidelines for the diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of breast cancer have been also changed accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients have a better prognosis&#xD;
      than HER-2 positive and triple-negative patients, there is still a long-lasting risk of&#xD;
      postoperative recurrence, which has been confirmed in two large-scale meta-analyses reported&#xD;
      by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). A meta-analysis released&#xD;
      by the EBCTCG in 1998 indicated that early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer&#xD;
      patients, especially lymph node-positive patients, experienced the second recurrence peak at&#xD;
      2-3 years and 7-9 years after completion of endocrine therapy. In 2016, the EBCTCG released&#xD;
      another relevant study at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology&#xD;
      (ASCO), in which the long-term recurrence rate within 5-20 years was up to 14% in T1N0 breast&#xD;
      cancer patients who had undergone 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Therefore, the 5&#xD;
      years of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy cannot eliminate the risk of recurrence. Most&#xD;
      scholars have suggested that the duration of endocrine therapy should be extended to reduce&#xD;
      the recurrence risk of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous clinical trials have focused on the use of extended endocrine therapy in patients&#xD;
      with specific types of breast cancer. In the MA17R trial, patients received 3-5 years of&#xD;
      tamoxifen or 5 years of aromatase inhibitor treatment, followed by another 5 years of&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor treatment. The extended aromatase inhibitor treatment was found to&#xD;
      significantly improve the disease-free survival time of hormone receptor-positive early&#xD;
      breast cancer patients, while also reducing the risk of contralateral breast cancer and&#xD;
      distant relapse. In the NSABP B42 trial, patients who had received initial 5 years of&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor treatment or initial 5 years of tamoxifen + aromatase inhibitor treatment&#xD;
      were all treated with extended aromatase inhibitor. Although the primary endpoint (P = 0.048)&#xD;
      did not reach the expected value, extended treatment with aromatase inhibitors significantly&#xD;
      reduced the secondary endpoints - breast cancer-free interval and distant relapse, confirming&#xD;
      the conclusion of the MA17R study. In the DATA trial, although extended treatment with&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor did not benefit in general, subgroup analysis showed that some high-risk&#xD;
      patients, such as patients with positive lymph nodes, tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter, or&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy, could benefit from 6 years of anastrozole treatment. The IDEAL trial&#xD;
      showed that there is a trend of benefit in patients with positive lymph nodes. With the&#xD;
      support of many large-scale clinical studies published in succession, the NCCN practice&#xD;
      guidelines for breast cancer released in 2017 recommends an additional 5 years of aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor treatment following the initial 5-year treatment in postmenopausal patients with&#xD;
      early-stage breast cancer at high risk for relapse. As per the Chinese Society of Clinical&#xD;
      Oncology guidelines published in 2019, the extended endocrine therapy is also recommended for&#xD;
      postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive patients who have been well tolerated to the initial&#xD;
      5-year adjuvant treatment. However, there are some restrictions, such as positive lymph&#xD;
      nodes, G3 or other risk factors that require adjuvant chemotherapy. For premenopausal hormone&#xD;
      receptor-positive patients who have been well tolerated to the initial 5 years of endocrine&#xD;
      treatment, extended endocrine therapy is also recommended in some situations, such as the&#xD;
      presence of positive lymph nodes, G3, less than 35 years old at diagnosis, high-level Ki-67&#xD;
      or pT2 and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the extended endocrine therapy also has some adverse events. Multiple studies have&#xD;
      shown that long-term use of tamoxifen can significantly increase the incidence of adverse&#xD;
      reactions such as endometrial cancer, thrombotic disease, and dyslipidemia. Similarly,&#xD;
      long-term treatment with aromatase inhibitors can also increase the incidence of adverse&#xD;
      reactions such as osteoporosis, fractures, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. In the ATLAS&#xD;
      trial, the incidence of endometrial cancer in patients treated with 10 years of tamoxifen was&#xD;
      higher than that in patients treated with 5 years of tamoxifen. Similar results are&#xD;
      discovered in the aTTom trial. In the IDEAL trial, the incidence rates of osteoarthritis and&#xD;
      osteoporosis in patients treated with 5 years of letrozole was increased by 14% and 10% of&#xD;
      that in patients undergoing 2.5 years of treatment. A study involving nearly 100,000 breast&#xD;
      cancer patients showed that only 49.9% of breast cancer patients died of breast cancer, 16.3%&#xD;
      died of cardiovascular disease, and 33.8% died of other causes. Among them, breast cancer and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease were the main causes of death in well- and poor-tolerated patients,&#xD;
      respectively. This suggests that although anti-cancer treatment can reduce cancer deaths, it&#xD;
      may increase the death due to cardiovascular disease. Such deaths are often offset, which&#xD;
      often improves the BCFI, but does not benefit the overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, an effective predictor for relapse risks that can accurately determine the&#xD;
      necessity of extended endocrine therapy is expected to be discovered. The use of this&#xD;
      predictor will both improve patient's prognosis and reduce treatment-related side effects.&#xD;
      The author's team recently discovered a possible factor with a long tubular structure in&#xD;
      breast cancer lesions using immunofluorescence staining, which was named as sj-subway. The&#xD;
      authors conducted a retrospective analysis based on the specimen library and case follow-up&#xD;
      library of the Breast Center of Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University.&#xD;
      They found that sj-subway was positively expressed in various subtypes of breast cancer&#xD;
      tissues, and mostly expressed in the hormone receptor-positive subtype. The group with more&#xD;
      sj-subway expression had a higher positive expression of hormone receptor/ progesterone&#xD;
      receptor. Further survival analysis also revealed the worse prognosis of patients with the&#xD;
      existence of higher sj-subway expression. Therefore, the authors speculate that positively&#xD;
      expressed sj-subway may become a predictor of recurrence and metastasis in high-risk patients&#xD;
      with hormone receptor positive. However, the clinical use of this factor to screen the&#xD;
      population benefiting from extended endocrine therapy remains to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This real-world study intends to observe the difference in the clinical efficacy of extended&#xD;
      endocrine therapy under different sj-subway expression in high-risk hormone receptor-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer patients, and to analyze whether the use of sj-subway can further screen out&#xD;
      the population with benefit from extended endocrine therapy, thus further improving the&#xD;
      survival of such patients without additional adverse events.&#xD;
