  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, single-dose, double-blinded, 4-period, crossover study to&#xD;
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of mitapivat in healthy adult&#xD;
      participants under fasted and fed (high-fat meal) conditions. Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of mitapivat on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, including&#xD;
      concentration-QT interval corrected for heart rate (C-QTc) analysis under fasted conditions.&#xD;
      The study will include a 28-day screening period, four 7-day treatment periods. Participants&#xD;
      will receive a follow-up telephone call within 28 (±1) days after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
