  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if performing radiotherapy (SRS) prior to surgery&#xD;
      results in better treatment outcomes than performing surgery before radiotherapy for patients&#xD;
      with brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain metastases occur when cancer cells from a primary cancer (e.g. lung, breast, colon)&#xD;
      travel through the bloodstream and spread (metastasize) to the brain. As these new tumors&#xD;
      grow they apply pressure and change how healthy brain tissue works. This can lead to a loss&#xD;
      of brain function and worsening quality of life. Treatments for patients whose cancer has&#xD;
      spread to the brain is often surgery, radiation therapy (radiotherapy) or a combination of&#xD;
      both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is one the main treatments for brain tumors. To remove the tumor, a neurosurgeon&#xD;
      makes an opening in the skull and attempts to the remove the entire tumor. If the tumor is&#xD;
      too close to important brain tissue, the surgeon may attempt to remove part of the tumor.&#xD;
      Removal of the tumor from the brain tissue is called resection. The complete or partial&#xD;
      removal of tumor helps to relieve symptoms by reducing pressure on healthy tissues and&#xD;
      reduces the amount of tumor that needs to be treated by radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One type of radiotherapy used to treat brain metastases is stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).&#xD;
      SRS uses many focused radiation beams to treat tumors within the brain. Unlike surgery, there&#xD;
      is no incision or cut being made. Instead, SRS uses an accurate map of your brain to deliver&#xD;
      a precise beam of radiation to the tumors. The radiation damages the tumor cells forcing them&#xD;
      to shrink and die off. The focused radiation beams also limit damage to healthy brain tissue&#xD;
      minimizing side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery followed by radiotherapy is a standard treatment for brain metastases. However, there&#xD;
      are still risks associated with the combination of treatments. This study plans to&#xD;
      investigate whether performing surgery prior to SRS results in improved quality of life and&#xD;
      decreased side effects.&#xD;
