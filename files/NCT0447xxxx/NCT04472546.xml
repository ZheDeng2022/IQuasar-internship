  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physiological states of the skin are characterized by a certain homeostasis linked to the&#xD;
      balance of the metabolic pathways. When these pathways are deregulated, the proteic, lipidic&#xD;
      and metabolic is affected. It is thus possible to follow a change in the state of the skin by&#xD;
      looking at change in the associated molecular profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PRISM laboratory (INSERM U1192) in Lille has developed an innovative system laser called&#xD;
      SpiderMass composed of 4 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A laser used for the micro-sampling of material in vivo,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A transport transfer line of the ablated particles,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A mass spectrometer that analyzes them in real time and generates the molecular profiles&#xD;
           of the epidermis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A data analysis procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SpiderMass(TM) is of great interest for the study of the skin because it allows&#xD;
      non-invasive vivo characterization, and therefore without biopsy or sample preparation. In&#xD;
      addition, it will complement techniques already used in the research center such as FTIR&#xD;
      spectroscopy. Indeed, in acne studies the FTIR allows to obtain only the Fatty Acid&#xD;
      Triglycerid ratio while the SpiderMass permits to detail these lipid classes by each observed&#xD;
      molecule on the surface of the skin and follow their evolution.&#xD;
