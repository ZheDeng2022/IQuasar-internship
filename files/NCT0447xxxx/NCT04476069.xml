      Abstract Introduction: Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
      before tooth extraction may reduce post-surgical pain, but there is a lack of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To compare pain and anxiety in pediatric tooth extraction patients receiving a&#xD;
      preoperative NSAID vs. placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting: Princess Nourah&#xD;
      Bint Abdulrahman University's (PNU's) dental clinic in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Eligible pediatric tooth extraction patients were randomized to Group&#xD;
      A, which received NSAID preoperatively, or Group B, which received placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: A research coordinator (RC) measured participants prior to extraction, and 3-&#xD;
      and 24-hours post-extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Methods: The Wong-Baker FACES scale (WBFS) and the Modified Child Dental Anxiety&#xD;
      Scale - Faces (MCDASf).&#xD;

      Aims The aim of this study was to compare the post-operative pain and anxiety experience of&#xD;
      pediatric tooth extraction patients who receive a preoperative NSAID with those who receive a&#xD;
      placebo in order to evaluate the impact of preoperative NSAID administration on post-surgical&#xD;
      pain and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting This&#xD;
      study was conducted at Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University's (PNU's) dental clinic in&#xD;
      Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Participants Pediatric patients were referred to the study by&#xD;
      clinicians at the PNU clinic. Inclusion criteria included: child must have been age five&#xD;
      through 13; child must be undergoing a simple extraction under local anesthesia of one or&#xD;
      more symptomatic primary molars including teeth with pathology such as abscess, cyst, and&#xD;
      internal resorption; parent must provide consent and the child provide assent; child must not&#xD;
      have any systematic disease, child must not be taking any medication that interacts with&#xD;
      ibuprofen (the NSAID used in this study), and child must be cooperative. Children were&#xD;
      excluded for known allergy or having ever had an allergic reaction to ibuprofen; taking&#xD;
      antibiotics or other medications; having special needs due to a physical or mental&#xD;
      disability; having been given an analgesic prior to appointment by guardian; or being treated&#xD;
      for an emergency medical condition (e.g., cellulitis). This study was reviewed and approved&#xD;
      by the PNU Research Ethics Board (REB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records of potential participants were reviewed prior to inviting them into study&#xD;
      participation so that they were already screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      they were known to qualify. This was a clinical study, and recruitment was limited to&#xD;
      participants who qualified, although a total sample size of 60 was thought to be possible and&#xD;
      so was targeted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, Blinding, and Baseline Data Collection To facilitate double-blinding, a&#xD;
      professional research coordinator (RC) was hired to develop blinded materials. A list of&#xD;
      identification numbers was created and each number was randomly assigned to either Group A&#xD;
      (receive ibuprofen prior to extraction) or Group B (receive placebo prior to extraction, as a&#xD;
      control). Only the RC knew the assignment of the numbers to groups. Blinded medications were&#xD;
      developed and labeled according to the identification (ID) numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants underwent consent, they were assigned an ID number which placed them in a&#xD;
      randomized group. The clinician used the medication associated with the participant's ID&#xD;
      number prior to extraction. At this point, baseline data was gathered, which included the&#xD;
      following variables: patient gender, patient age, anesthesia technique used (infiltration for&#xD;
      upper mouth extractions, and nerve block for lower mouth extractions), number of teeth being&#xD;
      extracted, baseline self-reported pain measurement, and baseline self-reported anxiety&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Administration of Study Drug Once placed in a randomization group, the study&#xD;
      drug was administered. Those randomized to Group A (active) received the NSAID in the study,&#xD;
      which was oral commercially-available NurfenÂ® syrup containing the NSAID ibuprofen. Between&#xD;
      7.5 to 15 ml/kg was administered, depending on the child's age. Those randomized to Group B&#xD;
      (control) were given a colored, flavored solution as a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tooth Extraction After administration of the study drug and baseline data collection, the&#xD;
      treating clinicians (n=6) followed a standard protocol for the study. Clinicians had 1 to 5&#xD;
      years of experience. No formal calibration was done, and behavioral management techniques&#xD;
      were included in the standard protocol. They reviewed the participant's medical and dental&#xD;
      histories and noted any allergies. After a thorough clinical and radiographic examination,&#xD;
      they applied topical anesthesia, then administered local anesthesia with dosage appropriate&#xD;
      to the patient's age and weight (Lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:100,000). After local&#xD;
      anesthesia, the efficacy of the anesthesia was tested subjectively and objectively, then&#xD;
      pediatric forceps were used for the extraction(s). This was followed by the application of a&#xD;
      gauze pressure pack, and verbal and written post-extraction instructions were provided to the&#xD;
      child and parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Methods Data Collection Two instruments were used for outcome measurement: the&#xD;
      Wong-Baker FACES scale (WBFS) for pain perception, and the Modified Child Dental Anxiety&#xD;
      Scale - Faces (MCDASf) for anxiety. Both the WBFS and MCDASf were administered at baseline&#xD;
      (immediately after consent), and at 3- and 24-hours post-extraction. It was estimated that&#xD;
      3-hours post-extraction, local analgesic would have worn off and pain would typically be at&#xD;
      its peak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline measurements were done in person by the RC, and both the 3- and 24-hour&#xD;
      follow-up measurements were conducted by the RC by phone. As both WBFS and MCDASf are visual&#xD;
      scales, forms were provided to the parent at the appointment which were then completed with&#xD;
      the child during the follow-up calls and sent to the RC in the mail. During the follow-up&#xD;
      phone calls, the researcher would talk on the phone to the parent, and coach them to ask the&#xD;
      child the questions and have the child answer them by pointing to the visual scale. The&#xD;
      parent would the relay the child's answer to the researcher for the record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Intended for pediatrics patients, the WBFS has patients assign a score of 0, 2,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, and 10 to indicate their level of perceived pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MCDASf scale was developed and validated to measure dental-related anxiety in children&#xD;
      about eight different topics; only &quot;How do you feel about having a tooth taken out?&quot; was&#xD;
      asked in this study. Respondents assign a score between 1 and 5 corresponding to their level&#xD;
      of anxiety about the topic .&#xD;
