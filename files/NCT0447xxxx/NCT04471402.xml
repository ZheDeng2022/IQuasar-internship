  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intranasal Dexmedetomidine is one of the sedative drugs of choice commonly used as an&#xD;
      anxiolytic premedication for children for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. However, some&#xD;
      children do not achieve the level of sedation expected with the usual dose after an expected&#xD;
      timeframe, leading to distress and costly time wasted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we would try to identify a genetic basis to non-responders of Dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      by comparing a chosen gene panel of 250 relevant genes between responders and non-responders&#xD;
      to a standardized 3mcg/kg intranasal Dexmedetomidine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For most children, having to endure a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure in a hospital&#xD;
      environment is a frightening and distressing experience, especially if it is accompanied by&#xD;
      pain or discomfort. In an attempt to minimise the trauma and to maximise co-operation from&#xD;
      the child, administration of a sedative is often requested by either the parent or the&#xD;
      proceduralist. Some sedative agents may have the side effect reducing the child's efforts in&#xD;
      breathing, causing inadequate oxygen to be delivered to and carbon dioxide removed from the&#xD;
      body, a state that can be life threatening if left untreated. Other sedative agents may cause&#xD;
      unpleasant sensations such as hallucinations or nausea while still others may have a&#xD;
      paradoxical effect of exciting rather than sedating the child. Among the available agents&#xD;
      that may be administered without the presence of an attendant anaesthesiologist,&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine is an agent of choice with minimal incidence of the aforementioned effects.&#xD;
      However, we have observed in a small proportion of children that dexmedetomidine does not see&#xD;
      to be able to elicit a sedative response in the expected time and with the usual dose. It is&#xD;
      possible that there is a genetic bas to this resistance and it would be of great use to be&#xD;
      able to predict the non-responders ahead of time so an appropriate alternative may be&#xD;
      selected without a trial and error approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, children who would require Precedex as first-line sedation for radiological&#xD;
      or pre-anaesthesia sedation are asked to participate by providing a buccal swab sample and&#xD;
      have their genome (genetic makeup) characterised by target sequencing. They are standardized&#xD;
      into receiving 3mcg/kg intranasal Precedex and are observed every 5 minutes afterwards for&#xD;
      their level of sedation. They would be identified as 'fast responder', 'normal responder',&#xD;
      'slow responder' and 'definite non-responder'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A gene panel of 250 relevant genes is chosen and compared between the different groups of&#xD;
      responders and non-responders. We will then try to look for the differences between these&#xD;
      groups and we will use this information to build a predictive model. This model will help to&#xD;
      identify non-responders in the future and this would allow clinicians to prepare for an&#xD;
      alternative approach to sedation. This would save time, distress to the child and parent and&#xD;
      ultimately cost to the institution.&#xD;
