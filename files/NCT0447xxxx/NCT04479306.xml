      This phase Ib trial studies the best dose, safety, and effect of alisertib or sapanisertib,&#xD;
      in combination with osimertinib, in treating patients with EGFR mutated stage IIIB or IV&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer that does not respond to osimertinib treatment (osimertinib&#xD;
      resistant). Osimertinib, alisertib, and sapanisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. This study has two parts. The goal of&#xD;
      part 1 of this trial is to find the highest tolerable dose of alisertib or sapanisertib in&#xD;
      combination with osimertinib that can be safely given to patients with EGFR mutated non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. The goal of part 2 of this trial is to learn if the dose of alisertib or&#xD;
      sapanisertib found in part 1 can help control EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer when&#xD;
      given in combination with osimertinib.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of osimertinib plus alisertib&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of osimertinib plus&#xD;
      sapanisertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) to the study combinations&#xD;
      (osimertinib+alisertib and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the progression free survival of the study combinations (osimertinib+alisertib&#xD;
      and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the disease control rate (DCR) of the study combinations&#xD;
      (osimertinib+alisertib and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore biomarkers associated with response/resistance of the study combinations&#xD;
      (osimertinib+aliertib and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib or sapanisertib in combination with&#xD;
      osimertinib, followed by a dose expansion study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and alisertib PO&#xD;
      QD on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop progressive disease may crossover to Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive osimertinib PO QD on days 1-28 and sapanisertib PO QD on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients who develop progressive disease may crossover to Arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
