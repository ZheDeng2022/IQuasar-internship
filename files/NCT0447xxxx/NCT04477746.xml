    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal injuries amongst surgeons are prevalent. This project will determine whether&#xD;
      Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic surgery (RALS) offers superior benefits to surgeon's&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health than standard laparoscopic surgery (LS), by identifying the&#xD;
      comparative changes in muscle fatigue during RALS Vs LS surgical procedures, and additionally&#xD;
      identify any cognitive effects of this. The Study if successful, could help reduce injury&#xD;
      rates in surgeons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of surgical procedures being performed using minimal access techniques is on the&#xD;
      rise because of improved recovery times for patients. Thus, surgeons are performing an&#xD;
      increasing number of endoscopic/laparoscopic procedures and are operating for longer periods.&#xD;
      A recent meta-analysis showed that work-related musculoskeletal injuries amongst surgeons are&#xD;
      common (1) and surgeons are amongst those most at risk of work-related musculoskeletal&#xD;
      decline (2). Indeed, the prevalence of degenerative spinal disease is 17%, rotator cuff&#xD;
      pathology 18%, and degenerative lumbar spine disease is 19% (1). Surgeon's experience&#xD;
      work-related musculoskeletal pain in addition to injury, and pain is highly prevalent in the&#xD;
      neck (48%), shoulder (43%), and back (50%) (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Office for National Statistics in the UK, musculoskeletal problems amongst&#xD;
      the workforce are the second most common cause for absence (17.7%) and account for 23 days&#xD;
      absence/year (2). This is not dissimilar in the US where the Bureau of Labour Statistics&#xD;
      estimates that 62% of all worker injuries and 32% of missed days from work result from&#xD;
      musculoskeletal problems. Collectively, these data suggest that musculoskeletal problems&#xD;
      caused by careers in surgery can reduce physical health, which is associated with reduced&#xD;
      productivity, career longevity, and even the quality of patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) is a modern technology that could help mitigate&#xD;
      these musculoskeletal problems and thereby improve patient care. In comparison to standard&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery (LS), RALS offers steadier wrist movements with a reduced fulcrum&#xD;
      effect, thus benefiting the patient (3). There is emerging evidence that RALS is associated&#xD;
      with a lower rate of musculoskeletal problems (23-80%) than LS (70- 100%) (1). RALS may&#xD;
      therefore be an attractive alternative to LS, despite the high cost of equipment and steep&#xD;
      learning curve during training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has compared the demands of RALS vs. LS on musculoskeletal fatigue (and subsequent&#xD;
      injury risk) and whether these changes are underpinned by changes in cognitive fatigue. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to determine whether a career using RALS is associated with better&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health for surgeons than standard LS when performing complex minimally&#xD;
      invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that RALS will reduce musculoskeletal fatigue and the prevalence of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injury in surgeons compared to LS. If this is true, RALS should receive&#xD;
      increased support through preserving surgeon's health and thereby reducing costs for&#xD;
      healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research subjects (surgeons and patients) Surgeons: Investigators will recruit surgeons&#xD;
      completing surgical procedures who have similar levels of experience between RALS and LS&#xD;
      groups. Surgeons will fill a questionnaire regarding working hours and experience, physical&#xD;
      activity level (e.g., sport, bicycling to work or gardening), general health conditions and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal symptoms within the last 12 months using the Standardized Nordic&#xD;
      questionnaires for the analysis of musculoskeletal symptoms (11). The investigators will also&#xD;
      quantify body composition (height, body weight, BMI, muscle mass, fat mass) using&#xD;
      clinically-validated bioelectrical impedance analysis. Surgeons will broadly be matched for&#xD;
      age and surgical experience, anthropometry, and sex. Patients: To complete the work, the&#xD;
      investigators will use data from n = 40 patients being operated upon in RALS and n = 40 LS&#xD;
      groups that will be age, sex, BMI, and pre-operative risk score matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure and overall study design Data will be collected during index procedures:&#xD;
      For example prostatectomy or anterior resection using either RALS or LS. Before surgery,&#xD;
      surgeons are fitted with both EMG (to measure muscle fatigue) and EEG (to measure cognitive&#xD;
      fatigue). Surgeons will complete a series of validated questionnaires before and after each&#xD;
      surgery to subjectively determine musculoskeletal strain/pain and cognitive fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being conducted in real-life surgery and controlling conditions between&#xD;
      operations is uniquely challenging. The study will exclude any operations where complications&#xD;
      result in the surgery taking beyond 50% of the mean average surgery time, to prevent this&#xD;
      skewing the data towards an effect for musculoskeletal fatigue. This mean average time will&#xD;
      also include for specific procedures e.g. Prostatectomy - defining resection margins by&#xD;
      dissecting the endopelvic fascia and mobilising seminal vesicles, rectum and bladder neck,&#xD;
      defining and transecting the prostatic pedicles; transecting the bladder neck, urethra, and&#xD;
      prostate; anastomosing the urethra to bladder neck. Bowel surgery - identifying, transecting&#xD;
      and ligating the pedicle; lateral mobilisation and preserving ureters, and bowel anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess acute fatigue by comparing RALS and LS within a single surgery&#xD;
      that is the first surgery of any given day. To determine the cumulative fatigue (chronic&#xD;
      effects of surgery, aim 2), comparison will be made between the subject's first and last&#xD;
      surgery of the day when &gt;2 surgeries have been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of musculoskeletal fatigue (EMG) EMG justification. The study will utilise&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG) to determine acute and chronic changes in musculoskeletal demands&#xD;
      associated with RALS and LS surgery. Surface EMG is a non-invasive procedure that measures&#xD;
      muscle activity by recording the electrical signal generated during muscle fibre recruitment.&#xD;
      Its ability to assess fatigue has been long established (e.g. (4)) and it has been widely&#xD;
      used in many populations, including athletes (e.g. (5)), dentists (6) and surgeons (e.g.&#xD;
      (7,8)) EMG will be collected for 200 s (9) at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes of a ~2-hour&#xD;
      surgical procedure. In addition to these time points, EMG data will be collected during&#xD;
      clinically important tasks (e.g. suturing upon completion of surgery, which typically will&#xD;
      take 10 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG protocol. Surgeons will provide written informed consent prior to participation. Surgeons&#xD;
      will be completing index procedures: For example prostatectomy or anterior resection using&#xD;
      either RALS or LS; the protocol for EMG data collection will be identical. Before surgery,&#xD;
      surgeons will be fitted with wireless EMG sensors. The EMG data collection procedures will&#xD;
      follow established protocols regarding site preparation and electrode placement, as well as&#xD;
      data collection, processing and normalisation (7,12). Briefly, the site will be shaved and&#xD;
      cleansed with alcohol wipes, with the bipolar electrodes placed on the belly of the muscle&#xD;
      and parallel to the muscle's fibres having an inter-electrode distance of 20mm (12).&#xD;
      Electrodes will be placed on muscles of the arm, neck, shoulder and back e.g. flexor carpi&#xD;
      radialis muscles, biceps muscle, bilaterally from the trapezius muscles, and bilaterally from&#xD;
      the erector spinae muscle. These muscles have been selected based on a recent meta-analysis&#xD;
      (13). Electrodes are fitted before surgeons' scrub for surgery and electrodes will be covered&#xD;
      by surgical gowns thereby maintaining a sterile theatre. A wireless EMG system has been&#xD;
      selected so that it is minimally invasive and does not impede a surgeon's movement with&#xD;
      wires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG data analysis. Data will be collected and analysed using EMG Works (Delsys Inc., Boston,&#xD;
      MA, USA), with recommended normalisation, sampling, filtering and smoothing techniques (7).&#xD;
      EMG recordings in previous data show significant changes during LS procedures in 70 - 85% of&#xD;
      surgeons, mainly in neck, shoulders, hands, lower back, and lower extremities muscles. The&#xD;
      recordings from muscles of the arm, neck, shoulder and back will be monitored but lower limb&#xD;
      muscles will not be included because during RALS, Surgeons are seated away from the patient&#xD;
      and having brow- and armrests considerably modifies the workload on the lower limbs making&#xD;
      comparisons of lower-limb muscles in LS not meaningful. Once the EMG signal has been&#xD;
      normalised (10), basic EMG variables, such as frequency and amplitude, can provide&#xD;
      information on how muscle fibre recruitment has changed, both at a single muscle as well&#xD;
      across several muscles (activation / recruitment strategies), while a fatigue score can also&#xD;
      be calculated (11). The normalisation process can afford the ability to compare between&#xD;
      muscles as well as examine the muscles' activity different time points (i.e. within the same&#xD;
      session or after a longer time has elapsed; e.g. (5,12,13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of cognitive fatigue (EEG) EEG justification. The study will use&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) to determine if acute or chronic changes in musculoskeletal&#xD;
      demands are associated with changes in motor control and cognitive fatigue. Cognitive fatigue&#xD;
      can be determined via neurophysiological measures, such as the electroencephalogram. The EEG&#xD;
      can measure the ongoing electrical activity of the brain during a given task, such as whilst&#xD;
      driving or during surgery. EEG measures of fatigue can provide an objective quantification of&#xD;
      an individual's cognitive state in real-time, removing reliance on subjective measures such&#xD;
      as self-report or questionnaires that have been found to be unreliable for moderate fatigue&#xD;
      states. The brain oscillates at a number of different frequencies at any given time, and this&#xD;
      information is recorded in the EEG. The power of certain frequency bands has been taken as a&#xD;
      proxy to index cognitive fatigue. Specifically, evidence indicates that alpha-band power&#xD;
      (7-13 Hz) is sensitive to fatigue (for a review see (14)), and has been used to measure&#xD;
      driver fatigue both in real-traffic and simulation exercises (15- 18). When fatigue&#xD;
      increases, alpha-band activity occurs in bursts of 500 milliseconds, which are known as alpha&#xD;
      spindles (19). Alpha spindles are considered to reflect individual fatigue states and can be&#xD;
      quantified in terms of their peak frequency, duration, and amplitude, giving rise to an&#xD;
      individual's alpha signature (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG protocol. Whilst surgeons are having EMG electrodes fitted, a similar procedure will be&#xD;
      completed for the wireless EEG electrodes. The skin site on the head will be prepared as&#xD;
      previously described (21) and the electrode gel and electrode cap will be applied before the&#xD;
      surgical cap, thereby maintaining the sterility of the surgical theatre. Electrodes will be&#xD;
      placed over the cortex using an 8-channel electrode montage to record ongoing EEG&#xD;
      oscillations during surgery for 200 s (9) at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes of a ~2-hour&#xD;
      surgical procedure. Electrodes will be positioned according to the 10-20 international&#xD;
      electrode placement system. The main EEG channels of interest will be positioned over the&#xD;
      occipital and parietal cortex, namely electrode locations O1, O2, P3, P4, P7, P8 where&#xD;
      maximal alpha activity can be detected. In addition to these time points, EEG data will be&#xD;
      collected during clinically important tasks (e.g. suturing upon completion of surgery, which&#xD;
      typically will take 10 minutes). A wireless EEG system has been selected so that it is&#xD;
      minimally invasive and does not cause distraction or restriction due to movement of wires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG data analysis. Data will be collected and analysed using Enobio 8 5G (Neuroelectrics,&#xD;
      Cambridge, MA, USA) using standard referencing, sampling, filtering and smoothing techniques&#xD;
      (21). Investigators will compare peak alpha power, and alpha spindle duration and amplitude,&#xD;
      in RALS compared to LS. Changes in EEG power spectra, specifically in the alpha frequency&#xD;
      band, will be used to monitor alertness, and will provide crucial information about whether&#xD;
      cognitive fatigue, underpins any musculoskeletal fatigue. The study will also be able to&#xD;
      identify how alertness changes over time during surgery through the EEG power spectra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of surgeon physical activity and musculoskeletal health It is vital that&#xD;
      musculoskeletal fatigue in the surgeons is not influenced by anything other than the work&#xD;
      environment. We will use tri-axial accelerometery every week throughout data collection to&#xD;
      measure and ensure surgeons are not changing their physical activity patterns (and thus&#xD;
      getting stronger or weaker). Nutrition is also critical in the development of strength, just&#xD;
      like poor nutrition can lead to strength loss. Therefore, surgeons will complete 3-day food&#xD;
      diaries and dietary analysis at weekly intervals throughout the data collection period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and data analysis. Power calculation: To address aim 1, The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate a difference in musculoskeletal fatigue of 20% between RALS and LS based upon the&#xD;
      limited evidence available (1). Therefore, based on a predicted effect size (Cohen's d) of&#xD;
      0.82, recruitment of 40 subjects in RALS and 40 subjects in LS (total sample size n = 80)&#xD;
      will be carried out. These numbers will be matched between prostate and bowel surgeries. In&#xD;
      aim 2, data suggest that the level of fatigue between the last surgery of the day versus the&#xD;
      first will be greater than the difference in aim 1 (Cohen's d 0.90), therefore 27&#xD;
      subjects/group are required for this research question. Lastly in aim 3 to investigate&#xD;
      whether changes in musculoskeletal fatigue are underpinned by changes in motor control and&#xD;
      cognitive fatigue, The investigators anticipate an effect size of 0.85 between RALS and LS&#xD;
      and therefore will use data from the 31/group to study this effect. An A priori power&#xD;
      calculation will be used to compute the required sample size using G*Power 3 (22).&#xD;
      Conservatively, the lower of the three values for the power calculation (an effect size of&#xD;
      0.82) has been chosen. Assuming a Cohen's d of 0.82 requires 40 participants per group for&#xD;
      90% power to detect a difference between groups, at an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: To determine differences in musculoskeletal and cognitive fatigue in&#xD;
      RALS and LS, a mixed-model ANOVA or non-parametric equivalent will be utilised. The data and&#xD;
      conclusions arrived at the end of the study will inform recommendations both in scientific&#xD;
      literature (publications) and dissemination at conferences towards the end of the project&#xD;
      (see Gantt chart). The study is the platform to develop a strong case regarding the long-term&#xD;
      musculoskeletal effects on surgeons performing minimal access procedures in RALS.&#xD;
