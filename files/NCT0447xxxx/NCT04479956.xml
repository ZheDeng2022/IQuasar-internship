      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic venous disease (CVD) is one of the most common pathologies in the general population&#xD;
      of adults in both industrialized and developing countries.1 the most severe form of CVD is&#xD;
      venous ulceration with an overall prevalence of about 1 % in the adult population, which&#xD;
      increases with age and is more common in women and obese patients. Venous ulcers&#xD;
      significantly impair quality of life, and their treatment places a heavy financial burden&#xD;
      upon healthcare systems. Varicose veins (VVS) is a common disease in adults, and VVS without&#xD;
      skin changes are present in about 20% of the population, while active ulcers are found in&#xD;
      0.5%. The traditional surgical treatment of VVS is high ligation of the great saphenous vein&#xD;
      (GSV), axial stripping and phlebotomy, but the postoperative clinical recurrence is as high&#xD;
      as 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, minimally invasive techniques, such as endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have become widely used for the treatment of VVS. Several&#xD;
      reports have shown Several reports have shown that endovenous techniques are as effective as&#xD;
      traditional procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovenous Microwave Ablation (EMA) for the treatment of VVS differs from the other&#xD;
      endovenous methods, and no specific dose regime has been established for this system. Thus,&#xD;
      it is unclear if EMA is more or less effective than conventional surgery, or whether it has&#xD;
      any additional benefits. In this study, we compared the clinical outcome of high ligation and&#xD;
      stripping (HLS) with EMA. Postoperative quality of life (QoL) analysis was assessed using the&#xD;
      Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) and Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work: Aimed to compare microwave therapy with other lines of management&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation, Laser ablation and surgical ligation; regarding time to recurrence&#xD;
      rate, ulcer-free time, and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods Study location: The study will be conducted at the department of&#xD;
      vascular surgery in Mansoura university hospitals Type of study: Randomized controlled&#xD;
      Prospective study Study duration: 2 years: 2019-2021 Sample size: It will include all&#xD;
      patients presented to our department fulfilling the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study will be conducted in patients with Incompetent Great saphenous&#xD;
      vein&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Primary symptomatic VVS (CEAP, C3eC6), sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) incompetence, GSV&#xD;
      reflux from the groin to below the knee&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Exclusion criteria included a history of venous surgery, suspected or proven deep venous&#xD;
      thrombosis, reflux of deep veins to distal limb, duplication of GSV, and patients' refusal to&#xD;
      participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent: Patients after signing informed consent that possible complication from the&#xD;
      procedure ought to happen and what are the alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The demographics, Symptoms and preoperative clinical data will be collected&#xD;
      History Data: included patient's demographics, underlying medical conditions, any previous&#xD;
      associated morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination: Venous examinations. Laboratory: Blood picture, Blood sugar level, Kidney&#xD;
      functions, Liver functions and Coagulation profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging: Duplex US Method of Randomization: Computer based Therapies Surgical group.&#xD;
      Conventional surgical procedures will carried out through a 3-4 cm incision in the groin. The&#xD;
      trunk of GSV and the tributaries will be ligated and divided. The GSV will be removed using a&#xD;
      pin-stripper, and all varices and incompetent perforators will be removed by phlebectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microwave group. The microwave treating wire (Microwave Intracavity Coagulation System;&#xD;
      Shanghai Medical Electronics, Shanghai, China) will be inserted into the GSV until it reached&#xD;
      the medial aspect of ankle, guided by a light that illuminated the tip of the wire. Then, GSV&#xD;
      will be ablated using pulse mode at 20-30 W. The treating wire will be withdrawn at 2-4 mm/s,&#xD;
      with the ablation time lasting 2 s (energy delivery to the GSV was estimated at around 80&#xD;
      J/cm); the treatment parameters will be based on a previous report. Tumescence will be used&#xD;
      in all patients with 0.9% saline containing 20 mL 2% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 adrenaline and&#xD;
      20 mL 0.5% levobupivacaine in 1 L 0.9% saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser ablation group: Endovenous Laser Ablation (EVLA) uses a laser Fiber, which is inserted&#xD;
      into the abnormal vein via a small skin puncture.using 1470 nm laser and a &quot;radial&quot; fiber for&#xD;
      less discomfort. Two weeks later the &quot;branch vessels&quot; have reduced in size Radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation group: inserts a small catheter into the diseased vein through a small incision,&#xD;
      using ultrasound guidance for an accurate and live view. Consistent and uniform heat is&#xD;
      delivered to contract the collagen in the vein walls, causing them to collapse and close.&#xD;
      After the vein is closed the treated vein is gradually absorbed into surrounding tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for technical success will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Closed or absent GSV with lack of flow&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A re-canalized GSV or treatment failure will be defined as an open segment of the&#xD;
           treated vein segment of &gt;10 cm in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All patients will be followed as outpatients up at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The operation time, number of incisions, intraoperative blood loss (determined by the&#xD;
           swabs weighed pre and postoperatively)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Recurrence of varicosities will be recorded, as well as any complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ecchymosis was confirmed 72 h after operation when the lividity and congestion area was&#xD;
           &gt;1 cm2 in the affected limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Skin burns were identified 72 h after operation when the skin was red and oedematous&#xD;
           according to the criteria for burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recurrence was defined by both duplex ultrasound and the clinical examination. A&#xD;
           varicose vein that had not been observed before or previously been marked by the patient&#xD;
           on the AVVQ form was considered to be a recurrent varicose vein (owing to&#xD;
           neo-vascularization or dilation of pre-existing veins).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sensory impairment (numbness) that occurred around incisions was recorded based on the&#xD;
           patient's history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoL assessment The diseased relation effect on QoL was determined using the AVVQ (Chinese&#xD;
      version), which assessed the specific effect on QoL and was scored from 0 (no effect of VVS&#xD;
      on QoL) to a theoretical maximum of 100.8 The VCSS (Chinese version) was also completed (for&#xD;
      the VCSS, 0 represents no significant venous disease and 30 is the maximum score), which is a&#xD;
      valid sensitive and responsive measure of the severity of VVS.&#xD;
