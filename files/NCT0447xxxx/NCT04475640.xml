  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the integration of cancer genetic testing in various ethnic populations.&#xD;
      Studying individuals and families at risk of cancer may help identify cancer genes and other&#xD;
      persons at risk. The information from this study may provide an opportunity for cancer risk&#xD;
      stratification and individualized screening in these ethnic populations.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the prevalence of genetic mutations in cancer patients from various ethnic&#xD;
      populations seeking care at Mayo Clinic Arizona cancer clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Perform a chart review to assess the impact of genetic testing as part of standard of&#xD;
      oncology care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Determine prevalence of pathogenic germline mutation detected by multi-gene panel&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. Determine differences in germline mutation detection in these patients as compared to&#xD;
      traditional guideline (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) based approach for&#xD;
      genetic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood or saliva sample for genetic testing.&#xD;

    <measure>Prevalence of positive pathogenic germline mutations</measure>
    <time_frame>Study completion (2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Will determine whether the prevalence of positive pathogenic germline mutations differs between cancer sites, age of diagnosis, and stage of diagnosis using logistic regression analysis across all cancer site groups and pairwise post-hoc analyses using Tukey's correction for multiple comparisons across pairs of cancer sites and chi-square tests of differences between age and stage groups.</description>
