  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VEGF is a key molecule in the control of vascular permeability via interactions with the&#xD;
      VEGF-receptor on the endothelial cell. Several authors reported plasma VEGF levels are&#xD;
      elevated in sepsis shock and associated with increased mortality (1,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In septic shock, the main elements of treatment are intravenous fluids, appropriate&#xD;
      antibiotics and vasopressors. Some authors observed positive fluid balance is associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality rates in patients (3,4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no studies have shown a correlation between VEGF levels and the&#xD;
      fluid balance. The aim of our study was to determine the role of VEGF in capillary leakage&#xD;
      and the positive fluid balance in septic shock.&#xD;
