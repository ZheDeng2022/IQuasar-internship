      -  This trial is a three-armed, open label, random assignment trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research subjects are patients who are first starting their treatment or patients&#xD;
           who have failed with the metformin treatment and are changing their medication. They&#xD;
           will be assigned to one of the following treatment groups: the glimepiride monotherapy&#xD;
           treatment group, the alogliptin monotherapy treatment group, and the alogliptin -&#xD;
           pioglitazone combination therapy treatment group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This trial is a prospective trial which will conduct surveys 6 times over the course of&#xD;
           the 6 months in which each treatment group is administered drugs (Week -2, Baseline,&#xD;
           Week 4, Week 12, Week 24, follow-up safety survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This trial is a multicenter clinical trial which will be conducted at more than 5&#xD;
           general hospital medical institutions in the vicinity of the capital.&#xD;

      -  The research subjects selected for this trial will patients among those who have given&#xD;
           their approval to participate in the trial and who are first starting their treatment or&#xD;
           who intend to alter their medication because treatment with the existing drugs has&#xD;
           failed who satisfy the criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a '7.5% ≤ HbA1c ≤ 10%' in the HbA1c test will be chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are intending to change drugs due to the failure of an existing drug&#xD;
           treatment must have the use of 1,000 mg or the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) of metformin&#xD;
           recorded in his or her medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators must confirm the patient's intention to participate in the trial and,&#xD;
           starting at the point of the routine laboratory test results, must provide a sufficient&#xD;
           explanation of this research to the patients who satisfy the criteria and then must&#xD;
           acquire a research subject consent form from these patients. The consent forms must&#xD;
           include the trial objectives, the benefits for participants, the risk factors, a&#xD;
           confidentiality agreement, the right to withdraw consent, and contact information. The&#xD;
           patients must sign the consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The change in the level of HbAc1 will be compared among the 3 treatment groups -&#xD;
                the glimepiride monotherapy treatment group, the alogliptin monotherapy treatment&#xD;
                group, and the alogliptin - pioglitazone combination therapy treatment group -&#xD;
                until the 24th week after the Baseline is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CGMS will be checked to investigate changes in blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Glimepiride's nonproprietary name is glimepiride; this drug is a snowman shaped&#xD;
                tablet. Starting with a 1 mg dosage once a day before the first meal, the&#xD;
                investigators will decide to increase the dosage to a maximum of 2 mg in the Week&#xD;
                4.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dosage adjustment will be conducted for participants proven to have persistent&#xD;
                hyperglycemia (in the opinion of the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4 Week 12 Alogliptin 25mg Dosage adjustment is not allowed Dosage adjustment is not&#xD;
      allowed Glimepiride1mg 2mg Dosage adjustment is not allowed Alogliptin 25mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      +Pioglitazone 15mg Dosage adjustment is not allowed Dosage adjustment is not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alogliptin's nonproprietary name is alogliptin benzoate and is an oval-shaped yellow&#xD;
           tablet. A 25 mg dose of this medication is administered once a day and is taken with&#xD;
           food or on an empty stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pioglitazone used by the alogliptin - pioglitazone combination therapy treatment&#xD;
           group is pioglitazone hydrochloride and is a grey circular tablet. A 15 mg dose of this&#xD;
           medication is administered once a day and is taken with food or on an empty stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects will test the HbA1c level in Week 12 and Week 24 and will check CGMS at the&#xD;
           Baseline and in Week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General characteristics (bodyweight and BMI), vital signs, and laboratory tests will be&#xD;
           conducted in Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MAGE will be measured using CGMS (continuous glucose monitoring system) for 3 days (72&#xD;
           hours). Education regarding eating, CGMS usage, notices, and correction will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up safety survey will be conducted 30 days after the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be enrolled in the trial for 6 months and following this a follow-up&#xD;
           survey will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 12 months will be required for the total trial period based on the last&#xD;
           patient (6 months) to have their Baseline enrollment conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be asked to come to the clinical research institution after Week 4, Week&#xD;
           12, and Week 24 (for Week 12 and Week 24, a period of ±7 days is permitted) after the&#xD;
           Baseline (or the first) visit. In addition, patients will be requested to take a call 30&#xD;
           days after their last visit for the safety follow-up survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with a drug compliance of less than 80% will be eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with an HbA1c level of more than 9.0% in Week 12 will be eliminated. Subjects&#xD;
           who sign the trial subject consent form and participate in the trial but do not finish&#xD;
           will be eliminated. The elimination of a subject can be determined at any time during&#xD;
           the trial. Withdrawal of consent by the subject will also be considered as an&#xD;
           elimination and the reason for the withdrawal of consent must be clearly recorded.&#xD;
           Furthermore, if an adverse event and/or a serious adverse event occurs during the trial,&#xD;
           the corresponding subject will be immediately eliminated from the trial.&#xD;
