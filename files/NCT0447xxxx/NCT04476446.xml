    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome, designed for self-completion by respondents. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each of the 5 dimensions is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems. Where Level 1: no problem, Level 2: slight problems, Level 3: moderate problems, Level 4: severe problems and Level 5: extreme problems).</description>
