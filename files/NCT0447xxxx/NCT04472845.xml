  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We at PGIMER have been practicing hypofractionated radiotherapy in breast cancer patients for&#xD;
      the last 4 decades. Our standard doses have been 35Gy/15#/3wks to the chest wall after&#xD;
      mastectomy and 40Gy/16#/3wks after breast conserving surgery (BCS).It is also a routine&#xD;
      practice in the UK and in a few centers in Canada. Hypofractionation reduces treatment time&#xD;
      to half while maintaining cosmesis and gives control rates equal to conventional&#xD;
      fractionation. As breast cancer is a leading cancer in females and radiation therapy is an&#xD;
      important part of its local management, hypofractionation helps radiation centers worldwide&#xD;
      to meet the growing need for radiation treatment in breast cancer, particularly in developing&#xD;
      countries where resources are limited. It also reduces the financial burden on the patient&#xD;
      and family. In this study we want to evaluate the impact of reducing the treatment duration&#xD;
      from 3 weeks to 1 week. Eligible patients with breast cancer after mastectomy or BCS will be&#xD;
      treated with a radiotherapy dose of 26Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week in the study arm and 40Gy&#xD;
      in 15 fractions over 2 weeks in the control arm. The primary endpoint of this noninferiority&#xD;
      study will be locoregional tumour control. Secondary endpoints will be early and late&#xD;
      radiation toxicities, quality of life, contralateral primary tumours, regional and distant&#xD;
      metastases, survival and second cancers. A total of 1018 patients will be randomised (1:1) to&#xD;
      receive 1 week or 2 weeks of radiotherapy. An event-driven analysis will be performed after&#xD;
      at least 94 patients have documented locoregional recurrences.&#xD;

      Aim: To test a 1-week schedule of hypofractionated adjuvant whole breast/chest wall and/or&#xD;
      regional nodal radiotherapy against 2 weeks for loco-regional control, acute and late&#xD;
      toxicities, quality of life (QoL), survival and second cancers after primary surgery in&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of literature Four randomised trials involving a total of &gt;8000 women have compared a&#xD;
      lower total dose in fewer larger fractions against 50Gy in 25 fractions, and all have&#xD;
      reported favourable results in terms of local tumour control and late adverse effects.1-4&#xD;
      Appropriate adjustments to total dose allow 15- or 16-fraction schedules to be delivered over&#xD;
      3 weeks that are at least as safe and effective as standard 5-week regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2008 Cochrane review of altered radiotherapy fractionation in early breast cancer1&#xD;
      including The Royal Marsden Hospital/Gloucestershire Oncology Centre and Ontario trials&#xD;
      totalling 2644 women with mainly axillary node negative tumours &lt;5cm diameter concluded that&#xD;
      radiotherapy fractions larger than 2Gy were at least as effective as 2Gy fractionation for a)&#xD;
      local-recurrence free survival (absolute difference 0.4%, 95% CI 1.5% to 2.4%), b) breast&#xD;
      appearance (risk ratio (RR)1.01, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.17; p=0.86), c) survival at five years (RR&#xD;
      0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.19; p=0.75), d) late skin toxicity at five years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.44&#xD;
      to 2.22; p=0.98, or e) late radiation toxicity in subcutaneous tissue (RR1.0, 95% CI 0.78 to&#xD;
      1.28; p=0.99).1 The UK START A trial(N=2236) showed that the estimated absolute differences&#xD;
      in 5-year local-regional relapse rates compared with the control schedule of 50Gy in 2Gy&#xD;
      fractions were 0.2% (95% CI 1.3% to 2.6%) after41.6Gy and 0.9% (95% CI 0.8% to 3.7%) after&#xD;
      39Gy. In STARTA, photographic and patient self- assessments suggested lower rates of late&#xD;
      adverse effects after 39 Gy than with 50 Gy, with a hazard ratio(HR) for late change in&#xD;
      photographic breast appearance of 0.69(95% CI 0.52 to 0.91,p=0.01).3 In the UK START B&#xD;
      trial(N=2215) the estimated absolute difference in 5-year local-regional relapse rates for&#xD;
      40.05 Gy compared with 50Gy was -0.7% (95% CI 1.7% to 0.9%),and the HR for late change in&#xD;
      photographic breast appearance was 0.83 (95% CI 0.66 to1.04). These START trials reported&#xD;
      similar local tumour control with some evidence of lower rates of late adverse effects after&#xD;
      schedules with fraction sizes larger than 2 Gy compared with the international standard&#xD;
      25-fraction regimen.4 The international standard regimen for whole breast radiotherapy prior&#xD;
      to publication of these studies was a total dose of 50Gy in 25 fractions (daily doses) over&#xD;
      5weeks following surgical resection of the primary tumour in women with early breast cancer.&#xD;
      With the establishment of safety and efficacy of moderate hypofractionation another 'new&#xD;
      standard of care' using 40-41Gy in 15 to 16 fractions over 3 weeks has been established, as&#xD;
      evidenced by recommendations by the National Institute for Health and Clinical&#xD;
      Excellence(NICE). 5 Although interesting and practically helpful, such moderate&#xD;
      hypofractionation is unlikely to represent the useful limits of hypofractionation for whole&#xD;
      breast or even regional nodal radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further hypofractionated radiotherapy has been tested using once weekly schedule to the whole&#xD;
      breast in the UK FAST study.5 Assuming an α/β value between 3 and 4 two different schedules&#xD;
      were hypothesised to be equally effective (28.5 Gy and 30Gy in 5 fractions over 5 weeks) to&#xD;
      the 50Gy in 25 fraction over 5 weeks schedule. Initial analysis has shown a higher rate of&#xD;
      moist desquamation using the 50Gy regimen; however photographic assessment after a median&#xD;
      follow-up of 28.4 months has shown more mild or marked change in the photographic appearance&#xD;
      with the hypofractionated schedule.4 Clinical assessments of breast appearance changes were&#xD;
      similar to the 50Gy group when using the 28.5Gy schedule but worse with the 30Gy schedule.&#xD;
      Final results from the study are awaited. The UK FAST Forward study randomly allocated 4096&#xD;
      patients to 40Gy/15#/3 weeks, 27Gy/5#/1 week, or 26Gy/5#/1 week to the whole breast or chest&#xD;
      wall.6 They concluded that 26Gy/5#/1 week was non-inferior to the standard of 40Gy/15#/3&#xD;
      weeks for local tumour control, and was as safe in terms of normal tissue effects up to 5&#xD;
      years in patients with early-stage breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypofractionated radiotherapy has been used at PGIMER and comparable clinical outcomes have&#xD;
      been published with moderate hypofractionation.7-9 Although Indian breast cancer patients&#xD;
      present at a younger age, with more advanced stage, and a higher percentage of grade 3 and&#xD;
      triple negative tumours compared to the western population. These adverse factors may not be&#xD;
      important when comparing hypofractionated radiotherapy with standard fractionation.9&#xD;
      Reservations exist for extreme hypofractionation to the regional nodes citing increasing risk&#xD;
      of brachial plexopathy when hypofractionating to the supraclavicular fossa although moderate&#xD;
      hypofractionation has been used at our institute for the last 5 decades without reports of&#xD;
      any brachial plexopathy.10,11 Similarly, moderately hypofractionated 2-week regimes have been&#xD;
      used in clinical trials and have been found to be safe.10 Given the above evidence, 40Gy in&#xD;
      15 fractions has been recommended as the standard of care in the UK even for cases that will&#xD;
      include irradiation of the supraclavicular fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Wang et al. published results from a randomised study in high-risk breast cancer&#xD;
      patients after mastectomy.11 They reported similar 5-year clinical outcomes and late&#xD;
      toxicities with conventional and hypofractionation. This study also established the safety of&#xD;
      3 weeks regional nodal irradiation(RNI) in patients with breast cancer. They reported a&#xD;
      lymphedema rate of 19% at 5-years. We published our results of RNI with 40 Gy/15 fractions/3&#xD;
      weeks hypofractionation with 2D technique, at 15 years RNI was safe and comparable to&#xD;
      historical data of conventional fractionation (ClinicalTrial.gov Registration No.&#xD;
      NCT04175821).12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against this background, a phase III randomised, non-inferiority study testing 1 week against&#xD;
      2 weeks of radiotherapy to the breast and chest wall with or without supraclavicular fossa&#xD;
      adjuvant radiotherapy will include 1018 patients. The primary end point will be locoregional&#xD;
      control and secondary end points will be acute and late radiation toxicity, QoL, survival and&#xD;
      second cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Preliminary work done: i) The consent form prepared. ii) CRF, PIS, evaluation sheet&#xD;
      prepared Detailed Research Methodology This study will be a randomised, non-inferiority,&#xD;
      open-label, phase 3 trial, with patients to be recruited from a single institute. Other&#xD;
      institutes will be invited if they are willing to participate. Patients to be included in&#xD;
      this study will be pre-operatively staged according to American Joint Committee on Cancer&#xD;
      (AJCC) 8th edition, International Union against cancer (which uses TNM staging) as stage III&#xD;
      breast carcinoma. For patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy, pathological stage will be&#xD;
      reflected and those with neoadjuvant chemotherapy the stage which is higher&#xD;
      (clinical/pathological) will be reflected. A total of 1018 patients with histologically&#xD;
      proven post lumpectomy/mastectomy cases of carcinoma breast suitable for radiotherapy will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Patients will be evaluated at the Department of Radiation Oncology&#xD;
      Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education &amp;Research, Chandigarh, India. A thorough&#xD;
      clinical examination followed by routine investigations which will include hemogram, liver&#xD;
      function tests, kidney function tests, mammography, chest X-ray, ultrasound of abdomen/CECT&#xD;
      chest, abdomen and pelvis and whole body bone scan. Written informed consent will be taken&#xD;
      from all the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and masking Eligible patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either&#xD;
      1 week or 2 weeks of radiotherapy without stratification by simple randomisation according to&#xD;
      a prescribed computer-generated central randomisation schedule. Radiation oncologists in the&#xD;
      study team will enroll participants, and research staff members who will be involved in&#xD;
      follow-up data collection will assign participants to interventions. Treatment allocation&#xD;
      will not be masked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy Radiotherapy dose to chest wall, axilla level III and supraclavicular fossa will&#xD;
      be of 26Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week in the study arm and 34Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks&#xD;
      in the control arm. BCS patients will receive a sequential boost of 8Gy/2#/2days or&#xD;
      simultaneous integrated boost(SIB) to a total dose of 34Gy in the study arm and 42Gy in the&#xD;
      control arm. Treatment will be done on a linear accelerator with 6 or 10MV photon energy.&#xD;
      Boost can be with photons or electrons. 1cm bolus will be used in all postmastectomy&#xD;
      patients, daily in study arm and in 50% of treatment in the control arm. Dose will be&#xD;
      prescribed at mid-separation in 2D technique and the dose covering 95% of the planning target&#xD;
      volume with three-dimensional conformal(3D-CRT) or intensity modulated radiotherapy(IMRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supraclavicular fossa(SCF) and axilla level III will be treated in patients with T3-4 disease&#xD;
      with lymphovascular invasion, grade 3 or N2 disease and T3-4 disease treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy after adequate axillary dissection. Level I and II axilla will only be&#xD;
      irradiated in patients with inadequate axillary dissection(&lt;10 lymph nodes). The prescribed&#xD;
      dose to the area will be defined as the dose to the point at 3 cm beneath the skin in&#xD;
      two-dimensional radiotherapy technique, or the dose covering 95% of the planning target&#xD;
      volume with 3D-CRT or IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal mammary node (IMNs) radiation will be done in T3-4 central and inner quadrant&#xD;
      lesions and patients with N2 disease. IMNs will be irradiated with a separate 12x5 cm single&#xD;
      field. The first five intercostal spaces will be included in the IMN target volume. The&#xD;
      medial border of the IMN field will be midline; lateral border 5 cm lateral to the midline;&#xD;
      the superior border will abut the inferior border of the supraclavicular field; and the&#xD;
      inferior border will be above the xiphoid. Dose will be 34Gy/10#/2weeks. Dose will be&#xD;
      prescribed at 3cm depth. Imaging will be done for set-up verification on alternate days in&#xD;
      the study arm and once weekly in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormonal therapy may be given to oestrogen receptor-positive or progesterone&#xD;
      receptor-positive tumours, and anti-HER2-targeted therapy (e.g., trastuzumab) for those with&#xD;
      HER2-positive disease depending on the affordability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Patients will be assessed for medical history, a physical examination, and a blood&#xD;
      test before radiotherapy, once per week during radiotherapy, and 2 weeks after radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up every 3 months for 2 years after radiotherapy, then every 6&#xD;
      months from 3 to 5 years, and yearly thereafter. Skin, subcutaneous toxicity and cosmetic&#xD;
      assessment will be done before treatment and then in regular follow up of the study. Acute&#xD;
      radiation toxicity will be assessed and scaled according to the RTOG grading system. Late&#xD;
      radiation toxicity will be assessed with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the&#xD;
      European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scale.&#xD;
      Cosmetic assessment will be done using Harvard/NSABP/RTOG breast cosmesis grading scale at&#xD;
      baseline, 3 and 5 years. Quality of life(QoL) will be assessed with EORTC QLQ -30, EORTC&#xD;
      QLQ-BR 23 at baseline, 3 and 5 years.12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations The primary hypothesis of the study is that locoregional&#xD;
      recurrence with 1 week is non-inferior to that with 2 weeks of radiotherapy. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be locoregional recurrence (LRR). Based on historical data (Wang et al.), the&#xD;
      5-year LRR rate with 3 weeks of RT is expected to be approximately 8%. 1 week RT would be&#xD;
      considered non-inferior to 2 weeks RT if the 5-year LRR rate does not exceed 13%. If LRR&#xD;
      follows exponential distributions within each treatment group, this non-inferiority margin&#xD;
      corresponds to a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.67.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations were performed using module STE0S-3 of nQuery version 8.5.2.0. A&#xD;
      total of 94 LRR events will be required to provide at least 80% power using a one-sided test&#xD;
      at the 5% level of significance. Under assumed failure rates and guarding against 10%&#xD;
      ineligibility or loss to follow-up, the target accrual will be 1018 patients with an accrual&#xD;
      period of 3 years. If the two schedules are equivalent, 5 years of follow-up after the last&#xD;
      patient has been randomised will be required to observe 94 LRR events, resulting in total&#xD;
      study duration of 8 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary efficacy endpoint, we will use the cumulative incidence method to estimate&#xD;
      the actual incidence of locoregional recurrence at different time points, with death without&#xD;
      locoregional recurrence as a competing risk. We will use the log-rank test and Cox regression&#xD;
      model for statistical inference based on cause-specific hazards. We will calculate overall&#xD;
      survival and disease-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier method, and we will analyse these&#xD;
      endpoints using the log rank test and Cox regression model. Acute and late toxicities will be&#xD;
      summarised as frequency and severity on the basis of their association with protocol&#xD;
      treatment; χ² tests will be used to compare the differences. The primary endpoint and all&#xD;
      efficacy endpoints will be analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population (i.e.,&#xD;
      including all eligible patients who will undergo randomisation but exclude those who are&#xD;
      considered ineligible. On the basis of the study design, the primary endpoint locoregional&#xD;
      recurrence will be analysed at a one-sided significance level of 0•05 and reported with a&#xD;
      two-sided 90% CI. All other statistical tests will be two sided, and p values of &lt;0.05 will&#xD;
      be taken as significant. All tests will be performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the&#xD;
      Social Sciences) v.23.0.&#xD;
