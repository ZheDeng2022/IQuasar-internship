  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block(SPGB) is administered to patients with facial or&#xD;
      head and neck pain. In the transnasal approach, the drip and topical methods are frequently&#xD;
      used. We compared facial temperatures and VAS after transnasal SPGB.&#xD;

      The objective of this study was to compare facial temperatures and visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) between drip method and topical method of transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block&#xD;
      (SPGB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transnasal SPGB is administered to patients with facial or head and neck pain. In the&#xD;
      transnasal approach, the drip and topical methods are frequently used. We compared facial&#xD;
      temperatures and VAS after transnasal SPGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records of 74 patients who visited the pain clinic and underwent transnasal SPGB were&#xD;
      retrospectively reviewed. A total of 156 transnasal SPGB were performed. The patients were&#xD;
      divided into the drip-method and topical-method groups. Facial temperatures were measured in&#xD;
      six areas of the right and left forehead, maxilla, and mandible before and 30 min after&#xD;
      completion of the transnasal SPGB. Temperatures were compared before and 30 min after SPGB in&#xD;
      each group and between the two groups. VAS scores were compared at same times of SPGB in each&#xD;
      group and between the two groups.&#xD;

    <description>Transnasal SPGB was performed by a single pain clinician. After the patient was placed in a supine and neck-extended position, 2 mL of 2% mepivacaine was placed in a syringe connected to a 16-gauge Angiocath sheath. The sheath of the Angiocath was inserted through the nostril, and 2% mepivacaine was dripped into the nostrils with the patient in a supine position. The mepivacaine drip on the nasal pharynx was maintained for 10 min. A drip of 2% mepivacaine was delivered to the nostril, where the pain was dominant. In cases of bilateral pain, mepivacaine drip was administered to both nostrils.</description>

    <description>Transnasal SPGB was performed by a single pain clinician. The posture was the same as that in the drip method. A cotton tip applicator soaked with 2% mepivacaine was inserted vertically into the nostril. After the cotton tip applicator made contact with the posterior wall of the middle turbinate, the cotton tip applicator was fixed for 10 min. A cotton tip applicator was inserted into the nostril, where the pain was dominant. In cases of bilateral pain, two applicators were inserted into both nostrils.</description>

    <description>In transnasal approach, several authors described the traditional technique using sterile 10cm cotton tipped applicators that are dipped in the chosen anesthetic and then advanced along the superior border of the middle turbinate, until it reaches the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Some other techniques had described dripping one or two ml of the anesthetics into the nostril.</description>
