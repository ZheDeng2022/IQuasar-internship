  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increase in life expectancy of our population due to advancement of medical&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatments, the incidence of age dependent neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
      increased, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), parkinsonian syndromes (PS), small vessel&#xD;
      disease (SVD) and motor neuron disease (MND). In spite of the progress of knowing the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases at molecular and genetic level, they are&#xD;
      still very incompletely understood and often cause diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to&#xD;
      physicians. Due to the overlapping presentation and similar brain pathology, especially in&#xD;
      the early stage of the diseases, it is difficult to differentiate idiopathic Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (iPD) from atypical parkinsonian syndromes, such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and&#xD;
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Similarly, distinguishing AD from other dementia&#xD;
      syndromes including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB),&#xD;
      corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and vascular dementia can be difficult. It is necessary to&#xD;
      develop accurate and comprehensive diagnostic tests to properly prognosticate the diseases,&#xD;
      start treatments in early stage of the diseases and maximize the accuracy of drug trials for&#xD;
      more effective preventive and therapeutic measures for these neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the registry aims to generate a large database of cognitive, behavioral, lifestyle&#xD;
      and psychological information of the subjects who suffered from neurodegenerative diseases,&#xD;
      as well as to examine the genetic basis of neurodegenerative diseases to help decode the&#xD;
      pathogenic mechanisms of the diseases. The registry may provide important information to&#xD;
      understand symptom development of the neurodegenerative diseases, in which may help&#xD;
      physicians to diagnose the diseases more accurately and provide better treatment plans.&#xD;

      This is a cohort study. It involves baseline, 1st follow up visit and 2nd follow up visit. At&#xD;
      baseline visit, all participants will go through a list of assessments and questionnaires and&#xD;
      blood taking. Follow-up visit(s) will be scheduled every one to two years, in which the same&#xD;
      set of assessments and questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical assessments and questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
           Different clinical assessments would be administered depending on the group that the&#xD;
           participant belongs to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hoehn and Yahr Stage and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) for&#xD;
                iPD, PSP and SVD patients with parkinsonism features&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS) for MSA&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Levodopa Equivalent Dosage for medication burden for parkinsonian syndromes&#xD;
                patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R), body&#xD;
                weight and forced vital capacity (FVC) for MND group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Montreal Cognitive Assessment Hong Kong version (HK-MoCA), Olfactory Identification&#xD;
                Test (OIT) and Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test for all groups&#xD;
&#xD;
           Video taking would be administered to record participants' eye movement if necessary.&#xD;
           For example, video of eye movement is useful to rate MSA patients' ocular motor&#xD;
           dysfunction, such as gaze-evoke nystagmus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with parkinsonian syndromes will fill in a set of questionnaires, including&#xD;
           demographic information, medical history, history and current medications, wearing-off&#xD;
           questionnaire, impulsiveness questionnaire, Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ),&#xD;
           rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder questionnaire (RBDQ), Epworth Sleepiness&#xD;
           Scale (ESS), Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI),&#xD;
           Beck's Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI), Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's&#xD;
           Disease-Autonomic questionnaire (SCOPA-AUT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale&#xD;
           (HADS), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), lifestyle and life history, and occupation&#xD;
           history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood sampling Blood taking would be carried out at Prince of Wales Hospital and will be&#xD;
           processed and transported to the laboratory according to standard procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Venous blood samples are collected into 6 EDTA tubes and 1 Heparin tube. The volume of&#xD;
           total blood samples will not exceed 23ml. Serum is obtained within 1 hour by&#xD;
           centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min and stored at -70Â°C until laboratory evaluation&#xD;
           for proteomics, SERS and other biochemical and genetics studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sub-studies Selected participants in the cohort groups, especially those with early&#xD;
           disease onset and/or familial cases, would proceed to sub-studies which include brain&#xD;
           MRI, brain PET, lumbar puncture and/or skin biopsy. Subjects are voluntary to join one&#xD;
           or more sub-studies.&#xD;
