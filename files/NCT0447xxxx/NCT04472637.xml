      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality among&#xD;
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CVD are present since the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and reach around 30 to&#xD;
      44% of those beginning hemodialysis. Macrovascular disease develops rapidly in uremic&#xD;
      patients and is responsible for the high incidence of ischemic heart disease, left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, sudden death, and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with the general population, the incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events among&#xD;
      patients with ESRD is significantly higher, but it does not seem to be fully explained by the&#xD;
      increased incidence of conventional risk factors alone. It has been hypothesized that HD&#xD;
      patients are exposed to unique renal and HD-related risk factors that predispose them to an&#xD;
      increased rate of CV events. Research efforts have expanded understanding of the contribution&#xD;
      made by vascular pathologies to this burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians now recognize that defects in the vascular wall are the bases of many CV events,&#xD;
      and early detection and intervention in subclinical vascular disease are fundamental for&#xD;
      preventing and controlling cardiovascular events. Changes in the vasculature include&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction (ED), smooth muscle cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy, vascular&#xD;
      calcification, and arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness is one of the vascular pathologies in HD patients. Recent studies&#xD;
      examining cardiovascular complications in dialysis patients focused on atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      including arterial stiffness and wall thickness changes as a major contributing factors for&#xD;
      CV events. It was shown that stiffening of arteries is associated with increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arteriosclerosis refers to the reduced arterial compliance due to increased fibrosis, loss of&#xD;
      elasticity, and vessel wall calcification affecting the media of large and middle-sized&#xD;
      arteries. These arterial wall changes are influenced not only by nonspecific factors, such as&#xD;
      age, genetics, hypertension, diabetes, lipid abnormalities, inflammation, and/or common&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, but also by parameter(s) associated with the presence of uremia per se.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffening in patients with CKD and ESRD occurs at an accelerated rate compared with&#xD;
      the normal ageing process and arteriosclerosis. As bone mineral metabolism worsens with&#xD;
      advancement to ESRD, hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism and inhibited vitamin D&#xD;
      synthesis result in vascular calcification that causes hardening of the arteries. Other&#xD;
      factors linked to the uremic environment, such as anaemia, endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      neuro-hormonal activation and inflammation, play important roles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness can be assessed noninvasively with the use of pulse wave velocity (PWV)&#xD;
      measurement. The aortic pulse wave velocity (APWV) reflects central arterial stiffness. APWV&#xD;
      is a predictor of cardiovascular outcome in patients with hypertension, diabetes, end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease, and elderly hospitalized subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are&#xD;
      considered first-line treatment for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)&#xD;
      levels, as large-scale, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated their clinical benefits&#xD;
      in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Background and clinical studies&#xD;
      have also shown beneficial actions of statins for the vasculature that may extend above their&#xD;
      lipid lowering properties, such as improvement of endothelial function, inhibition of&#xD;
      vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and reduction of vascular inflammation. It has&#xD;
      been also proposed that such pleiotropic effects of statins may translate into a beneficial&#xD;
      impact on arterial stiffness. Atorvastatin reduced arterial stiffness in patients with&#xD;
      hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus. Fassett at al. found that&#xD;
      atorvastatin reduced arterial stiffness in CKD patients (stage 2-4) but they did not include&#xD;
      patients on maintenance haemodialysis in their study. We want to illustrate if these&#xD;
      beneficial effects on arterial stiffness will be present or not among haemodialysis patients.&#xD;

Patients will be randomly assigned using block randomization method into two study groups:&#xD;
Experimental group (25 patients): They will receive atorvastatin 10 mg, as one tablet /day for 24 weeks.&#xD;
Control group (25 patients): They will receive a placebo in the form of multivitamin tablets similar to the experimental drugs with the same regimen (one tablet /day for 24 weeks).&#xD;
Allocation concealment: will be ensured using sealed closed envelop randomization technique, every patient will be given an identification code.</intervention_model_description>
