  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To utilize near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate if the research device, which induces&#xD;
      muscle stretching, and creatine loading impact submaximal exercise performance in aged and&#xD;
      PAD patients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived tissue oxygenation responses will be&#xD;
      obtained during device placement (muscle stretch) and during a walking test (i.e., six-minute&#xD;
      walk test). Muscle oxygenation at rest and during device placement will be assessed with&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It is hypothesized that the stretching protocol will improve both&#xD;
      NIRS-derived tissue oxygenation and magnetic resonance-derived muscle oxygenation and that&#xD;
      creatine supplementation will further improve phosphorus metabolite muscle performance. All&#xD;
      patients will undergo either 4 weeks of stretch training with- or- without creatine&#xD;
      supplementation according to previously defined creatine guidelines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) has been estimated to impact nearly 8.5&#xD;
      million U.S. adults above the age of 40, significantly increasing the rate of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality with concomitant decreases in quality of life. These patients are often given&#xD;
      medical therapy (e.g., statins, antiplatelet, anticoagulants) and are also recommended to&#xD;
      begin structured exercise programs. However, the limb ischemia that occurs during physical&#xD;
      activity in these patients often limits exercise tolerance. A previous study by Bauer and&#xD;
      colleagues showed that impaired muscle metabolism is a major contributor to functional&#xD;
      limitations in PAD patients. These data are important in that they show alterations in blood&#xD;
      flow and metabolic machinery likely impact exercise tolerance. As such, the development of&#xD;
      tolerable countermeasures to improve limb blood flow and muscle energetics may increase&#xD;
      adherence to exercise therapy and improve health outcomes in PAD patients. Previous work by&#xD;
      the investigators has shown that daily muscle stretching, achieved via 30-minutes of ankle&#xD;
      dorsiflexion, significantly improved soleus muscle function and muscle blood flow during&#xD;
      exercise in a rat model of aging . In a follow-up study, the investigators have also shown&#xD;
      that this model improves vascular function and walking function in PAD patients. As noted&#xD;
      above, muscle energetics are delayed in PAD patients, so improving the rest-to-exercise&#xD;
      transition with creatine supplementation may help PAD patients sustain exercise longer. The&#xD;
      investigators are now testing to see if an added supplement can further improve the effects&#xD;
      of muscle stretching in PAD patients.&#xD;
