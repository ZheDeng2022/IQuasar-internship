  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib study with a safety lead-in (n = 6 per arm) evaluating combinatorial&#xD;
      DPV-001 + sequenced PD-1 blockade, with or without GITR agonist, in recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      HNSCC.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib trial of an autophagosome vaccine (DPV-001) with or without anti-GITR&#xD;
      (INCAGN01876), combined with subsequent anti-PD1 (INCMGA00012), in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic HNSCC. Eligible patients will be registered and assigned to one of two treatment&#xD;
      arms. Subjects in Arm 1 will receive combination therapy with DPV-001 with delayed anti-PD-1,&#xD;
      and subjects in Arm 2 will receive DPV-001 and anti-GITR with delayed anti-PD-1 (triplet&#xD;
      therapy). Mandatory biopsy will occur at week 2. Initial restaging CT and mandatory biopsy&#xD;
      will occur at 8 weeks, followed by confirmatory CT at 12 weeks. Subsequent restaging CT will&#xD;
      be performed at week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Starting at week 22, dosing of DPV-101&#xD;
      will switch to a q4wk schedule, while the schedule of anti-GITR and anti-PD1 will remain&#xD;
      unchanged.&#xD;
