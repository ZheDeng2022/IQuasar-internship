  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in 300 Jamaicans have HbSS sickle cell disease, and of these, up to 70% will suffer from&#xD;
      sickle cell leg ulcers (SCLUs). Of these, 24% will have a chronic SCLU (one lasting longer&#xD;
      than 6 months). SCLUs heal very slowly, and sometimes they never close. SCLU patients would&#xD;
      benefit from an economical, less painful, dressing option. In addition, because SCLUs often&#xD;
      compromise education and employment opportunities, improving wound care for this population&#xD;
      benefits their entire community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This three-armed evaluator-blinded randomized controlled trial will determine if a cut-to-fit&#xD;
      food-grade plastic-based improvised dressing decreases pain, improves quality of life, and is&#xD;
      safe, effective, and acceptable for managing SCLUs in Jamaica. The negative control will be&#xD;
      usual practice, and the positive control will be the advanced wound dressing with the&#xD;
      strongest evidence supporting its use in a tropical climate (polymeric membrane dressing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with SCLUs will be actively recruited from three adjacent parishes. The first 120&#xD;
      SCLU patients meeting study criteria presenting to UHWI, Mona, will be randomized immediately&#xD;
      after initial cleansing/debriding into group (1) current usual practice, group (2) improvised&#xD;
      dressings, or group (3) advanced dressings. Data will be added to each participant's data&#xD;
      collection tool weekly. Results will be reported using descriptive statistics and ANCOVA. The&#xD;
      expected outcome is both improvised and advanced dressing superiority to usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because proposed improvised dressing materials are easily obtainable, their use would&#xD;
      increase the capacity of wound patients to safely and effectively care for themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed informed consent will be obtained from patients/parents. Only principal research&#xD;
      investigators will have access to participant confidential information. The literature review&#xD;
      demonstrates that risks are not higher than usual practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study's primary purpose is to determine if an improvised dressing, made from inexpensive&#xD;
      materials available for purchase in rural as well as urban settings, is a safe and effective,&#xD;
      culturally and medically acceptable choice for managing sickle cell leg ulcers in a tropical&#xD;
      climate. Three research questions will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the improvised dressing, consisting of a cut-to-fit new plastic bag sealed at the&#xD;
           periwound with zinc oxide paste, safe and effective (see definitions, below) when&#xD;
           compared with usual practice (saline-soaked gauze) and when compared with an advanced&#xD;
           wound dressing (PMD), on sickle cell leg ulcers (SCLUs) in Jamaica?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does use of the improvised dressing, when compared with usual practice, improve the&#xD;
           quality of life of patients (decrease pain, increase ability to engage in desirable&#xD;
           activities, decrease wound-related materials costs, decrease time required to perform&#xD;
           dressing changes, improve Wound QoL scores, and improve ASCQ-Me pencil-and-paper&#xD;
           interview scores) with SCLUs in Jamaica?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is the improvised dressing culturally acceptable to health care providers, patients, and&#xD;
           families for managing SCLUs in Jamaica?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected study outcome is improvised dressing superior effectiveness and quality of life,&#xD;
      when compared with usual practice, without increased safety and acceptability issues. The&#xD;
      improvised dressing is likely to be the least expensive choice, with the added benefit of&#xD;
      being available as first aid treatment throughout Jamaica. The advanced dressing is likely to&#xD;
      be more expensive with respect to materials costs, although fewer dressing changes are&#xD;
      anticipated and pain medication expenses are likely to be reduced. Based upon the review of&#xD;
      the literature, no serious infections or other safety issues are anticipated for any group.&#xD;
      However, to ensure that complications are not overlooked, in addition to the onsite&#xD;
      researchers' vigilance, weekly wound photos will be assessed for complications (signs of&#xD;
      infection, wound deterioration, or clinically relevant maceration) by two off-site blinded&#xD;
      wound experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle cell leg ulcer - a wound in a HbSS or HbSÎ²0 positive patient, open greater than one&#xD;
      month, below the level of the knee excluding the plantar surface of the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closed wound - 100% epithelialized with no discernible scab or exudate production (paper&#xD;
      napkin remains dry when lightly pressed against area, and no recurrence in the subsequent two&#xD;
      weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safe - infection and other complications (healing-impairing maceration, keloid, and&#xD;
      contracture rates) not statistically significantly higher than usual practice, with no major&#xD;
      adverse events attributable to the method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective - ulcer closure rates or ulcer surface area reduction rates not statistically&#xD;
      significantly lower than usual practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptable - average acceptability scores of 4 or higher on a 1 - 5 scale&#xD;

    <description>After a member of the UHWI surgical team performs the initial cleansing/debriding, the control group (1) will have their ulcer dressed as usually done at UHWI. Wounds are dressed with saline-soaked gauze, covered with dry gauze. One wrap of stretch gauze will hold the dressing in place. Patients will clean the wound by vigorously wiping with gauze soaked in homemade normal saline (1 tsp salt/500ml water bottle), center to edges, at each dressing change, unless already very clean. Clean wounds will simply be irrigated with normal saline at each dressing change. Patients experienced with using papaya for debridement of their ulcers may apply it only to the open wound, avoiding contact with the periwound, to remove slough or eschar. If patients observe green exudate, they are permitted to add one teaspoon of vinegar to their bottle of saline. Dressings in group (1) will be changed daily. The dressings will be soaked off if they become adherent.</description>

    <description>After initial cleansing/debriding, patients in the improvised dressing group (2) will then have a thin layer zinc oxide paste applied to the dried periwound, carefully avoiding the open wound. A piece of a clean new plastic bag (food-grade World Star 1 mil LD bags, or the equivalent, purchased from the Papine Market across John Golding Road from the University of the West Indies), cut slightly larger than the ulcer will be gently conformed to the moist wound contours and sealed onto the zinc oxide paste. The bag will be fenestrated with a small slit using a number 11 scalpel or clean scissors prior to placing it on the ulcer in order to allow excess fluid to escape. The edges of the slit will be approximated. Clean gauze will be placed lightly over the slit to capture escaping fluid. One wrap of stretch gauze will hold the dressing in place. Patients will be instructed to change the dressings daily, irrigating with normal saline at each dressing change.</description>

    <description>After initial cleansing/debriding, the advanced dressing group (3) will have a cut piece of a 4&quot;x24&quot; standard (pink) polymeric membrane dressing roll large enough to extend at least 0.5 cm beyond all open and closed (inflamed or damaged) wound edges applied as per the Instructions for Use (the periwound is blotted dry, but the wound bed remains moist from the final saline rinse). One wrap of stretch gauze will hold the polymeric membrane dressing in place. The approximate open wound edges will be marked on the dressing backing. As per the manufacturer's instructions for use, patients will change the dressings when saturation reaches any of the wound edges, as indicated by a change in color on the backing of the dressing, visible through the stretch gauze. Routine rinsing will not be performed; the wounds will be rinsed at dressing changes only if visible loose debris is present.</description>
