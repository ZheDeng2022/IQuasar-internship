  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well polatuzumab vedotin and combination chemotherapy work in&#xD;
      treating patients with previously untreated double or triple hit lymphoma. Polatuzumab&#xD;
      vedotin is a monoclonal antibody that works by binding with cancer cells and releasing&#xD;
      another chemotherapy drug, called monomethyl auristatin E, into the cell causing the cancer&#xD;
      cells to die or stop growing. Chemotherapy drugs, such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving polatuzumab vedotin with combination chemotherapy may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with double or triple hit lymphoma compared to combination chemotherapy&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

    <description>Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, summaries of changes from screening assessments in laboratory test results, electrocardiograms, and changes in vital signs. All adverse events occurring on or after first study treatment will be summarized by mapped term, appropriate thesaurus levels, and National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version (v) 4.03 toxicity grade. All serious adverse events will be listed separately and summarized.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarker assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to time of disease progression, assessed up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory analyses of biomarkers related to tumor biology and the mechanisms of action of polatuzumab vedotin and rituximab will be conducted. Analyses will assess prognostic and/or predictive value of candidate biomarkers separately for each histological subtype and both investigator and Independent Review Committee assessed outcomes. Specifically, the association between candidate biomarkers and positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) CR rate and objective response rate and potentially other measures of efficacy and safety, independent of treatment, will be explored to assess potential prognostic value. In addition, the potential effect modification of treatment effect on PET-CT CR rate and OR rate and potentially other measures of efficacy and safety, by biomarker status, will be explored to assess potential predictive value.</description>

             DLBCL per the investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,000/uL (unless due to underlying disease, as&#xD;

             dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is post-menarcheal,&#xD;

             childbearing potential are not required to have a pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             * With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must&#xD;
             remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 5 months&#xD;
             after the last dose of polatuzumab vedotin, 3 months after the last dose of rituximab,&#xD;
             and for at least 6 months after the last dose of cyclophosphamide to avoid exposing&#xD;
             the embryo for the duration of the pregnancy. Men must refrain from donating sperm&#xD;
             during this same period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation&#xD;
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients&#xD;
             considering preservation of fertility should bank sperm before study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CRITERIA FOR TISSUE SUBMISSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients must have available at the study site a representative&#xD;
             formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimen that enabled the definitive diagnosis&#xD;
             of DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The specimen must contain adequate evaluable tumor cells (&gt;= 20% for excisional&#xD;
                  biopsy and &gt;= 50% if sample is a core biopsy) to enable relevant biomarker&#xD;
                  analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A tissue block (preferred) or 15 serial, freshly cut, unstained slides plus punch&#xD;
                  biopsy of the tissue block accompanied by an associated pathology report will be&#xD;
                  requested. Punch biopsy is required only with the slide submission. Cytological&#xD;
                  or fine-needle aspiration samples are not acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the archival tissue is unavailable or insufficient on the basis of the above&#xD;
                  criteria, the patient may still be eligible if the patient is willing to provide&#xD;
                  tissue from a pretreatment core or excisional/incisional biopsy of the tumor.&#xD;
                  Cytological or fine-needle aspiration samples are not acceptable. The sample&#xD;
                  should be shipped according to instructions provided in the laboratory manual.&#xD;
                  Tissue collected on study will not be returned to sites. If needed, additional&#xD;
                  slides from previously collected samples may be requested. Cases received from&#xD;
                  each of the participating institutes should be histological confirmed according&#xD;
                  to the 2016 WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasm.&#xD;
                  The evaluation process by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ&#xD;
                  hybridization (FISH) requires the possession of representative amount of tissues&#xD;
                  in a paraffin embedded block to be sent to the primary testing institution&#xD;
                  (Karmanos Cancer Center, Detroit, Michigan). Shipped slides should be placed in&#xD;
                  proper containers to avoid breakage during shipping. Blocks of paraffin embedded&#xD;
                  tissue or slides should be sent with a tracking number the address. In addition,&#xD;
                  the participation institution should call the laboratory at 313-576-8351 (Julie&#xD;
                  Boerner) for any sample that they ship and provide tracking number&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
