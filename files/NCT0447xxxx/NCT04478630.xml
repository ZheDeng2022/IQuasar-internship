    <textblock>
      This study is a three group, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial with two&#xD;
      repeated measurements. The same measurements will be collected for each participant during&#xD;
      two consecutive chemotherapy treatment cycles.Subjects will be provided with written&#xD;
      instructions as an educational handout as well as essential oil safety information. Subjects&#xD;
      will be able to demonstrate an ability and accurate understanding of the proper use of the&#xD;
      diffusers, using a demonstration diffuser, at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time the subject will provide written informed consent, they will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of the three groups with a pocket diffuser containing either ginger essential oil,&#xD;
      peppermint essential oil, or vanilla extract )placebo- control). This is based on a&#xD;
      pre-determined list of random assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be instructed to inhale from the pocket diffuser beginning on the day of&#xD;
      their chemotherapy (Day 1) and continue using the inhaler for the next three consecutive days&#xD;
      (Day 1-Day 4). The subjects will remove the cover of the pocket diffuser, place the pocket&#xD;
      diffuser approximately an inch away from their nose and inhale three times with deep&#xD;
      breathing (i.e., three sniffs). Subjects will take 3 sniffs of the aromatherapy inhaler three&#xD;
      times daily (morning, afternoon, and evening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the Pre-treatment Assessment, occurring before each of the 2 cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, the subjects will be contacted to complete assessments at approximately 24 and&#xD;
      72 hours post-chemotherapy. A member of the study team will call the participant again at&#xD;
      their preferred time of day to ask the survey questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedures will be repeated during the participant's second cycle of chemotherapy,&#xD;
      which is likely two or three weeks after the first one.&#xD;

      This study is a three group, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial with two&#xD;
      repeated measurements. The same measurements will be collected for each participant during&#xD;
      two consecutive chemotherapy treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subjects are identified to meet criteria and have reported some degree of nausea&#xD;
      following chemotherapy, one of the Clinical Nurse Coordinators or Infusion Room Nurses on the&#xD;
      research team will provide information regarding the study to the potential subject. If the&#xD;
      potential subject is interested in participating in the study and physically demonstrates the&#xD;
      ability to correctly use the pocket diffuser the consent will be gone over in detail with the&#xD;
      potential subject and signed. Educational handouts outlining the instructions for use of the&#xD;
      pocket diffuser as well as safety and contact information will be provided and explained to&#xD;
      the subject at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time the subject will provide written informed consent, they will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of the three groups (ginger essential oil, peppermint essential oil, or vanilla&#xD;
      extract placebo- control) based on a pre-determined list of random assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diffusers will have been prepped with essential oils of either peppermint or ginger,&#xD;
      which will each contain 14 drops of the designated essential oil. The nonessential oil&#xD;
      diffusers (placebo) pure vanilla extract will also be prepared to each contain 14 drops each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the participant's chemotherapy infusion, all subjects will complete a&#xD;
      pre-treatment survey to evaluate their baseline/anticipatory nausea. The pre-treatment survey&#xD;
      will also include questions about the recent chemotherapy treatment experience related to&#xD;
      appetite and the use of medication to prevent or lesson nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, participants will be provided with their assigned pocket diffuser which has already&#xD;
      been prepared with the correct substance (ginger essential oil, peppermint essential oil, or&#xD;
      pure vanilla extract). Participants will be asked to remove the cover of the pocket diffuser,&#xD;
      place the pocket diffuser about an inch under their nose, and inhale three times with deep&#xD;
      breathing (i.e. three sniffs). After use, the inhaler should be capped to minimize dispersal&#xD;
      of the scent. Subjects will take three sniffs of the aromatherapy inhaler three times daily&#xD;
      (morning, afternoon, and evening) starting at the time of the chemotherapy appointment&#xD;
      through the final survey at 72 hours post-discharge. Subjects will be instructed on proper&#xD;
      disposal and receive a new pocket-sized diffuser at the next treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be encouraged to follow all standard procedures related to their&#xD;
      treatment including the use of any prescribed anti-emetics. Aromatherapy is considered a&#xD;
      complementary therapy and is not intended to replace any current treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the day after chemotherapy administration (approximately 24 hours post-discharge), a&#xD;
      member of the study team will call the participant at their preferred time of day to conduct&#xD;
      the first post-intervention survey. This survey will be identical to the baseline survey&#xD;
      conducted on Day 1, but it will also include questions about the aromatherapy diffuser usage.&#xD;
      By calling 24 hours after chemotherapy, the nausea reported by the participant can be&#xD;
      classified as &quot;acute nausea.&quot; Additionally, it will be documented as to if the subject&#xD;
      required any antiemetics in addition to what was planned and ordered per the standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 72 hours post-discharge, a member of the study team will call the participant&#xD;
      again at their preferred time of day. The survey questions will be exactly the same as the&#xD;
      first phone call. At this time point, it will be possible to evaluate &quot;delayed nausea&quot;&#xD;
      related to chemotherapy. Again, it will be documented as to if the subject required any&#xD;
      antiemetics in addition to what was planned and ordered per the standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be reminded during the call that they will receive a phone call from the&#xD;
      study team prior to their next chemotherapy appointment to remind them to return their used&#xD;
      pocket diffuser for disposal. Returning the used diffuser from the previous cycle will be&#xD;
      helpful to ensure that the subject will not confuse the diffuser from the 1st and 2nd cycles.&#xD;
      Although both diffusers will contain the same thing (ginger essential oil, peppermint&#xD;
      essential oil, or pure vanilla extract), the used diffuser would be less potent as it has&#xD;
      been opened multiple times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact same procedures will be repeated during the participant's next cycle of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, which is likely two or three weeks after the first one.&#xD;
