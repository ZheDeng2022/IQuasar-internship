  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgeries under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are a major treatment for heart valve&#xD;
      disease and coronary artery disease, and over 1-1.25 million such procedures are performed&#xD;
      annually worldwide. These procedures are associated with mortality rates of 0.9-4.0% and&#xD;
      morbidity rates up to 45.9%.The analysis of perioperative risk factors for these adverse&#xD;
      events can provide beneficial help for improving the prognosis of patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.Patients undergoing cardiac surgery under CPB at West China Hospital of Sichuan&#xD;
      University between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2017 and the Second Affiliated Hospital in&#xD;
      the School of Medicine of Zhejiang University between September 1, 2013 and June 30, 2017&#xD;
      will be enrolled,and demographic data, preoperative and intraoperative data, and&#xD;
      postoperative adverse events were collected.Independent perioperative risk factors of death,&#xD;
      organ injury and other adverse events in cardiac surgery patients under CPB were studied by&#xD;
      univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis to provide evidence for prevention&#xD;
      and intervention in clinic.&#xD;

      1. Anesthesia management The standard procedures of anesthesia and CPB in the two&#xD;
           institutions were applied as described (49, 50). Briefly, anesthesia was induced with&#xD;
           midazolam, sufentanil, muscle relaxant and/or etomidate, and maintained by continuous&#xD;
           remifentanil infusion and sevoflurane inhalation, combined with intermittent muscle&#xD;
           relaxant and sufentanil intravenous injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CPB management CPB involved a roll pump, a membrane oxygenator, a filter and connecting&#xD;
           tubes and was primed with colloid solution of 1000 mL and 500 ml crystalline liquid.&#xD;
           During CPB, blood flow was at 2.0-2.4 L/m2/min to maintain mean arterial pressure at&#xD;
           50-80 mmHg. Cold 4:1 blood cardioplegia was used for heart arrest. During CPB,&#xD;
           nasopharyngeal temperature was maintained at 32-340C during these procedures and&#xD;
           moderate hemodilution was used. All patients received an initial heparin dose of 375&#xD;
           U/kg to achieve systemic anticoagulation, and additional heparin was intermittently&#xD;
           injected to maintain activated clotting time longer than 480 s during CPB. After weaning&#xD;
           from CPB, heparin was neutralized with protamine in a 1:1 ratio based on the initial&#xD;
           heparin dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Collection Form (DCF) In order to minimize the role of potential confounders on&#xD;
           adverse outcomes, we will do a systematic search for &quot;risk factor, predictor, adverse&#xD;
           outcome, mortality, morbidity, complications, and cardiac surgery&quot; using EMBASE,&#xD;
           Cochrane and PubMed databases from Jan 1, 2000 to Dec 31, 2015. All the perioperative&#xD;
           potential risk factors mentioned in these studies will be on the DCF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data collection All variables in the DCF will be retrieved from the Hospital Electronic&#xD;
           Medical Record System and medical records. If information on a certain variable cannot&#xD;
           be acquired, it will be recorded as ☒. For example, there may be no record of the&#xD;
           hemoglobin level on the fifth day after surgery, so we will write ☒ in brackets on the&#xD;
           fifth day hemoglobin value.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the data collection is finished, the investigators will sign their names on the&#xD;
           first page of the DCF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data Checking Two supervisors will check data promptly. If data are doubted, they will&#xD;
           send their questions to the first investigator. According to the Schedule of Events, an&#xD;
           &quot;X&quot; will be recorded after the data are confirmed to be correct. Once the whole DCF is&#xD;
           completed, the supervisors sign their names and send the DCF to the statisticians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data Input Data will be input by one statistician using EpiDate3.0 (Odense, Denmark,&#xD;
           http://www.epidata.dk/), and another independent statistician will confirm this&#xD;
           procedure. Then the CRFs will be stored sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Quality control and quality assurance Diagnosis must be performed strictly according to&#xD;
           pre-established definitions. All data in the DCF will be inspected promptly and&#xD;
           correctly in order to guarantee reliability. All procedures in this study will be&#xD;
           performed by two independent researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical analysis Data analysis will be carried out by experienced&#xD;
           biostatisticians.Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies (percentages), and&#xD;
           compared between patient groups using the chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests.&#xD;
           Shapiro-Wilk tests are used to determine the distribution of continuous variables.&#xD;
           Normally distributed data are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and compared&#xD;
           between groups using one-way ANOVA test. Skewed data are expressed as median&#xD;
           [interquartile range (IQR)] and compared between groups using Wilcoxon rank sum tests.&#xD;
           The incidence of complications between groups will be performed with the chi-squared&#xD;
           test or Fisher's exact tests. Logistic regression analysis will be performed to evaluate&#xD;
           risk factors for complications.&#xD;
