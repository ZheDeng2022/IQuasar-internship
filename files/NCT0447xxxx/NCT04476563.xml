  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this multi-center prospective observational study, the investigators plan to identify the&#xD;
      incidence and risk factors for checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury and characterize&#xD;
      biochemical, genetic, immunological, and histological features associated with it.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (ChILI) is a new incompletely understood category&#xD;
      of hepatotoxicity which is distinct from other types of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) such&#xD;
      as direct or idiosyncratic DILI. The data regarding the incidence and risk factors is&#xD;
      lacking. Therefore, 'in-depth phenotyping' together with data from the control group exposed&#xD;
      to checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) is necessary to develop refined algorithms incorporating&#xD;
      CPI-related factors, host genetic and environmental risk factors that would enable&#xD;
      pre-empting ChILI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to enroll two deeply phenotyped cohorts (patients who developed ChILI&#xD;
      and patients who are starting checkpoint inhibitors) and obtain biological samples at&#xD;
      multiple time points.&#xD;
