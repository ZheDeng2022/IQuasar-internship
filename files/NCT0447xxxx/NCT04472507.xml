  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual Reality (VR) is technology that simulates an immersive 3 dimensional environment for&#xD;
      the user and is often used for immersive gaming experiences. The investigators will use VR in&#xD;
      children who undergo painful procedures such as blood sampling and cannulation to investigate&#xD;
      if VR reduces pain. The study will be carried out in 32 children admitted to the Royal&#xD;
      Manchester Children in the UK and will assess feasbility of use VR, child and parent reported&#xD;
      pain and therefore generate pilot data. This data will be used to design larger randomised&#xD;
      control studies.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct initial acceptability/feasibility testing of VRH use with children undergoing&#xD;
           venepuncture or cannulation in an acute, often unplanned inpatient setting in a&#xD;
           children's hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess level of child and parent reported pain during procedure as well as change in&#xD;
           heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Generate pilot data to design software and develop methods, outcome measures and&#xD;
           patient/family engagement for a large randomised control trial (RCT) in the same setting&#xD;
           to establish efficacy of VRH in reduction of perceived pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perceived and reported pain/anxiety scores for children undergoing venepuncture or&#xD;
           cannulation with VRH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in heart rate before, during and after painful procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinicians' feedback on the use of VRH in inpatient painful procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN and METHODS of DATA COLLECTION AND DATA ANALYIS Practitioners will be encouraged&#xD;
      to contact the research team each time they are to perform a procedure between 0830H and&#xD;
      1600H and, unless already with another child using VRH, the research team will come to speak&#xD;
      to parents to consent to the study. If consent is obtained then the procedure will be&#xD;
      performed using current standard care as well as use of a VRH. The Oculus Go is a cheap and&#xD;
      quick to set up headset. Off the shelf software will be selected that will distract but not&#xD;
      require the movement of both arms. Software such as The Blu, Ocean Rift and Pet lab will be&#xD;
      selected, dependent upon the age of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRH will be brought to the room planned for procedure and set up for the child as part of the&#xD;
      preparation for venepuncture/cannulation. Prior to application of VRH children will be asked&#xD;
      to score their current pain score using the Wong Baker Faces Score (WBFS)1. This will be&#xD;
      transcribed by the researcher. VRH use will be commenced at least 3 minutes prior to&#xD;
      commencement of painful procedure. The procedure will then be performed by the practitioner&#xD;
      and VRH supervised by parent(s). The researcher will not participate in the procedure beyond&#xD;
      initial setup of the VRH to ensure real world feasibility is being tested for. Once the&#xD;
      procedure is completed, the child will be allowed to continue using the VRH while clinicians&#xD;
      and parents involved in the procedure fill in the feedback forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback forms for parents will focus on perceived pain score and short qualitative review&#xD;
      regarding acceptability, whether they would consider repeat application at subsequent&#xD;
      venepuncture procedures, if VRH was well tolerated and whether they felt it helped. Feedback&#xD;
      from clinicians will focus on ease of use of VRH, if they felt it facilitated procedure or&#xD;
      whether it was felt to prolong the procedure. Forms will be filled in by parents and&#xD;
      clinicians themselves and then handed to the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will then have the VRH removed and be asked to score their current pain again using&#xD;
      the WBFS. Children's WBFS will be compared pre and post procedure. Assessment of&#xD;
      acceptability/feasibility for children will be based on 3 questions - 1. Do they like it, 2.&#xD;
      Was VRH wear comfortable and 3. Did they feel unwell whilst wearing VRH. Questionnaire&#xD;
      answers will also be used to design future trials and bespoke VR software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will then be pseudonymised and transcribed on to a secure computer for&#xD;
      analysis of data. Interpretation of data will be performed by the clinical research team. Any&#xD;
      statistical analysis required will be performed using SPSS Statistics 25 on pseydonymised&#xD;
      datasets. Paper questionnaires will be kept in a locked drawer, in a locked room, on a locked&#xD;
      research unit where access is only via swipe card. Access to paper questionnaires and digital&#xD;
      data will only be for the immediate clinical research team of Professor Banerjee and Dr&#xD;
      Worth.&#xD;

&#xD;
      STUDY SETTING The study will be performed on all paediatric inpatient wards at Royal&#xD;
      Manchester Hospital. The research team will be based on the CCRF (Children's Clinical&#xD;
      Research Facility) and will move to each ward as required to provide VRH for procedures.&#xD;
      Participants will be accessed via identification by clinicians performing painful procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Royal Manchester Children's Hospital is the busiest children's hospital in the UK.&#xD;
      Venepuncture and cannulation are routinely performed by a wide variety of staff including&#xD;
      doctors, nurses and the IV access team. It is therefore an ideal location to conduct this&#xD;
      study. Participants will undergo recruitment, discussion with the research team, consent and&#xD;
      procedure all in the same location within Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. Participation&#xD;
      in the study will not impact upon patient care and will not require patients or parents to&#xD;
      move anywhere or do anything they would not already be doing as part of their inpatient stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Any child of age 5-12 years who are an inpatient in Royal Manchester&#xD;
      Children's Hospital over a 4 week study period will be considered for consent if they require&#xD;
      venepuncture or cannulation for a medical reason as determined by their lead medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals will be considered for inclusion in this study regardless of age, disability,&#xD;
      gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion&#xD;
      and belief, sex, and sexual orientation except where the study inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria EXPLICITLY state otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Children under the age of 5 years (may not fit the headset, may become&#xD;
      upset) and over the age of 12 years (pubertal, more mature understanding and expectations)&#xD;
      will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children not needed venepuncture or cannulation will not be invited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who have worn VRH previously and recognise dizziness/sickness or other ill health&#xD;
      symptoms will not be asked to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent/ guardians of children who are unsure about VRH will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will not be excluded if their first language is not English. As far as possible a&#xD;
      translator will be arranged to translate child/parent responses and give feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size of sample For this feasibility study, the investigators aim to recruit 32 children&#xD;
      during a 4 week period. Using the primary outcome acceptability of patient use, 32 children&#xD;
      will enable us to identify our acceptability target of 75% of patients with 95% CI 56.6-88.5%&#xD;
      (Clopper-Pearson exact). This number will also provide meaningful representation of a spread&#xD;
      of gender, age groups, complexity of underlying illness, cultural and ethnic backgrounds to&#xD;
      design future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The study will be advertised a month and two weeks prior to the start via email&#xD;
      targeting all doctors, IV practitioners and nurses within Royal Manchester Children's&#xD;
      Hospital informing them of the availability of VRH headsets for distraction during&#xD;
      venepuncture/cannulation. Posters detailing similar information will be distributed across&#xD;
      all paediatric wards and in treatment rooms. Information will also be available on the trust&#xD;
      intranet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Informed consent will be taken from parents of patients recruited to the study. Both&#xD;
      patients and parents will be given a written information sheet to read prior to consent. Once&#xD;
      they have read this they will have the opportunity to ask any questions of the research team.&#xD;
      If they agree to take part then parents will be asked to sign a consent form. Children will&#xD;
      be given the option to sign an assent form if they wish but this will not be compulsory.&#xD;
