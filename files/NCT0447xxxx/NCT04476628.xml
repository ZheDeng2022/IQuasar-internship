  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of intranasal budesonide administration with&#xD;
      lying head back position and a 5 mins time to release of medication (5MR) compared to 1 min&#xD;
      time to release (1MR) in chronic rhinosinusitis patients (CRS). Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to administer via mucosal automatization device (MAD) with either of the two&#xD;
      treatment approaches daily for 5 to 7 days per week and 8 weeks total. This is a crossover&#xD;
      study design so each participants will be placed in the other treatment approach for an&#xD;
      additional 8 weeks of treatment. Moreover, there will be a &quot;washout&quot; of 2 weeks after&#xD;
      baseline assessment and before the first treatment, as well as a second &quot;washout&quot; of 2 weeks&#xD;
      between the two treatment approaches. The participants will also complete study related&#xD;
      procedures such as endoscopic evaluation, cultures, and two questionnaires throughout the&#xD;
      study period. The investigators hypothesize that Budesonide delivered to the sinuses with a 5&#xD;
      minute time to release of medication will be more effective at decreasing inflammation when&#xD;
      compared to a 1 minute time to release of medication after administration.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the efficacy of 1 minute versus 5 minutes time to release of budesonide with lying&#xD;
      head back position following administration via mucosal atomization device (MAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Budesonide delivered to the sinuses with lying head back position and a 5 minute time to&#xD;
      release (5MR) of medication will be more effective at decreasing inflammation both&#xD;
      objectively and subjectively when compared to 1 minute time to release (1MR) of medication&#xD;
      after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and Follow-up Visits Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be obtained from each participant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Demographic Data: Age, sex, smoking status, CRS subtype, pre-existing comorbidities,&#xD;
      history of asthma, history of previous surgery, history of previous medications including&#xD;
      oral and inhaled corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data: Modified Lund-Kennedy (MLK) scores, sinonasal cultures, Sino-nasal Outcome&#xD;
      Test-22 (SNOT-22), EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) scores, and culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a single blind randomized, controlled crossover study at of 20 weeks in&#xD;
      duration. Participants who have CRS and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a 2 week &quot;washout&quot; period before starting their respective&#xD;
      administration method. The first administration methods will be once daily for 8 weeks in&#xD;
      duration. This is then followed by an additional &quot;washout&quot; period of 2 weeks. Finally,&#xD;
      participants will switch to the other administration method for an additional treatment&#xD;
      duration of daily application for 8 weeks. The goal is to assess which administration method&#xD;
      is more effective. Participants will be asked to administer budesonide daily with a minimum&#xD;
      requirement of at least five days a week to ensure changes seen are related to the&#xD;
      appropriate treatment arm. The &quot;washout&quot; period will involve standard of care daily&#xD;
      non-medicated intranasal saline irrigation. Data will be collected at baseline, 2 weeks, 10&#xD;
      weeks, 12 weeks, and lastly 20 weeks follow-up visit. SNOT-22 questionnaires, EQ-5D-5L&#xD;
      questionnaires, endoscopic evaluation, and Modified Lund Kennedy Scores will each be&#xD;
      completed at baseline and then again at 2 weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks, and 20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrolment in the study, participants will be randomly divided to either start with 5MR&#xD;
      or 1MR administration methods through 1:1 block randomization. In addition, demographic data&#xD;
      and clinical data will be obtained by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of Patient Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical care remains the same for participants participating in this study; however,&#xD;
      there is a possibility that some participants will experience an increased frequency of&#xD;
      visits to the clinic with some being spaced 2 weeks apart. The increased appointments are&#xD;
      required to effectively transition each participants into the different treatment types and&#xD;
      also to acquire additional outcome measures. This will be clearly explained to each&#xD;
      participant to ensure that they are aware of the additional appointments compared to standard&#xD;
      of care. Otherwise, there are no additional risks imposed on the study participants.&#xD;
      Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. Participants who meet any&#xD;
      of the exclusion criteria that were not noted at the beginning of the study will be removed&#xD;
      from this study and the physician will discuss the future management options with the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recruitment goal of 60 participants (30 participants per study arm) is expected to&#xD;
      demonstrate an effect for the study. To account for a drop-out rate of 25% the investigators&#xD;
      plan to recruit 40 participants in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The washout periods included in the crossover study design will allow for more control in&#xD;
      regards to reducing confounding variables. In particular, this allows participants to start&#xD;
      at a similar baseline by using the same standard of treatment with Budesonide for the 2 weeks&#xD;
      of washout before going into the 5MR or 1MR treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the baseline characteristic data and the data&#xD;
      from the administered surveys and objective findings of cultures and MLK scores. In addition,&#xD;
      rigorous statistical analysis will be conducted on the Likert scale-based SNOT-22 and&#xD;
      EQ-5D-5L surveys. These analyses will include paired t tests with repeated measured ANOVA for&#xD;
      validation and confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who experience signs and symptoms of budesonide reaction will be noted and the&#xD;
      code will be broken so that a discussion can occur between the research supervisor and the&#xD;
      participants regarding the use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All expected and unexpected adverse events will be recorded and graded by the research&#xD;
      supervisor. Stable chronic conditions, which are present prior to the clinical trial entry&#xD;
      and do not worsen, are not considered adverse events and will be accounted for in the&#xD;
      participant's medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each participant visit, the research supervisor will ask appropriate questions and&#xD;
      perform a physical exam to elicit any adverse events. The research supervisor will also&#xD;
      review any relevant clinical data and laboratory investigations with the partcicpant. All&#xD;
      reportable adverse events will be recorded on appropriate case report form. The research&#xD;
      supervisor will also write the stop date, the severity of the AE and his judgment of the AE's&#xD;
      relationship to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as an AE meeting one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Death occurring between Day 0 and 182 days (6 months) of the study. Life Threatening Event&#xD;
      (defined as a participant at immediate risk of death at the time of the event) In-participant&#xD;
      hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization between Day 0 and 42 of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity In the event of SAE, the&#xD;
      research supervisor will discuss with the partcipant (or next of kin) whether there is a&#xD;
      relationship between the study and the SAE. If there is a relationship, the PI will be&#xD;
      responsible for coordinating care for the participant until the SAE has been addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy During the Trial Participants will be responsible for determining if they are&#xD;
      pregnant or become pregnant during the study. If participants notify the PI they are&#xD;
      pregnant, they will be removed from the study and the medical management options will be&#xD;
      discussed.&#xD;
