  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiological and structural features of premature infants differ from mature newborns.&#xD;
      Families worry about touching their very sensitive and fragile babies, which are quite&#xD;
      different from their expectations, and they seriously concern about how they will take care&#xD;
      of their babies who are cared for by the specialist staff at the hospital when they are&#xD;
      discharged to home. Different approaches and models are applied in the Neonatal Intensive&#xD;
      Care Units (NICU) to prepare families, especially mothers, for the discharge process and to&#xD;
      overcome these fears of the parents. However, most of the time, investigators observe in both&#xD;
      researches and units that these approaches are not efficient. In this study, which&#xD;
      investigators started with the questions as &quot;What can investigators do better in this issue?&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;How can investigators help families more in this process?&quot;, investigator have seen that&#xD;
      Family Integrated Care (FICare) model is applied in some clinics abroad and successful&#xD;
      results have been obtained. However, investigators did not come across a study that applied&#xD;
      this model and examined the effect of it on parents on being ready for discharge. Since this&#xD;
      study will be a first in terms of both this aspect and the application of this model in our&#xD;
      country, in this unique study, investigators aim to draw attention to this approach in our&#xD;
      country, also contribute to keeping the premature babies healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Family Integrated Care Model is not an effective method for parents to be ready for&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Family Integrated Care Model can be applied in NICU. H2: Family Integrated Care Model&#xD;
      positively affects parents' readiness for discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The Family Integrated Care (FICare) model is a modern approach that supports the&#xD;
      participation of parents (excluding ventilation, monitor adjustments, vascular fluid and drug&#xD;
      administration) developed in collaboration between parents and healthcare professionals,&#xD;
      which is carried out gradually in the NICU (1). Parents are informed about the general&#xD;
      development of the baby, brain and sensory development, motor and behavior development, care&#xD;
      of the premature. In addition, parents are informed about what they can do about general body&#xD;
      cleaning and care, especially in touch, attachment, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding and&#xD;
      increased breast milk and diaper change (2).FICare; It is a care model with a 25% increase in&#xD;
      the weight gain of premature babies, a 80% increase in breastfeeding rate, a 25% decrease in&#xD;
      parental stress, a significant decrease in critical incident reports such as hospital&#xD;
      infection and sudden infant death (3). The care that these babies receive in their first&#xD;
      hours, days, weeks and months is vital to determine their future health and long-term&#xD;
      outcomes. Evidence suggests that if parents are supported and encouraged to take care of&#xD;
      their babies while in hospital, this will have better outcomes for both the baby and their&#xD;
      family. FICare support not only reduces the length of hospital stay of parents, but also&#xD;
      reduces the rate of re-hospitalization, and strengthens the bond between parents and babies.&#xD;
      It helps parents feel safer when taking care of their babies, both in the hospital and at&#xD;
      home (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard care model for discharge preparation is not applied to parents who have a&#xD;
      premature baby in their NICU. Institutions make the decision to discharge with the opinions&#xD;
      of the doctor and nurse working in the unit. With the FICare model, it is thought that&#xD;
      parents will be prepared for discharge, bonding between parents and babies, fulfilling their&#xD;
      parental roles, supporting babies' breastfeeding, reducing hospital stay, enhancing&#xD;
      parental-employee communication, and increasing the quality of care services..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This research is a randomized controlled experimental study. The data of the research&#xD;
      will be carried out between 01.08.2020-01.05.2021 with the parents of the premature babies in&#xD;
      accordance with the inclusion criteria in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health University Education and Research Hospital. The sample of the study was calculated in&#xD;
      accordance with the intervention group selection criteria and by performing power analysis.&#xD;
      Power analysis was performed using G * Power (v3.1.7) program in order to determine sample&#xD;
      size. The effect range value was taken as 0.70 as the method used in cases where it is&#xD;
      unknown how many units difference is significant between the groups. In cases where Type 1&#xD;
      error probability (Î±) was 0.05 (at a confidence level of 95%), at a power level of 80% and&#xD;
      the effect range was 0.70, the study was planned with a total of 68 mothers, including 34&#xD;
      mothers women for each group. It will be ensured that the mothers to be assigned to the study&#xD;
      and control groups show similarity in terms of two factors (age, education level). People&#xD;
      will be assigned to groups with simple random sampling. The sample of the study will randomly&#xD;
      allocated into two groups: the FICare model will be applied to the intervention group, and&#xD;
      the other group, which was the control group, will be followed in the routine maintenance of&#xD;
      the service. Since the Family Integrated Care model will be given by researchers and baby&#xD;
      nurses trained in this subject, single blind (researchers are not blind) randomization will&#xD;
      be provided. The statistician was also blinded for the data analysis purpose. In the data&#xD;
      collection tools, investigators would use the &quot;Parental Identification Information Form&quot;&#xD;
      containing the sociodemographic characteristics of the family, the &quot;Newborn Identification&#xD;
      Information Form containing the characteristic features of the babies&quot; and the&#xD;
      readiness-ready scales prepared for mother and father, with validity and reliability studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FICare trainings will be given to the parents in the study group, and the parents will&#xD;
      experience their care (sub-care, skin care, bath etc.) applications on the model and then on&#xD;
      their babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no intervention to the control group and the routine care and discharge process&#xD;
      of the clinic will be applied. The questionnaire will be applied to both groups in the first&#xD;
      24 hours of the baby's hospitalization, and the same questionnaire will be applied 24 hours&#xD;
      before the discharge plan. The results of the two surveys will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis in Data Evaluation will be done using Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS) software. For normality, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test will be used. In&#xD;
      order to determine whether there are differences in dependent variables according to&#xD;
      independent variables, independent group t-test will be used if the distribution is normal,&#xD;
      and if the distribution is not in normal percentages, Mann Whitney-U test will be used.&#xD;
      Results will be evaluated at 95% confidence interval and significance at p &lt;0.05 level&#xD;
