      The main purpose of this research study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      SX-682 in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma who have completed at least 16 weeks of first line chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
      without evidence of disease progression.&#xD;

      In this study the investigator would like to better understand the maximum tolerable dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of SX-682 in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma who have completed at least 16 weeks of first line chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
      without evidence of disease progression. In addition, the investigator would like to measure&#xD;
      the SX-682 pharmacokinetic data in humans. The investigator would also like to assess the&#xD;
      immunophenotypic and stromal changes to the tumor microenvironment after treatment.&#xD;

        interpretation of study results. Specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with active, non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;

             replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of&#xD;
             active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of other investigational drugs (drugs not marketed for any indication) or&#xD;
