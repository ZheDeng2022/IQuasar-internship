  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-dose, open-label, randomized, three-period, three-way crossover&#xD;
      study in which healthy adult participants will receive three separate single-dose&#xD;
      administrations of ASTX660 capsules under three different conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants receiving Treatment A (fasting) will be dosed after having fasted overnight for&#xD;
      at least 10 hours. Participants receiving Treatment B (fed; high-fat/high-calorie meal) will&#xD;
      fast overnight for at least 10 hours then consume a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      standard high-fat, high-calorie breakfast beginning 30 minutes before dosing. Participants&#xD;
      receiving Treatment C (fed; low-fat/low-calorie meal) will fast overnight for at least 10&#xD;
      hours then consume an FDA standard low-fat, low-calorie breakfast beginning 30 minutes before&#xD;
      dosing. The duration of the study is expected to be approximately 47 days.&#xD;

             broccoli, Brussels sprouts, pomegranate, star fruit, char-grilled meat, or&#xD;
             caffeine/xanthine from 48 hours before the first dose of study medication until the&#xD;
             end-of-study visit. Participants will be instructed not to consume any of the above&#xD;
             products; however, allowance for an isolated single incidental consumption may be&#xD;
             evaluated and approved by the study Investigator based on the potential for&#xD;
             interaction with the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has any prior history of substance abuse or treatment (including alcohol).&#xD;
