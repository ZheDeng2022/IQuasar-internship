  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there have been no Canadian led neoadjuvant or peri-operative trials, this&#xD;
      multicentre design gives the opportunity to build more experience with this strategy across&#xD;
      Canada in more institutions. The design of this prospective trial will also test our&#xD;
      important hypotheses regarding the use of biomarkers to understand the benefit of mFFX in&#xD;
      improving outcomes for patients with resectable pancreas cancer. Data from this study would&#xD;
      likely inform future studies where patients are given personalised options for the best&#xD;
      treatment strategies rather than one empiric approach.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a histological diagnosis of PDAC. Those with unconfirmed histology must&#xD;
             have this confirmed by EUS-FNB in the pre-screening period prior to commencement of&#xD;
             chemotherapy. Invasive PDAC in the setting of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm&#xD;
             (IPMN) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must consent to EUS-FNB for correlative analysis even if adenocarcinoma has&#xD;
             been confirmed, unless confirmation was performed using a previous biopsy or fine&#xD;
             needle biopsy with adequate tumour tissue for GATA6 analysis.&#xD;

             period and a negative pregnancy test) must agree to use two medically acceptable&#xD;
             methods of contraception (one for the patient and one for their partner) during the&#xD;

             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another primary cancer within the last 3 years with the exception of&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer, early stage prostate cancer or curatively treated cervical&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ or other indolent malignancy (discretion of PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients are excluded from this study as the chemotherapy&#xD;
             agents used in this study have been demonstrated or have the potential to be&#xD;
             teratogenic and there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being therapeutically anticoagulated with coumadin and cannot have an&#xD;
