    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of the multi-drug&#xD;
      combination of abiraterone, cabozantinib, and nivolumab in conjunction with ongoing androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy in previously untreated metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that the combination of cabozantinib and abiraterone&#xD;
      acetate/prednisone in conjunction with nivolumab will have an acceptable safety profile and&#xD;
      will be feasible to administer in patients with hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Protocol defined hematologic DLTs that occur during the first cycle that are attributed as possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment&#xD;
Protocol defined non-hematologic DLTs possibly, probably, or definitely related grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity that occurs during the first cycle of treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PSA response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Through end of treatment (estimated to be 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-PSA response rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who have PSA response as defined by at least 50% decline in PSA level from baseline measured twice at least 3 weeks apart. Based on the PCWG3 criteria, a favorable effect on PSA may be delayed for ≥ 12 weeks. Therefore, early rises in PSA before 12 weeks will not be considered when determining PSA response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through end of treatment (estimated to be 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment through 1 year of follow-up (estimated to be 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-Defined as time of enrollment to time of death from any cause</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment through 1 year of follow-up (estimated to be 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of first PCWG3 defined progression or death, the event that occurs first. Patients who have not experienced either event at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of their last progression assessment.&#xD;
For rising PSA after an initial decline from baseline, the PSA is recorded from the start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2ng/mL above the nadir, which is confirmed by a second value 4 or more weeks later, confirming a rising trend. If there is no initial decline from baseline, PSA progression is defined as ≥ 25% increase and ≥ 2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 weeks.</description>
