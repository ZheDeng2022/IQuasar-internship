  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The opioid epidemic has had a tremendous negative impact on the health of persons in the U.S.&#xD;
      The objective of the trial 1 of Application of Economics &amp; Social psychology to improve&#xD;
      Opioid Prescribing Safety (AESOPS-T1), is to discourage unnecessary opioid prescribing&#xD;
      through the application of &quot;behavioral insights&quot;-empirically-tested social and psychological&#xD;
      interventions that affect choice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multisite study, AESOPS-T1 randomizes clinics to behavioral intervention or control.&#xD;
      Clinics randomized to the behavioral intervention arm receive electronic health record&#xD;
      (EHR)-based nudges. Eligible participants are clinicians who practice ambulatory primary care&#xD;
      at the participating clinical sites in Illinois and California. At the time of opioid&#xD;
      prescribing, clinicians in clinics randomized to the intervention group will be prompted with&#xD;
      an EHR nudge when the prescribing history for the patient falls into one of the following&#xD;
      three mutually exclusive categories: Opioid naïve, At-risk for long-term use, or Long-term&#xD;
      opioid recipient. These EHR-based nudges include accountable justification, defaults and&#xD;
      precommitments. The control arm receives no EHR-based intervention. Both arms receive&#xD;
      guideline education. The primary outcome is the change in clinician aggregate weekly&#xD;
      milligram morphine equivalent (MME) dose and the secondary outcome is the proportion of&#xD;
      dosages that equal or exceed 50 MME per day. These outcomes will be estimated by treatment&#xD;
      arm with an intent-to-treat difference-in-differences framework using a mixed-effects&#xD;
      regression model on clinician MME daily dose. The intervention period will be 18-months, with&#xD;
      a 6-month follow-up period to measure the persistence of effects after the interventions&#xD;
      conclude.&#xD;

    <description>Clinicians in clinics randomized to the intervention group will be prompted with an EHR nudge when the prescribing history for the patient falls into one of the following three categories: Opioid naïve, At-risk for long-term use, or Long-term opioid recipient. These EHR-based nudges include elements of accountable justification, defaults and precommitments. Clinicians will also receive web-based guideline education, consisting of an online educational module at the start of the study period. This will include educational clinical content related to the CDC guidelines, the Oregon Pain Guidance document, tapering training and other resources such as Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Medication-Assisted Treatment Physician Locator and the Naloxone Provider Guide.</description>
