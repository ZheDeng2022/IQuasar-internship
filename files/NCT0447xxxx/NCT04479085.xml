      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of nursing intervention to regulate the&#xD;
      home environment on symptom control and quality of life in children with allergic rhinitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a clinical picture resulting from one or more allergen&#xD;
      sensitivities. Seasonal AR develops due to grass, tree and grass pollen. Prennial AR develops&#xD;
      due to house dust mite, cockroaches, mold and pets.The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in&#xD;
      children ranges from 19.3-50.8%. AR affects school performance, sleep patterns and quality of&#xD;
      life in children.Children spend most of their lives in the home environment, and many studies&#xD;
      have shown that AR is associated with the home environment in children. Control measures&#xD;
      should be taken in patients' homes to prevent and reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in&#xD;
      children. Awareness and education should be provided to families and children about the&#xD;
      importance of these measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pretest-posttest, parelel group, randomized controlled study study to examine&#xD;
      the effect of nursing intervention to regulate the home environment on symptom control and&#xD;
      quality of life in children with allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sample of the study; The effect size was intended to be medium effect size due to the absence&#xD;
      of a similar randomized controlled study to determine the quality of life in children with&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis. In the study, the number of samples to be included in the study with 0.7&#xD;
      medium effect size, power 80%, alpha reliability level 95%, 26 experiments and 26 controls&#xD;
      were calculated as 52 children and their mothers. Considering the 20% loss that may occur in&#xD;
      the study, it was decided to include 62 children and their mothers in the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized appointments were made in the appointment of 62 children and mothers who were&#xD;
      followed up with the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, who included the criteria for inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion, and who volunteered to participate in the study. Stratified randomization&#xD;
      method was used in this study. Stratified randomization method was used in this study. The&#xD;
      gender of the children (girls and boys), the age of the children (6-9 years, 10-12 years) and&#xD;
      the level of mother education (primary education, high school, university) were determined as&#xD;
      prognastic factors for stratification. Randomization was performed in a total of 62&#xD;
      participants, 31 experimental and 31 control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Group Inclusion Criteria The child is diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, 6-12 age group&#xD;
      children and their mothers, The child's sensitivity to at least one of Dermatophagoides&#xD;
      pteronyssinus and/or dermatophagoides farinae according to the skin prick test. Although&#xD;
      sensitive to at least one of the house dust mites Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and / or&#xD;
      Dermatophagoides farinae according to the child's skin pric test; The child has mold allergy&#xD;
      according to the skin prick test, The child is allergic to cockroaches according to the skin&#xD;
      prick test, The child has any of the cat and dog allergies according to the skin prick test,&#xD;
      The child and his mother live in the city center Volunteering to participate in the research&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools; &quot;Mother and Family, Child and Disease, Home Environment Information&#xD;
      Form&quot;, &quot;Home Environment Assessment Form&quot;, &quot;Quality of Life Questionnaire for 6-12 Years Old&#xD;
      Children with Allergy in Nose and Eyes (pediatric rinitis quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
      PRQLQ)&quot;, &quot;Symptom Diary&quot;,&quot;Humidity and Temperature Measurement &quot;Diary&quot; will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number, percentage, average and standard deviation will be used in the evaluation of the&#xD;
      descriptive data obtained from the research; Significance will be evaluated within 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval, p &lt;0.05 will be taken. For the implementation of the study, permission&#xD;
      was obtained from the ethics committee of Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Medical Faculty,&#xD;
      Non-Drug and Medical Device Research Ethics Committee, and work permit was obtained from&#xD;
      Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Medical Faculty Hospital Chief Physician. Patients&#xD;
      included in the study sample will be informed before the study that the purpose of the study&#xD;
      and participation in the study is in line with the principle of volunteering and &quot;Informing&#xD;
      and Consent of Volunteers Consent Form&quot; will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      implementation of the research The nursing attempt to organize the home environment for the&#xD;
      experimental group will take 4 months. During this period, two home visits and two telephone&#xD;
      calls will be made. During the first home visit, training will be organized to regulate the&#xD;
      home environment, as well as a heat-moisture meter and anti-allergic duvet cover set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two home visits to the control group. During the first home visit, a&#xD;
      heat-humidity meter device will be given. Data collection forms will be applied at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of the study.training will be organized at the end of the study.&#xD;
