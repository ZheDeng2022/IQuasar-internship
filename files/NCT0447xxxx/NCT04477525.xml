    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study to assess the effectiveness of erector spinae (ESP) nerve blocks&#xD;
      for postoperative pain control following bariatric surgery. Currently, there are mainly case&#xD;
      series/pilot studies describing the use of ESP nerve blocks for postoperative pain control in&#xD;
      abdominal procedures; of these only one uses this treatment modality for bariatric&#xD;
      procedures. The population undergoing bariatric surgery poses specific challenges to&#xD;
      postoperative pain management. They often have comorbid obstructive sleep apnea, which puts&#xD;
      them at greater risk for ventilatory depression when treated with parenteral opioids. This&#xD;
      risk can be reduced with regional techniques. The ESP nerve blocks provide visceral and&#xD;
      somatic pain coverage as opposed to the more commonplace transversus abdominis plane nerve&#xD;
      block which only provides somatic coverage. This means that the ESP nerve blocks will cover&#xD;
      incisional pain as well as the discomfort associated with the pain from the procedure itself.&#xD;
      This study intends to build on current knowledge by proving that the use of ESP in the&#xD;
      post-operative are providing a significant reduction in pain scores as well as reducing the&#xD;
      need for parenteral opioids. Thus, decreasing the risk of postoperative ventilatory&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for this study, three pilot studies were reviewed. The studies assessed the&#xD;
      usefulness of ESP nerve blocks on patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Single-shot&#xD;
      bilateral ESP blocks were performed in the first two studies. One of the studies, patients&#xD;
      undergoing ventral hernia repair and the other for patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The&#xD;
      third pilot study used bilateral ESP blocks followed by a continuous infusion on one patient&#xD;
      undergoing an open prostatectomy with bladder reconstruction. All the ESP blocks were placed&#xD;
      preoperatively at the T7 transverse process. In the studies using a single shot technique&#xD;
      20-30 ml of ropivacaine 0.5% was used. For the continuous ESP catheter an initial bolus of&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.25% 10 mls followed by continuous infusion rate of 6 ml/hr bilaterally. All&#xD;
      showed a significant reduction numerical rating scale (NRS) as a primary outcome. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome of reduced 24-hour parenteral opioid consumption was also achieved by all&#xD;
      three studies.&#xD;

    <description>The planned intervention is a bilateral erector spinae nerve block for patients undergoing bariatric surgery. This intervention will be performed in the PACU for patients with an NRS pain score &gt;5. All eligible candidates who have consented for this study will be present in the PACU, have all standard ASA monitoring placed. The patient will then be placed in a sitting position. The patient will then be prepped with chlorhexidine in the thoracic region and draped in a sterile fashion. The ultrasound will be brought in over the patient and the T7 Transverse Processes (TP) will be identified. An echogenic needle will be placed under direct ultrasound guidance on the TP. Then, 20 cc of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected.</description>
