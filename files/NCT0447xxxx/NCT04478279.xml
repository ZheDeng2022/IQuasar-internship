  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-part, phase 1-2 dose-finding study designed to determine the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and proof-of-concept efficacy of ST101 administered IV in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors. The study consists of two phases: a phase 1 dose&#xD;
      escalation/regimen exploration phase and a phase 2 expansion phase.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose escalation / regimen exploration phase During the dose escalation/regimen exploration&#xD;
      phase, only patients diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, carcinoma or&#xD;
      sarcoma of any tumor type who are refractory or intolerant to all available therapies that&#xD;
      would impact survival will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ST101 will be administered intravenously (IV), initially once per week. The dose escalation&#xD;
      cohorts will be recruited using a standard 3+3 design. At each new dosing cohort, there will&#xD;
      be a 1-week observation period after dosing the first patient in order to assess safety prior&#xD;
      to dosing the remainder of the patients in that cohort. The dose cohorts will be 0.5, 1, 2,&#xD;
      4, 8 and 16 mg/kg with once weekly (QW) dosing in all cohorts except for the highest dose&#xD;
      level which will be dosed every other week (Q2W).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion phase consists of 4 specific tumor-type cohorts, which each follow the same&#xD;
      Simon 2-stage design. Fifteen (15) patients will be enrolled in each cohort and treated with&#xD;
      the ST101 RP2D. If one or more responses is observed that cohort will be expanded to a total&#xD;
      of 30 patients to further assess efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responses will be graded using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1&#xD;
      (Eisenhauer 2009) for hormonal receptor positive (HRpos) locally advanced/metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer (LA/MBC) and melanoma, modified response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO)&#xD;
      (Ellingson 2017) for GBM and prostate cancer clinical trials working group 3 (PCWG3) (Scher&#xD;
      2016) for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).During the expansion phase, only&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with the following tumor types will be allowed into this phase of the&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRpos LA/MBC that has progressed after prior 1-2 hormone-based therapies. Previous&#xD;
           treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor, mammalian target of&#xD;
           rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor or chemotherapy is allowed as monotherapy or in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Melanoma that has progressed after/or on treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
           (CPI) and have received 1-2 prior lines of therapy for their advanced/metastatic&#xD;
           disease. Patients that have BRAF mutated disease should also have received one line of&#xD;
           appropriate targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary (de novo) GBM that has recurred or progressed (per modified RANO criteria) after&#xD;
           1 standard treatment regimen. Standard therapy is defined as maximal surgical resection,&#xD;
           radiotherapy, and concomitant temozolomide with radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
           with temozolomide. Patients that undergo tumor treating fields as an adjuvant to first&#xD;
           line therapy are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRPC that has progressed after previous treatment with taxanes, abiraterone and&#xD;
           enzalutamide/apalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor types in the expansion phase may change based on emerging data from the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase of this study. Additional mini cohorts of 10 patients may be added to the&#xD;
      expansion phase based on efficacy signals during the dose escalation phase.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Able and willing to sign informed consent form (ICF) and comply with the protocol&#xD;
                  and the restrictions and assessments therein.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Male or female ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Must have a locally advanced or metastatic inoperable tumor as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. For the dose escalation/regimen exploration phase: melanoma, carcinoma, or&#xD;
                       sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. For the expansion phase: HR positive LA/MBC, melanoma, GBM, CRPC&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Agrees to provide a newly obtained biopsy of an accessible lesion (if they can be&#xD;
                  biopsied based on the investigator's assessment) prior to the start of study&#xD;
                  treatment, and to repeat biopsy once during study treatment. Tissue obtained for&#xD;
                  the biopsy must not be previously irradiated (unless progressing following&#xD;
                  irradiation), but a new or progressing lesion in the radiation field is&#xD;
                  acceptable. Archived biopsies are acceptable for GBM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. In the investigator's opinion, the patient may not derive clinical benefit from,&#xD;
                  or is ineligible for, a particular form of standard therapy on medical grounds,&#xD;
                  or the patient failed or did not tolerate one or more of other anti-cancer&#xD;
                  therapies:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  a. For the dose escalation/regimen exploration phase up to 3 previous lines of&#xD;
                  systemic anticancer therapies are allowed. Since this is a FIH study, it's&#xD;
                  important that patients are not refractory to therapeutic intervention due to&#xD;
                  multiple lines of prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  a. For the expansion phase: i. HRpos LA/MBC must have progressed after prior 1-2&#xD;

                  chemotherapy is allowed as monotherapy or in combination ii. Melanoma that has&#xD;
                  progressed after or on treatment with a CPI and have received 1-2 prior lines of&#xD;
                  therapy for their advanced/metastatic disease. Patients that have BRAF mutated&#xD;
                  disease should also have received one line of appropriate targeted therapy iii.&#xD;
                  Primary (de novo) GBM that has recurred or progressed (per modified RANO&#xD;
                  criteria) after 1 standard treatment regimen (surgery, radiotherapy, and&#xD;
                  temozolomide therapy). Patients that undergo tumor treating fields as an adjuvant&#xD;
                  to first line therapy are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  iv. CRPC that has progressed after previous treatment with taxanes, abiraterone&#xD;
                  and enzalutamide/apalutamide or that are intolerant to these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1, modified RANO or PCWG3 with at least one target&#xD;
                  lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Disease that progressed on, or is non-responsive to, the previous line of therapy&#xD;
                  per RECIST 1.1, modified RANO or PCWG3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. If not menopausal or surgically sterile, willing to practice at least one of the&#xD;
                  following highly effective methods of birth control for at least a (partner's)&#xD;
                  menstrual cycle before and for four months after ST101 administration: (1) total&#xD;
                  abstinence from sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex; (2) sexual&#xD;
                  intercourse with vasectomized male/sterilized female partner; (3) combined&#xD;
                  (estrogen and progestogen containing) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception&#xD;
                  associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, parenteral, transvaginal or&#xD;
                  transdermal) for at least 3 consecutive months prior to investigational product&#xD;
                  administration; (4) other acceptable forms of birth control (condoms,&#xD;
                  contraceptive sponge, diaphragm or vaginal ring with spermicide or cream); (5)&#xD;
                  use of an intrauterine contraceptive device.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. All previous anti-cancer therapy-related adverse events should have resolved to&#xD;
                  grade 1 or baseline value with the exception of alopecia. Levothyroxine is&#xD;
                  allowed for patients that previously received a CPI and experienced thyroid&#xD;
                  dysfunction.&#xD;
