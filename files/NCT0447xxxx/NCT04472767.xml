          -  The effects of cabozantinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation,&#xD;

             treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Based on its mechanism of action, ipilimumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a&#xD;

        treatment with ipilimumab and for 3 months following the last dose of ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Based on its mechanism of action, nivolumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a&#xD;
