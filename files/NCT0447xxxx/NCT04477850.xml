      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm bridging study to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) for the treatment of anemia due to&#xD;
      IPSSR very low, low, or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in Chinese and&#xD;
      Japanese subjects with ring sideroblasts who require RBC transfusions. The study is divided&#xD;
      into the Screening Period, Treatment Period (Primary Phase and Extension Phase) and a&#xD;
