    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well ZEN-3694, enzalutamide, and pembrolizumab work in&#xD;
      treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body (metastatic). ZEN-3694 blocks the expression of the MYC gene to prevent cellular&#xD;
      growth in certain types of tumors, including castrate resistant prostate cancer. Enzalutamide&#xD;
      has been shown to block testosterone from reaching prostate cancer cells by binding to a&#xD;
      receptor on prostate cancer cells, called androgen receptors. This works similar to a lock&#xD;
      and key. When enzalutamide (key) inserts into the androgen receptor (lock) testosterone&#xD;
      cannot attach to the androgen receptor, which slows the growth of tumor cells and may cause&#xD;
      them to shrink. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody (proteins that can protect the body&#xD;
      from foreign organisms, such as bacteria and viruses) designed to block a specific control&#xD;
      switch which may be activated by tumor cells to overcome the body's natural immune system&#xD;
      defenses. It also enhances the activity of the body's immune cells against tumor cells. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to find out the effects ZEN-3694, enzalutamide, and pembrolizumab on&#xD;
      patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have previously experienced&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who had prior disease&#xD;
      progression on at least one second generation androgen signaling inhibitor, including&#xD;
      abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide, and/or enzalutamide and have clinicogenomic evidence&#xD;
      of transdifferentiated mCRPC (Cohort A) or mCRPC without transdifferentiation (Cohort B).&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment in Phase 2 (Cohort A and B), a safety lead-in cohort of 6 patients with&#xD;
      metastatic CRPC will be enrolled. Accrual will proceed to Phase 2 if &lt; 33% of patients (0/6&#xD;
      or 1/6 patients) experiences a dose-limiting toxicity during Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, BET bromodomain&#xD;
      inhibitor ZEN-3694 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and enzalutamide PO QD on days 1-21. Patients&#xD;
      not on enzalutamide prior to study enrollment or have previously discontinued enzalutamide&#xD;
      receive BET bromodomain inhibitor ZEN-3694 beginning on day 1 of cycle 2. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 90 days&#xD;
      until death or study completion or loss to follow-up, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the composite response rate in Cohort A and Cohort B study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate and median duration of response in each study&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the median progression free survival and 6-month progression-free survival&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 50 (PSA50) response proportion in each&#xD;
      study cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the median overall survival of each cohort. V. To determine the safety of&#xD;
      the treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the association between baseline metastatic tumor characteristics including&#xD;
      treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (t-SCNC), androgen receptor (AR),&#xD;
      retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB1) loss, and immune response transcriptional&#xD;
      signatures with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate modulation of AR transcriptional activity, expression of t-SCNC markers, and&#xD;
      immune parameters including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression in evaluable&#xD;
      paired tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the association between baseline and change from baseline in peripheral&#xD;
      blood biomarkers including T cell subsets, T cell repertoire, and inhibitors of bromodomain&#xD;
      extraterminal protein (BETi) whole blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) panel with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the association between baseline or change from baseline in gallium Ga 68&#xD;
      citrate (68Ga-citrate) positron emission tomography (PET) with subsequent clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare efficacy outcomes (composite response, PSA50 response, objective response,&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS)) between cohorts.&#xD;

             metastatic lesion is safely accessible to tumor biopsy, this requirement will be&#xD;
             waived. Bone or soft tissue lesion is allowed, but soft tissue will be prioritized. If&#xD;
             a patient has archival tissue obtained within 90 days of C1D1 the requirement for&#xD;
             fresh tumor biopsy will be waived&#xD;
