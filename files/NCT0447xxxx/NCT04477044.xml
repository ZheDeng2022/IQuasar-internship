      The study team proposes that mounting a point-of-view camera on the student's head will&#xD;
      enable the team to view what the student is seeing in real-time when intubating with a normal&#xD;
      laryngoscope. This will allow the team to guide the students accurately. When used in&#xD;
      conjunction with the established simulation programme in the department, it is believed that&#xD;
      this will improve the learning and retention of this skill when compared to standard&#xD;
      teaching.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ability to correctly perform an endotracheal intubation is a life-saving skill that every&#xD;
      doctor should possess. It is an integral part of established protocols for resuscitation and&#xD;
      advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). It is an essential procedural skill that is taught to&#xD;
      all students at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS. It is also recommended by the&#xD;
      American Association of Medical Colleges as an essential procedural skill for medical&#xD;
      students to learn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timely and correctly performed endotracheal intubation can be life-saving because it&#xD;
      maintains and protects the airway, reliably provides adequate tidal volumes, frees the hands&#xD;
      of rescuers, allows the removal of airway secretions and provides a route for giving drugs.&#xD;
      However, poorly performed endotracheal intubation exposes patients to the life-threatening&#xD;
      risks associated with the unrecognised misplacement of a tracheal tube and leads to delays in&#xD;
      resuscitative efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there is a comparatively high failure rate associated with endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation because this skill is difficult to learn and retain. Mulcaster et al reported&#xD;
      that, to achieve a 90% intubation success rate, a mean of 47 intubation attempts were&#xD;
      required. In a similar study, Konrad et al found that a mean of 57 attempts were required to&#xD;
      achieve a 90% intubation success rate. This difficulty in learning is compounded by the&#xD;
      finding that, without repeated practice, the ability to perform endotracheal intubation&#xD;
      successfully diminishes rapidly. The intubation success rate of infrequent users who have&#xD;
      successfully learned to intubate has been shown to fall to as little as 57% after only 6&#xD;
      months. Clearly, there is a need to improve the learning and retention of endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI previously published a randomized controlled trial in the journal Medical Education to&#xD;
      study the utility of experiential learning on a simulator in the learning and retention of&#xD;
      this skill. It was showed that with experiential learning, more students were able to&#xD;
      intubate a manikin at 3 months (64.5% vs. 36.9%, p&lt;0.001). With repeated learning (refresher&#xD;
      every 3 months), 86% of students were able to successfully perform endotracheal intubation at&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are limitations to acquiring this skill on a simulator, as it has been argued&#xD;
      that expertise gained on manikins may not translate into successful intubations in patients.&#xD;
      Learning on actual patients is desirable, but impractical given the large number of students&#xD;
      in our medical school. On average, each YLLSoM student only intubates between 3-5 patients,&#xD;
      far less than the 47-57 endotracheal intubations necessary to gain expertise as cited&#xD;
      earlier. Combining the learning experiences on the simulator with that on actual patients&#xD;
      appears to be the best solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is important to optimize the limited learning opportunities on patients.&#xD;
      However, this is often difficult because the mouth is small, and the view of the pharyngeal&#xD;
      structures is limited. The tutor will not be able to view what the student is seeing as there&#xD;
      is only one line of vision. More recently, video-laryngoscopes, which are laryngoscopes with&#xD;
      a camera at its tip, have emerged as an effective means of teaching endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
      However, the technique of using the video-laryngoscope differs from using the common&#xD;
      laryngoscope due to its different shape and the requirement that the student looks at the&#xD;
      screen rather than into the patient's mouth. Hence it is unclear if the ability to&#xD;
      successfully perform endotracheal intubation with a video-laryngoscope necessarily translates&#xD;
      into the ability to perform endotracheal intubation with a normal laryngoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team proposes that mounting a point-of-view camera on the student's head will&#xD;
      enable the team to view what the student is seeing in real-time when intubating with a normal&#xD;
      laryngoscope. This will allow the team to guide the students accurately. When used in&#xD;
      conjunction with the established simulation programme in the department, it is believed that&#xD;
      this will improve the learning and retention of this skill when compared to standard&#xD;
      teaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students will be randomised into 2 groups. For the study group, students will have a GoPro&#xD;
      Hero4 camera mounted on their head which will be linked via Wi-Fi to allow real-time&#xD;
      streaming of the view onto a laptop, while students in control group will have a regular type&#xD;
      of tutorial and practicing session. Data such as time to successful intubation and Cormack&#xD;
      Lehane laryngoscopy view will be recorded. At the end of the session, tutors will use a&#xD;
      debrief guide to give feedback to students. Students from the study group will be given a&#xD;
      questionnaire to be completed at the end of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These students will be recalled 3 months later. Each student will individually be assessed on&#xD;
      his or her intubation skill using 2 different manikin: a normal airway manikin and a&#xD;
      difficult airway manikin. All the students will be wearing the GoPro Hero4 this time round.&#xD;
      Data such as time to successful intubation and Cormack Lehane laryngoscopy view will be&#xD;
      recorded. Students will be given feedback as appropriate by tutors for their learning&#xD;
      purposes using the same debrief guide. There will be questionnaires for both students and&#xD;
      tutors to fill in this time.&#xD;
