  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tear is one of the most common shoulder diseases and conservative treatment is&#xD;
      commonly used for tears involving ≤50% of tendon thickness. Since conventional conservative&#xD;
      treatments are not fundamental to repair tendon tissue, there is a growing need of new&#xD;
      therapy to improve structural outcome. This study assesses the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      allogeneic fibroblasts on partial-thickness rotator cuff tear. The primary outcome is change&#xD;
      in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score at 24 weeks after TPX-115 injection.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include changes from baseline in Visual Analogue Score (VAS) pain score,&#xD;
      functional evaluations including Range of Motion (ROM), Constant Score (CS), ASES score and&#xD;
      Simple Shoulder Test (SST) at 4, 12 and 24 weeks after administration and structural&#xD;
      evaluation using MRI at 24 weeks after injection.&#xD;
