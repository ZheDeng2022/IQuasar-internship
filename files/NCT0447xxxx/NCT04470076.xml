  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recommended adjuvant therapy for stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were&#xD;
      perioperative chemotherapy. The adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early stage lung&#xD;
      cancer improved about 5% 5-year survival. As for advanced NSCLC with epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (EGFR) activating mutation, epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) combination with chemotherapy had improved progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) compared with EGFR-TKI alone. We propose this trial of Neoadjuvant Afatinib Combination&#xD;
      With Chemotherapy for Stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC With EGFR Activating Mutation, which would maximize&#xD;
      benefit early in a patient's treatment course. At the same time, dynamic&#xD;
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) was used to&#xD;
      evaluate the standardized uptake value (SUV) and uptake rate constant (Ki) changes of lesions&#xD;
      before and after treatment, so as to accurately and quantitatively monitor the tumor response&#xD;
      of different therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was worse, with 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate between 26%-60%. The recommended adjuvant therapy for stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC were&#xD;
      adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As for advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation,&#xD;
      EGFR-TKI combination with chemotherapy had improved survival compared with EGFR-TKI alone.&#xD;
      The Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group-1103 (CTONG-1103) trial showed that neoadjuvant erlotinib&#xD;
      has better PFS than neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that neoadjuvant EGFR-TKI combination with chemotherapy for stage&#xD;
      Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation might have better pathological response and&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS) than chemotherapy alone, and maximize benefit early in a&#xD;
      patient's treatment course. At the same time, dynamic 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) was used to evaluate the standardized uptake value (SUV)&#xD;
      and uptake rate constant (Ki) changes of lesions before and after treatment, so as to&#xD;
      accurately and quantitatively monitor the tumor response of different therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Neoadjuvant treatment (chemotherapy+afatinib) will start within 1-3 days from enrollment/randomisation. 3 cycles will be administered at 21-day (+/- 3 days) intervals (QW3) prior to surgery. Before surgery a tumor assessment (including dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT) will be done. Patients must leave the study if there is evidence of progression. Patients with stable disease or partial response may be considered for surgery.&#xD;
Surgery: Surgery must be done within the 3rd-4th week (+7 days) from day 21 cycle 3 of neoadjuvant treatment (day 42-49 after day 1 of cycle 3) Adjuvant treatment (afatinib): Patients that are R0 confirmed by surgical pathology evaluation will receive the first adjuvant administration within the first week (+ 7 days) from surgery and up to 2 years.</description>
