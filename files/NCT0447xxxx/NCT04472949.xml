  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard of care for Extensive-Stage Disease (ED) Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) as first-line&#xD;
      treatment is 4 to 6 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) in&#xD;
      combination with etoposide. However, the outcome of the disease remains poor with a median&#xD;
      overall survival of approximately 10 months, mainly caused by rapid development of drug&#xD;
      resistance. The risk of intrathoracic recurrences can be reduced and an improved 2-year&#xD;
      survival can be achieved with the addition of thoracic radiotherapy (tRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of tRT combined with maintenance&#xD;
      durvalumab in SCLC after chemoimmunotherapy. Secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      tRT combined with maintenance durvalumab in SCLC after chemo-immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this trial durvalumab is the IMP. Patients will start with an induction phase (part 1):&#xD;
      Patients will receive durvalumab in combination with carboplatin and etoposide for 4 cycles&#xD;
      of 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CR; PR or SD after the induction phase, will transfer to the maintenance phase&#xD;
      (part 2): Patients will receive durvalumab treatment up to PD or max. 2 years, i.e. 26&#xD;
      maintenance cycles, in combination with tRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PD after the induction phase will transfer to the follow-up phase: Patients&#xD;
      will be followed up for 24 months, every 8 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with advanced small cell lung cancer is poor. Despite chemotherapy&#xD;
      and immunotherapy, median survival is only 12 months. The trial SAKK 15/19 is investigating&#xD;
      whether thoracic radiotherapy and the administration of durvalumab can slow down the&#xD;
      progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with advanced small cell lung cancer, the standard therapy consists of 4-6 cycles&#xD;
      of platinum-based chemotherapy plus etoposide with or without Atezolizumab. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      median overall survival of these patients is only 10-12 months, because resistance to the&#xD;
      therapy usually develops rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy and maintenance therapy with Durvalumab to activate the immune system The risk&#xD;
      of intrathoracic progression of small cell lung cancer can be reduced by additional thoracic&#xD;
      radiotherapy. It is assumed that the radiation not only has a direct cytotoxic effect on the&#xD;
      tumor cells, but also stimulates an antitumor immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the trial SAKK 15/19, it is being investigated whether the combination of the monoclonal&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab with thoracic radiotherapy in patients with advanced small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer can cause an even stronger activation of the immune system with an improved&#xD;
      antitumoral immune response. The trial therapy (thoracic radiotherapy + durvalumab) is based&#xD;
      on chemo-immunotherapy with carboplatin, etoposide and durvalumab. The primary endpoint of&#xD;
      the trial is the progression-free rate after 12 months, secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      progression-free survival, median overall survival and objective response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Which patients can participate? The trial is open to patients with advanced small-cell lung&#xD;
      cancer who have either metastases (stage IV) or whose lung tumor volume is so large that&#xD;
      radiation therapy with curative intent is not possible as a first-line therapy (stage&#xD;
      III-IV). Patients who have already received systemic therapy or thoracic radiotherapy because&#xD;
      of the small cell lung carcinoma cannot participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the trial is carried out in three phases for patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive four cycles of chemo-immunotherapy with carboplatin,&#xD;
           etoposide and durvalumab. One cycle lasts 21 days. In those patients who show a response&#xD;
           or stable disease situation after completion of induction therapy, maintenance therapy&#xD;
           follows. Maintenance therapy is not performed in patients whose disease has progressed&#xD;
           further under induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance therapy: Thoracic radiotherapy for 2.5-3 weeks (13 fractions of 3 Gray each)&#xD;
           and administration of Durvalumab every 28 days for a maximum of two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up for two years.&#xD;
