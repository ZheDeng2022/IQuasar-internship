  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis causes many disabling symptoms, including fatigue, muscle weakness, and exercise&#xD;
      limitations. Physical activity programs have been shown to improve physical performance and&#xD;
      decrease fatigue in sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate (1) the effect of continuous activity&#xD;
      monitoring using an electronic activity tracker (AT), compared to controls, and (2) the&#xD;
      effect of additional personal coaching on exercise performance and fatigue of sarcoidosis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This prospective, randomized clinical trial included 54 sarcoidosis patients who&#xD;
      received an AT (Group Ia: 27 with coaching and Group Ib: 27 without). Exercise capacity and&#xD;
      fatigue scores (Fatigue Assessment Scale) were evaluated at baseline and after three months.&#xD;
      A historical group of sarcoidosis patients (Group II; n=41) from an earlier study who did not&#xD;
      follow a physical activity program served as controls.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis patients often suffer not only from organ-related symptoms but also from&#xD;
      disabling non-specific, non-organ-related symptoms, such as fatigue, reduced muscle strength,&#xD;
      loss of physical condition, reduction of physical activity (PA) in daily life and pain.&#xD;
      Fatigue is the most frequently reported in sarcoidosis patients disregarding the clinical&#xD;
      presentation, varying from 50 to 90%. This may persist after other signs of sarcoidosis&#xD;
      activity have resolved, and adversely impacts major life areas, including quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) and work ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, there is promising evidence for the benefits of physical training in sarcoidosis.&#xD;
      Interventions involving technology that is readily accessible on a daily basis to monitor&#xD;
      activity levels can support care providers in encouraging patients to achieve behavioral&#xD;
      changes. These interventions may be an effective strategy to provide PA-coaching without&#xD;
      increasing time demands on primary care providers. Moreover, they give patients an&#xD;
      opportunity to keep up a more active lifestyle with direct feedback and monitor their&#xD;
      physical performance over time. Counseling, guidance and support using e-health technology&#xD;
      had been found to be very helpful for patients who want to improve their PA. The use of&#xD;
      commercially available, technology-based wearable activity trackers (ATs) such as Fitbit is&#xD;
      growing for research and recreational purposes, both among healthy persons and among those&#xD;
      with chronic illness. Beneficial effects of AT-based counseling have been demonstrated in&#xD;
      patients with chronic diseases. In a recent study by our group we found that wearing an AT&#xD;
      stimulated patients to be more physically active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate (1) the effect of continuous activity monitoring using&#xD;
      an electronical AT and (2) the effect of additional personal coaching of sarcoidosis&#xD;
      patients. The outcome measures were exercise performance and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All participants received a Fitbit for free. They were encouraged to improve&#xD;
      their physical fitness, which was assessed at baseline. The patients in the intervention&#xD;
      group (group Ia) engaged in a three-month physical therapist-guided activity program. The&#xD;
      guidance was based on the input from the AT and the questionnaires. The weekly FAS scores,&#xD;
      Fitbit-measured parameters and brief daily questions were combined in a web-based dashboard&#xD;
      accessible to the assigned physical therapist. The information was used for goal setting,&#xD;
      encouraging, and identifying barriers and facilitators for patients becoming more active. The&#xD;
      coaching procedure included weekly action planning and feedback, modelling of behaviors and&#xD;
      problem solving, and individual decision making by email and/or telephone. The coaching&#xD;
      physical therapist acted as facilitator, and assisted participants in making choices and&#xD;
      achieving success in terms of reaching self-selected goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the patients in group Ib did not receive the guidance from a physical therapist,&#xD;
      their daily activity was also computed with the Fitbit Charge HR (Brand name), and patients&#xD;
      were also able to use a Fitbit and monitor app to monitor their performance, questionnaire&#xD;
      results and progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-report feedback questionnaires at follow-up (12 weeks) were used to determine&#xD;
      participants' experience with data from the Fitbit tracker itself and coaching, if&#xD;
      applicable.&#xD;

The diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was measured using the single-breath method (Masterlab, Jaeger, Würzburg, Germany). Values were expressed as a percentage of the predicted value (i.e., FVC%, FEV1%, and DLCO% respectively).&#xD;
