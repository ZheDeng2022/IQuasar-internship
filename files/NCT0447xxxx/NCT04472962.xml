    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical, randomized, crossover study. The study investigates the effect of a&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate-high-protein pre-exercise meal on preventing exercise-induced hypoglycemia&#xD;
      in people with type 1 diabetes. The hypothesis is that intake of a&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate-high-protein meal can reduce the duration and depth of hypoglycemia during&#xD;
      and after exercise in people with type 1 diabetes compared with an isocaloric&#xD;
      high-carbohydrate-low-protein meal with identical fat content. The study will contribute with&#xD;
      new knowledge about importance of meal composition on preventing exercise-induced&#xD;
      hypoglycemia.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with type 1 diabetes practicing a low-carbohydrate diet can increase the fat and/or&#xD;
      protein content of the diet to cover their energy needs. In relation to physical activity,&#xD;
      ingestion of protein is preferable for muscle protein synthesis and enhances structural&#xD;
      changes in non-muscle tissues such as tendons and bones. Furthermore, addition of â‰¥ 28 g of&#xD;
      protein to a meal is likely to result in significant and sustained postprandial hyperglycemia&#xD;
      commencing in the late postprandial period (2-3 h) and continuing beyond 5 h in people with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. The protein-induced change in the postprandial glucose response could be&#xD;
      beneficial in relation to prevention of exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a&#xD;
      common fear in people with type 1 diabetes and makes many abstain from exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the effect of a low-carbohydrate-high-protein pre-exercise meal on&#xD;
      preventing exercise-induced hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that intake of a low-carbohydrate-high-protein meal can reduce the duration and depth of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia during and after exercise in people with type 1 diabetes compared with an&#xD;
      isocaloric high-carbohydrate-low-protein meal with identical fat content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will contribute with new knowledge about importance of meal composition on&#xD;
      preventing exercise-induced hypoglycemia. The study may add new aspects to current guidelines&#xD;
      for glucose management during exercise in people with type 1 diabetes. If the strategy has a&#xD;
      positive effect on preventing exercise-induced hypoglycemia it will be useful to all people&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes irrespective of diet strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized, two-arm crossover trial including one screening visit, two study&#xD;
      days and a short visit after each study day, where the participants must meet to upload&#xD;
      research data. The study will include adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy&#xD;
      using flash glucose monitoring (FGM) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). 15 participants&#xD;
      have to complete the study. The study days are identical except for the content of the&#xD;
      pre-exercise meal (low-carbohydrate-high-protein meal versus high-carbohydrate-low-protein&#xD;
      meal) and the size of the meal bolus. Meals are isocaloric. The participants will complete&#xD;
      two study days in random order with a 10-14 days washout period between. 48 hours prior to&#xD;
      each study day blood glucose will be monitored by CGM and activity level will be monitored by&#xD;
      an activity monitor wristband.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study day is divided into an in-clinic period, which takes place at Steno Diabetes&#xD;
      Center Copenhagen (SDCC), and a home period, which takes place in the participants own homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will arrive at the research facility in the morning following an overnight&#xD;
      fast. A pre-exercise meal with either low-carbohydrate-high-protein content or&#xD;
      high-carbohydrate-low-protein content will be served. To estimate the gastric emptying 1g&#xD;
      paracetamol will be added to the meal. After ingesting the meal and 90 min of resting the&#xD;
      participants must perform 45 min of exercise on an ergometer cycle equaling to 60 % of their&#xD;
      peak oxygen consumption or until hypoglycemia (plasma glucose &lt; 3.9) or unbearable symptoms&#xD;
      of hypoglycemia. Throughout the in-clinic study day the participants must use their insulin&#xD;
      pumps. The basal insulin rate and meal-bolus will be adjusted according to international&#xD;
      guidelines. Blood samples for analysis of glucose, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, adrenalin,&#xD;
      noradrenalin, growth hormone, ketones, lactate, free fatty acids, GLP1, GIP and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers will be collected. Indirect calorimetry will be performed before, during and after&#xD;
      exercise to measure energy expenditure, respiratory exchange ratio and carbohydrate and fat&#xD;
      oxidation rates. The Borg Scale will be used to assess perceived exertion during the exercise&#xD;
      and a visual analog scale will be used to assess the feeling of satiety during the study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leaving SDCC the home period begins. Throughout the home period the blood glucose and&#xD;
      activity level will be monitored by the CGM and the activity monitor until the next morning,&#xD;
      where the study day ends. From the research facility the participants will be provided a&#xD;
      standard evening meal and a bedtime snack. The participants will also be provided dextrose&#xD;
      tablets, which they must ingest in case of hypoglycemia. Within one week after both study&#xD;
      days, the participants must meet at the clinic to upload research data.&#xD;
