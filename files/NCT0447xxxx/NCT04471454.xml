  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is some cognitive impairment in patients with bipolar depression. THINC-it is a simple,&#xD;
      fast and free cognitive assessment tool. It has good reliability and validity in patients&#xD;
      with depression, but its application in patients with bipolar depression is not clear. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to verify the reliability and validity of THINC-it cognitive test in&#xD;
      bipolar depression, and to further explore the difference of cognitive impairment between&#xD;
      attack and remission of bipolar depression, so as to provide empirical research basis for&#xD;
      clinical evaluation-based treatment.&#xD;

      There is some cognitive impairment in patients with bipolar depression. THINC-it is a simple,&#xD;
      fast and free cognitive assessment tool. It has good reliability and validity in patients&#xD;
      with depression, but its application in patients with bipolar depression is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes three steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. baseline: demographic data, sequential test THINC-it and standard test tools, clinical&#xD;
           scale evaluation, to verify the discriminant validity and parallel validity of THINC-it&#xD;
           in bipolar depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. follow-up (1 week): 30-50 patients with stable bipolar depression were evaluated by&#xD;
           clinical scale and THINC-it test to verify the test-retest reliability of THINC-it in&#xD;
           bipolar depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. follow-up (8 weeks): all patients with bipolar depression were evaluated by clinical&#xD;
           scale, THINC-it test, longitudinal comparison data, and the influencing factors of&#xD;
           cognitive impairment were analyzed.&#xD;
