  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is going to be done on a type of brain tumor in children called&#xD;
      Medulloblastoma. The WNT pathway type of medulloblastoma is considered to be low risk and&#xD;
      have the best outcomes in terms of survival. With the current standard of care for this type&#xD;
      of medulloblastoma it is believed by the investigators that we are over treating the disease&#xD;
      and increasing the long term side effects of these children. Several groups in the world are&#xD;
      testing de-intensification of treatment in this favourable subset of children who experience&#xD;
      long term late side effects of therapy. By reducing the dose to the craniospinal axis and&#xD;
      keeping the total tumor bed dose the same in this study the investigators are expecting to&#xD;
      reduce some of the late side effects of craniospinal irradiation without compromising disease&#xD;
      control and survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WNT pathway medulloblastomas have the best prognosis amongst all four subgroups with 5-year&#xD;
      overall survival exceeding 90%. Overall medulloblastoma is more common in males. They can&#xD;
      occur at all ages, but, are uncommon in infants. They are mostly uniform in their genetic&#xD;
      aberrations, histological pattern, and clinical presentation. The WNT pathway is involved in&#xD;
      regulating embryonal development in the brain. They are frequently described as having CTNNB1&#xD;
      mutations, nuclear immunohistochemical staining for β-catenin, and monosomy six (deletion of&#xD;
      one copy of chromosome 6 in the tumor). Thus monosomy 6 in conjunction with nuclear β-catenin&#xD;
      accumulation is considered a sensitive and specific marker for WNT pathway medulloblastoma&#xD;
      they are typically located in the midline vermian region filling up the fourth ventricle and&#xD;
      infiltrating the brain stem consistent with their proposed cell of origin from the dorsal&#xD;
      brainstem nuclei. The immediate impact of enhanced understanding of molecular biology has led&#xD;
      to biologically driven next-generation clinical trials in newly diagnosed medulloblastoma.&#xD;
      Given the excellent long-term survival outcomes in WNT-pathway medulloblastoma and potential&#xD;
      for significant late toxicities with currently prevalent doses of CSI (23.4-36Gy), it has&#xD;
      been hypothesized that further reduction of dose or in certain cases avoidance of CSI would&#xD;
      translate into reduction in late morbidity of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our first generation FOR-WNT study, the investigators had avoided upfront CSI and treated&#xD;
      the tumor-bed alone with focal conformal radiotherapy in low-risk WNT-pathway medulloblastoma&#xD;
      followed by 6-cycles of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. However, early experience from our&#xD;
      own study and similar results from another study (primary chemotherapy approach completely&#xD;
      avoiding radiotherapy) suggests an unduly increased risk of relapse - spinal leptomeningeal&#xD;
      or supratentorial if CSI is avoided and local recurrence at primary site too if radiation is&#xD;
      completely avoided. Given the excellent long-term survival outcomes in WNT-pathway&#xD;
      medulloblastoma treated with currently prevalent doses of CSI (23.4-36Gy), presence of&#xD;
      significant late toxicities with such doses, but the increased risk of relapse with avoidance&#xD;
      of CSI and/or local irradiation, the investigators hypothesize that further moderate&#xD;
      reduction of CSI dose to 18Gy/10fx keeping the primary-site dose to 54Gy/30fx would translate&#xD;
      into a meaningful reduction in late morbidity of treatment without compromising disease&#xD;
      control or survival. Thus, the investigators herewith propose the second-generation study&#xD;
      (FOR-WNT 2) to include low-dose CSI (18Gy/10fx) plus tumor-bed boost (36Gy/20fx) for a total&#xD;
      primary site dose of 54Gy/30fx without concurrent chemotherapy followed by standard 6-cycles&#xD;
      of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy.&#xD;
