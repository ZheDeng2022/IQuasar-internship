  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of disability in developed countries, and the major cause of&#xD;
      mortality in Brazil.It is associated with low quality of life, disability, decreased muscle&#xD;
      strength and control due to the hypertonia, spasticity. These pathways can develop inadequate&#xD;
      upper and lower limbs functional mechanisms. These changes are linked with disabilities and&#xD;
      painful syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shoulder pain relationed after stroke has a variable prevalence from 16 to 84%, from mild&#xD;
      to severe pain and is relationed as a precursor factor of secondary deformities, depression,&#xD;
      longer hospital stay. Its etiology remains controversial with many possibilities as rotator&#xD;
      cuff injuries, glenohumeral dislocation, impact syndrome, bicipital tendinitis, hand shoulder&#xD;
      syndrome, myofascial painful syndrome, presence of spasticity and contractures, adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis, central pain and others. Its management is controversial and could be done with&#xD;
      physical therapy (kinesiotherapy) intra-articular or local injections (muscles and nerves),&#xD;
      functional electrical stimulation, acupuncture, herbal medicine, tapping, myofascial painful&#xD;
      syndrome treatment, painkillers, anti-inflammatories and antispastic drugs like botulinum&#xD;
      toxin A - tested in few studies, case series, against corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of 200 units of&#xD;
      abobotulinumtoxin against placebo in both pectoralis major and subscapularis: for reducing&#xD;
      shoulder pain (Visual Analogue Scale, McGill pain scale), active and passive range of&#xD;
      motion(goniometer),upper limb function (Fugl-Meyer test), burden of care questionnaire (apply&#xD;
      to caregivers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled study in two&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Centers (Rehabilitation Center from Santa Casa de São Paulo and Hospital de&#xD;
      Clínicas of Universidade de Sao Paulo - Ribeirão Preto).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim will be the pain evaluation (Visual Analogue Scale and McGill pain scale)&#xD;
      with the use of 200 units of abobotulinumtoxin (Dysport) against placebo in both pectoralis&#xD;
      major and subscapularis, after 01and 04 months of the procedure The secondary objectives will&#xD;
      be analysis the active and passive affected shoulder range of motion (goniometer), the upper&#xD;
      limb function (Fugl-Meyer test), Burden of care questionnaire (apply to caregivers) and the&#xD;
      use of medicine and therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated to a alpha error (5%), statistical power (80%) and a decrease&#xD;
      of 1.4 points in Visual Analogue Scale, totalizing 10 patients per group, to avoid lack of&#xD;
      statistical power due to possible drop out we will recruit 12 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The muscles selected for this study are the pectoralis major and subscapularis muscles, each&#xD;
      receiving 200U of Dysport® distributed in 2 points, guided by electrical stimulation .The&#xD;
      evaluations will be performed in 0, 1 and 4 months after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers that will apply and evaluate the patients will be blinded. The patients will&#xD;
      be randomized by 6 blocks of four.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria will be spasticity in upper limb due to ischemic or hemorrhagic&#xD;
      hemispheric stroke; over 18 years old; diagnosis of hemiplegic painful shoulder syndrome,&#xD;
      regardless of motor dominance; agreement of the patient, family member and / or responsible&#xD;
      caregiver to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria will be pain before stroke in shoulder affected by hemiplegia;&#xD;
      previous treatment using TXB-A for painful shoulder; cognitive impairment that hinders&#xD;
      assessment and collaboration with treatment; counterindication to the botulinum toxin use;&#xD;
      structured joint deformity in the shoulder affected by pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative variables will be described through percentages of each categories. The&#xD;
      quantitative variables will be analyzed for normality by the Komolgorov-Smirnov. The&#xD;
      comparison of the value average of the pain variable evaluated by VAS will be performed by&#xD;
      the ANOVA test, considering the treatment groups and the moment of evaluation, followed by&#xD;
      post hoc comparisons, if the ANOVA test indicates a significant effect group time.The&#xD;
      dropouts will be evaluated according to the intention to treat. We will use software Stata11&#xD;
      or similar model&#xD;
