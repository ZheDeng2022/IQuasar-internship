  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will run an at-home usability study of a newly developed speech therapy app&#xD;
      called Speech Hero with 10 individuals with Broca's aphasia in the chronic stage of stroke.&#xD;
      The Speech Hero app allows users to perform rhythm-based speech exercises at home. For this&#xD;
      study participants will be instructed to use Speech Hero for three hours per week over a&#xD;
      3-week period.&#xD;

    <description>Speech Hero will be deemed feasible for this population if at least 5 participants are able to use the device on their own at home for at least 9 hours over three weeks without technical or other issues.</description>

    <measure>Western Aphasia Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of language function of adults with suspected neurological disorders as a result of a stroke, head injury, or dementia. Completion of WAB yields a total score entitled the Aphasia Quotient (AQ). The AQ is a composite, ranging from 0-100, of the four major test areas of the WAB, with a lower score representing more severe impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Boston Naming Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post-Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of language function of adults with suspected neurological disorders as a result of a stroke, head injury, or dementia. Scoring counts the number of spontaneously produced correct responses, the number of cues given, and the number of responses after phonemic cueing and after semantic cueing. For the 60-item test the lowest score that can be obtained is 0 and the highest score is 60, with a lower score representing more severe impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Post-Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Usability will be assessed using a modified version of the System Usability Scale (SUS), which is a 10 item questionnaire designed to capture a user's subjective view of a system's usability. To calculate the overall score, the participant's responses for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original score to a scale from 0-100, with a higher score representing a higher perceived usability.</description>
