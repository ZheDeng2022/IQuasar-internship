      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder. It results from a single genetic&#xD;
      change (mutation) in red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs are the cells that carry oxygen to the&#xD;
      body. In people with SCD, some RBCs are abnormal and die early. This leaves a shortage of&#xD;
      healthy RBCs. Researchers want to learn more about how long RBCs live in the human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how long RBCs live in people with and without SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 and older who either have SCD, had SCD but were cured with a bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant, have the sickle cell trait (SCT), or are a healthy volunteer without SCD or SCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will give a&#xD;
      blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a small amount of blood drawn from a vein. In the laboratory, the&#xD;
      blood will be mixed with a vitamin called biotin. Biotin sticks to the outside of RBCs&#xD;
      without changing their function, shape, or overall lifetime. This process is known as biotin&#xD;
      labeling of RBCs. The biotin labeled RBCs will be returned to the participant via vein&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give frequent blood samples. Their RBCs will be studied to see how many&#xD;
      biotin labeled RBCs remain over time. This shows how long the RBCs live. Participants will&#xD;
      give blood samples until no biotin labeled RBCs can be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study visits, participants will report any major changes to their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation lasts for up to 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mean potential lifespan (MPL) of RBCs can be quantified by either a population or cohort&#xD;
      study. Such studies have corroborated the MPL of healthy donor (HD) RBCs to be approximately&#xD;
      115 days while RBCs from subjects with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a much more variable&#xD;
      but consistently shorter MPL of approximately 32 days. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (HSCT) is utilized as a curative therapy for the treatment of severe SCD resulting&#xD;
      in, among other pathophysiological advantages, restoration of a HD RBC phenotype. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate the population methodology (biotin-labeled RBCs) to determine MPL in subjects&#xD;
      with SCD compared to patients who have successfully undergone allogeneic BMT, subjects with&#xD;
      sickle cell trait, and healthy donors without SCD. Data generated will be used to determine&#xD;
      the utility of performing a population study of RBC lifespan in gene therapy treated patients&#xD;
      to ultimately target the percentage of transferred globin gene needed to reverse SCD.&#xD;
