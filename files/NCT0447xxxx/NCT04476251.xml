  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 12,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year. A new&#xD;
      therapy has been developed that involves taking white blood cells from a person, genetically&#xD;
      modifying the cells in a lab so they recognize cancer, and then giving the cells back to the&#xD;
      person. Researchers want to see if this therapy can help people with cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if people with Stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer can safely be given E7 TCR T cells&#xD;
      before they get standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 and older who have Stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under a separate protocol. Tests will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medicine review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test (if needed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vein assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor sample or biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (to record the heart s electrical activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging scans, x-rays, and/or endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart and/or lung tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo leukapheresis. For this, blood is removed through a needle in the&#xD;
      arm. A machine removes the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a&#xD;
      needle in the other arm. Participants may need to have a large catheter inserted into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay at the hospital for 2-3 weeks. They will get chemotherapy drugs. They&#xD;
      will get the E7 TCR T cells as an intravenous infusion. They will get the drug aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the NIH 3 and 6 weeks after treatment. They will be contacted yearly&#xD;
      for 5 years. They will be asked to participate in long-term follow-up for 15 years....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical cancer is the third most common cause of death among women with gynecologic&#xD;
           cancers in the United States. Worldwide, cervical cancer accounts for nearly 300,000&#xD;
           deaths annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Virtually all cases of cervical cancer result from chronic infection with high-risk&#xD;
           human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common type being HPV16.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer consists of chemoradiation +/-&#xD;
           extended field radiation therapy. Participants with FIGO (revised 2018) stage III-IVA&#xD;
           have the worse prognosis with approximately 50% of the participants dying from their&#xD;
           disease within 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction chemotherapy is an active area of study in this type of cancer. The aim of&#xD;
           induction therapy is to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and improve overall&#xD;
           survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E7 TCR T cells, administered as a single infusion, have demonstrated safety and clinical&#xD;
           activity in advanced, treatment-refractory metastatic HPV+ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the feasibility of induction E7 TCR T cell therapy for FIGO (2018) stage&#xD;
      IIB-IVA, HPV16+ cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants greater than or equal to 18 years old with FIGO (2018) stage IIB-IVA&#xD;
           cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cancer must be HPV16+ and participant must be HLA-A*02:01+.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be treatment-naive (i.e., no prior local or systemic treatment,&#xD;
           including radiation; prior LEEP procedure or cone biopsy is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single arm, pilot study, testing the feasibility of induction E7 TCR T cell&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, a&#xD;
           single infusion of E7 TCR T cells, and systemic aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be referred for standard of care definitive therapy (i.e.,&#xD;
           chemoradiation +/- extended field radiation therapy) within 6 weeks after infusion of E7&#xD;
           TCR T cells.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of the cervix&#xD;
             that has not been treated, with clinical staging as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lead-in safety cohort: FIGO stage IIIC-IVA (2018 International FIGO Staging&#xD;
                  System)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  After lead-in safety cohort: FIGO stage IIB-IVA (2018 International FIGO Staging&#xD;
                  System)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. HPV16+ tumor and HLA-A*02:01+ HLA type. Note: HLA-A*02 is also acceptable for&#xD;
             enrollment but not for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria or PERCIST (if not eligible by RECIST 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of E7 TCR T cells in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from&#xD;
             this study. Note: This age range is consistent with the age of participants with the&#xD;
             disease being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because E7 TCR T&#xD;
             cells have unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women of child-&#xD;
             bearing potential are defined as all women who are not post-menopausal or who have not&#xD;
             had a hysterectomy. Note: Postmenopausal will be defined in this study as women over&#xD;
             the age of 55 who have not had a menstrual period in at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The effects of E7 TCR T cells on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because the chemotherapy agents used in this trial are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (e.g., intrauterine device, hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence;&#xD;
             tubal ligation or vasectomy) prior to study entry and for four months after treatment.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Seronegative for HIV antibody. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this&#xD;
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Participants who are HIV seropositive can&#xD;
             have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen and hepatitis C antibody. If hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             test is positive, then the participant must be tested for the presence of antigen by&#xD;
             RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Must be willing to participate in Gene Therapy Long Term Follow up Protocol (20C0051),&#xD;
             which will follow participants for up to 15 years per Food and Drug&#xD;
             Administration(FDA) requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participants must have organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes &gt;=3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets &gt;=100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin &gt;=9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits except in participants with&#xD;
                  Gilbert s Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) Serum ALT/AST &lt; 2.5X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;=50 mL/min/1.73 m^2&#xD;
                  for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal (by the&#xD;
                  Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous treatment for invasive cervical cancer including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chemotherapy or other systemic treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hysterectomy (prior LEEP procedure or cone biopsy is allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of severe allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations at the time of treatment that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with E7 TCR T cells, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with E7 TCR T cells. These potential risks may&#xD;
             also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants with any form of systemic immunodeficiency, including acquired deficiency&#xD;
             such as HIV or primary immunodeficiency such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease, are ineligible. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol&#xD;
             depends on an intact immune system. Participants who have decreased immune competence&#xD;
             may be less responsive to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants on immunosuppressive drugs including corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participants with autoimmune diseases such as Crohn s disease, ulcerative colitis,&#xD;
             rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, or systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus. Hypothyroidism, vitiligo and other minor autoimmune disorders are not&#xD;
             exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participants with a second invasive malignancy requiring treatment within the last 2&#xD;
             years are not eligible with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cutaneous skin cancers requiring only local excision&#xD;
