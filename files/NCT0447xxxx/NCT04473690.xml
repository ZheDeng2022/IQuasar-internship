    <textblock>
      This is an First In Human (FIH), observer-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of KBP-COVID-19 plus CPG adjuvant&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy adult subjects in 2 age groups, Part A (18-49 years) and Part B (50-85&#xD;
      years).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened up to 14 days (Day -14 to Day -1) before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 90 eligible healthy adults ages 18-49 years (inclusive) will be enrolled for&#xD;
      Part A and 90 eligible healthy seronegative adults ages 50-85 years will be enrolled for Part&#xD;
      B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel dosing (three subjects in each group) will be utilized in this FIH study. Sentinel&#xD;
      cohorts will be used for the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A (18-49 years) low dose Part B (50-85 years) low dose Part A (18-49 years) high dose&#xD;
      Part B (50-85 years) high dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive study vaccine or placebo by&#xD;
      IM injection on Days 1 and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits will be conducted at the clinical sites on an outpatient basis. Subjects&#xD;
      will participate in the study for approximately 1 year from the first dose.&#xD;
