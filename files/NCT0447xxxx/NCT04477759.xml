    <textblock>
      Locoregional failure remains the principal mode of mortality in head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with conventional chemoradiation therapy. Radiation dose escalation&#xD;
      with hypofractionation has shown unparalleled local control in other malignancies, such as&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer, but has been limited in HNSCC due to toxicity concerns. Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) allows for adaptive radiation dose escalation&#xD;
      based on tumor response and may improve therapeutic outcomes while limiting toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol evaluates a novel framework for radiation delivery using MRgRT with concurrent&#xD;
      atezolizumab in patients with advanced HNSCC. Unlike conventional radiotherapy,&#xD;
      Dose-Escalated Hypofractionated Adaptive Radiotherapy (DEHART) modifies radiation dose using&#xD;
      MRgRT by adapting the radiation plan during the course of treatment, escalating radiation&#xD;
      dose to residual tumor while deescalating radiation dose to areas of tumor regression. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that DEHART will safely deliver ablative radiation doses in 15 fractions over 3&#xD;
      weeks while limiting both toxicity and the effect of tumor repopulation by resistant&#xD;
      clonogens, thus resulting in an improved therapeutic ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase I clinical trial will encompass the following specific aims: (1) determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the DEHART regimen delivered using MRgRT with concurrent&#xD;
      atezolizumab in a population of patients who are not candidates or unsuitable for definitive&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy; (2) evaluate the toxicity and functional outcomes of the DEHART&#xD;
      regimen; and (3) assess the efficacy of DEHART and obtain volumetric and functional imaging&#xD;
      correlates of efficacy using MRgRT to serve as hypothesis-generating data for future trials&#xD;
      of radiation dose adaptation. A modified Time-to Event Continual Reassessment (TITE-CRM)&#xD;
      Phase I Design with three radiation dose levels delivered to regressing disease will be used&#xD;
      to determine the MTD: 50 Gy in 15 fractions, 55 Gy in 15 fractions and 60 Gy in 15 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If DEHART is found to be safe and shows a signal of efficacy in this study, a future Phase II&#xD;
      trial will be conducted to compare this novel treatment strategy to standard-of care&#xD;
      conventionally fractionated chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced HNSCC.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Adequate hepatic function within 14 days prior to registration defined as follows:&#xD;
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 times&#xD;

             definition; Note: HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need&#xD;
             to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatment&#xD;

             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception during treatment and&#xD;
             for 6 months after the last dose of atezolizumab, this exclusion is necessary because&#xD;
             the treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic. Women who are&#xD;
             breastfeeding are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to atezolizumab or any of study drug&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;

             surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis C. Patients with a past or resolved HBV&#xD;
             infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and absence&#xD;
             of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible&#xD;
             only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.&#xD;
