      The purpose of this observational study is to collect contemporary real-world treatment&#xD;
      patterns, clinical outcomes, humanistic burden (including patient-reported disease-specific&#xD;
      Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL), and treatment- related adverse events (AEs) or&#xD;
      adverse reactions (ARs) among Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (aRCC) patients initiating&#xD;
      first-line systemic therapy.&#xD;
