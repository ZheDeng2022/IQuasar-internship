  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses education needs in gestational diabetes care and followup at the staff&#xD;
      and patient levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial phase, nurses and community health workers will complete specific training&#xD;
      modules on gestational diabetes developed for this study. The effectiveness of the education&#xD;
      modules will be evaluated through pre/post surveys of participants assessing diabetes&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention participants will be compared on survey measures before and after the&#xD;
      intervention and on health outcomes with 'contemporaneous control' group. Both groups will&#xD;
      receive initial gestational diabetes education with trained clinic staff. The intervention&#xD;
      group will receive additional education during and after pregnancy with a curriculum&#xD;
      delivered by a community health worker. The contemporaneous control will not be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study and will be identified retrospectively.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Staff participants will complete surveys on diabetes knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy before and after completing online training modules on gestational diabetes.&#xD;
Patient participants will be recruited from our community health center partner at diagnosis of gestational diabetes. These participants will be considered to be in an intervention group and as such will receive a community health worker delivered curriculum including 4 sessions during pregnancy and 3 sessions postpartum. Patients in the intervention group will be compared to a contemporaneous 'control' arm that is not enrolled in the intervention.</intervention_model_description>
