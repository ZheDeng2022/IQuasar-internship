  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;In so-called &quot;&quot;early onset&quot;&quot; anorexia nervosa (AN), a rare and severe form affecting 8-13&#xD;
      year olds, experts recommend that, as soon as possible, treatment should take place on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis, at an age when separation from the usual environment would be particularly&#xD;
      unpleasant and deleterious. However, in severe AN, full-time hospitalisation (FTH) is still&#xD;
      indicated when somatic and psychiatric instability criteria are met. Thus, the severity and&#xD;
      rapidity of undernutrition in children aged 8-13 years suffering from AN (linked on the one&#xD;
      hand to the frequency of total aphagia with refusal to drink and on the other hand to the&#xD;
      lack of early detection of the disorder, frequently requires emergency FTH, contrary to&#xD;
      expert recommendations. This FTH, which lasts on average 3 months in our specialized unit,&#xD;
      has certain disadvantages: poor acceptability by the patient and/or his family, increased&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms on entry and exit, school dropout, social isolation, coercive experience. In&#xD;
      addition, the rate of premature FTH exits - before weight targets are reached - and the&#xD;
      frequency of relapses after FTH remain high, making FTH unsatisfactory in terms of&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. Some families refuse FTH, which is classically long, exposing themselves&#xD;
      to the risk of complications that can occur if the disorder is inadequately treated: somatic,&#xD;
      acute and chronic complications; risk of progression to another eating disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, day hospitalization (DH) care has been developed for adolescents aged 11 to&#xD;
      18 years and adults (Madden, 2015). The few studies available are in favour of comparable&#xD;
      efficacy, better acceptability and lower cost in the management of moderate AN compared to&#xD;
      prolonged FTH, but also better social adaptation.In children aged 8 to 13 years with AN,&#xD;
      whose somatic condition requires continuous monitoring in a hospital setting (the usual&#xD;
      indication for FTH), a DH cannot reasonably be proposed immediately given the severity of the&#xD;
      situation. Our hypothesis is that it would however be possible, in these children, to shorten&#xD;
      the duration of FTH and to continue DH treatment once the critical period has passed at the&#xD;
      somatic level, with comparable efficacy, best acceptability, best progress in terms of school&#xD;
      and social integration, and lower cost.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of DH management after a&#xD;
      short full-time hospitalisation compared to a prolonged full-time hospitalisation aiming at a&#xD;
      healthy weight on the evolution of BMI at 1 year in children aged 8 to 13 years suffering&#xD;
      from anorexia nervosa, with severe undernutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum healthy weight is defined by a weight corresponding to the BMI corridor prior to&#xD;
      the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, +/- 1 corridor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial, open-label, single-centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into one of the two arms of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (control group): continuation of full-time hospitalisation until reaching the&#xD;
           minimum healthy weight, defined as the weight corresponding to the return to the&#xD;
           previous BMI corridor (previous BMI +/- 1 BMI corridor, e.g. change from 25th to 10th&#xD;
           percentile).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (experimental group): Exit from FTH (full-time hospitalisation ) and relay to DH&#xD;
           (day hospitalization ) one day per week until the minimum healthy weight. This treatment&#xD;
           combines a one-day medical evaluation by a senior psychiatrist, family sessions (parents&#xD;
           group and multi-family therapy session), a therapeutic education group, a cognitive&#xD;
           remediation group and a dietary follow-up with therapeutic meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the data will be carried out with the intention to treat. The BMI at&#xD;
      1 year between groups, as well as its bilateral 95% confidence interval (equivalent to a&#xD;
      one-sided 97.5% confidence interval), will be estimated and compared with the predefined&#xD;
      margin of non-inferiority (1 BMI point).&#xD;
