  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dysfunction of wound healing in diabetes involves multiple healing processes by&#xD;
      diminished inflammatory responses and delayed deposition of matrix components, wound&#xD;
      remodeling, and closure. Furthermore, hyperglycemia increases the infection susceptibility of&#xD;
      wounds. In Taiwan, we have data demonstrating the nutrition status associated the outcome of&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) acute treatment and value of serum arginine level (in preliminary&#xD;
      metabolomics study) to predict one-year healing of DFUs. The arginine has the beneficial&#xD;
      effects on wound healing by the action of its metabolites, including vasodilatation,&#xD;
      bactericide, growth factors recruitment and collage formation. Nevertheless, its supplement&#xD;
      and mechanism in patients with diabetes is still remains unproven. This study aims at (1)&#xD;
      defining the effects of arginine supplement, on top of the traditional treatment and risk&#xD;
      reduction, on healing outcomes of patients with DFUs, (2) studying the modes of action of&#xD;
      arginine supplements in diabetes, and (3) verifying the metabolomics factors and their&#xD;
      association with wound healing prospects in patients with DFUs. A total of 120 patients with&#xD;
      chronic diabetic foot ulcer will be enrolled and survey in 3 years. Along with standard of&#xD;
      care, patients will receive, in a randomized fashion, either arginine (treatment group) or&#xD;
      whey protein (control group) 5 g per day supplement for 4 weeks. The wound status will be&#xD;
      collected with features in wound size, tissue perfusion, and infection status before and&#xD;
      after treatment. Nutritional surveys, nitrogen balance as well as various molecular studies&#xD;
      such as metabolomics analysis and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio will be performed to study&#xD;
      the association between the molecules of nutrients and the healing&#xD;

      The dysfunction of wound healing in diabetes involves multiple healing processes by&#xD;
      diminished inflammatory responses and delayed deposition of matrix components, wound&#xD;
      remodeling, and closure. Furthermore, hyperglycemia increases the infection susceptibility of&#xD;
      wounds. The wounds noted at distal limb of body, the diabetic foot ulcers, have more&#xD;
      significant impacts clinically and socioeconomically compare to those injuries from surgery&#xD;
      or pressure sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Urge for Novel treatments in patients with diabetic foot ulcers:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Facts: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a major complication of diabetes that can lead&#xD;
           to limb loss and premature death. According to a report from the International Diabetes&#xD;
           Federation in 2017, DFU is also the most common cause of hospitalization for patients&#xD;
           with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Taiwan, 1% of patients with diabetes are admitted to hospital for the treatment of&#xD;
           DFU annually. However, considering that the lower-extremity amputation (LEA) rate is&#xD;
           around 30%,the treatment outcomes are obviously unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Standard treatment for DFU 1.2.1 In 2016, we formed a Taiwan national working group&#xD;
           on diabetic foot under the authorization of Diabetes Association of the Republic of&#xD;
           China and subsequently published a Diabetic foot guideline in Taiwan in 2017 (ISBN&#xD;
           978-986-82436-8-2). In addition, I also participated in the writing of a clinical foot&#xD;
           care guideline released 2017 by International Diabetes Federation . 1.2.2 These two most&#xD;
           updated guidelines detail the diagnosis, management and prevention for patients with&#xD;
           DFUs with specifically focused on (1) infection, (2) peripheral artery diseases, (3)&#xD;
           wound care and surgical intervention, and (4) off-loading and risks reduction.&#xD;
           Suggestions for the appropriate medications for patients with various clinical&#xD;
           characteristics were also provided. Nevertheless, in addition to treating acute&#xD;
           infections and limb ischemia, the optimum healing of a foot ulcer requires treating the&#xD;
           complex biological and molecular events of cell migration and proliferation, and of&#xD;
           extracellular matrix deposition, remodeling, and tissue microcirculation. This is why&#xD;
           the prognosis for patients with DFU is still unsatisfactory, worldwide. Novel treatments&#xD;
           are therefore needed to provide better tissue healing in patients with diabetes.&#xD;
           Unfortunately, recent results of well-designed novel treatments for patients with DFU&#xD;
           have been disappointing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The role of nutrition in wound healing The relationship between nutrition and wound&#xD;
           healing, whether after injury or surgical intervention, has been recognized for&#xD;
           centuries and adequate carbohydrate, fat and protein intake is known to be necessary for&#xD;
           healing to take place. Wound failure, as reflected by wound infections and/or delayed&#xD;
           healing, significantly contributes to the financial burden imposed on health care&#xD;
           systems worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Molecular pathogenesis of diabetic wound healing In healthy individuals, the wound&#xD;
           healing requires maintenance of multiple signals (cytokines and chemokines) released by&#xD;
           keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, and platelets. During&#xD;
           wound-induced hypoxia, VEGF released by macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells&#xD;
           induces nitric oxide synthase (NOS) resulting in an increase in nitric oxide (NO)&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Role of nutrition in wound healing in patients with diabetes Studies have shown&#xD;
           that changes in energy, carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, and mineral metabolism&#xD;
           affect the healing process12. Loss of protein due to protein-calorie malnutrition, the&#xD;
           most common form of malnutrition, leads to decreased wound tensile strength, decreased&#xD;
           T-cell function, decreased phagocytic activity, and decreased complement and antibody&#xD;
           levels,ultimately diminishing the body's ability to defend the wound against infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, wounding increases metabolic rates, catecholamine levels, loss of total&#xD;
           body water, and cellular protein turnover, resulting in an overall state of catabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with diabetes have a significantly impaired ability to heal wounds, and&#xD;
           therefore, exhibit increased complication rates compared with their euglycemic&#xD;
           counterparts. The mechanisms at work are multifactorial and need to be further&#xD;
           verified.Recent evidence has shown that patients with diabetes exhibit a diminished&#xD;
           early inflammatory response and inhibition of fibroblast and endothelial cell&#xD;
           activities. Subsequently, when inflammatory cells eventually arrive at the site of&#xD;
           injury, they initiate a prolonged inflammatory phase that results in delayed deposition&#xD;
           of matrix components, wound remodeling, and closure. Furthermore, hyperglycemia&#xD;
           interferes with the cellular transport of ascorbic acid into fibroblasts and leukocytes&#xD;
           and decreases leukocyte chemotaxis. In addition, patients with diabetes are more&#xD;
           susceptible to infection2 because of decreased host resistance and phagocytosis ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Preliminary data highlights the role of L-arginine in wound healing in patients with DFU&#xD;
           In our diabetic foot center, we have consistently observed that a lower serum albumin&#xD;
           level is an independent risk factor for lower-extremity amputation (LEA) . Furthermore,&#xD;
           we identified an association between nutritional status and treatment outcomes in&#xD;
           patients with limb-threatening DFU. Using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) and&#xD;
           Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) tools, we confirmed a high prevalence of&#xD;
           nutritional problems among these patients. We further identified that the nutritional&#xD;
           status of the patients was an independent predictor for acute treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, we analyzed the effect of metabolomic molecules and clinical and wound&#xD;
      characteristics on the 1-year outcomes of wound healing in patients with limb-threatening&#xD;
      foot ulcer.&#xD;
