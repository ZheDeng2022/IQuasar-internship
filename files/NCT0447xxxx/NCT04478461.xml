  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ia, single-center, open label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and anti-tumor efficacy of MW11 (a&#xD;
      recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) for injection in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The enrollment mainly depends on &quot;3+3&quot; principle. A total of 3 or 4 dose groups will be&#xD;
      evaluated during the dose escalation period: 1, 3, 10 mg/kg, and maybe an additional fixed&#xD;
      dose (e.g., to evaluate 200 mg or other fixed dose as RP2D). The drug is scheduled to be&#xD;
      administrated Q3W. Actual dose increments or dosing frequency may be adjusted according to PK&#xD;
      data and safety of MW11. Safety, tolerability, and DLT will be assessed within 3 weeks (21&#xD;
      days) after initial administration. Anti-tumor efficacy will be assessed every 6 weeks during&#xD;
      the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks ever since. The study will be divided into screening&#xD;
      period and treatment period. The drug administration will be continued until the&#xD;
      investigators consider that the subjects will no longer benefit from the treatment, or the&#xD;
      subjects meet intolerable toxicity, or the subjects withdraw the informed consent, or disease&#xD;
      progression occurs.&#xD;
