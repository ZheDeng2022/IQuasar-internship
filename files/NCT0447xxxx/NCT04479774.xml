    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the major cause of lifelong disability if not treated on time, the&#xD;
      investigator's technique knows as Compelled Body Weight Shift Technique (CBWS) was utilized&#xD;
      and administered to chronic stroke population and results were figured out using gait&#xD;
      parameters and Tinetti POMA scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total 28 sample size out of which 27 were divided into control and experimental group.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria was Unilateral chronic stroke with asymmetrical stance, Patients with&#xD;
      score of 3,4 and 5 will be included according to FAS (Functional Ambulation Scale), Ability&#xD;
      to understand and follow instructions, Both male and female, Any type of stroke, and Age&#xD;
      40-60. Written and informed consent was obtained from participants of study. Six weeks of&#xD;
      exercise training was combined with compelled body weight shift technique via shoe lift of&#xD;
      0.6 cm thickness for experimental group and for control group training was performed without&#xD;
      shoe lift.&#xD;

    <description>Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment The Tinetti, evaluation instrument is, an effectively managed, task-arranged test that, quantifies gait and balance activities of patients. A three-point, ordinal scale, extending from 0-2. &quot;0&quot; demonstrates the most elevated level of debilitation and &quot;2&quot; the people's freedom.&#xD;
Total Balance Score = 16&#xD;

Results were obtained by using gait parameters including walk speed, cadence, step rate, stride length The tinetti POMA scale was utilized to record changes post treatment in gait , the weight bearing was recorded using Camry ZT-160 analog weight scale At the end of every week results were obtained.</description>
