    <textblock>
      This is a research study to look at blood sugar changes during chemotherapy using a&#xD;
      continuous blood sugar monitoring device. The device uses patches that attach to the skin on&#xD;
      the back of the arm to measure blood sugar changes for the duration of the chemotherapy&#xD;
      course. Each patch lasts for about 2-weeks. During chemotherapy visits, new patches will be&#xD;
      placed and will be worn until the chemotherapy course is complete. Participants will be in&#xD;
      this study for 6 months. Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

      This is a prospective observational cohort study monitoring trends in glucose in patients&#xD;
      with early stage breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients&#xD;
      will wear a noninvasive glucose monitoring sensor, the Freestyle Libre Pro for the duration&#xD;
      of chemotherapy. The primary goal of this trial is to evaluate the prevalence of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia in patients with early-stage breast cancer during neoadjuvant/adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Fifty patients will be enrolled. During each chemotherapy encounter, subjects&#xD;
      will have their glucose sensor scanned in order to download subjects' glucose data. If the&#xD;
      sensor has become no longer adherent to the participant's skin, participants will bring the&#xD;
      sensor with them to the chemotherapy infusion center to be scanned. During each chemotherapy&#xD;
      encounter, the Free Style Libre sensor will be replaced by the study team. Participants who&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy every three weeks will be asked to come in 10-14 days after their&#xD;
      chemotherapy infusion to replace the sensor. The sensors will be worn through completion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy (the duration will vary based on the individual's chemotherapy regimen).&#xD;
      Patients will have fructosamine, a glucose biomarker, and serum creatinine testing at&#xD;
      baseline and every 3 weeks (weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24) until week 24 (note: week 15,&#xD;
      18, and 21 are optional). Patients will have additional glucose biomarker testing (hemoglobin&#xD;
      a1c, glucose, and insulin [fasting preferred]) at baseline, week 12 and week 24. Patients&#xD;
      will also complete questionnaires assessing for symptoms of chemotherapy induced peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, quality of life, and fatigue at baseline, week 12 and week 24. Visits will be&#xD;
      conducted within the below specified windows forbidding unexpected circumstances such as&#xD;
      missed appointments or loss to follow-up.&#xD;
