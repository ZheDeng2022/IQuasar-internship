    <textblock>
      The challenge of breast conserving surgery (BCS) is to obtain free resection margins, by&#xD;
      removing the invasive tumor and the precursor cells: DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma in Situ).&#xD;
      Consequently, 17%-25% of primary invasive breast cancer patients will need a repeat surgery.&#xD;
      Repeat breast surgery has been associated with higher surgical risks, poorer cosmetic outcome&#xD;
      and increased psychological and economic burden. Finding a precise method to obtain tumor-&#xD;
      and DCIS-free resection margins during BCS is therefore strongly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose with this study is to investigate if the need for a re-operation can be reduced&#xD;
      by performing Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) of the resected tumor margins compared to&#xD;
      the currently used standard X-ray during BCS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in Denmark with approximately 4700&#xD;
      new cases each year, with an increased incidence during the last decades. Almost 70% of the&#xD;
      patients are treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) and breast irradiation.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, 5.9 % of the patients treated with BCS will experience local recurrence after&#xD;
      9 years. The strongest predictor for local recurrence is a positive pathologic resection&#xD;
      margin. Therefore it is important intraoperatively to be able to evaluate the margin width of&#xD;
      the resected specimen precisely. The challenge during BCS is to remove the primary invasive&#xD;
      breast cancer, with negative resection margin, free of invasive tumor and DCIS, Ductal&#xD;
      Carcinoma In Situ. Some have concluded that lack of accurate imaging especially of the DCIS&#xD;
      is the main reason for positive margins and repeat surgery, as the DCIS often, but not in all&#xD;
      cases, contains microcalcifications that can be detected on mammography (x-ray of the&#xD;
      breast). Consequently, 17%-25% of the patients will need a second or a third surgery. Repeat&#xD;
      surgery has been associated with higher surgical risk, poorer cosmetic outcome, and increased&#xD;
      psychological and economic burden for both patients and the society. Finding an optimal&#xD;
      imaging method to obtain adequate resection margins close to or during BCS that can reduce&#xD;
      the number of repeat surgeries, is therefore strongly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of resection margin status&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safe macroscopic surgical resection margin is, according to the Danish Breast Cancer&#xD;
      Group´s (DBCG) guidelines, defined as a margin width ≥ 5mm minimizing the risk of leaving&#xD;
      residual tumor. In many institutions in Denmark, a perioperative evaluation of the tumor is&#xD;
      performed as a macroscopically assessment by a pathologist. This is a ressource demanding&#xD;
      procedure and X-ray of the specimen is used instead. A radiological, positive resection&#xD;
      margin is defined as a margin width of 0 mm, that leads to a re-excision during the same&#xD;
      surgical procedure, and additional breast tissue is removed at the exact same area of the&#xD;
      patient's breast. This procedure aims to avoid the discomfort of a repeat surgery. The&#xD;
      perioperative radiological assessment of the resection margins is afterwards confirmed&#xD;
      microscopically, where a positive margin at our institution is defined as &quot;tumor on ink&quot;,&#xD;
      meaning tumor cells in the inked resection margin with 0 mm to the margin. A positive margin&#xD;
      will trigger a repeat surgery, either a new BCS or a mastectomy where the whole breast is&#xD;
      removed. For DCIS, a margin-width of less than 2 mm is considered positive, and the patient&#xD;
      will be offered repeat surgery according to guidelines. A distance from the invasive&#xD;
      carcinoma to the resection margin of &lt; 2 mm, but not &quot;on the ink&quot; is surgical considered&#xD;
      sufficient and the patient will according to DBCG guidelines, not require a repeat surgery,&#xD;
      but will instead be offered additional boost to the subsequent radiotherapy. The result of&#xD;
      the final histopathology is, however, not available until 7 workdays after the initial BCS.&#xD;
      Guidance of a more optimal perioperative methods to evaluate the resection margins during BCS&#xD;
      would, therefore, be highly desirable, and could potentially lead to a decreased rate of&#xD;
      repeat surgery and hence save several patients from the discomfort of a second surgical&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative imaging methods for margin assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various methods to assess resection margins have been investigated such as frozen section&#xD;
      analysis, imprint cytology, macroscopically evaluation and imaging with x-ray, micro-CT&#xD;
      scanning or ultrasound of the resected tumor margins. All have, however, their limitations,&#xD;
      either because they are time consuming, or simply because they are not accurate enough to&#xD;
      predict resection margin status. The imaging modality X-ray has been reported in several&#xD;
      studies to have a high specificity, predicting negative margins up to 95%, but unfortunately&#xD;
      a low sensitivity of only 21%. That means that the method is particularly good to predict a&#xD;
      negative margin. The X-ray is less sensitive when it comes to predict a positive resection&#xD;
      margin, with the final histopathology as a reference method. The lower sensitivity is due to&#xD;
      the fact, that x-ray has difficulties, when it comes to detect the breast tumor in a very&#xD;
      dense normal breast tissue, most common for young women. The X-ray evaluation also has the&#xD;
      disadvantage of only delivering a 2D solution to a 3D problem. The other imaging method&#xD;
      currently in use is ultrasound that has a high sensitivity of 80% but a low specificity of&#xD;
      59% to predict positive resection margins (Ramos M. et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new method called Micro-CT (micro-Computed Tomography) can provide 3D imaging of the&#xD;
      resected tumor and the microcalcifications that helps to asses all margins of the resected&#xD;
      tumor. Unfortunately, there is a high interobserver variability reported with this method.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is difficult to differentiate between tumor and normal breast tissue in the&#xD;
      resected margins in some of the cases, which makes it impossible for the radiologist to&#xD;
      determine if the margins are positive or negative. This may be one of the reasons for, why&#xD;
      this method does not perform so well with a sensitivity range of only 38%-56%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is a novel method for assessment of resection margins&#xD;
      based on X-ray technology. DBT provides images of the resected tumor with a large field of&#xD;
      view of the specimen and a high resolution, that allows the radiologist to examine the&#xD;
      resected specimen in one millimeter increments both in 2D and 3D, where the extent and the&#xD;
      shape of the tumor and the microcalcifications are better defined than on conventional 2D&#xD;
      mammography. Only few clinical studies have investigated DBT for evaluation of resection&#xD;
      margins with the most recent study with 98 patients included (Park KU. et al). This study&#xD;
      reported a high performance of the DBT with a sensitivity to predict positive margins of 93%,&#xD;
      and a specificity of 78%, to predict negative margins, with the final histopathology as a&#xD;
      reference method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the present study is to investigate if adequate resection margins&#xD;
      can be obtained with use of DBT of the resected margins during BCS to reduce the rate of&#xD;
      repeat surgery and avoid further unnecessary complications and psychological stress for the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does intraoperative DBT improve assessment of the resected margins compared to standard&#xD;
      method with X-ray? The final histopathology will be used as a reference method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DBT can contribute to obtain negative resection margins and thereby reduce the need of&#xD;
           repeat surgery as compared to X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The performance of DBT predicting resection margin status is more accurate compared to&#xD;
           the standard method with X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be recruited at the Department of Plastic and Breast Surgery at&#xD;
      Aarhus University Hospital after they have been diagnosed with operable invasive breast&#xD;
      cancer and scheduled for BCS. The study participants will receive separate information&#xD;
      leaflet about this project that respects the applicable regulatory requirements. The page&#xD;
      describing the rights of the patient participating in a health research project will also be&#xD;
      handed out to the patient by the breast surgeon. The breast surgeon will obtain the informed&#xD;
      consent from the patient and mention in the patient's medical record, that the patient has&#xD;
      given consent to participate in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participant will be randomized to either the DBT or the standard method (X-ray) by&#xD;
      the breast surgeon in the system REDCap®. REDCap® is a secure web platform that can build and&#xD;
      manage online databases and surveys that will also be used for the data management of this&#xD;
      project. The randomization will be performed by the breast surgeon during the first&#xD;
      consultation with the patient, as soon as the patient has given oral and written consent and&#xD;
      is included in each trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of the resected breast tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study encompasses tissue being procured as part of the normal diagnostic procedure. The&#xD;
      material will, as all tissue collected for diagnostic purposes, be kept in the existing&#xD;
      clinical biobank at the Department of Pathology, at Aarhus University Hospital during as well&#xD;
      as after the closure of the study. A research biobank will therefore not be established&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no side effects and no risk of radiation for the investigators in the DBT-trial, as&#xD;
      the resected tumor will be located inside the DBT or in the X-ray that is a closed system,&#xD;
      ex-vivo, with no radiation exposure to the technical staff or to the study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 123 study participants was calculated as necessary to detect a reduction&#xD;
      from 20% in the X-ray-group to 7% in the DBT-group with a statistical power of 80% and a 5%&#xD;
      level of significance. The investigators expect a few patients may drop-out for different&#xD;
      reasons, and estimated that a total number of 250 patients are enough to be included in the&#xD;
      DBT-trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyses and calculation will be made primarily by the investigator Irina&#xD;
      Palimaru Manhoobi (IPM) using STATA® where after the work will be reviewed by a statistician&#xD;
      to ensure a high quality of the statistical work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The occurrence of positive resections margins, re-excisions and repeat surgery will be&#xD;
           compared between groups using the Fisher exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The performance of the tested and the standard method: The sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
           Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) compared to the&#xD;
           reference method will be calculated with the McNemar Chi-Square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be identified from the Central Personal Register system (CPR)&#xD;
      with permission obtained the 1st of April 2020 from the Danish Data Protection Agency (DDPA)&#xD;
      / &quot;Region Midtjyllands interne fortegnelse over forskningsprojekter&quot; with case number&#xD;
      1-16-02-141-20. The informed consent from all study participants gives the investigator,&#xD;
      sponsor and the representants of the sponsor, the direct access to the below described&#xD;
      clinical data from the medical record (EPJ) Electronical Patient Journal, that is important&#xD;
      to perform this project. All clinical data will be transferred anonymously to the secure web&#xD;
      application for data management in &quot;RedCap&quot; that is administered by Aarhus University. The&#xD;
      investigator IPM is responsible for the data management. The study is in according to the&#xD;
      guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration II, GCP guidelines and the Danish Legislation&#xD;
      regarding clinical trials and legislation regarding personal data.&#xD;
