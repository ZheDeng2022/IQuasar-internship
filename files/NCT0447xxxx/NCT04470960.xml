      The purpose of this research study is to design, implement and evaluate the setting for a&#xD;
      &quot;Healthy Community Center&quot;. This is a program review of a program which will be planned in a&#xD;
      community based participatory level, based on the socioecological model. A pre-post design&#xD;
      will be utilized where all community centers in the study will be exposed to the intervention&#xD;
      components. It is hypothesized that community centers who will receive the intervention will&#xD;
      have better skills at building sustainable participatory effective health promotion projects&#xD;
      and will provide a healthy setting for the community within its juristiction.&#xD;

      components. All community centers (n=15) will be evaluated by pre intervention questionairres&#xD;
      and focus groups of community center Managers and health promotion professionals. The network&#xD;
      will be designed upon the foundation of the &quot;Healthy Cities network&quot; with adaptations made in&#xD;
      the process of participatory planning and designing according to the results of the focus&#xD;
      groups. Intervention will include a a 12 week training session for designated &quot;Health&#xD;
      Coordinator&quot; from each community center, Planning and implementing a personolized Health&#xD;
      promtion Project in each community centre .It is hypothesized that community centers who will&#xD;

    <description>Israeli Healthy Cities Network evaluation tool was designed based on the MARI's (Monitoring Accountability Reporting Impact assessment) framework. It assesses six dimensions of the principles and strategies of the Healthy Cities work: (i) Equity policy and political support. (ii) Management. (iii) Health promotion programs and activities in the city. (iv) Community participation. (v) Intersectoral partnerships (vi) Environmental protection activities. This questionnaire was adapted to a community center framework.</description>

    <measure>European Quality Instrument for Health Promotion</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after intervention initiation</time_frame>
    <description>information on four domains using in-person interviews: (i) compliance with international principles of Health promotion programs, (ii) development and implementation, (iii) project management and (iv) sustainability of programs. each item of the EQUIHP tool was recoded on a scale of 0-1: a score of 0 if the criteria was identified as not fulfilled, 0.5 if partly fulfilled and 1 if fully fulfilled. The sum of all valid scores per programme was divided by the number of valid answers to give the mean score. A mean score was given for each of the four domains, and for the overall score in the same manner. Higher scores are better.</description>
