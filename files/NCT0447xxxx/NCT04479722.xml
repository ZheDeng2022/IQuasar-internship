  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of using Microport CardioAdvance Left Atrium Appendage&#xD;
      Closure for preventing stroke in Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients who have&#xD;
      contraindications for long-term anti-coagulation. And to support registration approval from&#xD;

      SAFE-PROTECT trial is composed of Roll-in group, small-size group and RCT group. This trial&#xD;
      is planned to conduct in about 20 sites from China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Roll-in group plans to enroll at most 3 subjects each site to implant experimental device for&#xD;
      exploration and observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT group plans to enroll no less than 210 subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and 1:1 randomly allocated to experimental arm or comparator arm.&#xD;
