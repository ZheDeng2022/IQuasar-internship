  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to primarily evaluate the safety and efficacy of U3-1402 in&#xD;
      participants with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have received at least 2&#xD;
      prior lines of therapy and will explore clinical benefit according to human epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor 3 (HER3) tumor expression level in otherwise refractory tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There will be 2 cohorts with enrollment in 2 parts. Participants will be treated on Day 1 of&#xD;
      each 21-day cycle (every 3 weeks) with U3-1402 5.6 mg/kg intravenous (IV). The estimated&#xD;
      treatment period is approximately 8 months and the follow-up period is approximately 4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

                  documented to be below the level of detection in the absence of anti-viral&#xD;
                  therapy during the previous 12 weeks (ie, sustained viral response according to&#xD;
                  the local product label but no less than 12 weeks, whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with any human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases (including active bleeding&#xD;
             diatheses, active infection), psychiatric illness/social situations, geographical&#xD;
             factors, substance abuse, or other factors which in the Investigator's opinion makes&#xD;
             it undesirable for the participant to participate in the study or which would&#xD;
             jeopardize compliance with the protocol. Screening for chronic conditions is not&#xD;
