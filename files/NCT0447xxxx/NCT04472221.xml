      Abstract Purpose: To describe a technique used to treat a patient with Lt upper limb&#xD;
      synthetic arterio-venous vascular access and venous hypertension of the same limb. Technique:&#xD;
      we expose the venous anastomosis of the graft by small longitudinal incision in the axilla&#xD;
      and dissection of the axillary artery just parallel to the axillary vein , the investigator&#xD;
      disconnect the graft from the axillary vein and do primary repair of the vein , then&#xD;
      investigator s do end to side anastomosis of the graft to the axillary artery , after&#xD;
      finishing this anastomosis the axillary artery ligated just below the anastomosis.&#xD;
      Conclusion: the conversion of arterio-venous graft to arterio-arterial vascular access in&#xD;
      precious access with venous hypertension lead to resolution of edema of venous hypertension&#xD;
      and preservation of access for dialysis.&#xD;

      Keywords: Arterio-arterial vascular access, Arterio-venous synthetic access, Venous&#xD;
      hypertension, Hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In haemodialysis patients the investigator are confronted by patient with Left upper limb&#xD;
      synthetic graft used for haemodialysis and the patient developed edema due to central venous&#xD;
      occlusion ( venous hypertension) in the same limb. The other limb have no palpable pulse due&#xD;
      to previous 3 operations for vascular access which ended by ligation of the brachial artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First the hope to dilatation of the central veins but this trial failed due to failure of the&#xD;
      wire to cross the lesion, so we think to convert this arterio-venous graft to&#xD;
      arterio-arterial access as we have previous experience with brachial aretrio-arterial&#xD;
      vascular access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One limitation of this technique was that the continuity of the brachial artery which will&#xD;
      lead to thrombosis of the graft because of equal pressure in the graft and the brachial&#xD;
      artery so ligation of the axillary artery below the proximal anastomosis was done despite our&#xD;
      fear of ischaemia of the limb if the synthetic graft occluded later on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After failure of trial angioplasty of epsilateral central veins. This procedure was done&#xD;
      either by local, regional, or general anesthesia (IV deprivan) according to the patient&#xD;
      situation and surgeon preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal incision (about 5-7cm) in the axilla at the arterio-venous anastomosis of the&#xD;
      synthetic graft and along the course of the axillary artery , good hemostasis is needed&#xD;
      because of the edema and the venous hypertension in the dilated collateral veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good exposure of the end of the synthetic graft and mobilization of the axillary artery was&#xD;
      done with ligation of intervening branches (a segment of 4-6 cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The synthetic graft catted and we do repair of the axillary vein. End to side anastomosis&#xD;
      between the synthetic graft and the axillary artery by 6/0 proline then the axillary artery&#xD;
      is ligated just below the anastomosis by 2/0 silk suture , now the blood is reversed in the&#xD;
      synthetic graft and the blood flow from the axillary artery to the synthetic graft then to&#xD;
      the brachial artery and radial and ulnar arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were discharged in the 2nd postoperative day unless need. Creep bandage was applied&#xD;
      to the forearm and after 1-2 days the edema resolved and the patient regain the function of&#xD;
      the upper limb and he can used the graft for dialysis immediately because the graft already&#xD;
      healed and used previously for dialysis which is useful in those patients who has no venous&#xD;
      access even for temporary catheter .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same instructions as any arterio-arterial graft for hemodialysis were given to the&#xD;
      patient and the medical stuff at dialysis unit as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no medications given at the AAPL to avoid intra-arterial injection and acute ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only pulse which can be palpated at the graft but no thrill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patency of the graft is done by palpation of the distal pulsation (distal brachial or&#xD;
           radial artery) or duplex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The puncture site needs more time of compression than that needed for AV grafts.&#xD;
