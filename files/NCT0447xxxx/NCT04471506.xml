      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to determine the effect of interval training on sex hormones, metabolic and tumor markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer is one of death top causes in many countries1. In Egypt for example, cancer incidence&#xD;
      is 157.0 per 100 000 women with probability increasing up to three-fold by 2050 especially in&#xD;
      older adult women2. Who exhibit multiple factors leading to cancer including but not limited&#xD;
      to physical inactivity and postmenopausal obesity which considered the starting point of&#xD;
      developing insulin resistance3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High blood insulin level stimulates cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation,&#xD;
      decreasing cells apoptosis, increased level of fatty acids in conjunction with higher tumor&#xD;
      cell formation capacity invasion and survival4. Moreover, high level of insulin resistance&#xD;
      and adipose tissue increase the hormonal level of estradiol and testosterone coupled with&#xD;
      lower SHBG level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was noticed that being postmenopausal women with high adipose tissue content will increase&#xD;
      the risk of having cancer in which adipose tissue is considered as the main source of&#xD;
      steroids hormones that functioning in a different way rather than in premenopausal age. Based&#xD;
      on the mentioned underlying conditions, postmenopausal women subjected to have variable types&#xD;
      of cancer such as breast, endometrial, stomach, etc6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, regular screening of cancer incidence especially in high-risk women through tumor&#xD;
      indicators is necessitated to work against further cancer progression. CEA and CA125 are&#xD;
      low-cost tumor blood biomarkers used widely for early cancer identification, recurrence&#xD;
      monitoring and follow up which linked to proinflammatory cytokines production&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      may have no effect to interval training on sex hormones , metabolic and tumor markers in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there effect to interval training on sex hormones , metabolic and tumor markers in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women?&#xD;

      HIIT group involved in an exercise program three times per week for three months in form of&#xD;
      cycling protocol which will comprise 5 minutes warming up before exercise initiation and&#xD;
      another 5 minutes for cooling down by the end of exercise session in form slow pedaling (50%&#xD;
      of PHR). The work interval also will comprise 8-12 cycling intervals (60s cycling work&#xD;
      interval with 120s of passive rest or low-intensity cycling (70% of PHR) between work&#xD;
      intervals that progressively will be reduced until reaching 90s by the end of the exercise&#xD;
      program)17. Each work interval will be maintained at a range of 50-70 rpm (cycle revolutions)&#xD;
      with a speed between 20 and 40 km/h. Exercise intensity will be ≥ 85% of peak heart rate&#xD;
      (PHR) according to the Karvonen formula18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      which corresponds to 8-10 points on the modified Borg scale19. The exercise will be&#xD;
      supervised along the first week only with guidance to ensure that each participant masters&#xD;
      the optimal exercise procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be equipped with a pulse oximeter for continuous monitoring of the&#xD;
      heart rate prior to the start, during or just after the completion of the exercise session.&#xD;
      Healthy diet instructions will be recommended for those non-dietitian obese women without&#xD;
      following specific diet programs that could influence our results.&#xD;
