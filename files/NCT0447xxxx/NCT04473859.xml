        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female healthy subjects, 18-45 years of age and in good health as determined&#xD;
             by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and&#xD;
             laboratory tests at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must have been surgically sterilized at least six months prior to&#xD;
             screening. Surgical sterilization procedures must be supported with clinical&#xD;
             documentation made available to the sponsor and noted in the Relevant Medical History&#xD;
             / Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF. OR: Postmenopausal women must have no&#xD;
             regular menstrual bleeding for at least two years prior to inclusion. Menopause was to&#xD;
             be confirmed by a plasma 17β-estradiol concentration of &lt;20 pg/mL and a plasma FSH&#xD;
             level of &gt;40 IU/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal sitting blood pressure and pulse rate , i.e.: BP: 100 - 140 mm Hg systolic, 50&#xD;
             - 90 mm Hg diastolic and pulse rate: 45 - 100 bpm. Blood pressure and pulse were to be&#xD;
             measured after 3 minutes resting in a sitting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to communicate well with the investigator and comply with the requirements of&#xD;
             the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of serious adverse reactions or hypersensitivity to any drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or history of any allergy requiring acute or chronic treatment (seasonal)&#xD;
             allergic rhinitis which requires no treatment may be tolerated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse in the last 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal physical findings of clinical significance at the screening examination or&#xD;
             baseline which would interfere with the objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Need of any prescription medication within 14 days prior to the administration of the&#xD;
             drug and/or nonprescription medication within 7 days prior to the administration of&#xD;
             the drug or anticipated need for any concomitant medication during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical trial during the previous 4 weeks, i.e. from completion of&#xD;
             the previous trial to the planned first administration of the current trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Loss of 500 ml blood or more during the 3 month period before the study, e.g. as a&#xD;
             donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existence of any surgical or medical condition which might interfere with the&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of the drug, i.e. impaired renal or hepatic&#xD;
             function, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular abnormalities, chronic symptoms of&#xD;
             pronounced constipation or diarrhea or conditions associated with total or partial&#xD;
             obstruction of the urinary tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Symptoms of a significant somatic or mental illness in the two week period preceding drug&#xD;
        administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hepatitis B and / or C and / or positive serology results which indicate&#xD;
             the presence of hepatitis B and / or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive results from the HIV serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values (as determined by the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator) at the screening evaluation. Serum albumin below 3.5 g/l (Note to File&#xD;
             no. 8 states that the correct albumin value is below 35g/l) precludes study inclusion&#xD;
             in any case.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of serious mental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive results of the drug screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or clinical evidence of significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal,&#xD;
             hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematological, neurologic or other disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any active skin pathology including e.g., acne, acute sunburn,&#xD;
             inflammatory skin disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any open wounds or infection on the same arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of skin disorders e.g. atopic eczema or psoriasis or keloid reaction(s) Any&#xD;
             condition that constitutes a contraindication to minor surgical procedures (such as&#xD;
             bleeding disorders) or that obliges to the use of prophylactic antibiotics (such as&#xD;
             mitral valve prolapse) or other comedications for the performance of minor surgical&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
