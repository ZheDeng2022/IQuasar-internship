  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study to determine the RP2D of CI&#xD;
      8993 for administration to patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors by evaluating the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability and characterizing the PK, PD, and anti cancer activity of CI-8993 in&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plan is to enroll approximately 50 patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumor&#xD;
      malignancy (non-lymphoma) that is considered relapsed and/or refractory to prior therapy into&#xD;
      specific dose cohorts to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of full doses of CI-8993,&#xD;
      based on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) 28 days from the first full dose.&#xD;
      Administration is every 2 weeks. To assure patient safety, each patient will receive an&#xD;
      initial low dose of CI-8993 (step-dose) one week prior to their first full dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review all safety data and make cohort&#xD;
      escalation/de-escalation decisions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Each patient will be administered a step-dose of CI-8993. If a patient experiences a DLT following the step dose, treatment will be discontinued for that patient. If there are no safety concerns following the step dose, the patient will receive the first full dose of CI-8993 a week later. If none of the 3 patients in each cohort (or 1 in 6 patients) experiences a DLT during the first cycle (28 days following the first full dose), the SRC may clear the next dose level for enrollment.</intervention_model_description>
