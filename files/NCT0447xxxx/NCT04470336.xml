      Collagen Supplement is a natural ingredient that contains undenatured collagen derived from&#xD;
      chicken sternum. Collagen Supplement is efficacious and safe as compared to placebo and&#xD;
      efficacy is also comparable to glucosamine plus chondroitin for treatment of of knee&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic progressive degenerative disease involving thinning of&#xD;
      cartilage in movable joints that leads to friction between bones creating pain, stiffness,&#xD;
      and abnormal movement. It is estimated to affect more than 20% of the population over the age&#xD;
      of 60 years and is considered to be a major cause of morbidity, disability, and limitations&#xD;
      on the quality of life. In India, studies have reported the prevalence of 22% to 39%, with OA&#xD;
      being 2nd most common rheumatological disorder. , As global life expectancy increases, the&#xD;
      prevalence of OA is expected to rise further ultimately resulting in a greater burden for&#xD;
      healthcare. Currently, the management has largely been palliative, focusing on the&#xD;
      alleviation of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principles of OA treatments primarily are to alleviate pain and stiffness and maintain&#xD;
      function. The current treatment guidelines recommend a combination of physical therapy, use&#xD;
      of analgesia with Acetaminophen or NSAIDs, and surgical intervention when deemed necessary.&#xD;
      While medications slow the progression of OA and other inflammatory conditions, no proven&#xD;
      disease-modifying agents for the treatment of knee OA currently exists. The majority of&#xD;
      individuals are successfully managed with a combination of the aforementioned treatments, but&#xD;
      there is still a significant group of patients in whom these treatments do not provide&#xD;
      adequate relief. Furthermore, there remains a lack of treatments that have demonstrated&#xD;
      effectiveness in stopping or reversing the degenerative process. , Besides, there are&#xD;
      considerable side effects associated with the use of these drugs. As a result, OA sufferers&#xD;
      have turned to natural nutraceuticals to ease their pain and discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, several novel agents have emerged as potential treatment alternatives to&#xD;
      improve pain, stiffness, and function with the possibility of altering disease progression.&#xD;
      These products are commonly used because they are well tolerated and considered safe. Among&#xD;
      the OA patients, glucosamine and chondroitin are most commonly used and have shown to&#xD;
      considerably reduce the pain associated with arthritis. From the nutraceutical point of view,&#xD;
      there is a growing interest in Collagen Supplement as a solution for the treatment of OA. The&#xD;
      Collagen Supplement has been studied extensively in both animals as well as human clinical&#xD;
      studies. , Among animal studies, a study in the rat model of OA reported several benefits&#xD;
      after treatment, suggesting its potential for the prevention of worsening of articular&#xD;
      cartilage damage. In another study, porcine Collagen Supplement administration demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant reduction of pain intensity. Also, a lower dose regimen showed meaningful pain&#xD;
      reduction indicating its protective effect on the cartilage. Furthermore, several studies&#xD;
      have evaluated the efficacy and safety of Collagen Supplement in individuals suffering from&#xD;
      chronic OA. Crowley and colleagues showed that supplementation of Collagen Supplement for&#xD;
      three months is more efficacious as compared to the combination of glucosamine plus&#xD;
      chondroitin. In another study, 6-month administration of the Collagen Supplement&#xD;
      significantly reduced pain, stiffness, and physical functioning as compared to glucosamine&#xD;
      hydrochloride plus chondroitin sulfate group of participants with knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the available evidence it is clear that Collagen Supplement is effective in&#xD;
      improving joint discomfort associated with OA. Moreover, collagen products are also&#xD;
      recognized as safe components of pharmaceutical and foods by the US Food and Drugs&#xD;
      Administration Center for Food Safety and Nutrition. Hence, considering its symptomatic&#xD;
      benefits, the structural effect on the cartilage and its important role in bone structure,&#xD;
      Collagen Supplement is thought to be a viable alternative for OA patients. , Therefore, the&#xD;
      present study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an collagen supplementation in&#xD;
      participants suffering from knee OA. Study volunteers will be supplemented with Collagen&#xD;
      Supplement, an collagen product for 12 weeks and assessed as per study designated efficacy&#xD;
      and safety variables. Also, the efficacy and efficacy of Collagen Supplement will be compared&#xD;
      with Glucosamine HCL plus chondroitin sulfate and placebo as per the set study intervals.&#xD;
