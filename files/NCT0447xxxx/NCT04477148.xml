  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reusable laryngoscope blades, which are the most commonly used devices for airway management,&#xD;
      have been reported to be frequently contaminated and a possible source of infection. Although&#xD;
      disposable laryngoscope blades are recommended to reduce the risk of infection, there are&#xD;
      studies suggesting increased failed intubation attempt rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major cause of anesthesia-related mortality and morbidity is the failure of airway&#xD;
      management. The incidence of difficult airway is reported to be 1-4% in normal population&#xD;
      while it ranges up to 12-20% in obese patients. Following the introduction of disposable&#xD;
      blades and considering the increased rate of failed intubation in obese patients with these&#xD;
      devices, the investigators aimed to make a comparison of successful intubation rates of&#xD;
      plastic and metallic disposable blades in morbidly obese patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Successful airway management is the first and most important step of patient safety in&#xD;
      anesthesia practice, and most common reason of morbidity and mortality related to anesthesia&#xD;
      is failure to provide optimum airway safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation helps the anesthesiologist have complete control over airway by keeping airway&#xD;
      open, facilitating control over ventilation, reducing the risk of aspiration and providing&#xD;
      safe airway during resuscitation, and laryngoscopes are most commonly used tools for this&#xD;
      purpose. Laryngoscope are comprised of a handle and a blade (also contains light source)&#xD;
      which are mostly reusable. But these parts are easily contaminated during intubation,&#xD;
      creating susceptibility to infection. Some studies report that even handles have a chance of&#xD;
      50% to be contaminated with blood. Insufficiently disinfected blades are also a major source&#xD;
      of infection. Laryngoscopes contact with non-intact mucous membranes and blood frequently,&#xD;
      thus play an important role in cross contamination. Abramson et al. reported that 1/3 of&#xD;
      reusable laryngoscope blades are contaminated with bacteria after multiple uses. Concerns&#xD;
      about hygiene and risk of infection (including prion infections) caused many health&#xD;
      professionals tend towards use of disposable medical devices. Following their introduction,&#xD;
      single use laryngoscope blades have been subject to many studies, and many opinions were&#xD;
      discussed in different platforms. In studies in which intubation success rates of metallic&#xD;
      reusable, metallic disposable and plastic disposable blades were compared, while some have&#xD;
      demonstratedd their success rates to be identical, others concluded that plastic disposable&#xD;
      blades were ineffective compared to two other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation may not be easily performed in every case. Airway&#xD;
      management and endotracheal intubation are easier in non-obese patients compared to obese&#xD;
      patients. Short and relatively immobile neck, narrow interincisor distance, hypertrophic&#xD;
      tonsillae, uvula and adenoids in obese patients makes intubation more difficult in these&#xD;
      patients. Additionally, loss of muscle tonus causes tongue to obstruct airway and epiglottis&#xD;
      to touch posterior wall of pharynx, thus obstructing airway further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators couldn't find any study conducted on obese patients evaluating success&#xD;
      rates for intubation of metallic reusable, metallic disposable and plastic disposable blades&#xD;
      in the literature. In this study, they aimed to compare intubation success rates of metallic&#xD;
      reusable, metallic disposable and plastic disposable blades in intubation of obese patients.&#xD;
