  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of sex on postoperative pain, following&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Patients will first be stratified by sex and then be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two multimodal analgesic regimen (MAR), which differ in presence of&#xD;
      pregabalin. We hypothesize that that acute postoperative pain scores are different over time&#xD;
      between males and females and between multimodal analgesic regimens following TKA.&#xD;
      Investigators will be blinded to which multimodal group patients are in. Patients will&#xD;
      complete surveys in the office, during their hospital stay, and at followup intervals for up&#xD;
      to six months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to better understand the influence of patient-sex on&#xD;
      postoperative pain perception in men versus women following total knee arthroplasty (TKA)&#xD;
      utilizing two different multimodal analgesia regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregabalin is a neuromuscular antagonist of voltage gated calcium channels at the&#xD;
      post-synaptic dorsal horns in the spinal cord and brain. It binds to the alpha-2-delta&#xD;
      subunit and interrupts pain signal transmission. The use of pregabalin as part of multimodal&#xD;
      pain control has been associated with a decrease in postoperative opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, single-blinded control trial in which patients either will or will&#xD;
      not receive pregabalin as part of their multimodal analgesia regimen following TKA. It will&#xD;
      be performed at a single institution, with multiple tertiary academic centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will first be grouped according to their sex, then randomized into one of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Multimodal analgesia regimen including pregabalin;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Multimodal analgesia regimen not including pregabalin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention group, patient will be provided with an oral preoperative pregabalin&#xD;
      dose of 150mg on the day of surgery. Patient will continue pregabalin 75mg two times a day,&#xD;
      for two weeks postoperatively. For both both groups, the operative technique and additional&#xD;
      perioperative analgesic modalities will follow a standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Acute postoperative pain difference (up to 72 hours), measured by 100mm&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) while at rest and mobilization, between males and females and&#xD;
      between multimodal analgesic regimens in patients undergoing TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain control measured by 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS) while at rest and&#xD;
           mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain control additionally measured by morphine equivalent units (MEq).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of postoperative days to opioid cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain measured by Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical function measured by KOOS, physical component summary (PCS-12) of VR-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental health measured by mental component summary (MCS-12) of VR-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety will be tracked by adverse reactions reported or observed by investigators. These&#xD;
           will be collected via patient communication and review of the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additionally, severity of common short-term postoperative complications like nausea,&#xD;
           vomiting, dizziness, and sedation will be assessed by 100mm VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study recruitment phase is estimated to last for 6 months. Subject followup is 6 months.&#xD;
