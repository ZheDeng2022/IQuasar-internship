  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are very often sarcopenic/malnourished&#xD;
      at diagnosis (&gt; 60% of cases) and at high risk of rapid clinical deterioration. These&#xD;
      patients have important supportive care needs that represent a major challenge for improving&#xD;
      treatment tolerance and patient survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition and sarcopenia (muscle wasting and dysfunction) are associated with an increased&#xD;
      risk of death, complications from chemotherapy, infections, emergency procedures and&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and increased costs of care. Therefore, malnutrition and sarcopenia&#xD;
      represent a major clinical target in GI cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions targeting malnutrition/sarcopenia should be implemented as early as possible in&#xD;
      patients' pathways, these syndromes being reversible at early stages but not at late stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multidisciplinary assessment at diagnosis and therapeutic approach combining nutritional&#xD;
      support and and adapted physical activity (APA) in addition to anticancer treatments should&#xD;
      be systematically implemented in patients with advanced GI cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of intervention complies with the standards recommended by the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (INCa) to promote the practice of physical activity during and after treatment in&#xD;
      oncology.&#xD;

      All patients will receive usual care including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy at the investigator's choice,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient clinical visits according to the regular schedule,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor evaluation based on tumor marker serum levels, as appropriate, and TAP-CT with&#xD;
           intravenous contrast injection every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional support will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A nutrition assessment by a dietician including a VAS of food intakes at baseline, at W4&#xD;
           and W8 (plus additional visits if required),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutritional intervention according to the Société Francophone de Nutrition Clinique et&#xD;
           Métabolisme (SFNEP) guidelines (dietetic counseling for all patients ± oral&#xD;
           supplementation, enteral tube feeding, and/or parenteral nutrition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity support will consist of physical condition assessed by International&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), performance status (ECOG PS), resting heart rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure, 6-minute walking test (speed, fatigue), handgrip test, chair stand fitness&#xD;
      test, get-up and go test, balance in single-leg and bipodal stance.&#xD;
