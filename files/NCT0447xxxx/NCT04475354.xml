  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: A growing number of cervical cancer patients live years beyond their cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis and ultimately survive their disease. Cervical cancer patients report higher levels&#xD;
      of psychological distress compared to other (gynecological) cancer types, resulting in&#xD;
      physical and psychosocial limitations. The mechanisms explaining why some patients do, and&#xD;
      others do not experience persistent psychological distress after cervical cancer remain&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Gain insight into the mechanisms explaining psychological distress (i.e. anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, cancer worry, perceived stress) in a prospective population-based sample of&#xD;
      cervical cancer patients. Factors to be studied include characteristics of the individual&#xD;
      (demographical and clinical, including comorbidities), characteristics of the environment&#xD;
      ((sexual) relationships), biological function (cortisol, melatonin and sex hormone production&#xD;
      assessed in scalp hair, inflammation and telomere length assessed in blood, overall quality&#xD;
      of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), symptoms (EORTC QLQ-CX24), functional status (physical activity and&#xD;
      sleep measured using the Actigraph activity tracker, and food intake measured using the&#xD;
      online 'Eetmeter'), and general health perceptions (B-IPQ). The second aim is to assess the&#xD;
      impact of cervical cancer on partners' distress (cancer worry, illness perceptions,&#xD;
      relationship quality, dyadic coping).&#xD;

      Study design: Prospective population-based study in which cervical cancer patients and their&#xD;
      partners are included shortly after diagnosis and followed until 10 years after diagnosis.&#xD;
      Patients from treatment centres in the Netherlands and their partners will be asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires after diagnosis, after 6 months, and after 1, 2, 5 and 10 year.&#xD;
      Clinical data like disease stage, initial treatment and mortality will be extracted from the&#xD;
      Netherlands Cancer Registry. In a subsample of patients, additionally objective lifestyle&#xD;
      (actigraph, biosensor) and biological (blood, hair) measures are assessed at diagnosis and&#xD;
      after 6, 12 and 24 months. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Newly diagnosed stage 1-3 cervical cancer patients (N=520) and their&#xD;
      partners (N=312, expected) from any treatment centre in the Netherlands will be asked to fill&#xD;
      out questionnaires. In a subsample of patients (N=116) additionally lifestyle and biological&#xD;
      measures are assessed at all time-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: psychological distress (anxiety, depression, perceived&#xD;
      stress, cancer worry)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Patients and partners are asked to complete a questionnaire at 6 points in time:&#xD;
      after diagnosis, after 6 months, and after 1, 2, 5 and 10 year. Patients will additionally be&#xD;
      asked to complete an online food diary for 3 days. A subsample of patients will be asked to&#xD;
      donate blood samples (2X10 ml, 10 minutes) to assess inflammation markers and telomere&#xD;
      length, to donate a scalp hair sample (10 mg) to assess hormone production after diagnosis&#xD;
      and after 6, 12 and 24 months, and to wear an Actigraph activity tracker to assess physical&#xD;
      activity and sleep and a Philips Biosensor to assess heart rate variability as a marker of&#xD;
      vagal nerve function at 6, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
