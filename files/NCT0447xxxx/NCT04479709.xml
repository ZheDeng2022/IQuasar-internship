  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An altered urinary microbiome (UM) may explain the symptoms in overactive bladder (OAB)&#xD;
      patients who were previously considered to have &quot;idiopathic&quot; OAB. To date, most research on&#xD;
      the relationship between OAB and the UM has focused on differentiating between the UM of a&#xD;
      normal bladder and that of an OAB bladder. There is currently a paucity of data on the way&#xD;
      that OAB therapy impacts the UM. One of the few studies to evaluate the UM pre- and post-OAB&#xD;
      treatment focused on how management with solifenacin affected the UM, but no studies have&#xD;
      evaluated how intravesical onabotulinumtoxin A injections (IOI) affects the UM. Understanding&#xD;
      IOI's impact on the UM is particularly interesting because despite both anticholinergics and&#xD;
      IOI exerting antimuscarinic affects on the bladder, IOI is often successful when&#xD;
      anticholinergics are not. This raises the question of what other mechanisms of action IOI may&#xD;
      have in the bladders of OAB patients - one hypothesis is that it might stabilize the UM in&#xD;
      those select patients who suffer from OAB due to an altered UM. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is therefore to determine the UM profiles of OAB patients before and after treatment&#xD;
      with IOI.&#xD;
