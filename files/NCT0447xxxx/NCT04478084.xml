      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the immune response induced by VRVg-2 and Verorab vaccine at D14 (to assess the&#xD;
      immune response after 3 doses [2-2-2]) and D42 (to assess the immune response after 4 doses&#xD;
      [2-2-2-0-2]) when administered as standalone in healthy pediatric population or&#xD;
      co-administered with HRIG (Group 5 and Group 6) at D0 in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response induced by VRVg-2 and Verorab vaccine at D14 (to assess&#xD;
           the immune response after 3 doses [2-2-2]) when co-administered with ERIG (Group 3 and&#xD;
           Group 4) at D0 in healthy adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response induced by VRVg-2 and Verorab vaccine at D90 (to assess&#xD;
           the immune response 90 days post-rabies simulated exposure, which covers the rabies&#xD;
           incubation period of the majority of cases) when administered as standalone in healthy&#xD;
           pediatric population or co-administered with HRIG (Group 5 and Group 6) at D0 in healthy&#xD;
           adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of VRVg-2 and Verorab vaccine as standalone in pediatric&#xD;
           population or when co-administered with ERIG (Group 3 and Group 4) or HRIG (Group 5 and&#xD;
           Group 6) at D0 in adults, after each vaccination&#xD;
