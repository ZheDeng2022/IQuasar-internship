  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      fezolinetant and ES259564 (fezolinetant metabolite) in female participants with varying&#xD;
      levels of renal impairment (mild, moderate and severe) compared to healthy female&#xD;
      participants with normal renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      fezolinetant in female participants with varying levels of renal impairment (mild, moderate&#xD;
      and severe) and healthy female participants with normal renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal function will be measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the&#xD;
      modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula: Mild (eGFR 60 to &lt; 90 mL/min per 1.73&#xD;
      m^2) renal impairment; moderate (eGFR 30 to &lt; 60 mL/min per 1.73 m^2) renal impairment,&#xD;
      severe (eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min per 1.73 m^2) renal impairment and not on hemodialysis and normal&#xD;
      (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min per 1.73 m^2) renal function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be comprised of four groups of participants based on renal function.&#xD;
      Participants will be screened for up to 28 days prior to investigational product (IP)&#xD;
      administration on Day 1. Eligible participants with mild, moderate and severe renal function&#xD;
      and healthy participants with normal renal function will be admitted to the clinical unit on&#xD;
      Day -1 and will be residential for a single period of six days/five nights. On Day 1,&#xD;
      participants will receive a single oral dose of fezolinetant under fasting conditions&#xD;
      followed by a 96-hour in-house blood and urine sampling period. Participants are to remain&#xD;
      awake, seated or semirecumbent and avoid lying on either the left or right side for at least&#xD;
      four hours postdose. Standard safety and tolerability assessments will be conducted.&#xD;
      Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on Day 5 on the condition that all&#xD;
      required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical reasons for a longer&#xD;
      stay in the clinical unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place five to&#xD;
      nine days after the last pharmacokinetic sample is collected or at early discontinuation from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
