  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suffering a traumatic event is a potential risk factor for developing Posttraumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder (PTSD) with or without comorbidities with other pathologies that can become chronic&#xD;
      with time, including fibromyalgia. Different study results show the existence of an&#xD;
      association between living traumatic events and developing fibromyalgia. However, studies in&#xD;
      the field have not evaluated thoroughly the nature of traumatic events, the subsequent&#xD;
      development of PTSD and the degree to which it can cause an impairment. These results will&#xD;
      allow us increase the knowledge about the effects of comorbidity between both medical&#xD;
      conditions, get to know in depth the type of traumatic events that female patients with FM&#xD;
      suffer, and express the importance of the implementation of a therapeutic approach which&#xD;
      takes into account the existing psychological symptoms in addition to the main principal&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia (FM) affects 2-4% of the general population with typical symptoms being&#xD;
      generalized and widespread pain, sleep disturbances, problems in memory and attention,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression. Different studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between the&#xD;
      presence of psychological trauma and FM, in terms of sexual and physical abuse, chronic&#xD;
      stress and adverse lifetime events. According to some studies, the prevalence of&#xD;
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in patients with FM is 45,3%, while in the general&#xD;
      population it appears to be between 1.3%-12.3%. Nevertheless, current therapeutic approaches&#xD;
      do not take into account the assessment and treatment of this risk factor, therefore the&#xD;
      clinical benefits obtained are limited. Moreover, existing studies in the field do not carry&#xD;
      out a thorough clinical characterization of these traumatic events. As a result, there is a&#xD;
      lack of consensus about the prevalence of the different types of traumatic events and their&#xD;
      temporality, as well as a lack of awareness of the level of interference and impairment in&#xD;
      patients with FM. Additionally, studies done on the topic are subject to important&#xD;
      methodological biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to everything explained above, we consider that studying the prevalence and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of the possible traumatic events in patients with FM has a great relevance&#xD;
      and clinical importance, due to the considerable negative impact they have across the&#xD;
      beginning, curse and prognosis of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the project is to study de prevalence and characterization of traumatic&#xD;
      events in a sample of women diagnosed with FM and their association with FM's clinical&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the study intends to analyze the existence of specific characteristics of&#xD;
      traumatic events, such as the age when the event was experienced, the type of trauma&#xD;
      (interpersonal o intrapersonal; simple or complex; single or repeated in time, etc.) that can&#xD;
      be predictors or explicative of the patterns presented by these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants who have suffered traumatic events during childhood, of the interpersonal&#xD;
           type and repeated in time will be associated with greater severity of FM and higher&#xD;
           levels of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who have suffered traumatic events during childhood, of the interpersonal&#xD;
           type and repeated in time will present greater severity in the clinical symptoms of&#xD;
           trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants who have suffered traumatic events during childhood, of the interpersonal&#xD;
           type and repeated in time will present higher severity in affective symptoms, sleep&#xD;
           disturbances and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a transversal descriptive study in which the Rheumatology Service, Adult Mental&#xD;
      Health Service and Primary Care Centers of the Parc de Salut Mar will participate. The&#xD;
      evaluations will be carried out in a single interview with the duration of 1 hour and a half,&#xD;
      and will be conducted by specialized psychologists of the Centre Forum Research Unit (IMIM).&#xD;
      Participants will have the choice to attend the assessment in the Centre Forum C/Llull 410,&#xD;
      08019) or in the Rheumatology Service (CAP Vila Olímpica, C/Joan Miró 17, 08005) of the Parc&#xD;
      de Salut Mar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During assessment sociodemographic, clinical and pharmacological data will be collected.&#xD;
      Additionally, through the use of evaluation scales, pain and FM impact, psychological trauma&#xD;
      related symptoms, clinical symptoms, insomnia and quality of life will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data analysis will be carried out using the R statistics package. Logic, range and data&#xD;
      consistency tests will be applied to clean the data. In the same way, the different&#xD;
      distributions of the variables will be obtained in order to facilitate the detection of&#xD;
      possible errors in the data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis will be carried out of all the identified variables in the study.&#xD;
      Likewise, regression analysis will be used to predict the pain severity index (EVA, PDI, FIQ)&#xD;
      based on trauma-related variables (CTQ, IES-R, SUD, DES, SDQ-20), and to predict the clinical&#xD;
      severity index (HADS, AIS, SWLS) based on the pain-related variables (EVA, PDI, FIQ).&#xD;
      Redundant variables will be eliminated from the model in order to identify the smallest&#xD;
      possible group of predictors to explain a substantial amount of the variation in the&#xD;
      dependent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To control a possible confusion bias, an adjustment model will be defined to study the&#xD;
      influence of other variables and analyse possible confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A general lineal model will be used for independent variables of more than 2 categories and&#xD;
      two sample t-tests will be used for variables of 2 categories. Where data does not meet&#xD;
      criteria for parametric tests, non parametric tests will be used.&#xD;

    <measure>Presence of Postraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) evaluated with the Evaluación Global de Estrés Postraumático (EGEP-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of Postraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) will be assessed using the EGEP-5, a 55-item clinician-administered scale based on DSM-V criteria. There are three different sections: presence of traumatic events, symptoms and functioning. The scale can determine a diagnosis of PTSD, specifying the presence of dissociative symptoms (depersonalization and derealization) and delayed expression.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Levels of trauma associated symptoms assessed with the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological trauma will be evaluated using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised. This scale consists in 22-item to determine frequency and impact of posttraumatic symptoms experienced, with subscales of intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal, each scored on a 5-point Likert scale, yielding a score for each subscale and a total score. This scale has a scoring range of 0 to 88. On this test, scores that exceed 24 can be quite meaningful. High scores have the following associations: 24 or more PTSD is a clinical concern. Those with scores this high who do not have full PTSD will have partial PTSD or at least some of the symptoms; 33 and above represents the best cutoff for a probable diagnosis of PTSD; 37 or more this is high enough to suppress your immune system's functioning (even 10 years after an impact event).</description>
