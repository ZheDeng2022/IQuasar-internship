  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first time in human (FTIH) study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and repeat ascending&#xD;
      doses of GSK2556286 following oral administration in healthy adult participants. A food&#xD;
      effect (FE) cohort will investigate the influence of food on the PK of GSK2556286. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted in two parts. Part A will be a single ascending dose (SAD), sequential,&#xD;
      parallel cohort design including up to 8 cohorts (Cohort 1A to cohort 8A) and Part B will be&#xD;
      a multiple ascending dose (MAD), sequential, parallel dose cohort design including up to 4&#xD;
      cohorts (Cohort 1B to cohort 4B). In each cohort of Part A and Part B, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive single and repeated oral doses, respectively, of either GSK2556286 or&#xD;
      matching placebo, administered in a 3:1 ratio according to the randomization schedule in a&#xD;
      blinded manner. In Part A, Cohort 1A till cohort 6A will be dosed under fasted conditions and&#xD;
      Cohort 7A and cohort 8A will be dosed under fed conditions. Cohort 7A will investigate the&#xD;
      effect of food administration (high fat meal) on safety, tolerability and PK after a single&#xD;
      dose of GSK2556286. Based on emerging data, a second food effect cohort (Cohort 8A) may also&#xD;
      be included using a higher dose of GSK2556286. Progression from Part A to Part B will be&#xD;
      based on an acceptable safety, tolerability and PK profile in Part A. In Part B, participants&#xD;
      in each cohort will receive a daily oral dose of GSK2556286 over a period of up to 14 days.&#xD;
      Part B may include drug administration after either fed or fasted conditions, dependent on&#xD;
      the results from Part A. Sentinel dosing will be used in each cohort in Part A and Part B.&#xD;
      Participants can only take part in one dose cohort in either Part A or B of the study.&#xD;
