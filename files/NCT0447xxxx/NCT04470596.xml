    <textblock>
      Early bacterial neonatal infection (INBP) defined as occurring in the first 3 days and by&#xD;
      extension in the first week of life, remains to this day the leading cause of neonatal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The germs most frequently found are&#xD;
      Streptococcus B (SB) for term newborns (&gt; 37 Weeks of Amenorrhea SA) and Escherichia coli (E.&#xD;
      coli) in premature newborns. Although in France, its incidence of 0.4 / 1000 is lower than in&#xD;
      other developed countries (0.8 / 1000 general incidence), it remains a major public health&#xD;
      concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infection criteria were defined by the National Agency for Health Accreditation and&#xD;
      Assessment (ANAES) in 2002, allowing to differentiate between proven infections and highly&#xD;
      probable cases of infection. Infection is considered to be proven when SB or E. coli is&#xD;
      detected in blood culture or in cerebrospinal fluid. An infection is considered to be highly&#xD;
      probable in the event of association of clinical signs (fever, polypnea, desaturation,&#xD;
      tachycardia, etc.) evoking a beginning sepsis associating with a disturbance of the&#xD;
      biological balance sheet (elevation of CRP, hyperleukocytosis, evidence of colonization on&#xD;
      peripheral samples). These criteria remain valid to this day to define the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to define the newborns to be monitored, risk factors were established after a review&#xD;
      of the literature in 2002. They make it possible to decide on diagnostic management and / or&#xD;
      the setting up of a treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the recommendations of the ANAES of 2002, the rule, from the presence of a major&#xD;
      criterion, was to carry out bacteriological samples peripheral to the birth (gastric liquid,&#xD;
      swab of ear and anus) and to systematically collect a CRP of the child between H12 and H48.&#xD;
      In the presence of an isolated minor risk factor, simple clinical monitoring (routine) was&#xD;
      recommended for 48 hours without deciding firmly on the need for a biological sample.&#xD;
      However, it is important to note that these two categories of signs are defined and&#xD;
      classified in descending order of risk. This classification does not prejudge a systematic&#xD;
      therapeutic attitude. In many situations, the choice is actually left to the practitioner&#xD;
      depending on the context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017, new recommendations were implemented by the French Society of Pediatrics (SFP) and&#xD;
      the French Society of Neonatology (SFN) regarding the prevention of INBP. These take up the&#xD;
      risk factors of the 2002 ANAES by adding PCR SB at the same level as the traditional PV. They&#xD;
      define 3 categories of children according to the risk of INBP and the associated care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases, these new practices make it possible to dispense with costly blood and&#xD;
      bacteriological samples, which cause discomfort and pain for children. In addition, the use&#xD;
      of gastric fluid is not internationally validated, its use in the management case remains&#xD;
      very controversial. In case of delayed CRP or positive peripheral samples to the germs&#xD;
      generated, and even in the absence of clinical signs, antibiotic therapy was almost&#xD;
      systematically initiated. Unnecessary exposure to antibiotics promotes the development of&#xD;
      bacteriological resistance and unbalances the neonatal flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the implementation of these new recommendations at the Notre Dame de Bon Secours&#xD;
      maternity hospital, which is the case in few centers today and no national survey has yet&#xD;
      been carried out on their application, it therefore seems necessary to us evaluate the&#xD;
      application of these new recommendations and verify that they allow the detection of all&#xD;
      probable or proven infections.&#xD;
