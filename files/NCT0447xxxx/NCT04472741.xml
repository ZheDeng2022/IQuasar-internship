      Retrospective data analysis of comparsion of 3 types of colonoscopes in daily practice (FUSE&#xD;
      Full spectrum colonoscopy with 330° angle of view vs Pentax standard HD-colonoscopes and&#xD;
      Pentax plus Endocuff): medical device of the category IIb (CE-marked device used within its&#xD;
      intended purpose)&#xD;

      From March 2015 through February 2017 (phase A) patients referred for ambulant colonoscopy in&#xD;
      a private Swiss gastroenterologist's practice were alternatingly allocated to one of the two&#xD;
      endoscopy theatres. One equipped with a FUSE® endoscopy system from Endochoice (later: Boston&#xD;
      Scientific, nA/FUSE®=1044 examinations), the other with an EPKi Processor and Pentax i10&#xD;
      colonoscopes (nA/Pentax=934 examinations). In March 2017 a second doctor joined the practice,&#xD;
      but did not contribute to the study. These organizational changes required randomization to&#xD;
      be switched from per-patient alternation to per-day alternation in phase B from March 2018&#xD;
      through September 2019. In phase B the FUSE® system was unchanged (nB/FUSE®=1386&#xD;
      examinations), while the Pentax i10 colonoscopes were additionally equipped with Endocuff®&#xD;
      (nB/Endocuff®=750 examinations). Patients with contraindica-tion against Endocuff® (known or&#xD;
      found diverticular stenosis) were excluded from the study (nB/removed=127). Patients were&#xD;
      given their appointments to any free slot throughout the week without stratification. The&#xD;
      study and data analysis was consented by the ethical committee EKNZ Ethikkom-mission&#xD;
      Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz (Project-ID 2019-01643).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures were performed by one experienced endoscopist (board certified 2004) under&#xD;
      nurse assisted propofol sedation (NAPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics, age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, diabetes as well as quality of bowel&#xD;
      prepara-tion (measured by BBPS score) and indication for colonoscopy (screening,&#xD;
      surveillance, diagnostic, such as diarrhea, bleeding, persistent abdominal pain) were&#xD;
      assessed. Amount of sedatives, other medications given during endoscopy (e.g. Buscopan®) and&#xD;
      time for the endoscopy e.g. time to ile-um, retraction time (pullback time minus intervention&#xD;
      time) and time for intervention were measured by the assistant with a stopwatch. These&#xD;
      parameters, polyp counts, size and their localisation (entered in a table and to an&#xD;
      anatomical scheme), and satisfaction for all parts of the examination (bowel prep and overall&#xD;
      satisfaction) were realtime entered to the database by a tablet computer. The data entry was&#xD;
      done coded. Only the main investigator could subdue each single patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics were done with a professional statistics, the co-author Dr. Leiner&#xD;
