  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug, romiplostim, helps low platelet count&#xD;
      caused by the standard blood cancer treatment of chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic&#xD;
      cell transplantation. This study will also look at whether romiplostim can decrease the&#xD;
      number of times the participant needs to return to the clinic for platelet transfusions to&#xD;
      treat their low platelet count. In addition, the researchers will determine how safe it is to&#xD;
      give romiplostim to people with blood cancer who have received treatment with chemotherapy&#xD;
      and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be enrolled prior to admission for High-Dose Therapy and Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HDT-AHCT), and they will undergo their planned HDT-AHCT for their respective hematologic malignancy as per institutional standards.&#xD;
Regardless of the conditioning regimen received, all patients will receive romiplostim 3.0 mcg/kg SC on Day +1 and romiplostim 2.0 mcg/kg SC on Day +8 after HDT-AHCT. Beyond Day +8, patients will be treated until platelet count is &gt;50,000/mcL, without any platelet transfusions in the prior 48 hours. All doses after the second romiplostim dose will be titrated as per Table 3, based on weekly CBC/platelet counts. No patient will receive more than six doses of romiplostim, even if platelets have not corrected by Day +42.</description>
