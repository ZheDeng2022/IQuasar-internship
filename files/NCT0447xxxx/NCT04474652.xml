    <textblock>
      GPs in primary care in England currently refer over 2.17 million patients per year with vague&#xD;
      symptoms to the urgent cancer referral pathway. While this catches over 150,000 cancer cases&#xD;
      each year, 93% of the referred patients do not have cancer. For breast cancer, GPs refer&#xD;
      343,000 cases per year. Each of these patients are referred to a one stop clinic for&#xD;
      diagnosis. The Leeds teaching Hospitals' Trusts' Breast Unit, receives 10,000 per year, with&#xD;
      only 5% of patients actually being diagnosed with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breast cancer pathway involves a triple assessment process, which includes a clinical&#xD;
      examination, imaging (mammogram or ultrasound) and possibly a biopsy test. It is a&#xD;
      particularly expensive process as it is an imagingintense pathway; this places considerable&#xD;
      strain on NHS diagnostic facilities. Small changes will not be enough to solve this problem -&#xD;
      a new approach is needed. The purpose of this study is to see if we can develop a blood test&#xD;
      that can support doctors in identifying patients for whom the likelihood of having breast&#xD;
      cancer is extremely low. This would avoid unnecessary referral for those patients to the one&#xD;
      stop clinic. Patients with higher chances of suspected breast cancer would be referred to the&#xD;
      one stop clinic in the usual way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key to the idea of safely &quot;ruling-out&quot; patients is that the test must not miss patients who&#xD;
      do have cancer. By measuring a broad range of indicators (markers) in blood, the test will&#xD;
      provide a more accurate picture of the underlying biology. The test is also being developed&#xD;
      within the NHS, so that it can be adopted quickly into NHS computer systems and laboratories&#xD;
      to maximise patient benefit, whilst being held to the NHS's high standards for clinical&#xD;
      evidence and value.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Following on from the service evaluation of retrospective TWW cases within The Leeds Teaching&#xD;
      Hospitals Trust (between 2011-2018), the aim is to undertake a prospective analysis of a&#xD;
      cohort of patients (4000) that have been referred from primary care (via their GP) for&#xD;
      possible breast cancer diagnosis in the Leeds area. The analysis will include de-identified&#xD;
      routine clinical data and blood tests from patients on the primary care referral cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis pathway for cancer risk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is intended as a non-interventional study, where results from this study will not&#xD;
      influence patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 3 phases/workstreams:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validate previously developed prototype algorithm (computer instructions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Update algorithm incorporating additional blood biomarkers and other relevant clinical&#xD;
           data&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Validate diagnostic accuracy of updated algorithm The study will include 4000 patients&#xD;
           on TWW pathways. Note: The TWW pathway constitutes part of the urgent cancer referral&#xD;
           pathway. This study aims to address a major unmet clinical need for breast cancer&#xD;
           services within the NHS by safely combining the wealth of routinely collected clinical&#xD;
           data and testing of blood samples within the NHS, with secure IT infrastructure in the&#xD;
           NHS and the University of Leeds, to efficiently develop a risk assessment tool (guide)&#xD;
           to rule-out cancer within a routine NHS environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age â‰¥ 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male and female patient must have been referred from primary care for possible breast&#xD;
           cancer diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient consented to have blood tests The data sets will be divided into a development&#xD;
           and validation data set (50:50 split). A range of statistical approaches will be&#xD;
           performed on the training data set. The algorithm parameters will then be 'locked down'&#xD;
           and validated on the remaining test data set. Performance will be assessed via ROC&#xD;
           (Receiver Operator Characteristic) curves, sensitivity and specificity,&#xD;
           Area-Under-Curve, negative/positive predictive values and diagnostic odds ratios. The&#xD;
           algorithm generation and data analysis will be conducted at the University of Leeds,&#xD;
           specifically within a secure VRE within the Leeds Institute for Data analytics (LIDA).&#xD;
           Particular scrutiny will be given to the test set patients most likely to be false&#xD;
           negatives in this analysis (i.e. those patients with cancer whose predicted probability&#xD;
           is very low). Key to further improvements in this approach will be to characterise this&#xD;
           sub-group and identify possible ways in which they might be identified by an improved&#xD;
           analysis in a future study. Eligible participants will be observed electronically for 2&#xD;
           years post blood testing to ensure any patients with undetected cancer, who develop&#xD;
           cancer within a year, are not missed. The study will end once the consented sample and&#xD;
           data retention periods have completed therefore the expected duration of project is 5&#xD;
           years.&#xD;
