      labor and postpartum period in pregnant women in their last trimester.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During pregnancy and after childbirth, women experience many physical, emotional and&#xD;
      psychological changes and try to cope with them1. Many women have fear of childbirth and&#xD;
      anxiety for various reasons such as uncertainties about labor, labor pain, loss of control&#xD;
      and giving birth alone 2,3. Several studies have shown that 12%-31% of the pregnant women&#xD;
      experience fear of childbirth 4-6. The sources of worries are usually the possible risk of&#xD;
      harm to women themselves or their babies and attitudes and insufficient knowledge of health&#xD;
      staff2,6-8. These prenatal worries may lead to pain and restlessness during labor, emergency&#xD;
      cesarean section and postpartum affective disorders 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress experienced during pregnancy affects not only maternal health but also childbirth&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g. preterm labor and low birth weight) 9. Anxiety most frequently experienced in&#xD;
      the first and last trimesters are not directly associated with obstetric complications;&#xD;
      however, it may cause obstetric complications due to the changes it created in the endocrine&#xD;
      system1,7,9. Although labor pain can be due to physiological changes such as cervix&#xD;
      dilatation and uterus contractions, it may result from psychological factors like stress,&#xD;
      anxiety and fear 10. In several studies, the relation between state and trait anxiety scores&#xD;
      just before or during childbirth and pain experienced during labor has been evaluated 11,12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the purpose of the antenatal care is to&#xD;
      help women to have a positive childbirth experience 13. Positive expectations about&#xD;
      childbirth during pregnancy may lead to a positive childbirth experience, while anxiety, fear&#xD;
      or negative expectations can create a negative childbirth experience 14. Several studies have&#xD;
      shown that antenatal education decreases anxiety and labor pain 15,16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is of importance to reveal worries and anxiety experienced by pregnant women during and&#xD;
      after childbirth and to evaluate their relationship with labor pain in terms of provision of&#xD;
      higher-quality antenatal care and development of more effective coping strategies to deal&#xD;
      with these problems. Thereby, women may be more healthy during their pregnancy and have a&#xD;
      positive childbirth experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to determine the relation of labor pain with worries about childbirth and&#xD;
      the postpartum period and state-trait anxiety levels in pregnant women in the last trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS The study has a descriptive, prospective design and was conducted in the&#xD;
      obstetric clinic of a research and education hospital between January and November in 2014.&#xD;
      The study population included the pregnant women in their third trimester presenting to the&#xD;
      obstetrics outpatient clinic of the hospital at the time of the study and the sample&#xD;
      comprised 115 pregnant women planning to give birth in the same hospital. Since five women&#xD;
      did not volunteer to participate in the study and since six women gave birth in another&#xD;
      hospital, the study was performed with 104 women (90%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools Data were gathered with a sociodemographic and obstetric features&#xD;
      questionnaire created by the researchers in light of the literature, 1,11,17 Fear of&#xD;
      Childbirth and Postpartum Anxiety Scale (FCPAS), Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory (STAI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic and Obstetric Features Questionnaire The questionnaire was composed of two&#xD;
      sections. The first section involved questions about sociodemographic features including age,&#xD;
      employment status and education. The second section involved 11 questions about the total&#xD;
      number of pregnancies, outcome of the prior pregnancy, experiencing problems during the prior&#xD;
      pregnancy, experiencing problems in the current pregnancy and planned mode of childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fear of Childbirth and Postpartum Anxiety Scale FCPAS was developed by Kitapçıoğlu et al. in&#xD;
      2007 to determine worries experienced during and after childbirth 1. The scale is composed of&#xD;
      ten subscales and 61 items. It is a five-point Likert scale and one corresponds to completely&#xD;
      disagree and five totally agree. Some items are scored in the reverse order. The scores for&#xD;
      the scale range from zero to ten. The scores 0.00-2.00 are very low, the scores 2.01-4.00 are&#xD;
      low, the scores 4.01-6.00 are moderate, the scores 6.01-8.00 are high and the scores&#xD;
      8.01-10.00 are very high18. Cronbach's alpha was reported to 0.95 for the original scale1 and&#xD;
      it was found to be 0.96 in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory STAI was developed by Spielberg et al. in 1970&#xD;
      to measure state and trait anxiety levels of individuals. It was adapted to the Turkish&#xD;
      culture by Öner and LeCompte in 198519,20. The inventory is composed of two scales; i.e.&#xD;
      state anxiety scale (STAI-State) and trait anxiety scale (STAI-Trait), and each involves 20&#xD;
      items. The former is directed towards determining how individuals feel at a certain moment&#xD;
      and under a certain condition, whereas the latter shows how individuals feel in general. STAI&#xD;
      is a four-point Likert scale. The total score for the inventory changes between 20 and 80.&#xD;
      The scores 0-19 show lack of anxiety, the scores 20-39 mild anxiety, the scores 40-59&#xD;
      moderate anxiety, the scores 60-79 severe anxiety and the score 80 and over 80 very severe&#xD;
      anxiety 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale VAS was developed by Price et al. in 1983 to measure the severity of&#xD;
      pain 21. It is frequently used to determine the severity of pain experienced by women during&#xD;
      labor 3,11. Individuals are asked to assign a score for their pain on a 10cm-scale ranging&#xD;
      from zero to ten. Zero corresponds to lack of pain and ten corresponds to very severe pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The women were given information about the aim and methods of the study and&#xD;
      their participation in the study had a voluntary basis. Those accepting to participate in the&#xD;
      study and planning to give birth in the hospital where this study was conducted were given&#xD;
      the data collection tools and requested to complete them by the researcher . It took 15&#xD;
      minutes for each participant to fill them in. The researcher answered the questions asked by&#xD;
      the participants during the data collection process. The participants were given the&#xD;
      researcher's phone number and asked to call when they came to hospital to give birth. In&#xD;
      addition, every day during the study period, the researchers checked whether there were any&#xD;
      participants among the women presenting to the hospital to give birth. The pain severity was&#xD;
      evaluated by using VAS in the women giving normal birth in the delivery room during the&#xD;
      active phase of labor and in the women having cesarean section in the postpartum four hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Ethical approval was obtained from the ethical committee (date of&#xD;
      approval: 16.12.2013) and written permission was obtained from the hospital where the study&#xD;
      was performed. Written consent was taken from the participants after they were informed about&#xD;
      the aim and conduction of the study. The study was carried out in accordance with the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Obtained data were analyzed with the SPSS for Windows 16.0 (IBM Corporation&#xD;
      Armonk, New York, USA). Kolmogorov Smirnov test was used to determine whether the data about&#xD;
      continuous variables were normally distributed. Numbers, percentages, median and mean&#xD;
      ±standard deviation were used for descriptive statistics. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was&#xD;
      determined. For comparative statistics, t test, one-way analysis of variance, Kruskal Wallis&#xD;
      test and Mann Whitney U test were utilized. The relation between two continuous variables was&#xD;
      analyzed with Spearman correlation test. The statistical significance was set at 0.05 for all&#xD;
      the analyses.&#xD;
