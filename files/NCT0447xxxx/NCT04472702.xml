  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cooled radiofrequency ablation (cRFA) of the knee geniculate nerves is a promising treatment&#xD;
      option for knee osteoarthritis, but has variable efficacy. Fluoroscopy is the typical&#xD;
      guidance of choice, but uses bony landmarks to target these nerves which have variable&#xD;
      positions around the knee. Alternatively, ultrasound allows for targeting based on&#xD;
      visualization of bony landmarks, the nerves, and their accompanying vascular structures, and&#xD;
      thus may offer greater accuracy. However, there are few studies which directly compare the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of these two guidance options. This study will compare these two options.&#xD;

      Background: Cooled radiofrequency ablation (cRFA) of the knee geniculate nerves is a&#xD;
      promising treatment option for knee osteoarthritis, but has variable efficacy. Fluoroscopy is&#xD;
      the typical guidance of choice, but uses bony landmarks to target these nerves which have&#xD;
      variable positions around the knee. Alternatively, ultrasound allows for targeting based on&#xD;
      visualization of bony landmarks, the nerves, and their accompanying vascular structures, and&#xD;
      thus may offer greater accuracy. However, there are few studies which directly compare the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of these two guidance options. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      geniculate nerve cRFA on knee osteoarthritis outcomes when using either ultrasound or&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guidance. The primary outcome measures will be patient pain levels and&#xD;
      patient-reported function. The secondary outcome measures will be objective performance-based&#xD;
      functional outcomes. The exploratory outcome measures will be blood biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflammation, extracellular matrix turnover, and cartilage degradation. Methods: Knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis patients (Kellegren-Lawrence Scale 2-4) that have been refractory to&#xD;
      conservative treatments and report at least 80% pain relief with diagnostic geniculate nerve&#xD;
      blocks will be enrolled and randomized to fluoroscopic (N=45) or ultrasound (N=45) cRFA&#xD;
      treatment arms. Baseline assessments will include 1) Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Western&#xD;
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and PROMIS depression and pain&#xD;
      interference measures; 2) the Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommended&#xD;
      physical performance assessments including the 30-Second Chair Stand Test, Stair Climb Test,&#xD;
      40m Fast Paced Walk Test, Timed Up and Go Test, and Six Minute Walk Test; and 3) in a subset&#xD;
      of patients (N=24), blood biomarkers including MMP-3, IL-1β, TNF-α, COMP, and CTX-II. These&#xD;
      measures will be re-assessed at one month (pain and patient-reported function only, via phone&#xD;
      contact), three months, and 6 months after the cRFA procedure. Study endpoints will be&#xD;
      assessed using a mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance using an alpha level of&#xD;
      0.05. Statement of Relevance: Knee osteoarthritis patients are commonly treated by sports&#xD;
      medicine providers, who are typically well-trained in the use of ultrasound. Should&#xD;
      ultrasound be demonstrated as effective for cRFA, sports medicine providers would be&#xD;
      well-positioned to use relatively low-cost and accessible imaging technology to significantly&#xD;
      improve patient pain and function using cRFA.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants (N=90; 45 at each site) will be randomized with equal probability to either treatment group, restricted by equal enrollment and equal distribution at each site. Patients will be enrolled for the exploratory aim separately at the University of Florida site only. After enrollment into the main study (primary and secondary aims), subjects at the UF site will be offered enrollment into the exploratory aim (N=24) on a consecutive basis restricted by equal enrollment into each treatment arm. A random number table will be used for group allocation and the values recorded separately into opaque, sealed envelopes. This will be performed by a clinical coordinator who is not involved in study to ensure allocation concealment. Outcomes for the primary, secondary, and exploratory aims will be completed by research staff who are blinded to the subject treatment allocation. Data analyses will also be completed in a blinded fashion by the study statistical consultant.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The objective is to rate patient's reported pain. The NPRS asks for a number between zero and ten that fits best to the subject's pain intensity, with zero as &quot;no pain at all&quot; and ten representing &quot;the worst pain ever possible&quot;. It has a similar minimal clinically significant difference (20%) as the visual analog scale and can be administered via a phone interview.</description>

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The objective is to measure the patient's reported functional status.The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).&#xD;
The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. Usually a sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a total WOMAC score, however there are other methods that have been used to combine scores</description>

    <intervention_name>cRFA</intervention_name>
    <description>cRFA intervention will occur under sterile conditions, the patient will be placed in a supine position on a table and a bolster to provide flexion in the treated knee joint. Skin and soft tissues will be anaesthetized with 2 mL 1% lidocaine at each of the three anatomic sites for cRFA, and a introducer needle will then be placed under ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance to the SLG, SMG, and IMG nerves. Adjustments at these positions will be made when using ultrasound guidance in order to capture the geniculate nerve if the nerve and/or its accompanying vasculature can be directly visualized using greyscale or Doppler modes. When using ultrasound, the physician will note and record whether their positioning of the needle is based on bony landmarks, direct visualization of the nerve, and/or vascularity accompanying the nerve. Once the introducer needle is placed, the cRFA will be placed into the introducer needle.</description>
