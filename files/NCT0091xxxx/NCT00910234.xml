      Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is one of the most common brain injuries that occur in&#xD;
      preterm infants. Inflammation, hypoxia-ischemia, free oxygen radical formation and&#xD;
      excitotoxicity are all known pathogenic mechanisms that mediate this injury. Erythropoietin&#xD;
      (EPO) has been shown to be protective against hypoxic-ischemic and inflammatory injuries.&#xD;
      During the past decade, recombinant human Epo (rhEpo) has been widely used in preterm infants&#xD;
      to prevent or treat the anemia of prematurity, in general, rhEpo has been considered to be&#xD;
      safe and well tolerated in preterm infants. EPO was considered not capable of passing through&#xD;
      blood-brain-barrier at low dose. Evidence from animal experiments reveals that rhEpo must be&#xD;
      given in high doses at the beginning or within a short (up to 6 hours), critical time period&#xD;
      after the onset of brain injury to achieve a significant neuroprotective effect. A recent&#xD;
      study using high-dose rhEpo (3000 U rhEpo/kg body weight at birth) for neuroprotection in&#xD;
      very preterm infants revealed that no signs of adverse effects of early high-dose rhEpo&#xD;
      treatment in very preterm infants were identified. Contrary to this, a recent study in PVL of&#xD;
      a rat model revealed that using a low dose rhEpo (50-100 U/kg) was effective in the treatment&#xD;
      of brain damage induced by hypoxia-ischemia and did not affect normal oligodendrocyte&#xD;
      maturity. On this basis, the researchers intent to investigate (1) whether low-dose rhEpo&#xD;
      (100 U/kg) or high-dose rhEpo (3,000 U/kg) given to very preterm infants (gestation age &lt; 32&#xD;
      weeks) immediately after birth and subsequently during the first 2 days is safe and possesses&#xD;
      neuroprotective properties;(2) whether there are gender differences in response to the&#xD;
      hypoxia-ischemic insult and EPO treatment; (3)the pharmacokinetics of low dose and high dose&#xD;
      rhEPO. Very preterm infants with gestational age of &lt; 32 weeks and admitted to the NICU are&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment.&#xD;

      Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is one of the most common brain injuries that occur in&#xD;
      preterm infants. Inflammation, hypoxia-ischemia, free oxygen radical formation and&#xD;
      excitotoxicity are all known pathogenic mechanisms that mediate this injury. Although several&#xD;
      treatment strategies have been devised, few therapies effectively mitigate the harmful&#xD;
      effects of hypoxia-ischemia in preterm newborns and the ensuing neurodevelopment sequelae.&#xD;
      Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to be protective against hypoxic-ischemic and&#xD;
      inflammatory injuries in neuronal cell culture, animal models of brain injury, and clinical&#xD;
      trials of adult humans. During the past decade, recombinant human Epo (rhEpo) has been widely&#xD;
      used in preterm infants to prevent or treat the anemia of prematurity, in general, rhEpo has&#xD;
      been considered to be safe and well tolerated in preterm infants. EPO was considered not&#xD;
      capable of passing through blood-brain-barrier at low dose. Evidence from animal experiments&#xD;
      reveals that rhEpo must be given in high doses at the beginning or within a short (up to 6&#xD;
      hours), critical time period after the onset of brain injury to achieve a significant&#xD;
      neuroprotective effect. A recent study using high-dose rhEpo (3000 U rhEpo/kg body weight at&#xD;
      birth) for neuroprotection in very preterm infants revealed that no signs of adverse effects&#xD;
      of early high-dose rhEpo treatment in very preterm infants were identified. Contrary to this,&#xD;
      a recent study in PVL of a rat model revealed that using a low dose rhEpo (50-100 U/kg) was&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of brain damage induced by hypoxia-ischemia and did not affect&#xD;
      normal oligodendrocyte maturity. Clinical studies suggest that gender influences the response&#xD;
      to brain injury. Ment and coworkers have reported that the cyclooxygenase inhibitor&#xD;
      indomethacin ameliorated intraventricular hemorrhage and improved cognition in very low birth&#xD;
      weight boys, but not girls. On this basis, the researchers intent to investigate (i) whether&#xD;
      low-dose rhEpo (100 U/kg) or high-dose rhEpo (3,000 U/kg) given to very preterm infants&#xD;
      (gestation age &lt; 32 weeks) immediately after birth and subsequently during the first 2 days&#xD;
      is safe and possesses neuroprotective properties; (ii) whether there are gender differences&#xD;
      in response to the hypoxia-ischemic insult and EPO treatment; (iii)the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      low dose and high dose rhEPO. Very preterm infants with gestational age of &lt; 32 weeks and&#xD;
      admit to our NICU are eligible for enrollment. After informed consent is obtained, infants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to three groups based on a double-blind design. The study&#xD;
      medication (rhEpo or NaCl 0.9%) is dispensed to each patient number that is blinded to the&#xD;
      clinical investigators. Epoietin Beta or an equivalent volume of normal saline placebo is&#xD;
      given intravenously during a period of 10 minutes at 3 to 6 hours after birth, and at 24&#xD;
      hours interval for another 2 doses.The primary short-term outcome measures are brain injury&#xD;
      (intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)) and ROP. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), persistent ductus arteriosus&#xD;
      (PDA), apnea of prematurity, and chronic lung disease. The long term outcomes are whether&#xD;
      early low-dose or high-dose treatment of rhEpo in very preterm infants finally improves&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months' and 5 years' corrected age.&#xD;
