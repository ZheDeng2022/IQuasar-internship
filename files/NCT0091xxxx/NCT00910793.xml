    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of formoterol and&#xD;
      beclometasone dipropionate on central and peripheral airway dimensions in asthmatic patients&#xD;
      using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Further more, the effect of this combination&#xD;
      therapy on exhaled NO, lung function (spirometry, body plethysmography, diffusion and&#xD;
      resistance) and subjective asthma control score as well as the safety of this combination&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combination therapy on central and peripheral airway dimensions with CFD. The following primary outcome parameters will be determined:&#xD;
Total airway resistance for the segmented airways&#xD;
Peripheral airway resistance(from 4th bifurcation on) for the segmented airways&#xD;
Total airway volume for the segmented airways&#xD;
Peripheral airway volume (from the 4th bifurcation on) for the segmented airways&#xD;
Relative compliance for each lobe&#xD;
Density of the lung parenchyma given per predefined lung zone</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lung function tests: dynamic lung volumes, static lung volumes and airway resistances</measure>
    <time_frame>lung function tests will be perfomed at te following visits: screening, visit 1 (2 weeks after screening), visit 3 (6 weeks after screening), visit 5 (14 weeks after screening) and visit 7 (26 weeks after screening)</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome parameters that will be obtained with the lung function tests are:&#xD;
Dynamic lung volumes: Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 sec (FEV1), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF),Maximum expiratory flow when 50% of the FVC remain to be exhaled (MEF50) , Maximum expiratory flow when 25% of the FVC remain to be exhaled (MEF25)&#xD;
Static lung volumes: Vital Capacity (VC),Inspiratory Vital Capacity (IVC), Functional Residual Capacity (FCR), Total Lung Capacity (TLC)&#xD;
Airway resistances: Airway Resistance (Raw), Specific Airway Conductance(SGaw) (based on body plethysmography)</description>

    <time_frame>Asthma Control Test (ACT) will be performed on visit 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7</time_frame>
