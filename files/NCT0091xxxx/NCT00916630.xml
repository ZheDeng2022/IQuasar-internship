  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of the study drug pemetrexed,&#xD;
      and the highest dose of this drug that can be given to people safely. Another goal of this&#xD;
      research study is to gain information about how the body handles pemetrexed and how&#xD;
      pemetrexed may work to treat the participant's lymphoma in the nervous system. Pemetrexed&#xD;
      (also known as Alimta) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of some lung cancers&#xD;
      and has been shown to be effective in laboratory studies. Information from these studies&#xD;
      suggests that pemetrexed may help to treat patients with either primary or secondary central&#xD;
      nervous system lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of pemetrexed that can be given to people&#xD;
           safely, not everyone who participates in this study will be receiving the same amount of&#xD;
           the study drug. The dose participants will receive will depend upon the number of people&#xD;
           that have been enrolled on the study before them and how well they have tolerated their&#xD;
           doses of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pemetrexed is given into a vein (by IV) over a 10 to 20 minute period once every 14&#xD;
           days. This 14 day period is called a cycle of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study treatment will be divided into three phases. Induction: Participants will be given&#xD;
           a maximum of 8 cycles. If the participant does not achieve a complete response after&#xD;
           eight induction cycles, they will be taken off study. A complete response means there is&#xD;
           no evidence of disease on MRI or CT scan. Consolidation: If the participant has achieved&#xD;
           complete response, they will have two additional cycles. Maintenance: Following the&#xD;
           completion of the consolidation cycles, participants will receive the study drug only&#xD;
           once per month. They can continue to receive maintenance cycles for up to a year from&#xD;
           the start of the first induction cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Folic acid and vitamin B12 are two vitamins that have been shown to help lessen the&#xD;
           severity of some side effects of pemetrexed. Participants will begin taking oral folic&#xD;
           acid tablets at least 5 days before their first dose of pemetrexed and daily until 3&#xD;
           weeks after their last dose. Vitamin B12 is given through injections into your muscle.&#xD;
           Participants will receive their first vitamin B12 injection 1-2 weeks before their first&#xD;
           dose of pemetrexed. They will receive injections every 9 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone have been shown to help prevent severe skin rashes&#xD;
           associated with pemetrexed. Participants will receive dexamethasone twice daily starting&#xD;
           the day before each pemetrexed infusion continuing until the day after each infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day 1 of each cycle the following will be performed: a physical examination, blood&#xD;
           work, vital signs, assessment of who well the participant is functioning, and&#xD;
           mini-mental examination. On day 8 of each cycle blood work will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research blood work will be obtained (PKs) over the first four days of cycles 1 and 2&#xD;
           (or study participation days 1-4 and 15-18).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will come to the clinic once a month during the maintenance cycles for a&#xD;
           physical examination, blood work, assessment of how well the participant is functioning,&#xD;
           vital signs and mini-mental examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor assessments by MRI will be done after every 2 cycles during the induction and&#xD;
           consolidation cycles. During the maintenance cycles the MRIs will be repeated every 2&#xD;
           cycles (once every 2 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for research tests will also likely be&#xD;
           performed, if safe for you, to learn more about how well pemetrexed can cross the&#xD;
           blood-brain barrier. This will be performed by one of two methods 6 and 24 hours after&#xD;
           the pemetrexed is infused on days 1 and 2 of the first two cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After Alimta is given you will also receive, a white blood cell recruiting material,&#xD;
           Neupogen to avoid suppressing your bone marrow.&#xD;
