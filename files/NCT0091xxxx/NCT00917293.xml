      The primary objective is to assess the safety and effectiveness of Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate on&#xD;
      the reduction of expressed symptoms of tardive dyskinesia in patients with schizophrenia and&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorders.&#xD;

      This study will assess the effect of Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate on the reduction of expressed&#xD;
      symptoms of moderate to severe tardive dyskinesia in patients with schizophrenia and&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorders who are on a stable dose, and regime, of either a long acting (i.e.&#xD;
      depot/IM) or oral antipsychotic medication, as compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms will be assessed through the administration and scoring of Abnormal Involuntary&#xD;
      Movement Scale (AIMS), specifically on items 1 through 7 (facial and oral movements,&#xD;
      extremity movements and trunk movements) at each visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients must have signed an informed consent document indicating that they understand&#xD;
             the purpose of the study, its objectives, and the expectations of participation in the&#xD;
             study and that they agree to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Meet current diagnostic criteria for Schizophrenia (Disorganized [295. 10], Paranoid&#xD;
             [295.30], or Residual [295.60]), or Schizoaffective Disorder [295.70] as defined by&#xD;
             the DSM-IV for at least 3 months before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have been on a stable dose and regime of a LAI for at least 3 injection intervals or&#xD;
             oral antipsychotic for at least 1 month prior to randomization and are expected to&#xD;
             remain on this stable dose and regime throughout their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Meet current diagnostic criteria for Neuroleptic Induced Tardive Dyskinesia [333.82]&#xD;
             as defined by the DSM-IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Scoring ≥3 (moderate) on item 8, the &quot;severity of abnormal movements overall&quot; section&#xD;
             of the AIMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Score ≥3 (moderate) on at least one item, or ≥2 (mild) on at least 2 items, and an&#xD;
             overall total score of ≥5 on items 1 through 7 (facial and oral movements, extremity&#xD;
