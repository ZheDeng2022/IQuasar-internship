    <textblock>
      This pilot study initiates a research program testing the early technical and clinical&#xD;
      performance of a novel procedure for MRI-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy.&#xD;
      Testing will proceed in two cohorts of patients. In Arm 1, patients with locally recurrent&#xD;
      prostate cancer after radiotherapy will receive tumor-targeted salvage HDR brachytherapy. Arm&#xD;
      1 of the study will be coordinated and closely integrated with a separate concurrent study of&#xD;
      MRI-guided prostate biopsy, which will be performed prior to accrual to Arm 1 of this trial&#xD;
      (UHN 05-0641-C). In arm 2, patients with locally advanced prostate cancer will receive a&#xD;
      boost of prostate-targeted HDR brachytherapy during external beam radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique will be prospectively evaluated in up to 100 patients. Preliminary data&#xD;
      acquired in this pilot study will determine the technical limits of MRI guided HDR&#xD;
      brachytherapy and will be critical for the judicious conduct of a subsequent phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal is innovative in two fundamental ways: MRI-guidance, and specific tumor&#xD;
      targeting for HDR brachytherapy. Successful completion of this study will further&#xD;
      individualize local therapy, not only for the benefit of the proportion of cancer patients&#xD;
      for whom initial radiotherapeutic interventions have failed, but also provide valuable&#xD;
      technical and clinical validation that these novel image-guided (IG) approaches are&#xD;
      clinically feasible and could be applied more broadly in prostate cancer therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred and nineteen thousand new cases of prostate cancer have been projected in the&#xD;
      Unites States for 2007, with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) constituting the mainstay of&#xD;
      local therapy for an increasing proportion of newly diagnosed patients. Despite improvements&#xD;
      in the delivery and reduction in associated toxicity of external beam radiotherapy, local&#xD;
      persistence or recurrence of disease remains prevalent in 25-51% of patients. Local disease&#xD;
      after EBRT is a risk factor for subsequent metastatic progression and prostate&#xD;
      cancer-specific mortality, and is a cause of morbidity including hematuria, obstructive&#xD;
      uropathy, and chronic pain. Given its prevalence, and the lack of satisfactory local salvage&#xD;
      treatments, fear of prostate cancer recurrence has been shown to impose a substantial burden&#xD;
      of suffering in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic needle placement under MRI-guidance enables two critical steps in tumor-targeted&#xD;
      brachytherapy: 1) directly guiding brachytherapy catheters to sites of tumor recurrence, and&#xD;
      2) permitting treatment planning and delivery to be based on 3D MRI images. MRI-based HDR&#xD;
      brachytherapy will precisely identify the location of brachytherapy catheters relative to the&#xD;
      target volumes and adjacent normal structures at risk of radiation injury, obviating the need&#xD;
      for invasive saturation (24-100) mapping biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will build the evidence supporting the concept of MRI-guidance and tumor-targeted&#xD;
      HDR brachytherapy in the management of prostate cancer. This trial will strive to demonstrate&#xD;
      improvements in technical performance under MRI-guidance, while exploring a novel paradigm of&#xD;
      patient-specific modulation of dose intensity based on regions of tumor burden.&#xD;
