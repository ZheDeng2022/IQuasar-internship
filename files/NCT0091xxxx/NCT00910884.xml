      RATIONALE: Plant extracted natural compounds, in an adjunct therapy position, slow the growth&#xD;
      and reproduction of Stage IV Breast Cancer tumor cells. May help eradicate different types of&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this randomized Phase I trial is to first IDENTIFY, through&#xD;
      laboratory analysis and validating cellular biochemical pathways, and HELP CONTROL, using&#xD;
      natural plant extracted compounds, G.R.A.S. (Generally Accepted As Safe), compounds, the&#xD;
      reproduction, growth progress and metastasis of Stage IV Breast Cancer cells. The therapy&#xD;
      position is adjunct to conventional therapies and in &quot;one-off&quot; trials have been excitingly&#xD;
      effective for long-term survival. Novel use of bioactive GRAS compounds to augment and&#xD;
      enhance conventional cancer therapies and as stand-alone parallel therapies.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To utilize multiple naturally-occurring bioalkaloids, bioactive &quot;compounds of interest&quot; from&#xD;
      multiple sources, to influence prostate, breast, and uterine cancer pathways in cancer&#xD;
      patients and cancer patients in remission. Other cancer types may be applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To utilize specific naturally-occurring bioalkaloids and bioactive &quot;compounds of interest&quot; to&#xD;
      suppress cancer proliferation-stimulation/growth activities induced by normal cancer&#xD;
      metabolism including environmental estrogen impact, estrogen-mimicking compounds,&#xD;
      estrogen-influencing and testosterone-type compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To utilize DNA interaction with proliferating cancer cells via intercalation, which has a&#xD;
      binding impact activity that then impairs DNA polymerase furthering DNA strand breakage and&#xD;
      complete apoptosis. In addition, these bioactive compounds through intercalation, prevent&#xD;
      cancer-cell DNA strand breakage from re-connection and repair, (limitlessness) while&#xD;
      depleting nuclear topoisomerase, the enzyme also targeted by a number of conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy routes. Finally; a number of the bioalkaloids binds to cancer telomeres capping&#xD;
      them at specific number or reducing them to &quot;one and done.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural GRAS compounds, in previous studies that background this research, reduced secondary&#xD;
      bonding of TMPRSS2-ERG fusing affecting testosterone &amp; estrogen hormone influence in cell&#xD;
      proliferation. Variant mRNAs of, for example, the TMPRSS2-ERG fusing pathway were affected&#xD;
      whereas normalized mRNAs in all other cells were not, a mechanism and chemistry not readily&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To utilize natural extracted plant compounds as a means to influence DIABLO (direct inhibitor&#xD;
      of apoptosis binding protein with low isoelectric point) by downregulating over 350 genes&#xD;
      which influence extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction, and complement coagulation&#xD;
      cascades were upregulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To utilize applications of, or ingestion of, specifically grown plant species/subspecies,&#xD;
      extract the &quot;compounds of action&quot; or &quot;compounds of activity&quot; but maintaining an&#xD;
      &quot;entourage-affect by protecting &quot;multi-compound complex arrangement chemistry&quot; to maintain&#xD;
      normal metabolic functionality of the compounds of interest..&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND DATA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaceutica has, since the turn of the 1800s to the 1900s, tried to find, extract and/or&#xD;
      synthesize plant &amp; biological compounds that have the highest activity in a given medical&#xD;
      treatment regime. In many cases the object was to get to the heart of the active compound,&#xD;
      discarding non-active compounds,and, in other cases for various reasons including stockholder&#xD;
      satisfaction, to be able to patent the synthesis chemistry and prevent duplication by&#xD;
      competitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The one point of this important to this work is that the natural multi-compounds were the&#xD;
      &quot;compounds of action&quot; for centuries and in most cases, in the natural form they were utilized&#xD;
      in pre-20th century medicine, while the action of control was usually much slower, the side&#xD;
      affects were non-existent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research (sic) now places a more important role of the &quot;multi-compound&quot; and the&#xD;
      &quot;entourage-effect' they have as cancer cells are quick to evolve, like viruses, and where the&#xD;
      pharmaceutica &quot;single compound of action&quot; approach works well when ALL the cancer cells are&#xD;
      eliminated, does not work well when surviving cells evolve to create resistance...a common&#xD;
      outcome to most advanced stage cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;entourage-effect&quot; using the &quot;multi-compound&quot; natural extracted compounds appears to&#xD;
      negate the evolution/resistance response of cancerous cells by having multiple &quot;chemistries&#xD;
      of action&quot; involved the cancer-control process which then hides/disguises the metabolic&#xD;
      pathway of control from the surviving cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive oral natural supplements comprising indole-3-carbinol, perillyl&#xD;
      alcohol, glucuronic acid, and flavonoids daily for 12 months. Patients also consume whole&#xD;
      foods comprising indole-3-carbinol and a diet that eliminates exogenous growth hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients do not receive natural supplements or consume whole foods or a special diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of compounds of interest are measured by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry,&#xD;
      high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser&#xD;
      desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 6 months and&#xD;
      monitored for a second 6 months period.&#xD;
