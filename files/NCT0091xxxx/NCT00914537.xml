      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) have rates of anal cancer that approach&#xD;
           those of cervical cancer in women. However, unlike cervical cancer, there is no current&#xD;
           recommended method of screening that could be used to detect anal precancerous lesions&#xD;
           for the prevention of anal cancer in HIV-positive MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infections by human papillomavirus (HPV) are the likely cause of cervical and anal&#xD;
           precancer and cancer. Detecting the presence of HPV or related biomarkers has helped to&#xD;
           identify women who may be at increased risk of cervical cancer; researchers believe that&#xD;
           early detection of HPV or related biomarkers in MSM may be useful for anal cancer&#xD;
           screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effectiveness of various tests to detect cancer-causing HPV in HIV-positive&#xD;
      men who have sex with men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - HIV-positive MSM that are interested in receiving anal screening for precancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV-positive MSM will respond to a self-administered risk factor questionnaire, and will&#xD;
           undergo a physical exam and a high-resolution anoscopy at the participating clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinician will then collect to anal Pap specimens from each subject for research on&#xD;
           HPV and related biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be followed annually for 2 years to collect additional health data for&#xD;
           research follow-up.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive men who have sex with men (MSM) are at risk of&#xD;
      anal cancer that approaches the risk of cervical cancer for unscreened women living in&#xD;
      developing countries. There is currently no accepted method for screening HIV positive MSM&#xD;
      for anal precancer to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to anal cancer ; in the absence&#xD;
      of a standard and effective screening modality, clinics often resort to anoscopy, a&#xD;
      diagnostic procedure akin to colposcopy, and directed biopsies on all HIV positive MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the clinical performance of detecting carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA&#xD;
      and RNA, individual carcinogenic HPV genotypes, cytogenetic markers, p16(INK4a) and Ki-67&#xD;
      immunocytochemistry staining, anal cytology, and combinations of these biomarkers for&#xD;
      identifying HIV positive MSM with prevalent, 1 year cumulative, and 2 year cumulative anal&#xD;
      precancer and cancer (histologically-confirmed greater than or equal to AIN3) using&#xD;
      clinician-collected anal specimens at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV positive MSM seeking anal cancer screening. Inclusion: 1) KPNC member; 2) documented&#xD;
      HIV-positive status; 3) able and mentally competent to provide written, informed consent.&#xD;
      Exclusion:A current diagnosis of anal cancer at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this need and to improve detection of anal precancer and cancer, we propose a&#xD;
      screening cohort study of 1,000 HIV positive MSM participating in the Kaiser Permanente&#xD;
      Northern California (KPNC) health maintenance program. Under written, informed consent,&#xD;
      participating KPNC members will respond to a self-administered risk factor questionnaire and&#xD;
      will undergo two anal specimen collections into liquid-based cytology (LBC) medium prior to a&#xD;
      digital exam and high resolution anoscopy. Subjects will be asked to self-collect at home&#xD;
      into the same LBC buffer and return their specimen in a prepared return envelope to evaluate&#xD;
      the utility of self-collection for anal cancer screening. Subjects will be followed annually&#xD;
      for two years to collect follow-up clinical data related to outcomes. Baseline&#xD;
      clinician-collected specimens will be tested in a masked fashion for the following clinical&#xD;
      biomarkers: 1) carcinogenic HPV DNA in aggregate and individual carcinogenic HPV genotypes;&#xD;
      2) carcinogenetic HPV RNA and HPV16/18 RNA; 3) cytogentic changes (3q, 5p, and 20q&#xD;
      amplification); and 4) p16(INK4a) and Ki-67 immunocytochemical staining. For reference,&#xD;
      clinician-collected specimens will be used to make LBC slides and evaluated by an expert&#xD;
      cytopathology laboratory. We will estimate the clinical performance (sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and referral rates) for detection of&#xD;
      prevalently-detected, one-year cumulative, and two-year cumulative histologically-confirmed&#xD;
      anal precancer (anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3) or worse (greater than or equal to&#xD;
      AIN3). We will test the self-collected anal specimens by the best molecular test(s) or&#xD;
      combination of tests for detection of prevalently-detected greater than or equal to AIN3 as&#xD;
      determined from testing the clinician-collected specimens. All MSM will undergo diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures at all visits and independent of testing results, which will result in unbiased&#xD;
      disease ascertainment.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  2.1 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any male member of KPNC who is 1) identified as HIV positive through the Kaiser HIV&#xD;
        registry, 2) 18 years or older, can provide written, informed consent, and 3) is not&#xD;
        currently diagnosed with anal cancer (prior to enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-positive men will be invited to participate, regardless of race and ethnicity, as&#xD;
        described below if they meet the eligibility criteria. Other than having been diagnosed&#xD;
        with anal cancer prior to enrollment, there will no other disease-based exclusions. Because&#xD;
        of the high fraction of HIV-positive men are in fact MSM, we will not prescreen men for&#xD;
        their sexual orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The exclusion criteria will be age less than 18, a current diagnosis of anal cancer&#xD;
        rendered prior to enrollment, an unwillingness or inability (evident mental incapacity to&#xD;
        understand the informed consent documents) to give informed consent.&#xD;
