  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 80% of the worldwide population is positive on HSV antibodies. In the United States the&#xD;
      lifetime prevalence of recurrent herpes labialis is estimated at 20% to 40%, with&#xD;
      approximately 100 million episodes occurring in the country every year. In Switzerland about&#xD;
      70% of the adult population is positive on HSV-1 and about 20% is positive on HSV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Herpes simplex virus has a lipid bilayer (virus-envelope), which causes the&#xD;
      sensitiveness, to any kind of detergents. Within this bilayer cholesterol molecules are&#xD;
      integrated and play a crucial role in virus entry into host cells. In vitro experiments have&#xD;
      clearly shown that the depletion of cholesterol in HSV-envelope with 2- HPßCD has inhibited&#xD;
      the ability of the virus to infect host cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this clinical trial is to reduce the number of Herpes labialis relapse and to&#xD;
      provide patients with recurrent Herpes labialis a real benefit, concerning the simple&#xD;
      mechanism of action and the negligible side effects. Patients having problems in swallowing&#xD;
      the antiviral pills of standard treatment, will find with 2- HPßCD a drug, that just has to&#xD;
      be applied on the lips, which increases patient's quality of life tremendously.&#xD;
