      Hypothesis #1: Residents who complete a structured, ultrasound guided simulation training&#xD;
      protocol will have superior skills at central venous catheter (CVC) insertion on actual&#xD;
      patients as compared to residents who are trained in CVC insertion according to the&#xD;
      traditional, bedside apprenticeship model as measured by a reduced failure rate at CVC&#xD;
      insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2: Residents who complete a structured, ultrasound guided simulation training&#xD;
      protocol will have superior skills at CVC insertion on actual patients as compared to&#xD;
      residents who are trained in CVC insertion according to the traditional, bedside&#xD;
      apprenticeship model as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a reduced number of attempts at venous cannulation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a decreased rate of technical errors and a decreased complication rate based on an&#xD;
           independent rater's evaluation using a procedure checklist, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a decreased time to CVC insertion from opening the catheter kit to placement of sterile&#xD;
           dressing as timed by an independent rater.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resident education has traditionally devoted itself to knowledge acquisition rather than&#xD;
      defined levels of clinical competence. Currently, inexperienced physicians are trained to&#xD;
      perform invasive procedures such as central venous catheter (CVC) insertion according to the&#xD;
      bedside, apprenticeship model, gaining expertise on real patients in neither a rigorous nor&#xD;
      standardized manner. Simulators may ease trainees' transition to actual patients and avoid&#xD;
      adverse events. This project aims to investigate the efficacy of a structured simulation&#xD;
      training protocol in ultrasound guided CVC insertion for resident physicians. The specific&#xD;
      aims are to compare: (1) the failure rate of CVC insertion, and (2) the number of attempts at&#xD;
      venous cannulation, rates of technical errors and complications of CVC insertion, and time to&#xD;
      CVC insertion on actual patients between residents who completed a structured, hands-on&#xD;
      simulation training protocol (intervention group) and those who are trained according to the&#xD;
      traditional, bedside apprenticeship model (control group). We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      intervention group will obtain superior skills at CVC insertion on actual patients as&#xD;
      compared to the control group as measured by: (1) a reduced failure rate at CVC insertion,&#xD;
      (2) a) a reduced number of attempts at venous cannulation b) a decreased rate of technical&#xD;
      errors and complications and c) a decreased time to insertion based on an independent rater's&#xD;
      evaluation using a procedure checklist.&#xD;
