  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative fluid management has been historically dictated by outdated, contradictory&#xD;
      concepts. Excessive or inadequate fluid administration around surgery is deleterious and&#xD;
      hence goal-directed fluid therapy using Oesophageal Doppler-derived cardiac indices is&#xD;
      preferable to optimize tissue perfusion. Previous studies in this area have been hampered by&#xD;
      lack of standardization in other aspects of perioperative care and none have explored the&#xD;
      impact of individualized fluid therapy on post-operative fatigue.The investigators proposed a&#xD;
      study involving 80 patients having open/ laparoscopic colonic surgery to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of Oesophageal Doppler guided fluid administration intraoperatively compared to&#xD;
      current best practice of fluid restriction. The investigators have an optimized&#xD;
      peri-operative care pathway established at the Manukau Surgical Centre (MSC), Middlemore&#xD;
      Hospital. All patients will be cared for under the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)&#xD;
      multimodal care plan therefore ensuring that all other aspects of care besides intraoperative&#xD;
      fluid administration remain homogenous. Outcomes will include post-operative recovery,&#xD;
      clinical outcomes as well as physiological data with follow-up to 30 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until very recently, modern perioperative fluid management has involved routine&#xD;
      administration of large quantities of fluids during major surgical procedures, typically&#xD;
      causing a weight increase of 3-6 kg in the early post-operative period.Several factors,&#xD;
      including concern about preoperative dehydration, attempts to support the circulation and&#xD;
      cardiac function after general and regional anaesthesia, prevention of blood transfusion and&#xD;
      maintenance of adequate kidney perfusion have historically lead to excess perioperative fluid&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However administration of excess fluid has been shown to contribute to postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity. It increases demand on the heart and may adversely affect postoperative cardiac&#xD;
      function. It may also lead to increased pulmonary complications. Fluid overload may lead to&#xD;
      oedema of the gastrointestinal tract and hence contribute to post-operative gastrointestinal&#xD;
      paralysis, bacterial translocation and sepsis. Excess fluid also has been shown to decrease&#xD;
      tissue oxygen tension with potential deleterious effects on anastomotic and wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, current best practice has centred on fluid restriction peri-operatively with an&#xD;
      increased focus on the intraoperative fluid regimen. Since hypovolaemia is also associated&#xD;
      with a myriad of adverse outcomes, a balanced perioperative intravenous fluid regimen&#xD;
      focussing on tissue perfusion is thought to be optimal. By using the Oesophageal Doppler&#xD;
      Monitor (ODM) as a means to non-invasively estimate intra-operative cardiac output,&#xD;
      significant improvements in outcome have been observed in patients undergoing major&#xD;
      orthopaedic and cardiac procedures. Previous studies in patients undergoing major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery have demonstrated that goal-directed intraoperative fluid administration using ODM&#xD;
      may result in improved outcomes such as reduced number of critical care admissions, reduced&#xD;
      hospital stay and overall decreased morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the broader context of perioperative care in colonic surgery, recent developments have&#xD;
      included Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programmes- a combination of various&#xD;
      evidence-based strategies implemented together as part of a standardised protocol to&#xD;
      synergistically decrease post-operative fatigue and improve outcomes. These strategies&#xD;
      include preoperative counselling, avoidance of mechanical bowel preparation, pre-operative&#xD;
      carbohydrate loading, perioperative high-flow oxygen therapy, mid-thoracic epidural&#xD;
      analgesia, avoidance of parenteral opioids and routine wound drainage, use of short or&#xD;
      transverse incisions, early mobilisation, early feeding and a balanced analgesia regiment.&#xD;
      ERAS protocols are also ideal for well-designed clinical trials as they provide a template to&#xD;
      trial new interventions on the background of an otherwise homogenous, optimised perioperative&#xD;
      care programme. An ERAS programme has been implemented and prospectively evaluated at Manukau&#xD;
      Surgical Centre, Middlemore Hospital in Auckland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently published systematic review, we identified that a major short-coming of the&#xD;
      literature in this field is the non-standardised nature of peri-operative management of the&#xD;
      patients in these studies. Although fluid management was optimised, the other aspects of care&#xD;
      were not optimised or even standardised, introducing the risk of significant confounding.&#xD;
      Furthermore, none have explored the role of fluid management on post-operative functional&#xD;
      recovery- an important metric of patient-relevant outcomes evaluating recovery beyond&#xD;
      physiological and clinical parameters. Furthermore, none of the published ERAS programmes&#xD;
      have used ODM as part of their peri-operative strategies. Consequently, the true impact of&#xD;
      optimised fluid therapy within an environment of current best-practice (ERAS) is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Research Design We will conduct a double-blinded, randomised controlled trial of ODM&#xD;
      versus fluid restriction (current best-practice) in patients undergoing colonic surgery&#xD;
      within our ERAS programme to determine whether individualising fluid administration enhances&#xD;
      post-operative recovery, thereby improving patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect a 20% improvement in recovery as measured by the Surgical recovery Score at Day 7&#xD;
      (based on data from our previous work), we will require 37 patients in each arm (α= 0.05, β=&#xD;
      0.8) Therefore, we shall aim to recruit 80 patients anticipating for possible drop-outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be consented and then randomised by computer generated random numbers and the&#xD;
      opaque envelope method. All Patients will have an oesophageal probe inserted with readings&#xD;
      not available to the anaesthetist for patients in the control group (the screen will be&#xD;
      covered). At the commencement of anaesthesia, the patient will be randomised to receive fluid&#xD;
      management optimised by ODM data or by standard parameters. The patients, surgeons and&#xD;
      investigators will be blinded to the intervention. The anaesthetists will use a validated&#xD;
      protocol for the treatment group. Measurements of cardiac indices (Cardiac Output, Aortic&#xD;
      Flow Rate) from the ODM will be noted intraoperatively. The Oesophageal probe shall be&#xD;
      removed at the end of surgery prior to the patient waking up. All other aspects of&#xD;
      perioperative care will be according to our previously developed ERAS programme.&#xD;
