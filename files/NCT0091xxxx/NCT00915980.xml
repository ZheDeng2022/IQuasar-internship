  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many studies, gastric bypass surgery led to total remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as&#xD;
      early as 1 - 2 days after surgery before any real weight loss has occurred. This suggests&#xD;
      that the remission of the T2DM is due to the direct effect of the operation, more than the&#xD;
      secondary effect of the weight loss. The reasons for the major effect on the glucose&#xD;
      metabolism after gastric bypass surgery are still unaccounted for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project will be to unveil some of the mechanisms that explain the effect of&#xD;
      gastric bypass surgery on the glucose metabolism. Further more to find a better way of&#xD;
      testing patients that have just undergone gastric bypass surgery. It is not possible to test&#xD;
      patients who have just undergone gastric bypass surgery with normal oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test (OGTT) and a normal meal, because patients can only take in fluid and a normal OGTT will&#xD;
      often lead to dumping. Instead we will try to modify these tests - OGTT with lower glucose&#xD;
      level and meal-testing with a protein drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that the investigators can see changes in different hormones&#xD;
      and adipokines before and after surgery, even with modified OGTT and meal testing. The&#xD;
      project will consist of clinical trials on patients without T2DM that will undergo gastric&#xD;
      bypass surgery. The studies will take place before and within the first week after surgery.&#xD;
      The investigators will measure different hormones and adipokines after OGTT and a meal with a&#xD;
      protein drink. The investigators expect to see significant changes in some of the analyses&#xD;
      after the operation in patients undergoing gastric bypass.&#xD;
