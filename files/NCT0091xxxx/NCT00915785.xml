    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the hematological and cytogenetic responses with 5&#xD;
      azacytidine in patients over 55 years of age with MDS/AML due to chromosome 7 abnormalities&#xD;
      and to assess the hematological and cytogenetic response rates in patients with relapsed AML&#xD;
      and chromosome 7 abnormality.&#xD;

          -  Be &gt; 55 years of age; younger if first or subsequent relapse in patient less &lt; 55&#xD;
             years but with a chromosome 7 abnormality alone or as part of a complex clone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score of INT 1.5 and a&#xD;
             diagnosis of RAEB or RAEB-T per French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria&#xD;
             or a diagnosis of Myelodysplastic CMMoL per modified FAB criteria meeting the&#xD;
