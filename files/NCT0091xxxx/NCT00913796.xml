    <textblock>
      Acidosis (accumulation of acid in the body) may be an underrecognized problem in patients&#xD;
      after renal transplantation. It may have consequences on physical performance due to negative&#xD;
      effects on bone and muscle metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the status of physical capacity and bone structure in renal transplant&#xD;
           patients with metabolic acidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to study the effect of substituting base equivalents (citrate) on acid/base status of&#xD;
           renal transplant patients with acidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to compare the status of physical capacity and bone structure in renal transplant&#xD;
           patients with metabolic acidosis before and after substitution with citrate&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is developing to become one of the major health problems in the&#xD;
      Western world with more than one million patients on renal replacement therapy, and many more&#xD;
      expected in the years ahead [1]. Survival of patients with end stage renal disease has become&#xD;
      possible with the introduction of dialysis therapy. Renal transplantation has resulted both&#xD;
      in further reduction of mortality and improvement in quality of life for patients with end&#xD;
      stage renal disease. Nevertheless, successful transplantation with regard to graft and&#xD;
      patient survival is still associated with significant morbidity. Apart from infectious&#xD;
      complications and cardiovascular disease, limitations in physical capacity from&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders have become a relevant problem, resulting in reduced quality of&#xD;
      life, poor physical functioning and inability to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle and bone metabolism in chronic kidney disease are typically disturbed resulting in&#xD;
      significant pathology and dysfunction of the affected tissues. They are associated with&#xD;
      metabolic disorders related to renal insufficiency, among which metabolic acidosis is a major&#xD;
      contributor. Metabolic acidosis is a well recognized problem in renal transplant patients.&#xD;
      However, its prevalence, pathogenesis, course and sequelae are not well established. In&#xD;
      particular, its relation to post-transplant bone and muscle disorders, and the impact on&#xD;
      physical capabilities in renal transplant patients have not been comprehensively investigated&#xD;
      so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed project is to examine the characteristics and pathogenesis of&#xD;
      post-transplant metabolic acidosis, and its relation to bone and muscle pathologies and&#xD;
      impact on physical capabilities in renal transplant patients. In particular, the following&#xD;
      aims are proposed to investigate in de novo and long-term renal transplantation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim # 1: To examine the type, degree and course of metabolic acidosis in renal transplant&#xD;
      patients, early and long-term after transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim # 2: To examine alterations in mineral and bone metabolism, and bone structure, and their&#xD;
      relationship to the acid/base disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim # 3: To examine overall physical performance, exercise capacity and muscle energy&#xD;
      content, and their relationship to the acid/base disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to analyze secondary effects of subclinical and overt acidosis on bone (Aim # 2) and&#xD;
      muscle (Aim # 3), patients will be studied at baseline, and then be supplemented with base&#xD;
      equivalents in order to achieve a stable plasma serum bicarbonate concentration of 24-26&#xD;
      mmol/l, and be reexamined thereafter. Completion of the three aims will allow to&#xD;
      comprehensively analyze the pathogenesis of and interrelations between acid/base status,&#xD;
      mineral metabolism, bone disorders and muscle function in renal transplant patients. This&#xD;
      will be the first study to link metabolic alterations to structural and functional measures&#xD;
      of the musculoskeletal system, and to the impact of the resulting pathologies on physical&#xD;
      disabilities in patients with a kidney graft. We are in dire need to know the magnitude of&#xD;
      the problem, whether to treat, and how aggressive to treat these patients. The results of&#xD;
      this project will be indispensable regarding justification to rigorously evaluate and treat&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and after transplantation.&#xD;
