    <textblock>
      This study has 2 parts. Part 1 is a 12-week observational study of weekly Posterior Tibial&#xD;
      Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) treatment for women with overactive bladder. Part 2 is a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial of monthly maintenance PTNS therapy versus no therapy in subjects who were&#xD;
      successfully treated by PTNS in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: 12-week observational study of weekly PTNS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of Part 1 is to determine the efficacy of a 12-week course of PTNS in the&#xD;
      treatment of overactive bladder. Secondary aims are to determine the changes in voiding&#xD;
      frequency and quality-of-life measures after the 12-week treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Randomized, controlled study of monthly PTNS compared to no PTNS after 12-week&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to determine time-to-failure after 12 weeks of PTNS in subjects who&#xD;
      receive maintenance therapy compared to those who do not, in order to ascertain if there is a&#xD;
      need for maintenance therapy after 12 weeks of PTNS. The investigators' secondary aims are to&#xD;
      compare the long-term efficacy and quality of life impact in patient receiving maintenance&#xD;
      PTNS compared to those that do not and to determine the efficacy of rescue maintenance PTNS&#xD;
      in subjects who have symptom recurrence in the no maintenance therapy arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be no difference in time to failure between women randomized to&#xD;
      monthly maintenance PTNS compared to no maintenance PTNS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts: an observational study of PTNS (Part 1) and a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial of maintenance PTNS compared to no maintenance PTNS (Part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: This is an observational study of the efficacy of PTNS therapy in women with&#xD;
      bothersome OAB symptoms who have failed anticholinergic therapy. Subjects will be offered a&#xD;
      standardized weekly regimen of PTNS for 12 weeks and asked to respond to surveys before and&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post- intervention assessments will include a 3-day diary to assess voiding volume&#xD;
      and frequency, Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire, Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Patient&#xD;
      Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S), Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q short form&#xD;
      bother),and the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Short Form (Urogenital Distress Inventory UDI&#xD;
      6 subset). Post-intervention assessment will include the above, as well as the Patient Global&#xD;
      Impression of Improvement (PGI-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: After the initial 12-week treatment, all women with PGI-I less than 4, defined as&#xD;
      patient perception of bladder function as better, much better, or very much better after the&#xD;
      treatment than before the treatment, will be randomized to monthly PTNS or no PTNS. Part 2 of&#xD;
      the study will continue for an additional 42 weeks (i.e. 52 weeks total in parts 1 and 2).&#xD;
      Subjects will be considered to have failed therapy if their PGI-I score is greater than 3. If&#xD;
      they are currently receiving PTNS maintenance therapy and have a PGI-I score greater than 3,&#xD;
      they will be withdrawn from the study and transferred to clinical care to pursue other&#xD;
      treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they are in the no maintenance arm and have a PGI-I score greater than 3, then they are&#xD;
      considered to have failed the no-maintenance treatment arm and may receive monthly PTNS&#xD;
      treatment or pursue other treatment if they choose .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study questionnaires will be administered to patients at clinic visits. PGI-I questionnaires&#xD;
      will be administered via mail (followed by a phone call if the questionnaire is not received&#xD;
      within a designated amount of time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence of Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial urogynecology visit with history and physical (part of routine care). Identify&#xD;
      patients interested in PTNS Offer participation in this study, at which point the subject&#xD;
      visit transitions from routine care to a research visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete questionnaires and diaries to confirm inclusion criteria for those patients who opt&#xD;
      to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly PTNS sessions with nurse certified in PTNS administration for 12 weeks Telephone&#xD;
      reminder to complete 3-day prospective voiding diary prior to MD visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-person clinic visit with MD at end of 12-week treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visit with MD at end of 12-week PTNS treatment, with administration of questionnaires.&#xD;
      If PGI-I &lt;4, then randomization to monthly maintenance or no maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly RN visits for PTNS for those assigned to receive maintenance PTNS. Monthly&#xD;
      administration of PGI-I by mail one week prior to scheduled PTNS treatment (or when it would&#xD;
      be scheduled for those not randomized to receive it). If the questionnaire is not returned&#xD;
      within one week, PGI-I will be administered by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MD visit at one year for evaluation, administration of questionnaires, and end of study&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who are already undergoing PTNS and therefore do not participate in Part 1 of&#xD;
      the study, sequence of events will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visit with MD at end of 12-week PTNS treatment. Identify patients interested in&#xD;
      enrolling in the study. Offer participation and sign consents, at which point the subject&#xD;
      visit transitions from routine care to a clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of questionnaires and voiding diary. If PGI-I &lt;4, then randomization to&#xD;
      monthly maintenance or no maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly RN visits for PTNS for those assigned to receive maintenance PTNS. Monthly&#xD;
      administration of PGI-I by mail one week prior to scheduled PTNS treatment (or when it would&#xD;
      be scheduled for those not randomized to receive it). If the questionnaire is not returned&#xD;
      within one week, PGI-I will be administered by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MD visit at one year for evaluation, administration of questionnaires, and end of study&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTNS Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all study patients, PTNS will be performed per standard protocol by our trained clinical&#xD;
      R.N. as follows. A 34-gauge needle is inserted approximately three fingerbreadths cephalad to&#xD;
      the medial malleolus, between the posterior margin of the tibia and the anterior margin of&#xD;
      the soleus muscle, approximately 3-4cm deep. A ground pad is applied on the same leg near the&#xD;
      arch of the foot, and then the needle and electrode are connected to the Urgent PC stimulator&#xD;
      (Urgent PCÂ®, Uroplasty Inc., MN, USA), with an adjustable pulse intensity of 0-9 MA, a fixed&#xD;
      pulse width of 200 microseconds, and a frequency of 20 Hz. The intensity is increased until&#xD;
      the large toe starts to curl or the toes start to fan in order to assure correct placement,&#xD;
      then turned down to an intensity the patient can tolerate. This treatment is performed in the&#xD;
      clinic by a nurse trained in its administration, for 30 minutes weekly for 12 weeks. If the&#xD;
      patient responds, then she is randomized to receive either 30-minute monthly maintenance&#xD;
      treatment or no treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline 12 weeks and 52 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-day voiding diaries with frequency and volume charts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires regarding quality of life and symptom improvement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. OAB-q (Overactive Bladder-q Short Form)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. PFDI-SF (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Short Form)&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. PFIQ-SF (Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire Short Form)&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. PISQ-SF (Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence/Sexual Function Questionnaire Short&#xD;
      Form)&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. SF-12 Medical Outcomes Study Short Form&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. PGI-I (Patient Global Impression of Improvement)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 12 and one week before their maintenance PTNS (or when their maintenance PTNS would&#xD;
      be if they were randomized to receive it), patients fill out a mailed PGI-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is time to failure as measured by PGI-I greater than 3. Because there is&#xD;
      data for success rates with and without maintenance PTNS but no specific data regarding time&#xD;
      to failure, we will use success rates to power the study. For 80% power, and a confidence&#xD;
      level 0.05, if we estimate that 80% of people who initially respond to PTNS (as determined by&#xD;
      PGI-I &lt; 4) will continue to have improvement after 1 year with 12 weeks of PTNS followed by&#xD;
      maintenance PTNS [Cooperberg 2005] and 20% will continue to have improvement for one year&#xD;
      after 12 weeks of PTNS only [Nuhoglu 2006], then we need 7 subjects randomized to maintenance&#xD;
      treatment and 7 subjects randomized to no maintenance treatment in Part 2. Based on the&#xD;
      literature, we can expect at least 60% of subjects to respond to the 12-week course of PTNS,&#xD;
      so we will need 23 subjects enrolled in Part 1 of the study. A sample size of 23 subjects at&#xD;
      the start of Part 1 provides 14 responders for Part 2. This should offer 80% power to detect&#xD;
      a relative difference of 50% between maintenance PTNS and no maintenance PTNS. To buffer&#xD;
      against a potential drop-out rate over the year of 30%, we will plan to enroll 32 subjects&#xD;
      total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes, including quality of life, condition-specific quality of life, and diary&#xD;
      measures will be compared before and after the observational study, as well as at the end of&#xD;
      the year. We will subcategorize subjects by whether or not they intended to remain on&#xD;
      anticholinergic medications, whether or not they had detrusor overactivity based on&#xD;
      urodynamic studies (if done), and whether those receiving PTNS after a year were originally&#xD;
      randomized to receive maintenance PTNS or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening, each subject will be assigned a sequential study number. These will be&#xD;
      de-identified and stored in locked file cabinets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block randomization will be performed in groups of 8 with a random number generator, and odd&#xD;
      numbers assigned to PTNS maintenance, even numbers assigned to no maintenance PTNS.&#xD;
      Assignments will be put in sequentially administered envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups will be compared with respect to demographic and baseline variables (e.g. age,&#xD;
      race, BMI, quality of life status, prior treatment, current OAB medications) using chi&#xD;
      squared and t tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of primary outcome will be a comparison of time to failure measured by PGI-I &gt;3 in&#xD;
      the group assigned to maintenance PTNS compared to the group not assigned to maintenance via&#xD;
      chi-squared analysis. A cox regression model may be used to analyze time to failure on&#xD;
      maintenance PTNS compared to no maintenance PTNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other statistical and qualitative analyses will be performed on secondary outcome measures as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
