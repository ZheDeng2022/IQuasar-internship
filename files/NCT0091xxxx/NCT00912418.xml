      This study is an open-label, pilot study of an autologous tumor cell vaccine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regimen: A vaccine comprising autologous melanoma cells plus GM-CSF in-adjuvant will be&#xD;
      administered intradermally at a single dose. Subjects will be vaccinated over at least a 6&#xD;
      week period (at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6), with responders vaccinated every 4 weeks thereafter&#xD;
      for a maximum of 9 vaccinations (up to week 18). Systemic low-dose interleukin-2 will also be&#xD;
      administered daily for 6 weeks following the second vaccination at week 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent with the first three of these vaccinations, each patient will also receive an&#xD;
      additional set of 3 vaccinations in a different site, the response to which will be evaluated&#xD;
      at the draining lymph node. This node will be harvested using lymphatic mapping and sentinel&#xD;
      node biopsy methods.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been diagnosed, by cytologic or histologic examination, with stage&#xD;
             III or stage IV melanoma, where sufficient resected tumor is available for vaccine&#xD;
             preparation (approximately 3 g tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable tumor after resection is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with up to 3 brain metastases may be included if the metastases are all &lt; 2&#xD;
             cm in diameter, are asymptomatic, and there is no mass effect or they have been&#xD;
             treated successfully by surgical excision or by gamma knife radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had a larger number of brain metastases resected or treated and&#xD;
             resolved after gamma knife radiation therapy may be included if their status at the&#xD;
             time of study initiation meets these criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For those patients with resected melanoma, surgical resections must have been&#xD;
             performed within 6 months prior to entry. All patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ECOG performance status 0-1, and, ability and willingness to give informed&#xD;
                  consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Laboratory parameters as follows: ANC &gt; 1000/mm3, and Platelets &gt; 100,000 and Hgb&#xD;
                  &gt; 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic: AST and ALT up to 1.5 x upper limits of normal (ULN), Bilirubin within&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Other investigational drugs or investigational therapy also will not necessarily be an&#xD;
             exclusion criteria, but will similarly be recorded and taken into account during data&#xD;
             analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom there is a medical contraindication or other potential medical&#xD;
             problem in complying with the requirements of the protocol, in the opinion of the&#xD;
