  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with dengue viruses is one of the leading causes of hospitalization and death in&#xD;
      children in several tropical Asian counties. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates&#xD;
      that these viruses are responsible for more than 50 million cases of dengue fever (DF) and&#xD;
      approximately 0.5 million cases of the more severe disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever/ shock&#xD;
      syndrome (DHF/DSS) annually. Because dengue viruses are endemic in most tropical and&#xD;
      subtropical regions, keeping more than 2 billion persons at risk for acquiring dengue, the&#xD;
      WHO has made development of a dengue vaccine a top priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a candidate DEN4&#xD;
      vaccine aimed at preventing infection with dengue virus serotype 4.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses are endemic in most tropical and subtropical regions of the world with more&#xD;
      than 2 billion persons at risk for acquiring dengue. There are four serotypes of dengue virus&#xD;
      (DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3, and DEN 4) each capable of causing dengue illness ranging from mild,&#xD;
      self-limited febrile illness to life-threatening disease. Because previous infection with one&#xD;
      dengue serotype can increase the risk for DHF/DSS following infection with a different&#xD;
      serotype, immunization would ideally provide immunity against all four dengue viral&#xD;
      serotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several live, attenuated dengue vaccines have been tested in Phase I and/or Phase II clinical&#xD;
      trials. Although some have appeared promising in early trials, none have been able to meet&#xD;
      the requirements for a safe and effective vaccine. Meeting these requirements has been&#xD;
      particularly difficult when testing vaccines containing all four serotypes. The vaccine&#xD;
      candidate in this study is live-attenuated rDEN4delta30, which will target the DEN4 serotype,&#xD;
      it is a potential component for a future tetravalent dengue vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, random assignment, placebo-controlled study in healthy, adult&#xD;
      volunteers. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a single&#xD;
      dose of DEN4 vaccine. Some participants will be receiving placebo as a comparative measure,&#xD;
      to better assess vaccine-associated versus non vaccine-associated adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To qualify for participation in the study, volunteers will undergo an eligibility screening&#xD;
      which will include medical history, physical exam, hematology testing, liver and renal&#xD;
      function testing, coagulation studies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and&#xD;
      C screening, urinalysis, and screening for pervious flavivirus infection. Urine pregnancy&#xD;
      testing will also be required for female volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of individual participation in the study is approximately 26 weeks following&#xD;
      vaccination on Study Day 0. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      rDEN4delta30 or placebo; 50 participants will receive the vaccine, 20 will receive placebo.&#xD;
      On the day of vaccination, all volunteers will be reassessed by study personnel to ensure&#xD;
      continued eligibility, vital signs will be taken, and a physical exam will be performed.&#xD;
      Female participants will also have a pregnancy test and review of acceptable pregnancy&#xD;
      prevention methods. Eligible participants will receive a vaccination of Study Day 0, followed&#xD;
      by a 30 minute post vaccination assessment for adverse events. After vaccination, volunteers&#xD;
      will be evaluated in the clinic approximately every other day for the first 16 days if study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of study, volunteers will have blood drawn and clinical evaluations&#xD;
      performed on Study Days 21, 28, 42, and 180 post-vaccination. All participants will be asked&#xD;
      to record oral temperatures 3 times a day for the first 16 days post-vaccination.&#xD;
