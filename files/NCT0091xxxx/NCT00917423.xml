      This study will determine the importance and the level of physical activity among women with&#xD;
      anorexia nervosa, both during inpatient treatment and 1 year after hospital discharge.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is a disorder that causes people to maintain an unhealthily low body weight,&#xD;
      often through eating too little or exercising too much. Treatment for anorexia nervosa often&#xD;
      begins with a supervised program for raising a person's weight to a healthy level. This study&#xD;
      will monitor activity levels during inpatient treatment and for 1 year after hospital&#xD;
      discharge in order to determine the impact of physical activity on weight gain during&#xD;
      anorexia treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last until 1 year after participants are discharged from&#xD;
      inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa. Discharge is based on each person's progression in&#xD;
      treatment and may vary among participants. During the study, participants will have their&#xD;
      activity monitored two or three times-at low weight, at 90% of ideal body weight (IBW), and,&#xD;
      if the participant is living near the study clinic, within 6 weeks after discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital. Two monitoring devices will be attached to participants continuously for 48 hours&#xD;
      for the first two assessments and for 72 hours for the third. The first device is a SenseWear&#xD;
      armband, which is a wireless monitor strapped to the back of the upper arm that measures body&#xD;
      movement and body temperature. The second is an Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and&#xD;
      Activity (IDEEA) monitor, which consists of five sensors that will be taped to each&#xD;
      participant's feet, thighs, and chest. The device measures activity levels and energy&#xD;
      expenditure. Participants will complete a blood draw within 1 week of completing activity&#xD;
      monitoring assessments. Participants will also complete a computer &quot;work&quot; task at two time&#xD;
      points-at 75% of IBW and at 90% of IBW. This task will last 40 minutes and will involve&#xD;
      tapping a keyboard in order to earn rewards. Adult participants will also complete a dual&#xD;
      X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) test to assess body composition when 90% IBW is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments will occur 1, 2, 4, and 8 months after discharge. These will involve a&#xD;
      phone call or in-person visit in which health, body weight, and eating disorder symptoms are&#xD;
      discussed. One year after discharge, participants will attend an in-person assessment that&#xD;
      will involve completing questionnaires and an interview. Healthy participants will be&#xD;
      recruited as a control group, and these participants will complete one session of activity&#xD;
      monitoring, one blood draw, and self-rating forms without follow-up measurements.&#xD;
