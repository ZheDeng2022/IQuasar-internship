    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome (MDS) will receive investigational study drug ARRY-614.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 parts. In the first part, patients will receive increasing doses of study&#xD;
      drug, given either with food or without food, in order to achieve the highest dose of the&#xD;
      study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects. Approximately 60 patients&#xD;
      from the US will be enrolled in Part 1 (Completed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of this study, patients will receive the best dose of study drug, given&#xD;
      either with food or without food, determined from the first part of the study and will be&#xD;
      followed to see what side effects and effectiveness the study drug has, if any, in treating&#xD;
      the cancer. Approximately 40 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 2 (Completed).&#xD;
