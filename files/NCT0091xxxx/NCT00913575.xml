      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative condition of large weight-bearing joints, such&#xD;
      as the hip and knee, as well as small hand joints. Current interventions in patients with OA&#xD;
      are limited to symptomatic pain relief and later with total joint replacement (TJR). While&#xD;
      TJR improves function and pain, it does not fully restore function in most individuals. A key&#xD;
      factor of functional outcome is probably conditioning before and after TJR surgery. However,&#xD;
      this has not been studied conclusively in patients undergoing TKR surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary endpoint: To study the effect of a pre-surgery neuromuscular PT compared to an&#xD;
           attention control program on lower extremity function measured by the Chair stands test&#xD;
           (observed function) and the KOOS score (reported function).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary endpoints will be muscle strength, walking time and mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that patients undergoing pre-surgery PT will be significantly&#xD;
      quicker in performing the chair stands test and report a significant improvement in the KOOS&#xD;
      at 3 months after surgery compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 patients from a waiting list for unilateral TKR will be randomized to neuromuscular PT or&#xD;
      an attention control group intervention in a single-blinded randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Assessments will be at baseline, at 3 months after surgery and at 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuromuscular PT group will receive a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 24 training sessions;&#xD;
      all patients, including the control group, will receive 4 sessions of the Knee School.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the demographic change with an increase in the older segment of the population there&#xD;
      will be a rise in the absolute number of TKRs. It is therefore warranted to study pre-surgery&#xD;
      neuromuscular PT to help patients get the most out of their joint replacement.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the demographic change with a significant increase in the older segment of the&#xD;
      population, recent estimates in the United States suggest that the rate of TKR surgery will&#xD;
      rise exponentially over the next decade. A similar trend is expected in Switzerland with a&#xD;
      marked increase in the absolute number of TKR surgery. Today, patients waiting for TKR&#xD;
      surgery in Switzerland are neither routinely participating in an active training program to&#xD;
      reduce pain and improve function nor in an educational program to increase coping skills&#xD;
      before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive neuromuscular training as well as 4 sessions of the Knee&#xD;
      OA School. Both will be offered in group sessions separate from the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) The neuromuscular training will take place under the supervision of an experienced&#xD;
      physiotherapist, 2 sessions a week of 60 minutes each. The training program, based on&#xD;
      neuromuscular and biomechanical principles, according to the possibilities of the patient.&#xD;
      The training sessions consists of three parts: warming up (ergometer cycling), a circuit&#xD;
      program, and cooling down (walking, stretching, mobility). The circuit program comprises four&#xD;
      exercise circles with the key elements of core stability, postural function, functional&#xD;
      alignment, lower extremity muscle strength, and functional exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b) The Knee School is an educational program and takes place in three group sessions and one&#xD;
      individual follow-up session. Patients receive information about: anatomy and physiology of&#xD;
      the knee (first group session); proposed physical activity and pain self-management (second&#xD;
      group session); and the rehabilitation phase after surgery (third group session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive the Knee School sessions without the neuromuscular PT separate&#xD;
      from the intervention group to avoid interaction between the groups.&#xD;
