      RATIONALE: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a treatment that can cure&#xD;
      acute leukemia and myelodysplasia. After giving the patient chemotherapy and total body&#xD;
      irradiation to stop the growth of cancer and remove the patient's diseased bone marrow,&#xD;
      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient to replace the patient's bone&#xD;
      marrow and make red and white blood cells and platelets. Unfortunately HSCT is often&#xD;
      complicated by 'graft versus host disease' (GVHD) in which the transplanted cells from a&#xD;
      donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells and cause tissue damage and&#xD;
      severe symptoms. Removing a subset of the donor T cells, called 'naive T cells', before&#xD;
      transplant may reduce the frequency and intensity of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial will determine whether the removal of the naive T cells from&#xD;
      donor cells can decrease the rate and severity of graft-vs-host disease while preserving&#xD;
      specific immunity against infections in patients with acute leukemia or advanced&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the probability of grades II-IV acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients&#xD;
           with acute leukemia or advanced myelodysplastic syndromes treated with CD45RA+&#xD;
           T-cell-depleted allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and compare this&#xD;
           to relevant historical experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the probability of graft failure in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate immune reconstitution and pathogen-specific T-cell reconstitution in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the probability of transplant-related mortality by day 100 in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the probability of relapse in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the probability and severity of chronic GVHD in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily&#xD;
           for 4 days (Days -10 to -7) Patients also receive thiotepa IV over 4 hours for 2 days&#xD;
           (Days -6 and -5) and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes for 5 days (Days -6 to&#xD;
           -2.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transplantation: Patients receive a CD34+ enriched allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell&#xD;
           (PBSC) product followed by a CD45RA+ T-cell-depleted allogeneic PBSC product on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients will receive Tacrolimus as per cohort&#xD;
           1. If the rate of grade II-IV acute GVHD in the first 35 patients is significantly&#xD;
           reduced (compared to historical controls), subsequent patients are enrolled in cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 1: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally twice daily&#xD;
                beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 50, followed by a standard taper in&#xD;
                the absence of grade II-IV acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 2: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally twice daily&#xD;
                beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 30, followed by a rapid taper in the&#xD;
                absence of grade II-IV acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed actively for at least 1 year post transplant.&#xD;

    <description>Number of participants with aGVHD and severity of aGVHD within the first 360 days post-transplant as graded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. Acute GVHD is graded by standard criteria, and all suspected cases of acute GVHD will be confirmed histologically by biopsy of an affected organ. The severity of acute GVHD is determined by an assessment of the degree of involvement of the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Grade I is characterized as mild disease, Grade II as moderate, Grade III as severe (involvement of any organ system), and Grade IV as life-threatening.</description>

    <description>Graft failure is defined as either a failure to reach an ANC of &gt;500/uL for 3 consecutive days by day 28 post-transplant, or an irreversible decrease in ANC &lt;100 after an established donor graft, unless there is a reasonable explanation such as a viral infection or drug effect that may be responsible for a reversible decrease in ANC.</description>

DONOR BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION: GCSF-mobilized CD34 enriched PBSC and CD45RA depleted cells infused on day 0.&#xD;
POST-TRANSPLANT IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Ptients receive tacrolimus beginning on day -1 by continuous IV infusion, converting to oral formulation when oral feeding is established. If there is no evidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD prior to day 50, tacrolimus is then tapered.</description>

          <description>Graft failure is defined as either a failure to reach an ANC of &gt;500/uL for 3 consecutive days by day 28 post-transplant, or an irreversible decrease in ANC &lt;100 after an established donor graft, unless there is a reasonable explanation such as a viral infection or drug effect that may be responsible for a reversible decrease in ANC.</description>
