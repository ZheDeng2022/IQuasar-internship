    <textblock>
      Rationale: High-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is consistently increased after moderate&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, is an abundant plasma lipoprotein that is generally thought to be&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory in both health and infectious disease. HDL binds and neutralizes the&#xD;
      bioactivity of potent bacterial remnants such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which stimulate&#xD;
      the host innate immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To explore whether prolonged moderate alcohol consumption affects in vivo&#xD;
      cytokine response after a low dose of LPS in young, normal-weight men.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytokine response in a human model of low-grade systemic inflammation Lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
      (LPS) or endotoxin is a constituent of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall. It circulates&#xD;
      in the plasma of healthy human subjects at low concentrations (between 1 and 200 pg/mL).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the human gut is host to ~100 trillion organisms, which together contribute to&#xD;
      an enteric reservoir of ~1 g LPS (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon introduction in the bloodstream endotoxin binds to LPS-binding protein (LBP) and this&#xD;
      complex binds to CD14 on monocytes. CD14 does not have an intracellular domain but signals&#xD;
      through Toll-like receptor 4, leading eventually to activation of the transcription factor&#xD;
      NF-κB and to production of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α,) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and&#xD;
      a systemic inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endotoxin administration to humans, when given in a low dose, is a well-established model of&#xD;
      systemic inflammation (5). The low dose of endotoxin elicits an acute mild systemic&#xD;
      inflammation with a significant and reproducible cytokine and leucocyte response without&#xD;
      increases in body temperature (2;3). This model thus resembles the levels reported in chronic&#xD;
      low-grade inflammatory conditions such as type 2 diabetes and arthrosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a group of lipoprotein particles which have the highest&#xD;
      density in the circulation. HDL has several anti-atherogenic effects, including the ability&#xD;
      to transport excess cellular cholesterol to the liver for excretion, to protect low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL) against oxidation and to inhibit platelet aggregation. Besides its pivotal&#xD;
      role in protecting against atherosclerosis, accumulating evidence also suggest that HDL&#xD;
      possesses anti-inflammatory effects and plays an important role in modulating the&#xD;
      inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although all lipoprotein classes have been demonstrated to bind LPS, when added to whole&#xD;
      human normal blood, it mainly binds to HDL (60%), in addition to LDL (25%) and VLDL (12%)&#xD;
      (6). In vitro, LPS bound to lipoprotein was 20- to 1000-fold less active than the unbound&#xD;
      form in inducing monocytes and macrophages to release cytokines (7). When transgenic mice&#xD;
      with 2-fold elevation of plasma HDL levels were injected with LPS, they had more LPS bound to&#xD;
      HDL, lower plasma cytokine levels, and improved survival rates compared with control mice&#xD;
      (8). In humans Ex vivo reconstituted HDL abolished the LPS-induced overproduction of&#xD;
      cytokines in patients with severe cirrhosis and controls (9) and intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      reconstituted HDL protected humans from the toxic effects of LPS (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has never been studied whether the alcohol-induced increase in HDL could attenuate the&#xD;
      effects of LPS on cytokine response both ex vivo and in vivo. Given the fact that alcohol&#xD;
      induces an increase in HDL (1) and that HDL has LPS-neutralizing properties, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that moderate alcohol consumption attenuates the LPS-induced cytokine response&#xD;
      of TNF-α and IL-6 in young, normal-weight men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, because HDL causes down regulation of CD14 expression in monocytes (10) and&#xD;
      because CD14 modulates the pro-inflammatory response to LPS (11), the effects of HDL on CD14&#xD;
      expression and expression of other genes related to inflammation will be determined in&#xD;
      monocytes over time after both in vivo and ex vivo LPS administration. Since HDL also affects&#xD;
      endothelial function (12;13) and since eicosanoids are important messengers during systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory processes (14) these markers will also be investigated.&#xD;
