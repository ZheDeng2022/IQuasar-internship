      This study will be a retrospective electronic medical chart review of all patients admitted&#xD;
      to adult intensive care medicine units (ICU) at The Nebraska Medical Center over a three-year&#xD;
      period from January 2006 through December 2008. The study will have three primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: Determine correlates (qualifying criteria) of patients initiated on enteral&#xD;
           versus parenteral PPIs as first choice in ICU and after discharge from ICU,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: Based on correlates determine number of patients receiving parenteral PPIs that&#xD;
           could receive enteral therapy as first choice in ICU and after discharge from ICU,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: Estimate the potential savings in drug costs associated with conversion of&#xD;
           eligible patients from parenteral to enteral PPI therapy with emphasis on lansoprazole&#xD;
           solutab in the ICU and conversion of eligible patients requiring continued AST from&#xD;
           parenteral to enteral PPI therapy after discharge from ICU.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detail: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used in intensive care unit (ICU) patients&#xD;
      for various clinical conditions, including acute stress related gastrointestinal bleeding&#xD;
      (ASRGIB) and clinically significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Although&#xD;
      randomized prospective clinical trials are limited with PPIs and other agents that suppress&#xD;
      gastric acid, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)&#xD;
      requires patients receive acid-suppressive therapy on admission to any ICU. Physicians and&#xD;
      pharmacists tend to choose the parenteral route for PPI administration rather than the&#xD;
      enteral route despite several potential advantages for administration into the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. Factors supporting enteral PPI administration include: the ease with&#xD;
      which PPIs can be formulated as a liquid suspension, their high bioavailability in healthy&#xD;
      patients, an efficacy that has been shown to be greater than intravenous histamine-2 receptor&#xD;
      antagonists (H2RA) therapy, and a low acquisition cost. In fact, studies completed in healthy&#xD;
      patients demonstrate that enterally administered PPIs may lead to greater acid suppression&#xD;
      than parenterally administered PPIs on a mg-for-mg basis. A potential limitation associated&#xD;
      with the use of the gut to administer medication to the critically ill patient relates to&#xD;
      whether the drug will be adequately absorbed. We have repeatedly showed at our institution&#xD;
      (650 bed teaching hospital with 54 ICU beds) that seriously ill patients, adequately absorbed&#xD;
      enterally administered PPIs and provide equal or superior acid suppression profiles when&#xD;
      compared to equivalent doses of PPIs administered parenterally. Limited information is&#xD;
      available on the utilization trends and associated potential cost savings with the use of&#xD;
      enteral therapy compared with parenteral PPI administration in the ICU setting. Lansoprazole&#xD;
      oral solutab use in the ICU and hospital setting may lead to further cost savings by reducing&#xD;
      the lengthy preparation ease in administration compared with enterally administered PPIs like&#xD;
      omeprazole, pantoprazole and esomeprazole. Therefore, to inform formulary decisions and&#xD;
      cost-effective quality of care, we propose a real-world retrospective study of the correlates&#xD;
      of and economic outcomes in terms of potential savings in drug costs with use of enteral PPI&#xD;
      including lansoprazole solutab compared with parenteral PPI use in and out of the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview: Study Design: This study will be a retrospective electronic medical chart review of&#xD;
      all patients admitted to adult intensive care medicine units (ICU) at The Nebraska Medical&#xD;
      Center over a three-year period from January 2006 through December 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following investigational review board (IRB) approval, a computerized list of all patients&#xD;
      admitted to the ICU over the designated period will be generated. Using laboratory personal,&#xD;
      all patients will be reviewed and data recorded into an access data base. Data will be&#xD;
      collected in our outcomes laboratory which is a 400 square feet room housing 5 computers&#xD;
      equipped with related software and connected to PHAMIS, the hospital electronic medical&#xD;
      record of our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Inclusion Criteria:All patients greater than 18 years admitted to the ICU during&#xD;
      2006-2008 (January 2006 through December 2008; 3-year period) Exclusion Criteria Patients&#xD;
      ineligible to receive a PPI (e.g. hypersensitivity to any PPI) Sample size: We average 2,500&#xD;
      eligible patients per year admitted to the ICU. So we anticipate a final sample size of&#xD;
      nearly 5000 patients which would give us a meaningful indication of real-world use and cost&#xD;
      estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Data Collection: All data will be collected into an access file database for ease&#xD;
      of analysis. Demographic data collected will include: APACHE II score, age, gender,&#xD;
      underlying illness, ICU admission diagnosis and gut function, enteral and parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition, including tubes in place. In addition length of hospital, ICU stay, and death&#xD;
      during hospitalization will be recorded. We will also record the type, route, duration and&#xD;
      dose of acid-suppressive therapy before, during and after ICU admission and details of all&#xD;
      medications administered during the ICU stay.To aid in drug cost calculations, PPI associated&#xD;
      preparation and administration time will also be recorded by observation of 30 ICU admissions&#xD;
      each for enteral and parenteral PPI group. Drug costs will be based on 2008 Red book average&#xD;
      wholesale price of drugs and resource utilization costs will be based on hospital billing&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and Interpretation: Descriptive Summary: We will report descriptive statistics&#xD;
      in terms of proportions of enteral and parenteral PPI use (dose and duration) in ICU and&#xD;
      after discharge from ICU. We will also report patient, disease, and resource utilization&#xD;
      (continuous measures of PPI dose and duration, and PPI associated preparation and&#xD;
      administration time, length of stay (LOS) in ICU, out of ICU, and hospital) characteristics&#xD;
      by the two PPI groups (enteral including Lansoprazole solutab versus parenteral). Further,&#xD;
      using micro-costing procedures we will estimate economic outcomes i.e. costs in dollars&#xD;
      associated with drug resource utilization (PPI dose and duration, and PPI associated&#xD;
      preparation and administration time) for the two groups. Savings in drug costs will be also&#xD;
      be computed in dollars by calculating difference between parenteral and enteral PPI groups.&#xD;
      Death during hospitalization will also be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses for primary aims will be as follows - Aim 1: The proportion of PPI patients&#xD;
      initiated on parenteral PPI and enteral PPI will be compared for statistically significant&#xD;
      differences on ICU patient and disease characteristics using suitable (chi-square or&#xD;
      Fischer's exact) tests. The use of the two PPI groups may be confounded by patient and&#xD;
      disease characteristics. To adjust for these confounding factors, multivariate regression&#xD;
      modeling will be used. We will carry out multivariate logistic regression modeling to compare&#xD;
      the odds of enteral versus parenteral PPI use. Aim 2: Number of patients (mean +/- SD)&#xD;
      initiated on parenteral PPIs that could receive enteral therapy as first choice in ICU and&#xD;
      after discharge from ICU will be estimated. Aim 3: Savings in drug costs associated with&#xD;
      conversion of eligible patients from parenteral to enteral PPI therapy in the ICU and&#xD;
      conversion of eligible patients requiring continued AST from parenteral to enteral PPI&#xD;
      therapy after discharge from ICU will be reported as mean for normal distribution or median&#xD;
      for skewed distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses for secondary aims will be as follows - For the secondary aim 1, we will compare the&#xD;
      proportion of patients initiated on enteral and parenteral PPIs using chi-square or fishers&#xD;
      exact test. For the secondary aims 2, and 3, we will compare the mean or median for resource&#xD;
      and economic outcome variables between the two PPI groups using an independent sample t-test&#xD;
      or a Wilcoxon rank sum test for skewed distributions, respectively.&#xD;
