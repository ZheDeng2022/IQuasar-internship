      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective of this project is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To evaluate the efficacy of long term (18 months) L-Arginine therapy in preventing or&#xD;
      delaying clinical onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus in subjects with impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance (IGT) and Metabolic Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define if a long term treatment with L-arginine is able to ameliorate insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity and endothelial dysfunction in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To find new risk profiles and candidate genes able to define the sub-group of patients&#xD;
           at higher risk to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This is a double blind, parallel, one centre study to determine if long term oral&#xD;
      L-arginine administration is able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients&#xD;
      with Metabolic Syndrome. Two hundred and ninety four subjects were recruited at the&#xD;
      Cardio-Metabolic and Clinical Trials Unit of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute. One&#xD;
      hundred and forty two patients were randomized to enter the study and assigned to two arms:&#xD;
      oral L-arginine (6.4 g/die) or placebo, in addition to diet and physical exercise. The&#xD;
      treatment were maintained for 18 months. Visits were performed every 3 months for clinical&#xD;
      evaluation, blood samples, treatment supply and collection of data on adverse events.&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients were contacted every month by telephone to evaluate the accurate&#xD;
      continuation of the study and they were instructed to phone to the centre in case of possible&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An OGTT were performed before the enter into the study and at the end of the study period. An&#xD;
      additional OGTT were performed at an intermediate visit if fasting glucose levels were more&#xD;
      than 126 mg/dl. A diabetic response caused the end-point of the patient. Metabolic, hormonal&#xD;
      and endothelial activation and inflammation parameters were measured. Evaluation of&#xD;
      endothelium-mediated and non-endothelium-mediated vasodilatation were performed by strain&#xD;
      gauche plethysmography evaluating forearm blood at the basal state. in post-ischemic&#xD;
      conditions and after nitroglycerine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the enter into the study, an additional blood sample were drawn for DNA extraction and&#xD;
      candidate genes variants evaluation. Before the enter into the study and at the end of the&#xD;
      study period, gene expression for inflammation were measured on mRNA extraction on&#xD;
      endothelial progenitor cells.&#xD;

      This is a double blind, parallel, one centre study to determine if long term oral L-arginine&#xD;
      administration is able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with IGT and&#xD;
      Metabolic Syndrome. Two hundred and ninety four subjects were recruited at the&#xD;
      CardioMetabolic and Clinical Trials Unit of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute. One&#xD;
      hundred and fourty two patients were randomized to enter the study. Patients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to two arms: oral L-arginine (6.4 g/die) or placebo in blind scheme. The treatment&#xD;
      were maintained for 18 months. Visits will be performed every 3 months for clinical&#xD;
      evaluation, blood samples, treatment supply and collect data on adverse events, if any.&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients were contacted every month by telephone to evaluate the accurate&#xD;
      continuation of the study and they were instructed to phone to the centre in case of possible&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
