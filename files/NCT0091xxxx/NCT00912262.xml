  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single-blinded study in healthy volunteers is to select a&#xD;
      Low-Concentration Capsaicin Topical Liquid (LC-CTL) to serve as a control formulation in the&#xD;
      further clinical development of Capsaicin Topical Liquid, NGX-1998 (10% w/w). The goal is to&#xD;
      identify a low concentration formulation that will not reduce ENFD in healthy normal&#xD;
      volunteers when compared to NGX-1998 (10% w/w) but would still produce some local&#xD;
      capsaicin-related application site responses (e.g. erythema, heat sensation or pain) when&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single center, single-blind controlled study in up to 36 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Each subject will be dosed at four application sites, 7 by 7 cm in size, located&#xD;
      n the distal and proximal anterior medial thigh areas. At two sites, subjects will receive&#xD;
      15-minute treatments of a LC-CTL (1%, 0.3%, 0.1%, 0.003% or 0.001% w/w). At the remaining two&#xD;
      sites, subjects will receive 15-minute treatments of NGX-1998 (10% w/w) and a control liquid&#xD;
      (CTL-V (0%)). The volume applied at each application site is estimated to be 7 mcl per cm2&#xD;
      and hence the total volume of approximately 300 mcl of LC-CTL (all concentrations), NGX-1998&#xD;
      (10% w/w) and CTL-V (0%) applied at each site application will be sufficient to evenly wet&#xD;
      the surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The top or bottom section of each application site will be pre-treated with lidocaine 2.5% /&#xD;
      prilocaine 2.5% topical anesthetic cream. These sections are also the sections where the skin&#xD;
      punch biopsies will be taken. The biopsy will be obtained from these sections as it is&#xD;
      anticipated that subsequent clinical trials in patients will use pre-treatment with a topical&#xD;
      anesthetic. However, only the toop or bottom sections will be pre-treated with this topical&#xD;
      anesthetic so that pre-treatment with the topical anesthetic cream does not interfere with&#xD;
      tolerability assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacodynamic effects of nerve fiber density and function will be evaluated by&#xD;
      immunohistochemical staining of biopsied tissue from the treatment area. Skin punch biopsies&#xD;
      at all four application sites will be obtained to evaluate ENFD at 7 days post-application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by continuous monitoring of adverse events (AEs0&#xD;
      and periodic assessments of clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical&#xD;
      examinations, dermal assessments, and pain associated with treatment.&#xD;
