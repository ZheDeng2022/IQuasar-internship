      Though brain metastases are a risk in all patients with breast cancer, those with HER-2&#xD;
      overexpression are at significantly greater risk. One series estimated a 30% incidence of&#xD;
      brain metastases in this population, while another study found an incidence of approximately&#xD;
      40%. Traditional systemic therapies do not cross the blood brain barrier to any significant&#xD;
      degree or at all, but radiation treatment can be effective in the treatment of intracranial&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;

      The rationale for PCI is that the brain is a sanctuary site where cancer cells can remain&#xD;
      inaccessible to chemotheraphy and agents such as trastuzumab due to the blood brain barrier,&#xD;
      which prevents potentially harmful chemicals such as chemotherapy agents and antibodies such&#xD;
      as trastuzumab from reaching the brain. Decreasing the incidence of brain metastasis with&#xD;
      acceptable effects on neurocognitive function would be a significant improvement in the care&#xD;
      of patients with MBC.&#xD;
