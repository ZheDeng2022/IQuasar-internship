  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of&#xD;
      XP21279 sustained release formulation [administered with Lodosyn® (carbidopa)] and Sinemet®&#xD;
      tablets in subjects with Parkinson's disease with Motor Fluctuations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/Phase 2 multiple-dose, multi-center, open-label, two period&#xD;
      sequential-treatment study in subjects with Parkinson's disease to assess the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of XP21279 sustained release formulation&#xD;
      [administered with Lodosyn® (carbidopa)] and Sinemet® tablets in subjects with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease and to explore dose correspondence between XP21279 and Sinemet® to guide dose&#xD;
      selection for future studies in the target population (subjects with Parkinson's disease with&#xD;
      motor fluctuations on Sinemet®).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, confirmed by the&#xD;
             presence of at least two cardinal signs of the disease (resting tremor, bradykinesia,&#xD;
             rigidity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must have predictable motor fluctuations of the wearing off type, defined by&#xD;
             wearing off in at least 50% of inter-dose intervals between the first and the last&#xD;
             daily doses as recorded on the on/off diary over 3 days (Days -4 to -2) in the&#xD;
             Screening Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be on stable TID or QID Sinemet® or carbidopa/levodopa regimens from&#xD;
             morning through early evening, with a total daily dose ranging from 400 mg to 1000 mg&#xD;
             of levodopa, for at least 1 week prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History, signs, or symptoms suggesting the diagnosis of secondary or atypical&#xD;
             Parkinsonism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has greater than or equal to moderately disabling dyskinesias for greater than&#xD;
             25% of the waking day as assessed by a score of 2 or more on item 32 and a score of 2&#xD;
             or more on item 33 on the UPDRS at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who are dosing with Sinemet® or carbidopa/levodopa during the night time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have significant neurological symptoms not accounted for by Parkinson's&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who are taking concomitantly COMT inhibitors (i.e., entacapone or tolcapone)&#xD;
             or treated with Stalevo®, Sinemet® CR, or Madopar®/Prolopa® (levodopa/benserazide).&#xD;
