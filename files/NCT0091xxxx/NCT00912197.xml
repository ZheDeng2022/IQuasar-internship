  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to look into the effects of oligofructose supplementation on appetite,&#xD;
      energy intake, and body weight and body composition in overweight subjects. Compared to a&#xD;
      placebo product (cellulose) oligofructose is hypothesised to suppress hunger and thereby&#xD;
      reduce food intake moderately leading to a decrease in body weight.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Appetite regulation plays an important part in energy balance. Suppressing appetite by&#xD;
      manipulating the diet is a safe way of reducing energy intake and body weight compared to&#xD;
      drug therapy and obesity surgery. How various nutrients affect appetite is not fully&#xD;
      understood. Non-digestible carbohydrates (NDC) may affect appetite differently due to&#xD;
      differences in physio-chemical properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will look into how two different NDC affect appetite and energy intake in&#xD;
      overweight individuals in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo controlled parallel study.&#xD;
      The NDC under investigation are oligofructose and cellulose, both natural compounds of plant&#xD;
      origin. The former is broken down (fermented) in the large bowel by friendly bacteria&#xD;
      producing various compounds that may affect appetite and the metabolism of the host.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will consume one of the two NDC for eight weeks (including a two week run-in&#xD;
      period). Appetite study session, functional MRI (fMRI) and MRI body fat scans will be&#xD;
      conducted before and after the supplementation with NDC (or during the supplementation in the&#xD;
      case of fMRI). Using fMRI the effect of the NDC supplementation on central appetite&#xD;
      regulating centres will be investigated. Appetite questionnaires and dietary records will&#xD;
      completed under free-living conditions at baseline and during the supplementation to explore&#xD;
      the effect on subjective appetite feelings and energy intake, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that this project will enhance the understanding of how NDC affect appetite and&#xD;
      provide further information on how fermentation of NDC, gut hormone release, body&#xD;
      composition, and appetite regulation are linked.&#xD;
