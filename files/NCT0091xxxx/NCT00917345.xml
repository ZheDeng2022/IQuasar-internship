      Background: The most common pharmacologic test for diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (PA) is&#xD;
      administration of captopril to examine whether abnormal aldosterone to plasma rennin activity&#xD;
      (PRA)(ARR) persists, although active rennin concentration (ARC) in contrast to PRA may offers&#xD;
      advantages with regard to processing and standardization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess whether post captopril ARC offer any additional advantage in screening&#xD;
      primary aldosteronism (PA) than PRA and establish thresholds for the diagnosis using ARC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary aldosteronism (PA), characterized by an inappropriate production of aldosterone,&#xD;
      affects 5-13% of patients with hypertension(1, 2). The use of aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR)&#xD;
      as screening test contributes to the increased diagnostic rate of this disease(2), but it is&#xD;
      not standardized among laboratories. As the incidence of PA has increased since ARR has been&#xD;
      used as a screening test (3, 4), the difficulty in establishing a diagnosis of PA may be&#xD;
      encountered because of atypical manifestations. Administration of captopril to differentiate&#xD;
      the normal renin-angiotensin- aldosterone axis from autonomous secretion of aldosterone has&#xD;
      been proved to be a safe and effective test in confirmation of the diagnosis (5-8). Several&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that the ARR after a single dose of captopril is diagnostic (5-8)&#xD;
      and as sensitive as the saline loading test for the identification of aldosterone- producing&#xD;
      adenoma (APA)(8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active rennin concentration (ARC) is considerably easier to perform; being a single&#xD;
      immunoradiometric assay as opposed to the initial generation of angiotensin I generated from&#xD;
      angiotensinogen followed by radioimmunoassay of PRA(9). It was demonstrated as a reliable and&#xD;
      convenient screening tool for ambulatory conditions, independent of body posture (10).&#xD;
      Decreased angiotensinogen level is noted in pathological status ( e.g. liver cirrhosis, sever&#xD;
      cardiac failure) (11, 12) that results in dissociate of PRA measurement. PAC when used in&#xD;
      conjunction with aldosterone to produce an ARRARC , has been reported to classify&#xD;
      aldosteronism correctly(13). Although PRA is highly sensitive, the measurement is&#xD;
      time-consuming and measured values can vary considerably between laboratories(14). In&#xD;
      aldosteronism with suppressed renin, the ratio of ARR is clearly dependent on the variants&#xD;
      lower detection limit(15). Though determination of ARC in contrast to PRA offers advantage&#xD;
      with regard to processing and standardization, knowing the postcaptopril sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity as well as the optimum cut off value of ARC is paramount (16) help to the&#xD;
      diagnosis PA (15, 17, 18) and might serve better performance than ARRPRA.&#xD;

        Patients were referred to the hypertension clinics for suspicious of aldosteronism after an&#xD;
        initial evaluation, and recorded in the Taiwan Primary Aldosteronism Investigation&#xD;
        (TAIPAI). The initial evaluation included (1) age at onset younger than 35 years, (2)&#xD;
        hypertension that is difficult to control after initiating therapy, (3) clinical occurrence&#xD;
        of a hypertensive crisis, (4) the presence of hypokaliemia or metabolic alkalosis, or a&#xD;
        random aldosterone-renin ration (ARR) &gt;30, and (5) evidence of adrenal incidentaloma and&#xD;
        hypertension or hypokalemia. All patients with intention to confirm and received captopril&#xD;
        test were recruited and data were prospectively collected.&#xD;
