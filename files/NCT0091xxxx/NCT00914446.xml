      The main aim of this work will be to identify a profile of gene expression by microarray in&#xD;
      the liver which might allow to differentiate obese subjects having a normal liver from those&#xD;
      with steatohepatitis or steatosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent epidemiological studies in France showed a strong prevalence of obesity (12,4%) and&#xD;
      its strong increase during the 20 last years. Among the multiple complications related to&#xD;
      obesity, the hepatic complications (steatosis and steatohepatitis (NASH)) are among most&#xD;
      frequent. Our recent work showed that the adipose tissue, following the example of hepatic&#xD;
      tissue also expressed CRP, the hepcidin and the IL-6 on a gene and protein level. We also&#xD;
      noticed that 5% of our patients in spite of their obesity presented a normal liver without&#xD;
      steatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this work will be to identify a profile of gene expression by microarray in&#xD;
      the liver which might allow to differentiate the obese subjects having a normal liver from&#xD;
      those with steatohepatitis or steatosis. The gene studies will be carried out initially in&#xD;
      morbid obese subjects without diabetes (women, index of body mass &gt; 40 kg/m2). We will select&#xD;
      a sample of 10 patients having a normal liver, 10 patients having a NASH and 10 patients&#xD;
      having a simple steatosis. These gene studies will be carried out in the liver and visceral&#xD;
      adipose tissue from these same patients which will make possible to evaluate the&#xD;
      interrelationship between the liver and the adipose tissue. We will also include 10 patients&#xD;
      having an overweight and a NASH (study only on liver biopsy). The livers controls (10) will&#xD;
      be provided from the department of surgery of Pr Jean Gugenheim and are practically all&#xD;
      available. They are &quot;healthy&quot; tissue near hepatic benign tumors. Commercial ARN (Biosciences,&#xD;
      Stratagene) will be also used. After identification of these profiles of gene expression in a&#xD;
      restricted number of patients, we will validate these profiles of gene expression in a more&#xD;
      significant number of patients (30 to 45 patients having a NASH compared with 30 to 45&#xD;
      patients having a simple steatosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the profile of gene expression between the liver and the adipose visceral and&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue from the morbid obese subjects After the identification of a group of&#xD;
      genes of interest whose expression is modified in a small number of patients having a NASH,&#xD;
      we continue our study with a more restricted number of genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To validate in a more significant number of patients the modifications of expression of&#xD;
           these genes by an approach by real-time PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the site of expression of these factors in the liver or adipose tissue by&#xD;
           immunohistochemic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of expression of these factors in the liver or adipose tissue by&#xD;
           biochemical analysis (Western blot)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A serum dosage could finally be carried out to determine if the serum proteins could&#xD;
           constitute a predictive index of the NASH or steatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the series of obese patients from the CHU of Nice whose a surgical approach of&#xD;
      obesity was programmed. Preoperative explorations include clinico-biological assessments.&#xD;
      During the intervention, the liver and adipose tissue biopsies will be systematically&#xD;
      realized for research. We will also use the hepatic biopsies carried out among patients&#xD;
      having an overweight and a NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of the work does not pose any problem. The department of surgery carries out&#xD;
      10 surgeries of obesity per month. We already have a series of 280 patients. We must include&#xD;
      150 patients in order to be able to obtain sufficiently patients with normal liver. For the&#xD;
      other patients, we will use the tissue bank which is already carried out and the patients&#xD;
      already gave the consent. Finally we must constitute a liver tissue bank for patients having&#xD;
      an overweight. All these fundamental techniques are controlled within team from INSERM U 568&#xD;
      Awaited results: We could by this strategy select protective and worsening factors of&#xD;
      steatohepatitis (NASH) which will be able to lead to identify predictive biological markers&#xD;
      of the lesions of steatohepatitis and thus to identify patients at risk for the hepatic&#xD;
      lesions. These factors could also serve as future therapeutic targets.&#xD;
