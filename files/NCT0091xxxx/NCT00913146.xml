      The investigators performed a prospective study, in order to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of restricting antimalarials to rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-confirmed cases in&#xD;
      children aged 5 to 15 years-old&#xD;

      This study was designed to measure the incidence of malaria attacks during a 2-week follow-up&#xD;
      period in 2 populations of patients. First, an index group (IG, exposed to fever) constituted&#xD;
      by schoolchildren attending the school nursery for fever and not diagnosed malaria, based on&#xD;
      a negative HRP2-based RDT. Second, a control group (CG, not exposed to fever) constituted of&#xD;
      apparently healthy schoolchildren paired with index cases on gender, age, week of inclusion&#xD;
      and malaria status (ie: negative HRP2-based RDT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pragmatic purpose, the subjects were selected for inclusion if no malaria diagnosis was&#xD;
      made by the means accessible to a clinician in routine practice, i.e., RDT and body&#xD;
      temperature assessment. During the follow-up, malaria was defined as the association of fever&#xD;
      and parasitemia, using any malaria diagnostic method, whatever its availability on the field:&#xD;
      (blood smear and/or PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the primary objective of the study was to show that applying the algorithm of&#xD;
      management of fevers in the school setting is safe, in the way it does not lead to an&#xD;
      excessive number of undiagnosed (and thus untreated) malaria attacks, by comparing the number&#xD;
      of malaria attacks between the two groups (exposed and non exposed to fever).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective was to compare malaria incidence between children at high risk for&#xD;
      malaria during follow-up in the IG and CG respectively. Children at high risk for malaria in&#xD;
      these 2 groups were defined by the detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection at&#xD;
      enrollment, using the most sensitive diagnostic tool currently available (i.e., PCR). Based&#xD;
      on data from the literature, we estimated to about 15% the proportion of children attending&#xD;
      for fever with a negative RDT and a positive PCR for malaria, and we assumed this proportion&#xD;
      to be roughly the same in apparently healthy children. Twenty-eight children at high risk for&#xD;
      malaria in each group (corresponding to187 children in each group) are needed to detect an 8%&#xD;
      difference in proportion between the 2 groups (α = 0.05 and β = 0.8). Assuming a maximum of&#xD;
      5% in the dropout rate, we aimed at including a minimum of 200 children in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site: This study was performed from February through June 2008 in 4 schools, located at&#xD;
      Allada, Southern-Benin, where malaria transmission is intense and perennial. Altogether, the&#xD;
      4 study schools received about 2600 schoolchildren of 5 years-old and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of the study: Ethical clearance was obtained from the Faculty of Medicine ethics&#xD;
      committee, Benin National University, Cotonou. Children attended school nurseries on their&#xD;
      own, or led by their parents/guardians. Care was provided for any child from a school&#xD;
      participating to the study. Children from the IG were included and actively followed only if&#xD;
      individual informed consent was obtained (within 24 hours from the initial visit) from a&#xD;
      parent or guardian. Asymptomatic children were screened for the CG on gender, age, week of&#xD;
      inclusion. The first child with a negative RDT and for whom an informed consent was obtained,&#xD;
      was included in the CG. Asymptomatic children (screened for inclusion into the CG) and with a&#xD;
      positive RDT were advised to quickly attend at the school nursery as soon as symptoms of&#xD;
      malaria would appear. Children treated for malaria within the prior month were not included&#xD;
      in either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children were examined by a study nurse. Children with danger signs were referred to a&#xD;
      health centre. Children attending the school nurseries were managed for fever only if fever&#xD;
      was stated (tympanic temperature at 37.8°C or above) or if an history of fever in the&#xD;
      preceding 24 hours was reported. For each schoolchild managed for fever, a RDT (Paracheck®,&#xD;
      ORCHID Diagnostics) was performed and children were given artemether-lumefantrine (AL) if the&#xD;
      RDT result was positive, according to national guidelines in this age group. At enrolment and&#xD;
      during follow-up, medications with antimalarial activity for the treatment of non malarial&#xD;
      illnesses were avoided when acceptable alternatives were available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits were on day 3, 7 and 14. A blood smear and a blood spot were collected at&#xD;
      enrolment and at each scheduled visit. An additional blood spot for pharmacological data was&#xD;
      collected for 100 children in each group on day 0 and day 14. When fever was reported and/or&#xD;
      stated at a follow-up visit, a RDT was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimated the number of undiagnosed P falciparum malaria at enrolment, by taking into&#xD;
      account both baseline data (all cases with P falciparum parasitemia &gt;1000/µL) and follow-up&#xD;
      data with fever with concomitant occurrence of at least one test (including PCR) positive for&#xD;
      a P falciparum infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis: RDTs were red by the study nurse, as recommended by manufacturer 15&#xD;
      minutes after it was performed. Microscopy examination was done retrospectively (patients&#xD;
      were managed according to RDT results in terms of antimalarials prescriptions and IG or CG&#xD;
      group assignment) and blinded to the patient's identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA was prepared from blood collected at day 0 and on the last day of follow-up, as well as&#xD;
      at occurrence of fever during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 0 and day 14 in the 100 first children from each group, whole blood was sampled on&#xD;
      filter paper spots and dried at room temperature. Using these dried blood spot (DBS),&#xD;
      chloroquine (and monodesethylchloroquine) and quinine were detected by high pressure liquid&#xD;
      chromatography with UV detection to 254 nm using ammonium acetate (40 mM, pH&#xD;
      =5.5)/acetonitrile (85/15 % v/v).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Parametric tests (Pearson's chi-square and chi-square for the comparison of crude&#xD;
      rates) and non-parametric (Fischer) tests were used. A logistic regression on PCR positivity&#xD;
      at enrollment was performed, taking into account variables likely to influence the malarial&#xD;
      status: gender, age, school, clinical status, declared bednet use.&#xD;
