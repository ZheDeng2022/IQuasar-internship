    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone&#xD;
      on the conduction of electric charges within the heart and to determine the blood levels of&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate following administration in patients with metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drugs will be known) study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone on the conduction of electric charges within&#xD;
      the heart in male patients diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (a&#xD;
      progressive form of prostate cancer that spreads to other parts of the body). At various time&#xD;
      points outline in the protocol from Day -1 of Cycle 1 up to Day 2 of Cycle 2, patients will&#xD;
      have electrocardiograms extracted from a 24 hour holter-monitor to evaluate the electrical&#xD;
      activity of their heart. Efficacy will be assessed according to Prostate Cancer Working Group&#xD;
      2 and modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria. Serial blood samples&#xD;
      for pharmacokinetic analysis (how the drug concentrations change over time) will be collected&#xD;
      and safety will be monitored throughout the study. Patients will take 1000 mg of abiraterone&#xD;
      acetate once daily plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily orally (by mouth) until disease&#xD;
      progression and will be followed up for up to 60 months.&#xD;
