      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      docetaxel and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug&#xD;
      (combination chemotherapy) together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of giving bevacizumab together with&#xD;
      docetaxel and cyclophosphamide and to see how well it works in treating patients with&#xD;
      early-stage high-risk breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm, non randomised pilot study investigating the safety of the combination&#xD;
      of Docetaxel + Cyclophosphamide+ Bevacizumab in the adjuvant treatment of patients with early&#xD;
      stage, HER 2 negative, high risk breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the feasibility of the combination of adjuvant bevacizumab, docetaxel, and&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide in patients with early-stage HER2-negative high-risk breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety of this regimen with regards to cardiac toxicity, hypertension, and&#xD;
           bleeding complications in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen by measuring Topo II overexpression in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 4 cycles of Docetaxel 75mg/m2 + 4 cycles of Cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2&#xD;
      (each cycle lasts 21 days) (+/- 3 days if a due date could not be met because of public&#xD;
      holidays, etc) and concomitant Avastin (Bevacizumab) 15mg/kg q 3weeks for treatment duration&#xD;
      of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab at a dose of 15mg/kg will be administered as an intravenous infusion every 3&#xD;
      weeks for a treatment period of one year, regardless of missed doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up through 5 years (i.e. from the time of registration through to&#xD;
      end of Year 5/ 1 year treatment and 4 years follow up).&#xD;
