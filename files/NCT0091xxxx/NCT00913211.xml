    <textblock>
      Paralysis following stroke stems not only from the loss of neurons killed by the stroke but&#xD;
      also from the loss of neurons lying dormant in the stroke hemisphere. One of the reasons&#xD;
      viable neurons become dormant (down-regulated) is because of excessive interhemispheric&#xD;
      inhibition imposed on them from the nonstroke hemisphere. The challenge in&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation is to restore excitability and voluntary control of these down-regulated&#xD;
      neurons in the stroke hemisphere. Suppression of the source of this excessive&#xD;
      interhemispheric inhibition can be achieved with the noninvasive method called repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). It has been shown in healthy subjects that the&#xD;
      known depressant effects of low-frequency rTMS can be increased and prolonged by preceding it&#xD;
      with 6-Hz priming stimulation. In a recent safety study, we showed that one treatment of 6-Hz&#xD;
      primed low-frequency rTMS applied to the nonstroke hemisphere is safe. It is now important to&#xD;
      evaluate a series of these treatments and whether their efficacy can be enhanced by combining&#xD;
      the rTMS with motor learning training. The specific aims of this study are to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy, mechanism, and safety of a series of 5 treatments of 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS&#xD;
      applied to nonstroke hemisphere and combined with motor learning training to promote recovery&#xD;
      of the paretic hand. Forty subjects with stroke will be randomly assigned to one of four&#xD;
      treatment groups. The rTMS/only group will receive 20 min. of rTMS per day. The Track/only&#xD;
      group will receive 20 min. of finger tracking training per day. The rTMS/combined group will&#xD;
      receive alternating days of the rTMS and Track treatments. The rTMS/sham group will receive&#xD;
      20 min. of rTMS using a sham electrode each day. The hypotheses are: 1) the rTMS/combined&#xD;
      group will show the greatest improvements in hand function, 2) the rTMS/combined group will&#xD;
      show the greatest improvements in cortical excitability using paired-pulse TMS testing and in&#xD;
      brain reorganization using fMRI, and 3) the rTMS treatment will be safe. The proposed&#xD;
      research is important because it addresses the greatest cause of long-term disability in&#xD;
      society, hemiparesis following stroke, and it is innovative because it applies a technique&#xD;
      never used before, 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS combined with motor learning training. The&#xD;
      potential impact of this research is a radical change to rehabilitation that accomplishes a&#xD;
      higher quality of life in stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research penetrates the problem of hemiparesis following stroke. This problem&#xD;
      devastates quality of life in thousands of people each year. The brain shows remarkable&#xD;
      ability to reorganize under certain conditions, including after stroke. Unfortunately, some&#xD;
      changes are maladaptive and leave the individual with additional loss of function beyond that&#xD;
      caused directly by the ischemic damage. Specifically, motor neurons in the ipsilesional&#xD;
      (stroke) hemisphere that have survived the stroke can undergo a loss of excitability due to&#xD;
      exaggerated interhemispheric inhibition imposed on them from neurons in the contralesional&#xD;
      (non-stroke) hemisphere through transcallosal pathways. Fortunately, the maladaptive&#xD;
      reorganization is reversible, even in chronic stroke, through forced-use and forced-learning&#xD;
      paradigms with the paretic limb. But we postulate that the effectiveness of behavioral&#xD;
      training can be richly enhanced when combined with electrophysiologic intervention that also&#xD;
      affects neural excitability. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a potent&#xD;
      and noninvasive way to influence the excitability of the brain. rTMS, at low stimulation&#xD;
      frequencies, depresses neural function. By stimulating the contralesional motor cortex at low&#xD;
      frequency, thereby depressing interhemispheric inhibition, a net excitatory effect&#xD;
      (disinhibition) is induced upon the ipsilesional motor cortex. Furthermore, it has been shown&#xD;
      in animals and in healthy humans that the depressive effect on the stimulated hemisphere can&#xD;
      be magnified by preceding the low-frequency rTMS with 6-hz &quot;priming&quot; rTMS. We will call this&#xD;
      arrangement 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS. We contend that by combining 6-Hz primed&#xD;
      low-frequency rTMS with behavioral motor learning training unprecedented improvements in&#xD;
      recovery from hemiparesis can be achieved. We have recently demonstrated the safety of a&#xD;
      single treatment of 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS in stroke but a large gap in knowledge&#xD;
      still exists in not knowing the effect of serial treatments of 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS&#xD;
      combined with motor learning training. Failure to address this gap only perpetuates the use&#xD;
      of conservative strategies in stroke rehabilitation, which may rob individuals of their&#xD;
      fullest possible recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to maximize motor recovery following stroke. The objective of this&#xD;
      proposal is to integrate the excitability effects induced exogenously by rTMS with those&#xD;
      produced endogenously by motor learning to produce a powerful yet safe interactive effect&#xD;
      leading to improved recovery from hemiparesis. The central hypothesis is that serial&#xD;
      treatments of 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS combined with motor learning training will be&#xD;
      effective and safe. Our research team is uniquely qualified to execute this project because&#xD;
      of 1) special training in rTMS undertaken by the PI in the laboratory of an international&#xD;
      leader in rTMS, 2) participation of this leader as a consultant, 3) participation of a&#xD;
      neuroscientist with expertise in stroke neuroplasticity as a consultant, 4) participation of&#xD;
      a recognized expert in cerebrovascular disease as a co-investigator, 5) conducting the study&#xD;
      in the University of Minnesota's General Clinical Research Center to maximize protection of&#xD;
      patients, and 6) inclusion of the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research for studying brain&#xD;
      reorganization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1. Determine the efficacy of using serial treatments of 6-Hz primed&#xD;
      low-frequency rTMS, in isolation and in combination with motor learning training, to improve&#xD;
      hand function in stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty subjects with stroke (with partial movement in weak hand, able to walk 100 feet, able&#xD;
      to follow directions, no history of seizures, no medical devices or metal incompatible with&#xD;
      mri) will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to one of four treatment groups: The rTMSonly&#xD;
      group will receive 5 treatments of rTMS to the primary motor area (M1) of the contralesional&#xD;
      hemisphere consisting of 10 min. of 6-Hz (&quot;priming&quot;) rTMS at 90% of resting motor threshold&#xD;
      interrupted into 20 trains of 5-s duration with 25-s intervals between trains then followed&#xD;
      immediately by 10 additional min. of 1-Hz (&quot;low-frequency&quot;) rTMS continuously at 90% of&#xD;
      resting motor threshold. Treatments will be every other day over two weeks. The Trackonly&#xD;
      group will receive 5 treatments of computerized finger tracking training every other day for&#xD;
      two weeks. The rTMScombined group will receive the same rTMS as the rTMSonly group and it&#xD;
      will be alternated with the same tracking training as the Trackonly group until 5 days of&#xD;
      each have occurred over a two-week period. The rTMSsham group will receive the same rTMS&#xD;
      procedures, including similar sound, but no magnetic stimulation will occur. The four&#xD;
      treatments have a 2x2 factorial design, with rTMS and tracking as the factors, which allows&#xD;
      estimation of any synergistic effects of rTMS combined with tracking. Behavioral gains in the&#xD;
      paretic hand will be measured with finger prehension/dexterity tests, finger tracking&#xD;
      accuracy, subject self ratings and examiner ratings. The working hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the rTMScombined group will show greater improvements in paretic hand function than the&#xD;
           rTMSonly and Trackonly groups at posttest and at one-month follow-up, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the rTMSonly and Trackonly groups will show greater improvements than the rTMSsham&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2. Explore the neural mechanism associated with 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS&#xD;
      combined with tracking training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the treatments described in Aim #1, M1 excitability will be measured with&#xD;
      paired-pulse TMS testing in the ipsilesional hemisphere. This testing will allow for&#xD;
      examination of both cortical inhibition and excitation. In addition, brain reorganization&#xD;
      associated with voluntary activation will be measured with functional MRI yielding data on&#xD;
      volume and signal intensity of active voxels during paretic finger tracking. The working&#xD;
      hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the rTMScombined group will show greater increases in cortical excitability and brain&#xD;
           reorganization in the ipsilesional hemisphere than the rTMSonly and Trackonly groups at&#xD;
           posttest and at one-month follow-up,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the rTMSonly and Trackonly groups will show greater increases than the rTMSsham group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3. Determine the safety of serial 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS treatments in&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associated with the treatments described in Aim #1, adverse effects will be measured through&#xD;
      observation for seizures at the time of treatment. Neurocognitive tests will measure mood,&#xD;
      verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, working memory and processing speed. Also, a&#xD;
      finger tracking test will measure motor control in the nonparetic hand. The working&#xD;
      hypothesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. five 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS treatments, given alone or in combination with motor&#xD;
      learning training, will not produce any seizure activity or any other serious adverse effect.&#xD;
