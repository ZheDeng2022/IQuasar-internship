    <textblock>
      Endotracheal Intubation (ETI) is done to place a plastic tube in a patient's trachea&#xD;
      (windpipe) to assist with breathing. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are&#xD;
      the sickest of patients and the majority of them require this life saving procedure. A&#xD;
      critical illness can be sudden and ETI required urgently. The doctors performing ETI in these&#xD;
      situations may not be experts at ETI. Studies have shown that if it takes more than one&#xD;
      attempt to get the tube in the right position patients can have severe complications such as:&#xD;
      decrease level of oxygen in the body, decrease blood pressure, and cardiac arrest. These&#xD;
      complications can be life threatening and increase the length of time spent in an ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform ETI the doctor uses a metal tool called a laryngoscope that is placed through the&#xD;
      patient's mouth to open the throat and then pass the tube into the trachea. The type of&#xD;
      procedure that has been used for many years is called Direct Laryngoscopy (DL) which means&#xD;
      that the doctor looks through the mouth directly into the throat. Newer technology is&#xD;
      available and can be used at VGH called Video Laryngoscopy (VL). With VL there is a camera on&#xD;
      the end of the laryngoscope and a video image is displayed on a monitor making it easier to&#xD;
      see the entrance to the trachea. VL is not available for all cases at VGH and is unavailable&#xD;
      in many other hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will compare DL to VL. Patients will be randomly placed in one of two&#xD;
      groups: first attempt at ETI done with DL or first attempt of ETI done with DL. Patients will&#xD;
      only be considered eligible for this study if the doctor feels that either DL or VL would be&#xD;
      appropriate for the patient. In this pilot study we hope show that conducting a larger study&#xD;
      would be feasible. If a larger study were to show that VL decreases complications and&#xD;
      shortens length of ICU stay we would be able to recommend this procedure for all ETI at VGH&#xD;
      as well as other hospitals where it currently may not be available.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: In this study, we hypothesize that videolaryngoscopy (VL) is associated with a&#xD;
      decreased risk of intubation failure compared to direct laryngoscopy in the critically ill.&#xD;
      We also hypothesize that VL is associated with fewer number of intubation attempts and&#xD;
      decreased risk of complications compared to DL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: In the critically ill, endotracheal intubation is a high-risk procedure with&#xD;
      complications occurring in up to 54% of patients. Our own published work has demonstrated&#xD;
      that more than one attempt at intubation occurred in 33% of patients and was associated with&#xD;
      a three-fold increased risk of severe complications. VL provides a superior laryngeal view&#xD;
      when compared to DL which may translate into less failed intubations, and resultant decreased&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine point estimates for failure to intubate on the first attempt, which can then&#xD;
           be used to power a larger efficacy trial examining VL vs. DL in the critically ill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare VL vs. DL on risk of intubation failure (as defined by one than more attempt)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare VL vs. DL on number of attempts at endotracheal intubation, time-to-intubate,&#xD;
           and risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design: Single center, randomized-controlled pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients: Forty critically ill patients requiring urgent endotracheal intubation (within&#xD;
           30 minutes) by the intensive care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention: Patients will be randomized to initial attempt at intubation by VL vs DL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Power Calculation: Given this is a pilot study to generate point estimates, power&#xD;
           calculations have not been performed. However, 20 patients in each arm will provide a&#xD;
           robust point estimate that can be used to power a future efficacy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Analysis: Data will be analyzed in an intention-to-treat fashion. Our primary objective,&#xD;
           failure to intubate on the first attempt, will be analyzed using Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
           This test will also be used to analyze the risk of complications comparing VL to DL.&#xD;
           Number of attempts at intubation and time-to-intubation will be analyzed using a&#xD;
           Wilcoxon rank-sum test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Potential Pitfalls: As slow recruitment is always a concern, we conservatively estimate&#xD;
           that 5 patients will be enrolled per month, thus requiring a total of 8 months for&#xD;
           patient accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: If VL results in fewer complications during endotracheal intubation, then this&#xD;
      technique may become widely adopted for this high risk procedure. Furthermore, in many&#xD;
      centers, anesthesiology support for airway management of the critically ill may be limited,&#xD;
      if at all present. Thus, the impact of this research may be even more applicable outside of&#xD;
      the tertiary teaching centers where airway management expertise is readily available.&#xD;
