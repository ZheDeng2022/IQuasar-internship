  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RLP) has gained widespread acceptance as&#xD;
      a standard treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer. Despite the enhanced&#xD;
      visualization and precise dissection afforded by the robotic platform, two major&#xD;
      comorbidities affect a significant number of men: incontinence and erectile function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary continence and erectile function&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is commonly believed that the most important factor affecting continence is preservation&#xD;
      of the external urinary sphincter complex which lies just below the prostate. Trauma to the&#xD;
      urethral tissue itself after it is transected from the prostate and damage to the autonomic&#xD;
      nerves that control this sphincter may lead to sphincteric dysfunction. In addition,&#xD;
      dissection of the bladder may lead to bladder irritability which also plays a role in&#xD;
      incontinence. Surgical removal of the prostate also causes significant inflammatory damage to&#xD;
      the pelvic floor which likely delays recovery of urinary continence. The same trauma issues&#xD;
      apply to sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One possible method to protect the nerves and other tissues from operative trauma may be the&#xD;
      use of local hypothermia (cold-ischemia) to the pelvis. Local tissue hypothermia using ice,&#xD;
      ice slush, or cold irrigation has been safely and routinely used for decades in humans during&#xD;
      brain, heart, and kidney surgery to minimize organ damage. Yet, this technique has never been&#xD;
      applied to prostate surgery. We will accomplish local cooling of the pelvis using a cooling&#xD;
      balloon inserted into the rectum. The cooling balloon is powered by an FDA approved cooling&#xD;
      system developed by Innercool therapies. Temperatures of 57-86 degrees F (22+/-8 degrees C).&#xD;

      2. 1. Selection of the Patients From June 2002 to August 2015, a total of 1,503 patients&#xD;
      underwent RARP. During this period, perioperative data, including postoperative functional&#xD;
      outcomes, were prospectively collected using a customized database; our ethics committee&#xD;
      approved the data collection. Erectile function was assessed using the sexual health profile&#xD;
      for men (SHIM) score at 3, 9, 15, and 24 months and then annually after surgery, and the&#xD;
      duration of pad-free continence recovery was asked by a non-physician third party. In our&#xD;
      institution, RH was applied during RARP for all patients from February 2008 to March 2015&#xD;
      (consecutively between the 671st and 1459th cases). Among the recruited patients, 789 men&#xD;
      (52.6%) underwent HP, leaving the other 711 (47.4%) as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) bilateral nerve-sparing RARP (over&#xD;
      70%) and (2) a minimum follow-up of 15 months. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)&#xD;
      men with a history of salvage radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy after RARP&#xD;
      (n=98) and (2) the presence of a high-risk disease with an initial prostate-specific antigen&#xD;
      (PSA) level over 20 ng/ml or biopsy Gleason score over 8, which may influence the refining&#xD;
      surgical plane around the neurovascular bundle (NVB), thereby affecting the degrees of&#xD;
      nerve-sparing strategy at the time of surgery (n=275). Further, (3) the initial 100 cases&#xD;
      were excluded to avoid potential bias from the learning period. From a cohort of 1,503&#xD;
      patients, 59 (3.92%) men whose potency outcome within 15 months was not assessed were also&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Finally, 930 patients were selected for the analysis; half of the&#xD;
      procedures (n=466, 50.1%) were performed under RH and the remaining other half (n=464, 49.9%)&#xD;
      as normothermal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. 2. Endpoints of the Study The primary endpoints of this study were the SHIM score and the&#xD;
      rate of potency regain, which was defined as a SHIM score &gt;17 in the RH and control groups 15&#xD;
      months after surgery. Considering the proven impacts of age and preoperative SHIM scores on&#xD;
      the recovery of potency, the groups were further divided into the young and potent (YP: age&#xD;
      &lt;65 years and SHIM score ≥22, n=409, 43.9%) subgroup and susceptible for impotency (SI: age&#xD;
      ≥65 years or SHIM score &lt;22, n=512, 55.1%) counterpart and investigated the sexual function&#xD;
      of the YP subgroup. The secondary endpoints were the duration of pad-free continence regain&#xD;
      and the rate of continence recovery within 3 months after surgery, especially in the YP&#xD;
      subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Surgical Protocol for RH All procedures were performed by a single surgeon. RH was&#xD;
      achieved by devising an endorectal cooling balloon system (ECB) as previously reported [2, 4,&#xD;
      5]. In brief, a 40-cm, 24-F, 3-way latex urethral catheter was placed inside a 5 × 2.5-inch&#xD;
      elliptic latex balloon that distended at a low pressure and conformed to the rectal wall&#xD;
      without excessive deformations. The lubricated ECB was inserted just inside the anus and&#xD;
      anchored by inflating the catheter balloon to 20 ml. The ECB was then distended and cycled&#xD;
      continuously with cold saline (4°C) by gravity 40 cm above the patient. The ECB volume was&#xD;
      ~200 ml. A 9-F esophageal probe (Smiths Medical ASD, Rockland, MA) was used to obtain the&#xD;
      intracorporeal temperature readings directly along the anterior surface of the rectum/NVB.&#xD;

          <description>The primary aim is confirmation of the feasibility and safety using an improved, more efficient and less labor intensive cooling balloon in patients undergoing hypothermic nerve-sparing RLP. Continence is defined as no protective urinary pad use as reported by the patient in response to the very first question on page 1 of the sample questionnaire.</description>

          <description>Both arms:&#xD;
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable experience (sign, symptom, significant laboratory abnormality, illness, or other medical event) occurring to a patient that appears or worsens during a clinical study, regardless of etiology.&#xD;
Mild - Awareness of signs or symptoms that are easily tolerated. Signs and symptoms are transient and only of minor irritant type and cause no loss of time from normal activities; symptoms do not require medication or a medical evaluation.&#xD;
Moderate - Discomfort severe enough to cause interference with usual activities. Symptoms may require treatment but not extended hospitalization or intensive care for the patient.&#xD;
Severe - Incapacitating with inability to do work or usual activities. Signs and symptoms may be of systemic nature or require medical evaluation and/or treatment that requires prolonged hospital stay</description>
