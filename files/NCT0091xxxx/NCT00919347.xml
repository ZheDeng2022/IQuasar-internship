      The purpose of this study is to measure the prevalence and severity of cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      neuropathy (CAN), diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) which in non-diabetics is termed&#xD;
      advanced nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, and autonomic dysfunction as well as the overall&#xD;
      sympathovagal balance (SB) in the CEFH population of diabetic patients versus non-diabetic&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective vitreoretinal surgery.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome will be to quantify, using the ANSR ANX 3.0 technology, the prevalence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN), diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN),referred to as advanced autonomic nervous system dysfunction in non-diabetic patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The strength of various comorbidities as predictors of autonomic dysfunction in both diabetics and non-diabetics will be evaluated. The differential effect of these various comorbidities in Type I versus Type II diabetes on ANS dysfunction and neuropathy</measure>

    <description>Three values are calculated by the ANSAR ANX 3.0® software of the spectral analysis of HRV and respiration:&#xD;
RFa an indicator of parasympathetic function with normal values between 0.5 and 10 bpm2;&#xD;
LFa an indicator of sympathetic function also with normal values between 0.5 and 10 bpm2;&#xD;
SB or the ratio of LFa/RFa with normal reference values of 0.4 to 3.0.&#xD;
The ANSAR ANX 3.0® software defines three different levels of autonomic neuropathy (autonomic dysfunction) as follows (see Figure 1):&#xD;
Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN): resting parasympathetic insufficiency (not enough parasympathetic protection for the heart) or RFa &lt; 0.1 bpm2.&#xD;
Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy (DAN), or advanced autonomic dysfunction in non-diabetics, is defined as low autonomics: LFa &lt; 0.5 bpm2 or 0.1 &lt; RFa &lt; 0.5 bpm2.&#xD;
Autonomic Dysfunction: normal resting LFa and RFa, but low LFa response to Valsalva or low RFa response to deep breathing.</description>
