      This project aims to identify whether therapeutic substitution of aripiprazole for&#xD;
      risperidone or olanzapine, combined with standard nutrition intervention, will impact the&#xD;
      metabolic changes associated with antipsychotic treatment in children and adolescents.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 6-18 years (at any point during study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &gt; 85th percentile&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One or more DSM-IV diagnoses, including disruptive behavior disorders (attention&#xD;
             deficit disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and disruptive&#xD;
             behavior disorder not otherwise specified), affective disorders (bipolar affective&#xD;
             disorder, major depressive disorder and mood disorder not otherwise specified),&#xD;
             anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder,&#xD;
             separation anxiety, social and other specific phobias) as well as other disorders,&#xD;
             including autism spectrum disorders (autistic disorder, Asperger's Syndrome and&#xD;
             pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified), psychotic disorders&#xD;
             (schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia and psychotic disorder not otherwise&#xD;
             specified) and movement disorders (tic disorder, Tourette's Syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 12 weeks of treatment and no more than approximately 12 months treatment with&#xD;
             risperidone or olanzapine immediately prior to study enrollment (assuming that the&#xD;
             initial phase of prior treatment involved a dose titration; clinically minor dosing&#xD;
             deviations such as changes in dose or missed doses will be evaluated for inclusion by&#xD;
             the PI on an individual basis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinically significant changes in permitted medications (e.g., stimulants) for 1&#xD;
             month prior to Baseline Evaluations (inclusion determined by evaluation on an&#xD;
             individual basis by the PI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant weight gain during an initial course of antipsychotic&#xD;
             treatment; for non-MEAC participants, this is defined as &gt; 10% increase from baseline&#xD;
             weight during the prior treatment if treatment lasted approximately 5-12 months or&#xD;
             defined as &gt; 7% increase from baseline weight during the prior treatment if treatment&#xD;
             lasted approximately 3-4 months (based on the totality of information from primary&#xD;
             care provider, school and home); for prior MEAC participants, clinically significant&#xD;
             weight gain is defined as &gt; 7% increase from baseline weight over the course of the 3&#xD;
             month MEAC study and/or &gt; 10% increase in total body fat as measured by DEXA during&#xD;
             the MEAC study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Score of &gt; 18 on the irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist prior to&#xD;
             initiating antipsychotic treatment: MEAC participants will automatically meet this&#xD;
             criterion based on similar inclusion criteria for MEAC; for non-MEAC participants, the&#xD;
             ABC questionnaire will be administered to parents and one or more collateral source&#xD;
             (such as a teacher, social worker or alternate caregiver) by study staff to&#xD;
             retrospectively gather information about symptoms of irritability and aggression prior&#xD;
             to initiation of antipsychotic treatment. Non-MEAC participants with a retrospective,&#xD;
             consensus (i.e., clinician evaluation of all available sources of ABC data) ABC&#xD;
             irritability subscale score of &gt; 18 in proximity to (e.g., within 3 months of)&#xD;
             initiation of treatment will be included (based on combined evaluation of the totality&#xD;
             of available corroborative resources), and viii) Clinically significant improvement in&#xD;
             psychiatric symptoms during the initial course of antipsychotic based on &gt; 30%&#xD;
             decrease in ABC irritability score from baseline to endpoint in the MEAC study or a&#xD;
             retrospective consensus of 30% decrease in ABC over the prior course of treatment OR a&#xD;
             CGI-I score of 2 or better or psychiatric symptoms experienced for at least 1 month&#xD;
             prior to enrollment as measured by a CGI-S score of 3 or less (mildly ill).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active suicidality&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of any serious medical disorder or condition that may, in the judgment of&#xD;
             the PI, confound the assessment of relevant biologic measures or diagnoses, including:&#xD;
             clinically significant organ system dysfunction; significant endocrine disease,&#xD;
             including diabetes mellitus; coagulopathy; significant anemia; or significant acute&#xD;
             infection; or pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants taking within the last 3 months any glucose lowering agent, lipid&#xD;
             lowering agent, exogenous testosterone, recombinant human growth hormone, or any other&#xD;
             endocrine agent that might confound substrate metabolism, oral glucocorticoids&#xD;
             (glucocorticoid nasal spray and inhalers are permitted), sedating antihistamines&#xD;
             (non-sedating antihistamines like Claritin (loratadine) and Zyrtec (cetirizine) are&#xD;
             permitted), non- serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor antidepressants and mood&#xD;
             stabilizing agents (exposure to SSRI's, stimulants, clonidine and guanfacine&#xD;
             permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IQ &lt; 70 (based on school records and/or evaluation by clinician)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current substance abuse; vi) past history of, or current dyskinesia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stimulant dosage higher than approximately 2 mg/kg/day methylphenidate or equivalent&#xD;
             dose of non-methylphenidate stimulant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who at baseline have elevated total cholesterol or low density&#xD;
             lipoprotein cholesterol (&gt; 95th percentile for age and gender) will be excluded based&#xD;
             on recent American Academy of Pediatric recommendations to treat this level of&#xD;
             dyslipidemia with pharmacotherapy,(63) unless is can be documented that they achieved&#xD;
             the &gt; 95th percentile dyslipidemia during antipsychotic treatment but did not have it&#xD;
             at baseline (e.g., MEAC recruits) given the clinical equipoise around whether the&#xD;
             planned intervention could lower lipids back below the threshold and allow them to&#xD;
             avoid the risks of lipid lowering drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline fasting triglyceride &gt; 400 mg/dl&#xD;
