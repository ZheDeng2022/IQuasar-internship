    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether daily images of the pelvis and bladder using a&#xD;
      device called a cone beam CT scanner will help to increase the accuracy of radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. The cone beam CT scanner is a part of the radiotherapy treatment unit. The results&#xD;
      of the study may allow patients in the future who are undergoing radiotherapy treatment for&#xD;
      bladder cancer to 1) have more accurately directed treatment, 2) have higher doses of&#xD;
      radiation delivered to the tumour while keeping doses to the surrounding normal tissues as&#xD;
      low as possible. This may allow eradication of the cancer while minimizing side effects of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two phases: Phase A and Phase B. In Phase A, images were collected and&#xD;
      analyzed and it was confirmed that it was useful to use the cone beam machine for daily Cone&#xD;
      Beam CT Bladder (Phase B)treatment adjustments. In phase B, we hope to be able to use cone&#xD;
      beam CT scans to more accurately direct the radiotherapy treatments on a daily basis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cone beam computed tomography (CT) is new technology that allows the acquisition of&#xD;
      3-dimensional cross-sectional imaging while the patient is positioned on a linear accelerator&#xD;
      couch. Cone beam CT also provides 3D soft tissue volumetric data and therefore important&#xD;
      information on daily interfraction movement and deformation of normal critical structures&#xD;
      within the pelvis. Visualization of the tumor using this technology may also be enhanced by&#xD;
      the additional placement of fiducial markers around the tumor bed to ensure even more&#xD;
      accurate targeting. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of daily cone beam CT&#xD;
      for image guidance in patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) for bladder cancer as well&#xD;
      document changes in size and location of the bladder and rectum during an entire course of&#xD;
      RT. This will enable us to explore techniques for radiation therapy based on normal tissue&#xD;
      avoidance models to reduce treatment toxicity and potentially dose escalation in the future.&#xD;
