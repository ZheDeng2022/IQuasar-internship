      Phase I part: to determine the recommended dose, and observe the preliminary response and&#xD;
      safety profile of the combination of oral lapatinib with vinorelbine in patients with ErbB2&#xD;
      positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II part: to determine the progression free survival, response rate, and to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety profile of the combination of oral lapatinib with vinorelbine in patients with ErbB2&#xD;
      positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II clinical trial. In phase I part, the primary objective is To determine&#xD;
      the recommended dose of the combination of lapatinib with oral vinorelbine in patients with&#xD;
      ErbB2 positive metastatic breast cancer. In phase II part, the primary objective is&#xD;
      progression free survival of the combination of lapatinib with oral vinorelbine as first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with ErbB2 positive metastatic breast cancer. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are safety profile and the response rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lapatinib, an oral inhibitor of EGFR and HER2, have been shown to be an effective treatment&#xD;
      in HER2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer patient who refractory herceptin, taxane,&#xD;
      and anthracycline treatment. In pre-clinical studies, the highest synergism between anti-Her2&#xD;
      treatment (trastuzumab) and cytotoxics was seen with the platinum compounds and with&#xD;
      vinorelbine. The oral vinorelbine has similar efficacy to that of the injection formulation&#xD;
      and has demonstrated generally favorable tolerability. We are interested in lapatinib plus&#xD;
      oral vinorelbine as 1st line treatment in Her2+ MBC, to which we believe this convenience&#xD;
      treatment offer a good response rate with satisfactory life quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For phase I part, we plan to use the standard phase I 3-patient cohort (''3 + 3'') design. Up&#xD;
      to 18 patients may be enrolled. For phase II part, the expected progression-free survival of&#xD;
      the protocol treatment in first line treatment of ErbB2 positive metastatic breast cancer is&#xD;
      more than 6 months. With type 1 and type 2 errors of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively, this design&#xD;
      calls for 29 patients at the first stage. If 20 or more progression disease is observed after&#xD;
      6 months of treatment, then the study will be terminated. Otherwise, additional 25 patients&#xD;
      will be entered at the second stage. The treatment will be rejected if a total of 37 or more&#xD;
      progression disease are observed out of 54 patients after 6 months of treatment. With the&#xD;
      estimated dropout rate of 10%, 32 patients will be accrued in the first stage and 28 in the&#xD;
      second stage.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  ErbB2 gene amplification by FISH/CISH (&gt; 6 ErbB2 gene copies per nucleus, or a&#xD;
                  FISH ratio (ErbB2 gene copies to chromosome 17 signals) of &gt; than 2.2;&#xD;
&#xD;

             setting. However, patient must be informed and well understand that in current&#xD;
