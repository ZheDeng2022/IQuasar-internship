  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with COPD are often admitted to the hospital with an exacerbation. It is the most&#xD;
      common cause for admissions to medical wards. The patients are often readmitted. This is har&#xD;
      great impact on health economy and is a significant factor to medical beds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of telemedicine consultations between&#xD;
      respiratory nurses at the hospital and COPD patients in their homes after a discharge from&#xD;
      the hospital, which was caused by an exacerbation.&#xD;

      Participants All patients admitted acutely to the medical ward for respiratory diseases at&#xD;
      Odense University Hospital, Svendborg from the 4th of June 2007 until the 15th of Marts 2008&#xD;
      and from the 8th of August 2008 until the 6th of January 2009 were candidates if they had&#xD;
      ECOPD defined as COPD with more dyspnoea, more cough and/or more sputum and a need for&#xD;
      increased medication. The inclusion and exclusion criteria as mentioned in eligibility&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECOPD patients included lived at Funen County, Denmark in the recruiting area of Odense&#xD;
      University Hospital, Svendborg. In order to further characterize the patients at baseline, we&#xD;
      retrieved data from the Funen County Patient Administrative System (FPAS) and the Odense&#xD;
      University Pharmacoepidemiological Database (OPED). In brief, FPAS holds discharge diagnoses&#xD;
      on all in-patient contacts in Funen County since 1973 and out-patient secondary care contacts&#xD;
      since 1989. Diagnoses are coded according to the ICD8 until 1993 and ICD10 from 1994. OPED is&#xD;
      a research database that holds information on reimbursed prescription from Funen County since&#xD;
      1990. All respiratory drugs are covered by the plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions The telemedicine equipment consisted of a computer with web camera, microphone&#xD;
      and measurement equipment with one bottom to contact to the respiratory nurse at the hospital&#xD;
      and one alarm bottom. The nurse and the patient were able to see each other and to talk&#xD;
      together and the nurse was able to measure saturation and perform a spirometry. The results&#xD;
      were transferred to the hospital by a secure internet line. The equipment was especially&#xD;
      designed to the ECOPD patients in cooperation between the OUH, Svendborg Hospital and a&#xD;
      private company, Global IT Systems. Its popular name is &quot;The Patient Suitcase&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 24 hours after the patient was discharged the telemedicine equipment was installed at&#xD;
      the patient's home by a technician, who also collected and cleaned the equipment after use.&#xD;
      The patients were included for four weeks followed by a visit to the outpatient clinic with a&#xD;
      doctor. The patient was planned to have the equipment for approximately one week and had at&#xD;
      least one follow-up phone call within the four weeks period. TVC could be made from 8 AM to 3&#xD;
      PM every day. The patient could call the telemedicine department in the same period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the TVC the nurse made clinical observations (i.e. dyspnoea, general condition,&#xD;
      physical activity, anxiety), measured saturation and lung function and informed the patients&#xD;
      how to prevent exacerbations and how to use the medication. Anxiety was estimated. The&#xD;
      telemedicine consultation was agreed on with the patient and the telemedicine nurse from day&#xD;
      to day. If the TVC patient were readmitted, the patient stopped with telemedicine&#xD;
      consultations and the telemedicine equipment was collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ECOPD patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
      were consecutively divided into two groups due to home municipality. ECOPD patients who lived&#xD;
      in Svendborg or Faaborg-Midtfyn municipality were included in the TVC-group and ECOPD&#xD;
      patients from other municipalities were included in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation Obviously, the study was not blinded. Every day between 8-9 AM all patients&#xD;
      admitted to the medical ward for respiratory diseases were screened by a nurse. Patients who&#xD;
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria's and none of the exclusion criteria's gave informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
