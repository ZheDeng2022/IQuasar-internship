           will enter into the marker study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End point evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary and secondary end points will be assessed by an independent end point committee.&#xD;
           The end point committee will consist of experienced cardiologists. The detailed end&#xD;
           point definitions are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Q wave myocardial infarction. Appearance of a new Q wave in two or more contiguous leads&#xD;
           on ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non Q wave myocardial infarction.Infarction, which is considered present in a patient&#xD;
           having clinical, angiographic electrocardiographic and/or laboratory evidence of&#xD;
           myocardial necrosis with an ECG showing no new Q waves&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure related myocardial infarction. A &gt; threefold increase of CK-MB or&#xD;
           Troponin-T/I.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target lesion revascularization. Coronary bypass operation with grafting or PCI of index&#xD;
           lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target vessel revascularization. Coronary bypass operation with grafting or PCI of index&#xD;
           vessel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stent thrombosis. Stent thromboses are categorized as acute, sub acute, late and very&#xD;
           late and as definite, probable and possible (see appendix).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vessel measurement. Proximal reference diameter: Vessel diameter proximal to&#xD;
           lesion.Distal reference diameter: Vessel diameter distal to lesion.Percentual diameter&#xD;
           stenosis: (Reference diameter - minimal luminal diameter)/reference diameter in percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Angiographic restenosis. &gt; 50% diameter stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recommendations for re-revascularization. Main vessel:Angina pectoris, CCS 1 related to&#xD;
           index lesion and stenosis diameter &gt;40%* Stenosis diameter &gt;70%*. Side branch: AP, CCS&#xD;
           &gt;1 related to index lesion and stenosis diameter &gt;40%*&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The stenosis diameter is evaluated by eyeballing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiographic core lab:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The index and follow-up angiograms will be asses by the QCA-laboratories at Department&#xD;
           of Cardiology, Paul Stradins Clinical Hospital, Riga, Latvia and Department of&#xD;
           Cardiology B, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus N, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of index angiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The angiography obtained during the PCI-procedure will be used as index angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up angiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 8 months conventional diagnostic angiography will be performed and the projections&#xD;
           used at the index angiography will be repeated after 0.1 mg intracoronary&#xD;
           nitroglycerine. The index angiograms will be stored on CD and sent by mail to the&#xD;
           angiographic core laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steering committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The steering committee members will be selected on basis of participation in the study.&#xD;
           All steering committee members will have full access to the database and will&#xD;
           participate in the interpretation of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The progress of the study will be checked on a weekly basis by the steering committee.&#xD;
           They will receive and evaluate data on inclusion rate and the primary end point event&#xD;
           rate. Further, the steering committee will receive and evaluate the weekly safety data&#xD;
           on the rate of stent thrombosis in the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The statistical analyses will be performed by UNI-C, Aarhus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary end point. The composite end point in the two groups at six month follow-up will&#xD;
           be described by Kaplan-Meier event graphs. The event graphs in the two groups will be&#xD;
           compared by a log-rank test. A two-sided test is used. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 is considered&#xD;
           significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary end points and other variables. For continuous variables, differences between&#xD;
           the treatment groups will be evaluated by Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. For discrete&#xD;
           variables, differences will be expressed as counts and in percent and will be analyzed&#xD;
           with the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Secondary end points will be assessed after&#xD;
           6 or 8 months. Two- sided test is used and the p-value considered indicating&#xD;
           significance will be 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For safety reasons, stent thrombosis after one month will be monitored continuously. A&#xD;
           stent thrombosis rate of &gt; 5% in any of the treatment groups will necessitate premature&#xD;
           termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The results will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle, i.e.&#xD;
           patients randomized to a certain group will be followed and assessed irrespectively of&#xD;
           the actual treatment. Protocol violations will be noted and the responsible centres&#xD;
           notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 225 patients will be included in each group, in total 450 patients. This is&#xD;
           based on the following: We expect a MACE rate of 2% in the group of dilatation of side&#xD;
           branch through main vessel stent and of 8% in the group without side branch dilatation&#xD;
           through main vessel stent. With an alfa of 5% and a strength of 80%, 206 patients will&#xD;
           be needed in each group (two-sided chi square test) to demonstrate this difference. By&#xD;
           including 225 patients in each group, a possible dropout before follow-up is counted&#xD;
           for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be randomized after successful stenting of the main vessel. There will&#xD;
           be a block randomization according to country and a stratification according to sex, age&#xD;
           &gt; 70 years, diabetes, +/- measurement of FFR and +/- angiographic follow-up. The&#xD;
           patients will be computer randomized by a 24 hour telephone service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be monitored according to the GCP rules by independent professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results, positive as well as negative, will be published in an international&#xD;
           cardiovascular journal. Publication and author issues will be decided by the steering&#xD;
           committee on basis of general involvement in the study (core lab. function, end point&#xD;
           committee membership etc.) and of number of included patients.&#xD;
