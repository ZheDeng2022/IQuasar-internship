      RATIONALE: Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above&#xD;
      normal body temperature. Ultrasound energy may be able to kill tumor cells by heating up the&#xD;
      tumor cells without affecting the surrounding tissue. Implant radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Giving&#xD;
      ultrasound hyperthermia therapy after implant radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying ultrasound hyperthermia therapy to see how well it&#xD;
      works after implant radiation therapy in treating patients with Stage III/IV cancer of the&#xD;
      cervix or prostate cancer with a rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) after prior local&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Approximately 2 hours&#xD;
      after brachytherapy, patients undergo catheter-based ultrasound hyperthermia therapy over 60&#xD;
      minutes. Treatment with HDR brachytherapy and hyperthermia therapy repeats within 1-3 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients may then undergo 2 additional standard HDR brachytherapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months.&#xD;
