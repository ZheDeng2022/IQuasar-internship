      Study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of OXC XR as adjunctive&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, multiple dose, multicenter study consisting of a Screening Period (up&#xD;
      to 14 days), a Dosing Period (7 days), and a Follow-up Period (7 days). In-clinic visits&#xD;
      occurred at screening, Visit 1 (Day 0), and Visit 2 (Day 7)/Early Discontinuation. All&#xD;
      subjects received open-label SPN 804O as adjunctive therapy during the Dosing Period. At&#xD;
      Visit 1, eligible subjects were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (150, 300, 450, or&#xD;
      600mg/day) based on weight (15-&lt;30, 30-&lt;45, 45-&lt;60, &gt;=60kg). The Dosing Period consisted of&#xD;
      six consecutive days of a daily dose, taken at home, followed by a final day with the dose&#xD;
      taken on-site and including blood draws for PK analysis.&#xD;
