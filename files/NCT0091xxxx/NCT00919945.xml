  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the impact of early post-operative feeding on&#xD;
      splanchnic blood flow, cardiac output and end organ perfusion, and the patients overall&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neonates with critical congenital heart disease (CHD) undergoing surgery often have&#xD;
      postoperative decreases in cardiac output. These hemodynamic changes can result in varying&#xD;
      levels of organ dysfunction, ranging from the subclinical to the more overt. Although this&#xD;
      low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) and accompanying multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is&#xD;
      in large part transient, the rapidity and completeness of resolution can vary greatly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During postoperative care in the intensive care unit, knowledge of this phenomenon must be&#xD;
      balanced against the desire to initiate enteral nutrition. Many studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that timely initiation of enteral feeds in the intensive care can reduce mortality, morbidity&#xD;
      and costs. Practically speaking, the decision to initiate feeds is made based on the&#xD;
      patient's postoperative hemodynamic status, a normal lactate, absence of vasopressor agents&#xD;
      and presence of bowel sounds. Trophic enteral feeding can usually commence 24h&#xD;
      postoperatively, even after complicated neonatal heart surgery,&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vast majority of postoperative neonates suffer no apparent ill effects from this&#xD;
      management strategy. However, recent data have demonstrated an exceedingly high incidence&#xD;
      (3.3-6.8%) of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in CHD patients; a disease for which diminution&#xD;
      in splanchnic blood flow and disruption of the mucosal barrier are felt to play an important&#xD;
      role. These data suggest the combination of diminished cardiovascular reserve, cyanosis and&#xD;
      increased myocardial oxygen demands may promote the development of NEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from Sickkids (Chanthong and Sivarajan, 2008) demonstrates an NEC incidence&#xD;
      of 8% in CHD patients. Patients with NEC also accounted for 25% of all cardiac arrests in&#xD;
      Cardiac CCU.&#xD;

    <description>The initial observation period of the study begins in the postoperative period (time 0) after the patient arrives in the Cardiac Critical Care Unit and calibration of the monitors with initial clinically indicated baseline bloodwork is completed. Eligible patients will be randomized when the clinical decision to feed is made (by the treating team) to one of the two treatment arms. Patients in arm 1 will receive continuous nasogastric formula feeding at time 1 and NPO at time 2 (12 hours later).</description>
