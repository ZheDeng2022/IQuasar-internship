      The purpose of this trial is to study the effect of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on&#xD;
      the elevation of antibody titer to 4 serotypes of HPV in patients with systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematous and compare the antibody response with an equal number of age-matched healthy&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Genital infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infections in Hong Kong. Most cases of HPV infection are asymptomatic. However,&#xD;
      in some individuals, especially those patients who are immunocompromised, HPV infection is&#xD;
      persistent and may result in genital warts, cervical smear abnormalities, cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and rarely cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a disease that predominantly affects women of the&#xD;
      childbearing age. Patients with SLE are at risk of persistent HPV infection. This is because&#xD;
      of the immunosuppressive state induced by various treatments. The prevalence of abnormal Pap&#xD;
      smears and cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in SLE patients is higher than&#xD;
      that in age-matched healthy women. Thus, prevention of HPV infection is important in patients&#xD;
      with SLE to reduce the incidence of CIN lesions and hence invasive cervical cancers in the&#xD;
      long run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quadrivalent HPV vaccine, GARDASIL is effective in reducing the occurrence of high-grade&#xD;
      CIN lesions and anogenital disease elated to HPV-16 and HPV-18 infection. Vaccination of&#xD;
      young women aged 16 to 23 years resulted in seroconversion rates of more than 99% for all the&#xD;
      HPV types (6,11,16,18) and was well tolerated. There has been very little information&#xD;
      regarding the efficacy of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in immunocompromised hosts. The&#xD;
      objectives of the current study are to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the&#xD;
      quadrivalent HPV vaccine in a group of patients with SLE in terms of antibody conversion.&#xD;
      Comparison will be made with an equal number of age-matched healthy women.&#xD;
