  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a healthy, social and economic threat worldwide. In the&#xD;
      past ten years, the incidence and prevalence of ESRD patients have tremendously increased,&#xD;
      ranking at the top in the world. The reasons for such high incidence and prevalence are&#xD;
      multifactor. Early diagnosis and closed monitor of the patients with chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD) may be beneficial, but not confirmed yet.The advising mechanisms for non-doing or&#xD;
      withdraw long-term dialysis. All these studies will be performed in a multicentered project.&#xD;
      Three medical centers in which CKD researches have been conducted for many years will provide&#xD;
      a large cohort and share the data collected from their own hospitals. We expect that the&#xD;
      results will provide an excellent guideline for CKD care, achieve cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      dialysis therapy and better life quality of ESRD patients.&#xD;
