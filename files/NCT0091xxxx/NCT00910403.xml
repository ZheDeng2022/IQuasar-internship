    <textblock>
      The Presbyopia Algorithm subject to this study has been specifically developed to&#xD;
      prospectively generate a treatment file for the Technolas 217z100 laser that will provide&#xD;
      Presbyopia correction among eyes with primary hyperopia or hyperopic astigmatism (distance&#xD;
      correction). The treatment algorithm provides a bilateral, multifocal ablation with a center&#xD;
      near addition, thereby allowing good focus over a range of object distances.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must read, understand, and sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Subjects must be willing to have both eyes treated during the same visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have up to +4 diopters (D) of absolute spherical hyperopia (not&#xD;
             spherical equivalent), with up to +2.5 D of refractive astigmatism (NOT corneal&#xD;
             astigmatism) by manifest subjective refraction in both eyes. The spherical equivalent&#xD;
             must be no more than +5.25 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have presbyopia as determined by an age-related need for optical aid (&gt;&#xD;
             +1.50 D) for reading with their best distance correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are contact lens wearers must have gas permeable (GP) lenses discontinued&#xD;
             for at least 3 weeks and soft lenses discontinued for at least 1 week prior to the&#xD;
             preoperative evaluation in the eye to be treated. Contact lens wearers who wear their&#xD;
             contact lenses for any amount of time between the preoperative baseline examination&#xD;
             and the operative visit must not be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corneal topography should be normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are contact lens wearers must have 2 central keratometry readings and 2&#xD;
             manifest subjective refractions taken preoperatively at least one week apart. The&#xD;
             refraction values must not differ by more than 0.50D as defined by manifest refraction&#xD;
             spherical equivalent (MRSE). The keratometry values must not differ from the previous&#xD;
             values by more than 0.50D in either meridian.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High contrast, manifest, best spectacle-corrected logMAR distance visual acuity (VA)&#xD;
             must be correctable to at least 0.1 (20/25 or 6/7.5) in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned&#xD;
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of&#xD;
             remaining posterior corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eyes for which the baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibits a difference of&#xD;
             greater than 0.75D in sphere power, or a difference of greater than 0.50D in cylinder&#xD;
             power, or a difference in cylinder axis of more than 15 degrees compared to the&#xD;
             baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction. For manifest cylinder of less than 0.75D,&#xD;
             the difference in cylinder axis will not be taken into consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects for whom the preoperative assessment of the ocular topography indicates that&#xD;
             one or both eyes are not suitable candidates for treatment based upon the suggested&#xD;
             computer-simulated treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any subject who is going to be co-managed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is&#xD;
             not approved as a Technolas GmbH Excimer laser Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with anterior segment pathology, including dry eye syndrome and cataracts&#xD;
             which in the Investigator's opinion, would interfere with best spectacle-corrected VA&#xD;
             (BSCVA) or a successful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with evidence of retinal vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any residual, recurrent, or active ocular disease, or corneal&#xD;
             abnormality that in the Investigator's opinion would interfere with BSCVA or a&#xD;
             successful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with signs of keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with unstable central keratometry readings with irregular mires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have undergone previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind,&#xD;
             including any type of excimer laser surgery for either refractive or therapeutic&#xD;
             purposes.&#xD;

             outcomes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects taking systemic medications likely to affect wound healing such as&#xD;
             corticosteroids or antimetabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are known to be pregnant, lactating, or who plan to become pregnant&#xD;
             during the course of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects participating in any other ophthalmic clinical trials during this clinical&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an ocular muscle disorder including a strabismus or nystagmus, or other&#xD;

             in the interface between the flap and underlying stroma for the first eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe blepharospasm in the first eye that may have prevented or impeded the&#xD;
             completion of the keratectomy and/or the laser ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor subject cooperation with instructions for the first eye's surgery and/or poor&#xD;
             subject fixation on the laser fixation target.&#xD;
