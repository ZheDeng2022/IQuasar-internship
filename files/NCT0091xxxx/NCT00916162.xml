    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to study the effects of stopping aromatase inhibitory&#xD;
      (AI) therapy on breast cancer progression. Aromatase inhibitors are a class of drugs used to&#xD;
      treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women. They work by decreasing the level of estrogen,&#xD;
      which is believed to stimulate the growth of tumor tissue. Breast cancer that progresses&#xD;
      despite therapy with an AI is thought to have been resistant to AI therapy. There is&#xD;
      scientific evidence to suggest that resistant breast cancer cells learn to grow at the very&#xD;
      low levels of estrogen present on AI therapy and that increasing estrogen levels even&#xD;
      slightly by stopping AI therapy with inhibit the breast cancer cells. An improvement or&#xD;
      stabilization of breast cancer has been observed after stopping therapy with tamoxifen, a&#xD;
      different anti-estrogen therapy, and has been reported in the literature after stopping AI&#xD;
      therapy. This research study will be the first study to formally test the rate of disease&#xD;
      improvement (response) or stabilization after stopping AI therapy.&#xD;

      -  Participants will have the following tests and procedures done at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and&#xD;
           24 weeks after stopping AI therapy: Physical examination; blood tests; tumor assessment&#xD;
           by physical exam (if possible); chest x-ray or CT scan of chest; CT scans of abdomen and&#xD;
           pelvis; and bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After week 24, these procedures will be repeated every 12 weeks while the participant is&#xD;
           on the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with&#xD;
             radiographically documented progressive or recurrent local-regional or metastatic&#xD;
             disease. Disease must not be considered amenable to curative treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of hormone sensitivity (ER +ve and/or PR +ve) of primary or secondary tumor&#xD;
             tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable or nonmeasurable (but evaluable-defined as nontarget lesions) disease&#xD;
             according to modified RECIST. Patients with bone disease are eligible. These patients&#xD;
             will be evaluable only for the presence of stable or progressive disease and not a PR&#xD;
             or CR. Patients wih bone-only metastatic disease will be considered to have stable&#xD;
             disease if there is no evidence of new lesions and no clear progression of existing&#xD;
             lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal, defined as fulfilling any of the following criteria: If &gt; 50 year, no&#xD;
             menses within past 12 months, OR if &lt; 50 years, no menses within past 12 months AND&#xD;
             FSH within post menopausal range OR bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current AI monotherapy at the time of documented disease progression&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior antiestrogen therapies including tamoxifen, steroidal AIs, nonsteroidal AIs, or&#xD;

             patient is currently on AI monotherapy (or within two weeks of discontinuation) and&#xD;
             has demonstrated a response or stable disease on the current AI&#xD;
