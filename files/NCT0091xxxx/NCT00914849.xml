      -  To reduce the number of donors treated with intravenous (IV) AMD3100 who require a&#xD;
           second collection to obtain the minimum CD34/kg (2 X 106) necessary for allogeneic stem&#xD;
           cell transplantation when compared to our historic group who received 240ug SC AMD3100&#xD;
           from 33% (8 in 24) to 11% (3 in 27).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate with 95% confidence intervals the proportion of human leukocyte antigen&#xD;
           (HLA)-identical sibling donors who experience grade 3-4 infusional toxicity and the&#xD;
           proportion from whom ≥ 2.0 x 10e6 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight are safely mobilized&#xD;
           following one or two intravenous infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the kinetics of stem cell and lymphocyte mobilization using IV AMD3100 and&#xD;
           to determine if peripheral blood stem cell products collected after mobilization with IV&#xD;
           AMD3100 can be used safely for hematopoietic cell transplantation in HLA-matched&#xD;
           recipients as measured by neutrophil engraftment by day +21.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IV AMD3100 on stem cell and&#xD;
           T-cell phenotyping and on immune reconstitution after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD in&#xD;
           patients who receive IV AMD3100 mobilized peripheral blood stem cells.&#xD;
