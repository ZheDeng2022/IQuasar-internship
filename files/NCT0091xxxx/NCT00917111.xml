  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallel group, pilot study&#xD;
      will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a four times a day treatment with nasal, non-inhaled&#xD;
      administration of CO2 (nasal CO2) in patients with SAR. Approximately 50 patients who meet&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into this study at up to 4 sites to ensure that&#xD;
      approximately 30 patients complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups and be provided with either an&#xD;
      active or placebo dispenser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will administer study drug for 10 seconds to each nostril once on Day 0 in the&#xD;
      clinic then four times a day during waking hours (approximately 4 hours apart) for 14 days.&#xD;
      Patients will assess their nasal and non-nasal symptoms in a patient diary. Each patients&#xD;
      participation in the study may last up to 72 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 5 scheduled clinic visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 Enrollment (within 42 days of Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3 Randomization (after the completion of a 3-7 day run-in period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4 Mid-Treatment (Day 7 ± 1 day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5 End of Treatment (within 1-3 days of last study drug administration) Sites will&#xD;
           follow-up with randomized patients via telephone 7 ± 1 days after the last study drug&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
