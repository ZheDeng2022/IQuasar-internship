  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent of the mobilization of endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells induced by low versus high dose atorvastatin after 4 weeks of treatment, in&#xD;
      patients treated with anti-CD 34 antibodies coated stent.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Addition of statins to peripheral blood circulating mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) and to their&#xD;
      CD 34+ subset cultures promotes endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) proliferation, migration&#xD;
      and survival according to a time and concentration-dependent effect. Data suggested that in&#xD;
      patients with stable coronary artery disease atorvastatin 40 mg/day induced a 2 fold increase&#xD;
      in the number of CD34+VEGFR2+ cells after 1 week of treatment and a 3 fold increase after 4&#xD;
      weeks; likewise, the number of EPCs colonies increased 1.5 times after 1 week and 3 times&#xD;
      after 4 weeks. Data also suggested that the short term mobilizing effect of statins on EPCs&#xD;
      may be transient and that medium-high doses long term statin treatment (&gt; 1 month) may lead&#xD;
      to a reduction in EPCs. Rather, a depletion of EPCs may not only be explained by exhausted&#xD;
      mobilization but also by improved incorporation at sites of tissue hypoperfusion with&#xD;
      potentially beneficial effects in therapeutic angiogenesis.In an interventional contest high&#xD;
      concentrations of circulating EPCs may contribute to accelerate the reendothelialization&#xD;
      process after stents implantation in coronary arteries. Considering the use of recent stents&#xD;
      coated with anti-CD34 murine antibodies, the presence of high levels of PBMNCs expressing&#xD;
      CD34 surface antigen may define the safety and efficacy levels of the procedure. Both the&#xD;
      angiographic outcome and the clinical outcome seems to be better in patients with normal&#xD;
      levels of EPCs than in patients with low levels. No data are available about the effects of&#xD;
      different doses of statins on the biology of the PBMNCs and in particular about the timing of&#xD;
      mobilization, duration of mobilization, the CD 34+ cell subset subpopulation mobilized and&#xD;
      their gene expression balance in humans. No data are available about the effect of statins on&#xD;
      clinical evolution in patients treated with PCI after the implantation of the stents coated&#xD;
      by anti-CD34 murine antibodies.no specific data describing the effects of different doses of&#xD;
      statins on the biology of the PBMNCs and in particular about the timing of mobilization, the&#xD;
      duration of mobilization, the CD 34+ cell subset subpopulation mobilized and their gene&#xD;
      expression balance in humans. No study has evaluated the effect of statins on clinical&#xD;
      evolution in patients treated with PCI after the implantation of the new stents, coated by&#xD;
      anti-CD34 murine antibodies. These data can contribute to better define the process of&#xD;
      mobilization of endothelial progenitors induced by statins and to set up the best&#xD;
      pharmacological strategy anti-CD34 coated stents deployment.&#xD;
