  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of using a web-based (P-PROMPT) chronic&#xD;
      disease management system (CDMS) by primary care practitioners and their team members and on&#xD;
      their care for patients with diabetes. The system will help to ensure that all patients have&#xD;
      up-to-date laboratory monitoring and visits as recommended by the Canadian Diabetes&#xD;
      Association Guidelines. The hypothesis is that the use of a CDMS in Ontario primary care&#xD;
      practices, as a part of the routine clinical management of diabetes patients, can improve&#xD;
      monitoring frequency of A1C, blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol levels. The results of this&#xD;
      study will serve as a benchmark for the utilization of chronic disease management software&#xD;
      tools in primary care diabetes management for patients in Ontario, establishing and providing&#xD;
      evidence to inform decision-makers. If the results are favorable towards CDMS interventions&#xD;
      for the management of diabetes, potential expansion and availability of these types of&#xD;
      programs may be possible for other chronic diseases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Practice Guidelines recommend that patients with chronic diseases should be monitored with&#xD;
      specified clinical measurements each with regular repeats at different specified time&#xD;
      intervals or on specified conditions. It is virtually impossible for health care providers to&#xD;
      adhere consistently to guidelines and to do so sustainability as well as equitably for &quot;most&#xD;
      if not all&quot; of their patients with diabetes. Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee&#xD;
      (OHTAC) has requested the following study. Aggregate monthly primary care practice level data&#xD;
      will form the basis of the analysis. Primary care practitioners in Ontario will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Differences in 1-year outcome measures within will be performed. Baseline, 2 month, 6 month&#xD;
      and 12 month site team member surveys will be completed. Using patient level data from each&#xD;
      site, a cost-utility analysis will be conducted. Six aspects related to the use of the CDMS&#xD;
      will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in proportion of the patients in whom monitoring frequency is up to date for A1C,&#xD;
           blood pressure and cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in proportion of patients who are well controlled with A1C &lt; 0.07, blood pressure&#xD;
           &lt; 130/80 and LDL-cholesterol &lt; 2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change from baseline across sites in the percentage of patients with an up-to-date foot&#xD;
           exam, retinopathy screening, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or&#xD;
           angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and documentation of self-management goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Site questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Changes in physician MOHLTC diabetes incentive billings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Long-term cost-utility of the use of the CDMS.&#xD;

        The unit of evaluation or cluster for this study will be individual primary care&#xD;
        practitioners. The study will analyze aggregate practice level data from all rostered&#xD;
        diabetes patients within each practice. Between 33 and 61 primary care practitioners with a&#xD;
        total number of patients with diabetes across all practices of 2,376 from across Ontario&#xD;
        will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
