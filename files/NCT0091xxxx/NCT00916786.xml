      The ultimate goal of this study is to find the association between specific polymorphism of&#xD;
      candidate genes and medication response in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)&#xD;
      patients. These results will lead the investigators' team: (1) to resolve controversies over&#xD;
      inconsistent findings in previous pharmacogenetic studies; (2) to study the medication effect&#xD;
      on the neuropsychological functions that are useful candidate endophenotypes for ADHD; (3) to&#xD;
      delineate the nature and the effect of gene-gene interaction in the drug response of ADHD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Background: The science of pharmacogenetics seeks to identify patterns of genetic variation&#xD;
      that will direct individually tailored treatment regimens and enhance long-term adherence.&#xD;
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by inattention, hyperactivity&#xD;
      and impulsivity, is an early onset, highly heritable, clinically heterogeneous, long-term&#xD;
      impairing disorder with tremendous impact on individuals, families, and societies. It affects&#xD;
      5-10% of school-aged children worldwide (7.5% in Taiwan) and 2-4% of adults. Although the&#xD;
      efficacy of medications for ADHD is well demonstrated in clinical trials, substantial numbers&#xD;
      of patients fail to remain on therapy, and there is tremendous variability in tolerability&#xD;
      and treatment acceptance. An understanding of genetic predictors of ADHD medication response&#xD;
      is likely to influence future clinical treatments, inform research on treatment-resistant&#xD;
      ADHD patients, and identify patients at increased risk for significant treatment related&#xD;
      adverse events. Although interest in ADHD pharmacogenetics is encouraging, conflicting&#xD;
      results in previous studies may reflect genetic heterogeneity and differences in phenotype,&#xD;
      and medication response in ADHD children likely results from the combined effects of several&#xD;
      potential genes. In addition, the categorical measure of treatment effects and retrospective&#xD;
      study design may not have been sensitive enough to pick up statistically significant&#xD;
      differences in treatment response based on genotype. Further prospective studies including&#xD;
      quantitative measures of medication response are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the specific genetic moderators of methylphenidate and atomoxetine response&#xD;
           using repeated outcome measurements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to examine the association between genetic polymorphisms and medication effects on the&#xD;
           neuropsychological functions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to identify the gene-gene interactions in pharmacogenetics for ADHD. Subjects and&#xD;
           Methods: We will recruit 160 drug-na誰ve ADHD patients and 80 matched normal controls,&#xD;
           aged 7-18. The patients will be randomly assigned to two treatment groups, the&#xD;
           OROS-methylphenidate group (n=80) and the atomoxetine group (n=80), respectively. After&#xD;
           complete assessment at baseline and administration of either OROs-methylphenidate or&#xD;
           atomoxetine, patients with ADHD will be reassessed at Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24&#xD;
           mainly for vital signs, behavioral symptoms, and psychosocial functions evaluations&#xD;
           using the SNAP-IV, YSR, CBCL, CGI-ADHD-S, CGI-ADHD-I, SAICA, and Family APGAR-C.&#xD;
           Neuropsychological tests, including CPT, Time Perception Tasks, and CANTAB, will be&#xD;
           performed at Week 4 and 16. The DNA will be collected, and the candidate genes (DAT1,&#xD;
           DRD4, DRD5, SLC6A2, and SLC6A4) hypothesized to influence medication effects or&#xD;
           individual risks for ADHD will be genotyped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results: We anticipate that this study will delineate the pharmacogenetics for&#xD;
      ADHD by determining the association between medication response and genetic variants in a&#xD;
      Taiwanese sample. The findings of different approaches to identify the effects of genotypes&#xD;
      on the drug response in this study should help us to extend our understanding of the genetic&#xD;
      basis of ADHD. Development of individualized medication regimens based on patient genetic&#xD;
      variability might lead to optimized symptom reduction, improved tolerability, and concomitant&#xD;
      improvements in patient adherence. Conversely, patients with increased genetic risk for&#xD;
      treatment failure or significant adverse effects could be spared exposure to certain&#xD;
      compounds that are of unlikely benefit. Pharmacogenetics also has a potential role in the&#xD;
      development of new compounds for ADHD therapy. The use of genetic screening in dosing will&#xD;
      provide a model for future drug development, in which outcome variability is assessed in&#xD;
      genetic subgroups and not merely on the basis of treatment assignment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are eligible to be included in this study only if they meet all of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients will be outpatients who are between 7 and 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have ADHD that meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
             disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) disease diagnostic criteria assessed by the&#xD;
             investigator's clinical evaluation, as well as confirmed by the Chinese version of the&#xD;
             Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age&#xD;
             Children-Epidemiological Version (K-SADS-E).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a Clinical Global Impressions-ADHD-Severity (CGI-ADHD-S) score &gt; 4&#xD;
             at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be psychotropic medication-na誰ve. Patients will be considered to be&#xD;
             medication-na誰ve if they have never received medications specifically to treat ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have laboratory results, including serum chemistries, hematology, and&#xD;
             urine analysis showing no significant abnormalities and no clinical information that&#xD;
             should preclude a patient's participation at study entry. A patient with a significant&#xD;
             abnormal laboratory result mat enter the study if, after appropriate medical&#xD;
             evaluation, the result dose not indicate a serious medical condition that in the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment would preclude participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients and parents (or legal representative) must have a degree of understanding&#xD;
             sufficient to be able to communicate suitably with the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be of normal intelligence in the judgment of the investigator. Normal&#xD;
             intelligence is defined as achieving a score of 80 or more when IQ testing is&#xD;
             administrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have been judged by the investigator to be reliable to keep appointments&#xD;
             for clinic visits and all tests, including neuropsychological testing and&#xD;
             venipunctures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with current or past history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective Disorder,&#xD;
             organic psychosis, bipolar I or II disorder, autism, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive&#xD;
             developmental disorder. Other comorbid psychiatric disorders are not excluded if the&#xD;
             ADHD symptoms are the primary source of impairment for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a history of any seizure disorder (other than febrile convulsion) or&#xD;
             patients who are taking anticonvulsants for seizure control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients have been at serious suicidal risk, determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a history of severe allergies to more than one class of medications or&#xD;
             multiple adverse drug reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 3 months, or who are&#xD;
             currently using alcohol, drugs of abuse, or any described or over-the-counter&#xD;
             medication in a manner that the investigator considers indicative of abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with cardiovascular disease or other conditions that could be aggravated by&#xD;
             an increased heart rate or increased blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are likely to need psychotropic medications apart from methylphenidate or&#xD;
             atomoxetine, including Chinese medicine or health-food supplements that have central&#xD;
             nervous system activity.&#xD;
