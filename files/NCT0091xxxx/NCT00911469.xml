  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common diseases affecting the joints, usually those&#xD;
      that are weight bearing such as the knees. OA is considered to be a disease of the cartilage&#xD;
      in the joints even though it involves the whole joint, including the bone and synovium (thin&#xD;
      lining of the joints which produces synovial fluid). With time, more and more of the&#xD;
      cartilage is destroyed by the disease with inflammation commonly occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AS902330 is expected to increase the production and development of specific bone cells:&#xD;
      chondrocytes and osteoblasts (cells that produce and maintain bone and cartilage). This is&#xD;
      expected to lead to repair and regeneration of the cartilage, and a narrowing of the space&#xD;
      width between the knee joints in a selected region of the knee.The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to see how safe treatment with AS902330 is, and to evaluate its effect on the knee cartilage.&#xD;
      In addition, the study will also measure the effects of AS902330 in the blood.&#xD;

             study, due to the absence of data on teratogenic potential of the drug, a very&#xD;
             conservative approach on contraception is taken based on the spermatogenesis duration&#xD;
             in humans.&#xD;

          6. Willingness to stay in hospital for 24h after injection for SAD regimens and after&#xD;
             first injection for MAD regimens (and up to 4 hours after second and third injections&#xD;
             for MAD regimens) for safety and PK evaluation&#xD;

             study objectives, conduct or evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinically significant abnormal hematology or biochemistry values (platelets,&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Intra-articular treatment with steroids or hyaluronic acid derivatives within the past&#xD;
             3 months (systemic symptomatic treatments with NSAIDs are allowed when stable for 4&#xD;

             Neuropathic arthropathy whatever the cause Patients with risk factors for knee OA&#xD;
             (e.g. obesity, meniscectomy) are not considered as having secondary OA and can be&#xD;
