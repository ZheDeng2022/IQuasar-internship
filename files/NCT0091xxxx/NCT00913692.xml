      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cold sore is usually a blistering rash on or near the lips, caused by infection with&#xD;
           herpes simplex virus. After the first infection, the virus goes into a dormant&#xD;
           (inactive) state, but it can continue to cause cold sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most people with the herpes simplex virus have a few episodes of cold sores per year.&#xD;
           However, some individuals may have many recurrent episodes that are uncomfortable and&#xD;
           may cause embarrassment. Researchers are attempting to find treatments that can decrease&#xD;
           the number of cold sore episodes for people who have six or more episodes per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glutamine is a molecule called an amino acid and is one of the components that make up&#xD;
           proteins in the body. Clinical studies using glutamine have addressed the potential of&#xD;
           glutamine to improve immune function and to heal damaged tissue or to help healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To find out if the dietary supplement glutamine can help individuals with frequently&#xD;
      recurring (more than six episodes per year) cold sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients between 18 and 65 years of age who have a history of having six or more cold&#xD;
           sore episodes per year, and have not received certain kinds of drug treatment for the&#xD;
           cold sores within 1 month of beginning the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have two or more episodes of cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus&#xD;
           will be eligible for treatment as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial clinical visit for a physical examination and medical history, at which blood&#xD;
           samples will be drawn for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will undergo a 4-month screening period. Patients who develop&#xD;
           sores during this period will visit the NIH to have the sore examined to determine if it&#xD;
           is caused by the herpes virus. Patients who have two or more episodes of cold sores&#xD;
           caused by the herpes simplex virus will be eligible for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are eligible for treatment will provide an initial blood sample and will&#xD;
           receive randomized doses of either glutamine or glycine (another amino acid), which must&#xD;
           be taken on a regular schedule twice daily, mixed with either liquid or soft food.&#xD;
           Patients who develop sores during this period will visit the NIH to have the sore&#xD;
           examined to determine if it is caused by the herpes virus. Blood, urine, and saliva&#xD;
           specimens will be collected each month during the treatment period. A 2-week washout&#xD;
           period will occur between the 2 treatment periods when no doses of glutamine or glycine&#xD;
           will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will then undergo a second 5-month treatment period with either glutamine or&#xD;
           glycine (whichever was not given in the first part of the study), taken in the same&#xD;
           manner as before. Patients who develop sores during this period will visit the NIH to&#xD;
           have the sore examined to determine if it is caused by the herpes virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the second treatment, patients will remain in touch with researchers for 1 month&#xD;
           to note any changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frequently recurrent herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection of the lips or perioral&#xD;
      area, known as herpes labialis, or commonly as cold sores, can cause discomfort, pain, and&#xD;
      embarrassment. Traditional antiviral therapies are moderately effective in suppressing these&#xD;
      recurrences. Studies have shown that the amino acid glutamine can affect HSV-1 reactivation&#xD;
      in vitro. Glutamine has been studied in various clinical situations and has been found to&#xD;
      decrease morbidity in critically ill patients (reducing nosocomial infections), in patients&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy or undergoing bone marrow transplantation (reducing severity of&#xD;
      stomatitis, reducing incidence of infection, shortening hospital stay), and in patients with&#xD;
      short gut syndrome (decreasing requirement for parenteral nutrition). No significant adverse&#xD;
      consequences of glutamine therapy have been reported in these patients. We will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, control-comparison crossover trial comparing the efficacy of&#xD;
      glutamine versus glycine (control) to suppress recurrences of herpes labialis in patients&#xD;
      with frequent episodes (greater than or equal to 6 per year). Based on our in vitro and in&#xD;
      vivo data, we hypothesize that oral glutamine will decrease the number of recurrences of&#xD;
      herpes labialis during a 5-month treatment period in participants with frequently recurring&#xD;
      herpes labialis compared with control.&#xD;

                  participants must experience at least 2 clinically confirmed episodes of herpes&#xD;
                  labialis, 1 of which must be virologically confirmed, during the 4 month&#xD;
                  screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Oral or intravenous antiviral therapy &lt; 4 weeks before enrollment or during the study&#xD;
             with the following agents is not permitted: acyclovir (intravenous), ganciclovir&#xD;
             (intravenous or oral), valganiciclovir (oral), cidofovir (intravenous), or foscarnet&#xD;
             (intravenous).&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir or with&#xD;
                  topical antivirals 4 weeks prior to enrollment or during the study is not&#xD;
                  permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Use of oral acyclovir or valacyclovir or famciclovir or topical antiviral&#xD;
                  ointments or creams for the treatment of herpes labialis outbreaks during the&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Evidence of active herpes labialis reactivation at the time of enrollment. The&#xD;
             volunteer can be enrolled after resolution of herpes labialis and if inclusion and&#xD;
             exclusion criteria are still met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with conditions associated with immunodeficiency (e.g., human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus infection) or conditions requiring either daily systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids exceeding a dose equivalent to10 mg/day of prednisone or other&#xD;
             significant immunosuppressant therapy (e.g., organ or stem cell transplantation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Persons with significant liver or kidney disease [serum glutamic oxaloacetic&#xD;
             transaminase [SGOT], serum glutamine pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], or alkaline&#xD;

             the person should be seizure free for 5 years and not on any anti-seizure medication&#xD;
             in order to be enrolled into the study. (Since glutamine is metabolized to glutamate&#xD;
             and ammonia, and glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central&#xD;
             nervous system (CNS), there is a theoretical increased risk of seizures).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women who are known to be pregnant (pregnancy category C) or breastfeeding (it is not&#xD;
             known whether glutamine is excreted in human milk).&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Subjects cannot take supplemental amino acids (e.g., glutamine, glycine, arginine,&#xD;
             other amino acids) or high protein supplements, such as Boost within 30 days of&#xD;
             enrollment into the study or during the study (except for study drug amino acid).&#xD;
             Subjects can take vitamins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Persons treated with atypical neuroleptics such as clozapine (Clozaril, FazoCIo) or&#xD;
             olanzapine (Zyprexa, Zydis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in any study involving investigational drugs within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             entry into this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any condition (e.g., schizophrenia, psychosis, major depression, mental deficiency or&#xD;
             illness) or major co-morbidity that the study investigator thinks might compromise the&#xD;
             person's ability to comply with the requirements of the study.&#xD;
