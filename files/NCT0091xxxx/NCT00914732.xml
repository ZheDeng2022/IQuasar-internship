  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to recent concern of biowarfare and bioterrorism, the US government is making efforts to&#xD;
      improve its ability to protect citizens against the smallpox virus. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      safety of IMVAMUNE®, an investigational smallpox vaccine, and its ability to stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system (the body's defense system). Two vaccine preparations have the same name but&#xD;
      one is a liquid and one is a powder that has liquid added just before it is given. The&#xD;
      vaccine that comes as a liquid will be injected (given as a shot) just under the skin&#xD;
      (subcutaneously) or injected between the layers of the skin (intradermally). The powder&#xD;
      formulation is only injected just under the skin. Approximately 495 adults, age 18 older born&#xD;
      after 1971, which have not had smallpox vaccine before, may participate in the study for&#xD;
      about 7 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smallpox was declared officially eradicated by the World Health Assembly in 1980. Despite the&#xD;
      fact that the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared smallpox to be eradicated,&#xD;
      a new threat exists due to the potential use of variola virus as an agent for biological&#xD;
      warfare and/or bio-terrorism. Following the events of September 11, 2001 the Division of&#xD;
      Microbiology and Infectious Diseases/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&#xD;
      contracted for the advanced development of IMVAMUNE®. Initially, a lyophilized formulation&#xD;
      was manufactured, which was reconstituted 'at the bedside' prior to administration in&#xD;
      clinical and non-clinical settings. Due in part to the potential requirement for mass&#xD;
      vaccinations coupled with the increased manufacturing time and other constrains associated&#xD;
      with lyophilization, it was decided to transition to a liquid product formulation. Therefore,&#xD;
      after 2005, clinical and non-clinical efforts have focused largely on the liquid formulation,&#xD;
      though non-clinical studies with the lyophilized formulation continued. Presently, due to the&#xD;
      potential need to be able to stockpile Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) for an extended period&#xD;
      of time, there is renewed interest in the lyophilized formulation. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to compare the safety and immunogenicity of lyophilized IMVAMUNE® [1x10^8 tissue culture&#xD;
      infectious dose 50 (TCID50)] versus liquid formulation IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50) administered&#xD;
      by the subcutaneous (SC) route and a lower dose liquid formulation IMVAMUNE® (2x10^7 TCID50)&#xD;
      administered by the intradermal (ID) route in healthy vaccinia-naïve individuals. This study&#xD;
      is designed as a randomized, non-placebo controlled, partially-blinded study (liquid versus&#xD;
      lyophilized formulation by the SC route Group B versus A). The study staff is unblinded to&#xD;
      Group C. The study will contain 3 arms: Group A [Number (N)=165] will receive a 2 dose&#xD;
      regimen of IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL per dose) lyophilized formulation by the SC route&#xD;
      on Day 0 and 28. Group B (N=165) will receive a 2 dose regimen of IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8&#xD;
      TCID50/0.5 mL per dose) liquid formulation by the SC route on Day 0 and 28. Group C (N=165)&#xD;
      will receive a 2 dose regimen of IMVAMUNE® (2x10^7 TCID50/0.1 mL per dose) liquid formulation&#xD;
      by the ID route on Day 0 and 28. Safety will be measured by assessment of solicited local and&#xD;
      systemic reactions within 15 days after each vaccination (Day 0-14), unsolicited adverse&#xD;
      events for 28 days following the second vaccination (56 days following the initial&#xD;
      vaccination for those subjects that fail to receive the second vaccination), and serious&#xD;
      adverse events through six months post the final vaccination. Immunogenicity testing will&#xD;
      include assessment of vaccinia-specific plaque reduction neutralizing antibody titers (PRNT)&#xD;
      and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) mean geometric titers (GMT) based on individual&#xD;
      peak titers. For each subject, the peak PRNT or ELISA will be defined as the largest titer&#xD;
      among all available measurements post second vaccination.&#xD;
