  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been recognized as a common (5-8%),&#xD;
      early-onset, long-term impairing, heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder with high&#xD;
      heritability. Pharmacotherapy (methylphenidate and atomoxetine) has been proved to be the&#xD;
      most effective treatment for ADHD. Gau (PI) has done extensive research on ADHD and published&#xD;
      7 SCI papers in ADHD pharmacotherapy. The PI published the first paper in the effectiveness&#xD;
      of atomoxetine in improving executive functions among 30 boys with ADHD in the world&#xD;
      (International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2009 Oct 23:1-14. [Epub]). Due to its&#xD;
      lifelong impairments up to adulthood, adult ADHD has drawn much more attention in Western&#xD;
      studies in the past decade; however, there is lack of such information in Asian population&#xD;
      except the PI's three SCI papers on adult ADHD. Because little is known about atomoxetine&#xD;
      effect in adults with ADHD except symptoms reduction, this proposal aims to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of atomoxetine beyond symptoms improvement. The significance of this project is its&#xD;
      novelty and research and clinical relevance because there is lack of information regarding&#xD;
      long-term effect of atomoxetine on neuropsychological and brain imaging functions on adults&#xD;
      with ADHD, a high-prevalent mental disorder with long-term impairment in adults.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the efficacy of atomoxetine in improving neuropsychological functioning&#xD;
           (CANTAB, Time Perception Tasks) and structural (DSI) and functional (resting fMRI) brain&#xD;
           connectivity as the primary efficacy endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the efficacy of atomoxetine in reducing ADHD core symptoms and in improving&#xD;
           family/social/academic/occupational adjustment and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a randomized open-label, methylphenidate control trial. The sample&#xD;
      consists of 60 adults, aged 18-50, with clinical diagnosis of DSM-IV. All participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to atomoxetine (n= 30), methylphenidate (n= 15), and clinical visit with&#xD;
      psychological counseling (n=15) in a 8-week randomized clinical trial with 3 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measures included psychiatric interviews (ADHD+SADS), the CGI-ADHD-S, the standardized&#xD;
      self-reported questionnaires (the AAQoL, WFIRS-S, and WFIRS-P for social function; ASRS for&#xD;
      ADHD symptoms), neuropsychological tests (CANTAB including attention tasks, visual memory,&#xD;
      executive functioning, and gambling test; Time Perception Task), and brain imaging (DSI and&#xD;
      resting fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be reassessed with safety, ADHD symptoms and social functioning/quality of life at&#xD;
      baseline, week 2 (± 5 days), week 4 (± 5 days), and week 8 (± 5 days); neuropsychological&#xD;
      tests at baseline, week 4 (± 5 days), and week 8 (± 5 days); and brain imaging studies (DSI&#xD;
      and resting-fMRI) at baseline and week 8 (± 5 days). Additionally, blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline for future pharmacogenomic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that this study will be one of the first to investigate the efficacy of&#xD;
      atomoxetine on neuropsychological functioning, and structural and functional brain&#xD;
      connectivity in the world. If this research can be carried out, it will be the first project&#xD;
      using brain images as assessment tools in a clinical trial among psychiatric patients in&#xD;
      psychiatric field in Taiwan.&#xD;

        We will recruit 60 adults, aged 18 to 50, who are diagnosed with ADHD at the PI Gau's Adult&#xD;
        ADHD clinic at the Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital.&#xD;
