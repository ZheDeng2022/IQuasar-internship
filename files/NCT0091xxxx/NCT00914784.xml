    <textblock>
      Currently Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is the leading cause of&#xD;
      transfusion-related mortality in the United States, and one of major post-transfusion&#xD;
      complications. TRALI is defined as new ALI occurring within 6 hours from the onset of&#xD;
      transfusion. It is manifested by acute dyspnea, hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates in chest&#xD;
      radiograph. TRALI may be caused by any blood product and is not dose-dependent. Associated&#xD;
      risk factors include prolonged storage of blood products and underlying conditions such as&#xD;
      severe IHD hematologic malignancies or active infections. Since TRALI has only recently been&#xD;
      defined as a clinical entity, and its prevalence has been largely underestimated - the&#xD;
      epidemiology of TRALI is not well established. Therefore the objective of this work is to&#xD;
      study the incidence of TRALI in a patient population that receive blood products frequently,&#xD;
      namely orthopedic-oncologic.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transfusion of blood products is occasionally complicated by acute lung injury (ALI),&#xD;
      which can progress to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Such&#xD;
      transfusion-related acute lung injury, abbreviated TRALI, has been defined by both a National&#xD;
      Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) working group, and by a Canadian consensus&#xD;
      conference (CCC), as new ALI occurring during or within six hours after a transfusion [1-2].&#xD;
      This definition is based entirely on clinical and radiological criteria and includes [2-4]:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ALI, as defined by [4]:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. The sudden onset of respiratory distress symptoms (dyspnea). B. Hypoxemia: as defined&#xD;
           by a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
           (PaO2/FiO2) below 300mmHg, or oxygen saturation (SpO2) below 90% on room air, or other&#xD;
           clinical evidence of hypoxemia C. Bilateral infiltrates on frontal chest X-ray, without&#xD;
           cardiomegaly. D. No clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension (congestive heart&#xD;
           disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No preexisting ALI before transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During or within 6 hr after transfusion of any blood product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. No temporal relationship to an alternative risk factor for ALI. All types of blood&#xD;
           products have been associated with TRALI, however, the plasma-rich components, such as&#xD;
           fresh frozen plasma (FFP), whole blood, packed red blood cells (PC) and platelets, have&#xD;
           been most frequently implicated [3, 5-10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged storage of transfused products, use of FFP, and the presence of an underlying&#xD;
      condition such as recent surgery, cytokine treatment, thrombocytopenia, massive blood&#xD;
      transfusion, hematologic malignancies or cardiovascular disease requiring cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass (CABG) surgery, and active infection have been reported as risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of TRALI [11-18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of TRALI involves the presence of anti-leukocyte antibodies and/or&#xD;
      biologically active lipids from cell membrane fragments (and cytokines) in the donor's blood,&#xD;
      triggering an inflammatory response within the recipient's pulmonary microvasculature, which&#xD;
      in turn leads to lung injury [2,13,16,19-27].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of TRALI is not well established [28]. Nevertheless, using the NHLBI/CCC&#xD;
      definition of TRALI, several retrospective studies reported the incidence of TRALI to be one&#xD;
      case for every 1000-2400 units transfused [29-30]. This incidence estimate of 0.04% to 0.1%&#xD;
      (or up to 0.85% among transfused patients) is comparable to other estimates from earlier&#xD;
      studies that used older case definitions [6,12,31]. The only prospective cohort clinical&#xD;
      surveillance study to use current diagnostic guidelines for TRALI reported an 8% incidence of&#xD;
      TRALI in their intensive care unit (ICU) [32]. These data suggest that passive reporting&#xD;
      systems greatly under-estimate the number of TRALI cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though underdiagnosed, TRALI is currently the leading cause of transfusion-related&#xD;
      mortality in the United States [1,7,11]. The estimated mortality rate for recognized TRALI is&#xD;
      5%-8% [20]. However, most survivors recover completely with appropriate supportive care and&#xD;
      can receive additional blood products in the future [11,20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lacking epidemiology, and the increasing significance of TRALI as a major&#xD;
      transfusion-associated complication, we stress the need for additional prospective&#xD;
      surveillance studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, we wish to conduct a prospective observative study in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      incidence of TRALI among patients undergoing elective orthopedic-oncology procedures. This&#xD;
      patients' population receives blood product transfusions frequently, and may thus provide an&#xD;
      adequate cohort for such study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives This work aims to study the prevalence of TRALI-associated morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in patients undergoing elective orthopedic-oncology procedures, and are transfused&#xD;
      with blood products in the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we wish to evaluate whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.The incidence of TRALI is higher in patients operated for malignancies (versus benign&#xD;
      neoplasms) B.The incidence of TRALI is higher in patients treated with&#xD;
      C.chemotherapy/radiation prior to surgery (versus non-treated) The incidence of TRALI is&#xD;
      increasing with older blood products&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design An informed consent will be obtained from all orthopedic-oncology&#xD;
      patients scheduled to have an elective surgery, except for those who require minor procedures&#xD;
      (e.g., biopsies) which normally do not require transfusions. Diuretics and oral hypoglycemics&#xD;
      will be discontinued the day prior to surgery, as dictated by the routines in our patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-operative management Anesthetic and surgical management as well as blood product&#xD;
      transfusion will adhere to standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, the patients will be transferred to the post-anaesthesia care unit and later&#xD;
      to the orthopedic-oncology department, unless otherwise indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the postoperative period, departmental routines will guide blood product transfusions,&#xD;
      pain management and fluid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of patients who received transfusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient that receives blood products will be included in the study, whether it occurred&#xD;
      pre-operatively, intra-operatively or post-operatively as long as they are hospitalized. For&#xD;
      these patients we will document:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.General demographics, including chronic diseases, medications and treatments (e.g.,&#xD;
      chemotherapy/radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.Blood product information, including type, dosage and storage age. C.Intra- and&#xD;
      post-operative data, including operative time, volume of crystalloids (and colloids) given&#xD;
      during surgery and afterwards, urine output, the need for vasopressors, inotropes or&#xD;
      diuretics, re-intubations, transfer to ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each unit of blood product transfused, we will commence patient monitoring for the next 6&#xD;
      hours. If several units are given in a sequel we will monitor the patient since the beginning&#xD;
      of the first transfusion until 6 hours after the last transfusion. Monitoring will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical symptoms of dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PaO2/FiO2, or SpO2 on room air if arterial line is not obtainable - every 2 hours or&#xD;
           when indicated by clinical signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. If PaO2/FiO2&lt; 300mmHg, or SpO2&lt; 90% on room air, or clinical signs of lung injury&#xD;
           occur - chest X-ray will be obtained and diagnosed by two radiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hb (gr/dl) will be assessed according to the physician's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size In the orthopedic-oncology department of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center&#xD;
      approximately 550 patients are operated annually, about 20% of whom receive transfusions.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the study is planned for 5 years. Therefore the anticipated sample size is&#xD;
      approximately 550 patients.&#xD;
