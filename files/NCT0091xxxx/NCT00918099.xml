      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal prolapse is a well-known disease and is observed in approximately 11% of all&#xD;
      postmenopausal women and tending to increase with age. Consequently, many surgical procedures&#xD;
      have been developed in order to ensure sufficient support for the bladder, rectum or vaginal&#xD;
      vault depending on the site of the defect. However, many procedures are associated with a&#xD;
      high recurrence rate up to 40 % even within one to two years after the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high recurrence rate new methods include the use of mesh, either biologically or&#xD;
      synthetic. The latter is a permanent implant and therefore theoretically may result in a&#xD;
      long-lasting anatomically correct position of the prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the recurrence rate may be lower using a mesh such surgical procedures may be&#xD;
      associated with adverse events such as erosions of the vaginal mucosa. Others have observed&#xD;
      shrinkage of the vaginal mucosa. However, in these studies large prolene mesh have been used.&#xD;
      In contrast the recurrence rate is lowered up to 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above-mentioned advantage of synthetic mesh is however, mostly based on few&#xD;
      non-randomised studies. The investigators therefore find it of importance to evaluate whether&#xD;
      a surgical procedure using a mesh implant is superior to conventional surgical techniques.&#xD;
      The present study is a clinical controlled study where patients with anterior vaginal&#xD;
      prolapse are randomised to either a mesh technique or a standard anterior procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study includes only two more visits at the outpatient clinic after the surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Furthermore the patients have to fulfil questionnaires regarding urinary and&#xD;
      faecal leakage and sexual habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any participation in the study is totally voluntary and the patient may at any time withdraw&#xD;
      herself. In any case the patient will receive the investigators' standard treatment.&#xD;

      RESEARCH PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Avaulta for anterior repair. A multicenter randomised prospective controlled&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the resent years the methods for pelvic organ prolapse repair have changed rapidly.&#xD;
      The reason for this is several. Firstly, there is a relative high recurrence rate in patients&#xD;
      having an anterior vaginal repair. Thus, the rate has been estimated to be close to 40% or&#xD;
      even higher and most often the recurrences occurs within the first two years. Weber et al and&#xD;
      Sand et al reported various techniques of the anterior colporrhaphy without the use of mesh&#xD;
      to be successful in the management of cystoceles in only 42 and 57%, respectively. In&#xD;
      contrast others have shown a much lower 1-year recurrence rate. Shull reported on the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of the paravaginal repair but this procedure may also vary in success from 67 -&#xD;
      100%. Taken all together however, interpretation of these studies is difficult since the&#xD;
      patients included have undergone at least one (in most cases several) vaginal surgical&#xD;
      procedures at the same time and some studies even include patients with recurrence together&#xD;
      with patients scheduled for primary vaginal surgery. Secondly, there is a need for simple&#xD;
      procedures, which can be performed in an outpatient clinic and thirdly, the surgery should be&#xD;
      acceptable for the women, i.e. without postoperative pain, short recovery period and no need&#xD;
      for further surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most centers a vaginal surgical repair of an anterior genital prolapse is performed in a&#xD;
      standard manner through a midline incision followed by dissection of the vaginal mucosa from&#xD;
      the pubocervical fascia. Interrupted sutures approximating the fascia at the midline then&#xD;
      repair the cystocele. However, this may not be sufficient in those cases where no fascia is&#xD;
      present or the presence of huge defects in the pubocervical fascia. As a consequence the use&#xD;
      of mesh have been more popular. Several studies report a reduced recurrence rate following&#xD;
      anterior repair using different types of mesh such as biomesh (6,7) or nonabsorbable mesh.&#xD;
      The latter has been shown to be associated with vaginal erosion 8 - 2%%, which probably is&#xD;
      related to the strong inflammatory response observed after implementation of such mesh.&#xD;
      Another complication is shrinkage of the vaginal mucosa and this may be followed by sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction or dyspareunia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polypropylene mesh appears to induce less inflammatory respons compared to other types. A&#xD;
      specific type of mesh is the Avaulta Biosynthetic Mesh, which is a polypropylene mesh coated&#xD;
      with collagen. This layer protects against inflammatory response and is slowly resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since most studies have included patients undergoing several vaginal surgical procedures at&#xD;
      the same time, it is difficult to conclude whether or not the use of mesh is superior&#xD;
      compared to conventional technique. Furthermore, only sparse information is available&#xD;
      regarding sexual function and dyspareunia following vaginal prolapse surgery. Especially&#xD;
      there is a lack of information regarding new mesh types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is therefore to test the hypothesis that the Avaulta&#xD;
      Biosynthetic Mesh is associated with a lower recurrence rate after two years of follow-up&#xD;
      compared to conventional anterior repair. Secondly, the study is planned to evaluate the&#xD;
      frequency of sexual dysfunction following vaginal anterior repair, and if there is any&#xD;
      difference between the two surgical methods.&#xD;
