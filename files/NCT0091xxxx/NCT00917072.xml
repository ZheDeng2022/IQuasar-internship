    <textblock>
      Study the feasibility of different educational modalities to improve resident handoff of&#xD;
      patient information b) Determine whether different educational modalities (powerpoint vs.&#xD;
      simulation workshop) lead to improved educational and (surrogate) clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Educate residents on the content and process of quality handoffs (Medical Knowledge)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Educate residents on good communication skills (Communication competency)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improve perceived continuity of patient care, decrease adverse events related to&#xD;
           transfer of care. (Patient safety competency)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Increase providers (night residents) satisfaction with the continuity of care during&#xD;
           handoffs. (system-based practice/ Practice-based learning)&#xD;

      Randomize interns into three groups. The control group has been described above. Two more&#xD;
      groups will randomized to one of two interventions: Intervention Group #1: will have a&#xD;
      focused, interactive power point lecture on the background, content and guidelines for a good&#xD;
      handoff (focus on a standardized electronic hand-off tool). They will have an exercise to&#xD;
      complete. Intervention Group #2: will undergo the same power point lecture ( as in Group #1)&#xD;
      with an additional intervention focused not only on the hand-off tool, but on a standardized&#xD;
      hand-off process using an OSCE exercise (objective structured clinical exam). This group will&#xD;
      be trained about the effective implementation of the hand-off tool. They will be taught how&#xD;
      to standardize the hand-off process and will be given an opportunity to practice with their&#xD;
      peers in the HFH simulation center. Up to 12 residents will be taken in pairs to practice&#xD;
      written and verbal handoff skills in the simulation center under peer observation and by&#xD;
      faculty (investigators, PI). Each intern will be given a simulated patient history and&#xD;
      physical and any relevant information related to the patient's hospital course. The intern&#xD;
      will be given five minutes to create a handoff. Each pair will go into a separate room that&#xD;
      will be recorded and viewed by their peers and instructor. They will be observed giving a&#xD;
      handoff and receiving a handoff. When they exit the room, they will provide feedback to one&#xD;
      another regarding the quality of the handoff. Then the peers will give additional feedback.&#xD;
      Each intern will go through the process of giving a handoff and the one accepting the&#xD;
      handoff. After the simulation, they will complete a short survey on the intervention. At the&#xD;
      completion of the educational interventions, throughout the year as part of regular intern&#xD;
      evaluations, night residents will be asked on a weekly basis to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      intern handoffs. In addition, de-identified written handoffs will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      investigators and scored for completeness and accuracy. The resident cross covering will be&#xD;
      blinded to the intern group. They will evaluate the handoff process. During this process,&#xD;
      content omission can be measured, as well as time taken to cross cover a patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All interns participating in the study will do a self-assessment of their handoff skills.&#xD;
      Interns will then be randomized into one of three groups as described above and undergo the&#xD;
      educational intervention (#1 or #2) or standard education (control). Educational&#xD;
      interventions will be completed within 10 days of the start of the study (Specific Aims&#xD;
      #1,2). Following the interventions interns will be assessed throughout the year using a&#xD;
      standardized grading form that evaluates written and verbal handoff skills, and perceived&#xD;
      effectiveness of handofffs and it pertains to patient care for interns on inpatient rotations&#xD;
      that month (Specific Aim #3,4). This will be completed on a weekly basis by night residents&#xD;
      (second and third year residents not involved in the study, and blinded to the intervention&#xD;
      groups). Educational endpoints: perceived improvement in handoff skills by interns involved&#xD;
      in the study over a 6 month period of time as compared among the intervention groups.&#xD;
      (Surrogate) Clinical Endpoints: 1) Objective handoff skills evaluation of interns by more&#xD;
      senior residents using a standardized grading form 2) Review of electronic handoff forms by&#xD;
      investigators, forms by individual interns will be blinded to the investigators to reduce&#xD;
      bias&#xD;
