      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic research has implications for drug development and marketing. Race-based&#xD;
           medicine may be able to provide specific treatment for populations with increased&#xD;
           disease-specific morbidity and mortality. However, contemporary genetic research refutes&#xD;
           the idea that races are genetically distinct populations, even as drugs designed for use&#xD;
           in specific races are being promoted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies have shown high levels of public suspicion for race-based and personalized&#xD;
           genetic medicine. Concerns related to not only the potential performance of race-based&#xD;
           drugs, but also the motives of those offering these drugs. Many participants have&#xD;
           suggested conspiracy theories in which race-based medicine was disguising an attempt to&#xD;
           provide inferior medications or deliberately harm certain populations. Concerns about&#xD;
           personalized medicine often have to do with privacy and other personal concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Public suspicions of race-based medicine, and to a lesser extent, personalized genetic&#xD;
           medicine, make it important to examine and understand the theoretical and empirical&#xD;
           literature on trust and health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To describe the perspective of participants evaluating the medicine offer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Males and females ages 18 and older who are visiting the John Hopkins clinics (primarily&#xD;
           the adult care clinics).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be able to take a literacy screen and respond to a short survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to take a researcher-administrated literacy screen, read one&#xD;
           of three randomly assigned vignettes, and fill out a survey. The first page of the&#xD;
           survey will provide information about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will respond to initial questions about demographics, experiences with&#xD;
           discrimination, and trust in the medical profession and institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant will receive a random vignette in which he/she will imagine him/herself&#xD;
           being diagnosed with a common, chronic condition and offered a conventional drug, a&#xD;
           race-based drug, or a genetically personalized drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After being presented with the vignette, participants will be asked to respond to a&#xD;
           survey that asks about their levels of trust in the vignette doctor, perceived respect&#xD;
           given to the patient by the vignette physician, emotional response to the vignette,&#xD;
           their belief in the effectiveness and safety of the drug prescribed in the vignette,&#xD;
           information sufficiency, and their hypothetical behavioral intention to take the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be debriefed after completing the survey, and will be offered a small&#xD;
           amount of compensation for participating.&#xD;

      This study proposes to describe participants' attitudinal, emotional, cognitive, and&#xD;
      hypothetical behavioral responses to randomized hypothetical vignettes illustrating the&#xD;
      prescription of conventional, race-based, and genetically personalized medicine for a common&#xD;
      chronic condition. This study is theoretically guided by conceptualizations of&#xD;
      relationship-centered care and the risk information seeking and processing model. These&#xD;
      theories recognize the importance of interpersonal influence within health care interactions,&#xD;
      underscore the moral dimensions of patient-physician relationships, and describe the&#xD;
      predictors of how information is attended to and processed. An experimental, mixed methods&#xD;
      design will be used to randomly assign 357 patients at the Johns Hopkins clinics to one of&#xD;
      three vignettes illustrating conventional, race-based, and genetically personalized&#xD;
      medication offers. This study aims to examine the effects of the type of medication offer&#xD;
      (conventional, race-based, and genetically personalized) and certain participant&#xD;
      characteristics (race, literacy, background healthcare trust/experience with discrimination)&#xD;
      on attitudinal, emotional, cognitive, and hypothetical behavioral responses; to determine if&#xD;
      the relationships among the type of medication offer and the four categories of outcomes are&#xD;
      moderated by race and mediated by trust; and to describe the participants' perspective on the&#xD;
      vignette, through targeted open-ended questions.&#xD;
