      The purpose of this Phase I, open-label, single sequence drug-drug interaction trial in human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus-type 1 infected patients is to investigate the potential interaction&#xD;
      between steady-state nevirapine (NVP) 200 mg b.i.d. (twice a day) and a single dose of 400 mg&#xD;
      TMC207 and to explore the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream,&#xD;
      distributed in the body and eliminated from the body).&#xD;

      TMC207 is being investigated for the treatment of M. tuberculosis (TB) infection. This is a&#xD;
      Phase I, open-label (both participant and investigator know the name of the assigned&#xD;
      medication), single-sequence (all participants receive treatments in the same order)&#xD;
      drug-drug interaction trial in human immunodeficiency virus - type 1 (HIV-1) infected&#xD;
      patients to investigate the potential interaction between steady-state nevirapine (NVP) 200&#xD;
      mg b.i.d. (twice a day) and a single dose of 400 mg TMC207. The study medication will be&#xD;
      taken orally. The trial population will consist of 16 patients infected with HIV-1 virus who&#xD;
      have not yet been treated for this infection (antiretroviral or ARV naïve) with a medical&#xD;
      indication to start ARV therapy and electing to start treatment with NVP plus two&#xD;
      nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N(t)RTIs). The primary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of steady-state NVP 200 mg b.i.d. on the pharmacokinetics of TMC207 and&#xD;
      its M2 metabolite after single-dose administration of TMC207 400 mg, in HIV-1 infected&#xD;
      patients. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of single-dose TMC207 400 mg on&#xD;
      the steady-state plasma concentrations of NVP 200 mg b.i.d. and to evaluate the short-term&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of coadministration of single-dose TMC207 and steady-state NVP in&#xD;
      HIV-1 infected patients. Prior to starting the NVP-containing regimen, patients will receive&#xD;
      a single dose of TMC207 400 mg (Treatment A). At least 2 but no more than 4 weeks later, NVP&#xD;
      will be started (in combination with 2 N(t)RTIs) at the recommended dosing regimen (200 mg&#xD;
      once daily for 2 weeks followed by 200 mg twice daily). After 4 weeks of NVP at a dose of 200&#xD;
      mg b.i.d., a second single dose of TMC207 400 mg will be administered (Treatment&#xD;
      B).Pharmacokinetic profiles over 336 hours will be determined for TMC207 and its&#xD;
      N-monodesmethyl metabolite (M2) after administration of TMC207 400 mg alone, and in&#xD;
      combination with steady-state NVP. Morning predose concentrations of NVP will be determined&#xD;
      at several time points.Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the trial.&#xD;
      Adverse events will be recorded at every visit. A blood and urine sample will be taken at&#xD;
      screening, day -1, 1, 2 and 15 of treatment A and B and at both follow-up visits. An&#xD;
      electrocardiogram will be recorded at screening, twice on day 1 and once on day 2 and 15 of&#xD;
      treatment A and B and at the last follow-up visit. Vital signs will be measured at screening,&#xD;
      on day 1, 2 and 15 of treatment A and B and at both follow-up visits. A physical examination&#xD;
      will be performed at screening, on day -1 of treatment A and B and at both follow-up visits.&#xD;
      On day 1 of treatment A and B 400 mg TMC207 (4 tablets) will be taken by mouth in the morning&#xD;
      within 10 minutes after completion of the breakfast. At least 2 but no more than 4 weeks&#xD;
      after the first single dose of TMC207, NVP will be started [in combination with 2 N(t)RTIs]&#xD;
      as 200 mg once daily for 2 weeks followed by 200 mg twice daily, orally. After 4 weeks of NVP&#xD;
      at a dose of 200 mg twice daily, a second single dose of TMC207 will be administered.&#xD;
