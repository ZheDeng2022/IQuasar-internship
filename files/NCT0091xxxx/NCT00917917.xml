  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome has been defined as a group of associated risk factors for cardio-vascular&#xD;
      diseases and diabetes. It is usually treated with an association of restrictive diet,&#xD;
      physical exercise and drugs. Nevertheless the type of exercise associated to reduction in&#xD;
      cardio-vascular risks is not yet fully defined. Long term effects of such hygienic-diet&#xD;
      programs are of great importance since it is well-known that compliance to such treatment are&#xD;
      of short duration, namely when subjects return in routine life. Metabolic syndrome volunteer&#xD;
      subjects (n=90), aged 50 to 70 yrs will be randomly assigned to 3 groups of investigation.One&#xD;
      group will perform mostly resistance activity, a second mainly endurance activity and the&#xD;
      third one will be composed of subjects not exercising a lot. All subjects will have the same&#xD;
      restrictive diet (500-700 kcal/d) After the initial training (3 weeks), they will return home&#xD;
      with diet and physical program advises (personal compliance). They will be followed for one&#xD;
      year (at 3, 6 and 12 months) Such a design may allow to find out the type of activity and&#xD;
      power that are the best to reduce metabolic syndrome parameters and cardio-vascular risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable is the reduction in abdominal circumference, which is the main&#xD;
      criteria of MS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol is designed to determine which type of physical activity is the best to reduce&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome parameters especially abdominal circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      90 Metabolic syndrome (MS) Patients will be recruited by advertising and checked for MS&#xD;
      criteria. They will have a VO2max test in order to be sure they can perform physical&#xD;
      activities safely. After being checked, patients will have an eight day period to think about&#xD;
      participation and to ask questions before signing consent. They have to feel 3&#xD;
      questionnaires, one about regular physical activities, one about food intakes and a&#xD;
      psychology one to measure reluctance to the program. After written informed consent obtained,&#xD;
      patients will be randomly assigned to one of 3 groups of physical activity Group 1 will&#xD;
      perform mostly resistance activities, group 2 mostly endurance activities, and group 3&#xD;
      performing both activities at low level, serves as a control group for physical activities&#xD;
      and also to determine the importance of food reduction and food equilibrium in the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have the same restrictive diet (500- 700 kcal/d). They will be followed for&#xD;
      one year (at 3, 6 and 12 month), continuing at home the same program (diet and exercise&#xD;
      training).&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 healthy subjects will be recruited for cross-sectional comparison (They will not follow&#xD;
      any intervention, but will have the same investigation, only once).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured parameters Before and after the 3-week program and at 3, 6 and 12 months, the&#xD;
      following measurements will be made Level of physical activities quantifying heart rate in&#xD;
      each activity during the training 3 weeks and estimated thereafter on the same parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical capacities With the 6 minute walking test, Food intake and equilibrium measured by&#xD;
      full week records before training, during training and monthly thereafter. They will be&#xD;
      quantified by a trained dietician using the reference French Cidal tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic syndrome factors Body composition including weight, height, abdominal&#xD;
      circumference, total and torcular lean and total and abdominal fat mass measured by DXA&#xD;
      Cardiac diastolic and systolic functions by means of standard, Tissue Doppler imaging and&#xD;
      2D-strain echocardiogram Vascular structure function in conduit and resistance arteries and&#xD;
      microvascular reactivity Biological parameters with glycemic control : insulinemia and glaced&#xD;
      haemoglobin Inflammatory syndrome and related cytokines: CRP, 1GPA, IL-6, TNF-, Il-12 and&#xD;
      IL-10 blood protein: Albumine and transthyretin Appetite hormone: Leptine, adiponectin,&#xD;
      Gremlin and CCK osteocalcin, BASP and CTx&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statical analysis Subject numbers were calculated from the results of a pilot. A statistical&#xD;
      significance (p=0,05) may be reached with 22 subjects in group 1 and 2 for a difference of&#xD;
      0,6 kg of abdominal fat mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cross-sectional comparison, healthy and MS subjects will be compared by unpaired Student&#xD;
      test. The 3 groups of patients will be compared using a repeated measure ANOVA. If positive,&#xD;
      a post-hoc test for mean comparison will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A correlation matrix will analyse relationships between studied parameters. A principal&#xD;
      component analysis will allow to determine the reciprocal weight of positive explicating&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is done applying French and international regulations&#xD;
