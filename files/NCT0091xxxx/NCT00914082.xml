    <textblock>
      Labour pain is a challenge to the parturient woman. Pain relief methods during birth are&#xD;
      limited and often associated with side effects. Several studies indicate that a mental&#xD;
      trainings method, self hypnosis, has a positive impact on the labour pain and other birth&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized controlled study is to examine the effect of a short antenatal&#xD;
      course in self hypnosis on the use of epidural analgesia during birth and several other birth&#xD;
      outcomes. Data collection includes questionnaires, register data, medical records and&#xD;
      biological material.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiencing labour pain is a challenge to the parturient woman and can possibly cause a&#xD;
      traumatic birth experience, post traumatic stress syndrome, post partum depression, caesarean&#xD;
      section or refraining from having more children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological pain relief methods to relieve birth pain are limited and often associated&#xD;
      with side effects. Investigating new methods without adverse effects to relieve labour pain&#xD;
      is therefore important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies indicate that a mental trainings method, self-hypnosis, has a positive impact&#xD;
      on labour pain and several other birth outcomes. However, many of these studies were based on&#xD;
      observational data with a limited amount of participants that may be prone to bias and&#xD;
      confounding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of a short antenatal course in self hypnosis&#xD;
      on the use of epidural analgesia during childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as an interventional single center study taking place at one of the&#xD;
      largest birth departments in Denmark. It is a randomised, controlled, single blinded trial&#xD;
      using a 3 arm group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomised by a voice respond program. The intervention group&#xD;
      receives 3 antenatal classes in self hypnosis taught by midwives with qualified training in&#xD;
      hypnosis. The course includes audio compact discs for homework in self hypnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active comparator group also receives 3 antenatal classes. The program is taught by the&#xD;
      same midwives as in the intervention group and includes a mixture of training in different&#xD;
      relaxation methods and mindfulness. This course also includes audio compact discs for&#xD;
      homework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will only receive ordinary antenatal care and no additional interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will be based on questionnaires, register data, medical records and&#xD;
      biological material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of epidural analgesia during birth&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Birth progression at arrival at birth department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Birth experience (pain, control, anxiety)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical interventions during birth including mode of delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemorrhage during birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva cortisol profile at birth and 6 weeks p.p.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection during birth and the first 6 weeks p.p. (mother and child)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postnatal depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breastfeeding duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Child's condition and wellbeing at birth and 6 months later&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Future mode of delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, we performed our power calculations based on the fact that 44% of&#xD;
      all primiparas at Aarhus University Hospital Skejby in 2007 had received epidural analgesia.&#xD;
      We hypothesized that the observed frequency of epidural analgesia would be 25 % in the&#xD;
      intervention group, 35 % in the placebo effect group and 40 % in the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to these power calculations, we should include 328 participants in the hypnosis&#xD;
      group, 328 participants in the active comparator group and 152 participants in the control&#xD;
      group to obtain a power of 80 % (α 0.05 (two sided)) in detecting a difference of 5&#xD;
      percentage points (relative risk (RR) 0.71) between the intervention and the active&#xD;
      comparator group. By including 152 participants in the control group we would have a larger&#xD;
      power to detect a difference of 15 percentage points (RR 0.63) in the use of epidural&#xD;
      analgesia between the intervention and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because we expected that some participants would develop medical conditions that required&#xD;
      epidural analgesia during delivery, give birth prior to receiving their allocated&#xD;
      intervention, or give birth by caesarean section, we decided to increase the sample size by&#xD;
      10% in all groups to a total of 890 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010, the study board experienced that in 2009 the general frequency of epidural analgesia&#xD;
      in primiparas giving birth at Aarhus University Hospital Skejby had decreased to&#xD;
      34%.Therefore it was decided to adjust the sample size according to this new information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the sample size was adjusted we maintained the same sample ratios between the groups and&#xD;
      hypothesized that the observed frequency of epidural analgesia would be 22 % in the&#xD;
      intervention group, 30 % in the placebo effect group and 32 % in the placebo group. To obtain&#xD;
      a power of 80 % (α 0.05 (two sided)) in detecting a difference of 8 percentage points (RR&#xD;
      0.73) between the intervention and the active comparator group in the use of epidural&#xD;
      analgesia and a difference of 10 percentage points (RR 0.68) between the intervention and the&#xD;
      control group we should include 446 participants in the hypnosis group, 446 participants in&#xD;
      the active comparator group and 226 participants in the control group, in total 1097&#xD;
      participants. Again, we further increased the sample size with an extra 10% to account for&#xD;
      those women that would not be able to comply with their allocated treatment because of&#xD;
      obstetric conditions and reached a sample size in total of 1208.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will primarily be performed as &quot;intended to treat&quot;. Secondary analyses according to&#xD;
      &quot;as treated&quot; and preplanned subgroup analysis will also be performed.&#xD;
