    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate inflammatory and other substances that may be&#xD;
      elevated in the blood and blood cells following spinal cord injury (SCI). These substances&#xD;
      will be evaluated in samples from people who have had a spinal cord injury due to trauma&#xD;
      (e.g. car accident or a fall) within the first week (acute) or at least one year ago&#xD;
      (chronic). Specifically, the study will evaluate the presence and levels of a protein,&#xD;
      macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF is released by cells and has a specific&#xD;
      effect on the way cells behave, communicate and work together. In several other medical&#xD;
      conditions, MIF is known to increase inflammation in the body. By comparing blood samples&#xD;
      from individuals with spinal cord injury and uninjured (no spinal cord injury) individuals,&#xD;
      the investigators will try to find out if MIF levels are increased in people with SCI.&#xD;
      Investigators will also use these samples to measure other proteins that increase&#xD;
      inflammation in the body and to see if the biological activities of MIF can be reduced in a&#xD;
      test tube by adding other substances to the blood samples. It is hoped that this study of MIF&#xD;
      and other proteins related to inflammation will help improve the treatment of SCI in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to enroll a total of 312 subjects in this study (50 with acute spinal cord injury,&#xD;
      125 with chronic spinal cord injury, and 137 uninjured individuals).&#xD;

      During the study visit the investigator will collect basic biographical information and&#xD;
      health information, including some questionnaires, from the subjects and their medical&#xD;
      record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute SCI subjects will also have blood drawn once daily (First blood draw will approximately&#xD;
      be 2 tablespoons and subsequent blood draws will approximately be 1 tablespoon) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic SCI subjects will have blood drawn per study visit (approximately 2 tablespoons) and&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in two study visits, to take place 6 months apart.&#xD;
