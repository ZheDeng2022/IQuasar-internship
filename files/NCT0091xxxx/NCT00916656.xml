  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, prospective, open-label historically controlled Phase&#xD;
      IIIb non-inferiority clinical trial on the efficacy and safety of Fibrinogen Concentrate&#xD;
      (Human).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 150-300 patients in the U.S. suffer from afibrinogenemia. Substitution&#xD;
      with cryoprecipitate or alternative treatments have limited safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate the hemostatic efficacy of Fibrinogen&#xD;
      Concentrate (Human) by adequately controlling acute bleeding (spontaneous or after trauma) in&#xD;
      patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency (afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia).&#xD;
      Cryoprecipitate hemostatic efficacy data from a retrospective physician survey will be used&#xD;
      as a historical control.&#xD;

    <description>Intravenous (IV) infusion to reach the peak target levels of 100 mg/dL with an accepted lower limit of 80 mg/dL on at least 3 subsequent days for minor bleeding episodes and 150 mg/dL with an accepted lower limit of 130 mg/dL on at least 7 subsequent days for major bleeding episodes.&#xD;
If a subject's fibrinogen level is not known on Day 1, at the time treatment is initiated for the acute bleed (e.g., because they did not have a screening visit), the starting dose is to be 70 mg/kg b.w. Otherwise, the dose will be calculated individually.</description>
