      STUDY PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To assess the efficacy of an intervention in preventing or delaying postpartum smoking&#xD;
      resumption among women who stop smoking during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To determine the association of baseline risk assessment variables (dependence,&#xD;
      motivation, self-efficacy, concerns for the fetus, changes in sensory response to tobacco,&#xD;
      depression, weight concerns, and partner/household smoking and support) with time to&#xD;
      resumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Women's risk for resumption will be&#xD;
      assessed at 4 time-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Between 28 and 34 weeks of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 6-weeks postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 6-months postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 12-months postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who report not smoking at any of the assessment points will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      saliva sample for analysis of tobacco constituents and a breath sample to assess carbon&#xD;
      monoxide. Bio-behavioral and pregnancy-specific factors will be used to triage women to one&#xD;
      of four levels of stepped-care that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One in-person counseling session and at least one telephone session during pregnancy and&#xD;
           from 6 to 11 telephone sessions over the first 9-months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Risk profiles will be used to match the intervention to each woman's needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Women randomized to the control arm will receive the booklet, Forever Free for Baby and&#xD;
           Me and usual prenatal and postpartum care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are recruiting 400 women for this study from 11 sites in the Durham/ Raleigh/ Chapel Hill&#xD;
      NC area and Fayetteville NC.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Women's risk for resumption will be&#xD;
      assessed at 4 time-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Between 28 and 34 weeks of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 6-weeks postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 6-months postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 12-months postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who report not smoking at any of the assessment points will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      saliva sample for analysis of tobacco constituents and a breath sample to assess carbon&#xD;
      monoxide. Bio-behavioral and pregnancy-specific factors will be used to triage women to one&#xD;
      of four levels of stepped-care that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One in-person counseling session and at least one telephone session during pregnancy and&#xD;
           from 6 to 11 telephone sessions over the first 9-months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Risk profiles will be used to match the intervention to each woman's needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Women randomized to the control arm will receive the booklet, Forever Free for Baby and&#xD;
           Me and usual prenatal and postpartum care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit women for this study from 11 sites: Duke University Health Systems, Durham&#xD;
      County Health Services, Person County Health Department, Orange County Health Department,&#xD;
      Alamance County Health Department, Guilford County Health Department, Wake County Human&#xD;
      Services, Durham OB, Harris and Smith (Durham), Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC), and Cape&#xD;
      Fear Valley on the Fort Bragg Army Installation in Fayetteville, North Carolina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be 400 women. To be eligible for the study women must be: 1) 18 years of age&#xD;
      or older 2) speak English 3) registered for prenatal care and 4) have a history of smoking,&#xD;
      defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes and at least 5 cigarettes&#xD;
      a day prior to becoming pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible women will need to have been continuously abstinent from tobacco for at least 1&#xD;
      month prior to their risk assessment, which will occur between 28 and 34 weeks of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Screening and Recruitment. At Duke and the Durham County Health Department, each&#xD;
      week, all new obstetric patient charts are reviewed, and women with a history of tobacco use&#xD;
      are sent a letter from their providers informing them of the study and asking them to call a&#xD;
      toll-free number if they prefer not to be contacted about study participation. Women who do&#xD;
      not call are contacted and screened for eligibility. At all other sites, nurses screen women&#xD;
      and ask women to complete a contact sheet so that study staff can contact them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurse Case Managers (NCM) contact women when they are between 28 and 34 weeks pregnant,&#xD;
      confirm their non-smoking status, and make an appointment to explain the study further. Data&#xD;
      Technicians obtain written consent, conduct risk assessment, and collect baseline data. Data&#xD;
      is collected at the woman's prenatal clinic or at her home if she prefers or if her next&#xD;
      prenatal appointment is outside our recruitment time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedures. Randomization occurs at each study site (Duke and WAMC). At each&#xD;
      site, women are randomized to treatment or control condition with proportional risk&#xD;
      categories represented in treatment and control groups. Women assigned to the control arm&#xD;
      receive a tobacco control and family-centered relapse prevention booklet, Forever Free for&#xD;
      Baby and Me.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK ASSESSMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A risk profile is created for women based on the assessment of bio-behavioral (BB),&#xD;
      pregnancy-specific (PS), and co-condition (CC) risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All follow-up data collection is conducted face-to-face by a blinded staff member (not Nurse&#xD;
      Case Manager).&#xD;
