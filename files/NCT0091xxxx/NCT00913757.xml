      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver cancer is the third most deadly and fifth most common cancer worldwide.&#xD;
           Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary liver cancer, and it has&#xD;
           grown more prevalent in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More information is needed about the causes and effects of liver cancer, and further&#xD;
           research into individuals who are at high risk for developing liver cancer is needed for&#xD;
           early diagnosis and prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify genetic factors that may help to explain the aggressiveness of liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if HCC biomarkers exist in blood, urine, and tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients between the ages of 18 and 90 who have been diagnosed with HCC or have a high&#xD;
           risk for developing HCC because of fatty liver disease (alcohol-related or&#xD;
           non-alcohol-related) or chronic hepatitis B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will reside in Baltimore City and the surrounding areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a questionnaire and provide blood and urine samples for&#xD;
           testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questionnaire will include questions about individual and family medical history,&#xD;
           tobacco use, and exposure to known factors for liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples will be collected from all participants after the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor tissue and healthy tissue will be collected from selected participants if they&#xD;
           undergo surgery for their cancer or disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No specific treatment will be offered as part of this protocol, but participants have&#xD;
           the option to be treated under different protocols.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver cancer is the third most deadly and fifth most common cancer worldwide. Hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary cancer of the liver with rising incidence in the&#xD;
      United States. HCC patients have a dismal outcome and are an underserved cancer population.&#xD;
      We are proposing a liver cancer case-control and case-case study to be conducted in&#xD;
      Baltimore, Maryland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research is aimed to identify genetic and genomic changes that might explain the&#xD;
      aggressive nature of liver cancer. We will test the primary hypothesis that HCC biomarkers&#xD;
      exist in blood products (or mouth wash), urine and/or tissues that can be used for early&#xD;
      diagnosis and prevention. A unique study factor is the use of urine samples for biomarker&#xD;
      identification. A secondary goal will be to examine whether certain genetic and genomic&#xD;
      factors modify liver cancer susceptibility using candidate and genome wide association study&#xD;
      approaches. Although other studies have investigated genetic susceptibility, large scale&#xD;
      studies have not been conducted for liver cancer. Our study will also be valuable due to&#xD;
      access to frozen tumor specimens from pre-therapy resection, whose collection is required for&#xD;
      gene expression analysis. If certain genes are related to HCC risk and progression, this&#xD;
      tissue resource will be used to further validate our findings with laboratory investigations.&#xD;
      The proposed study is designed to be exploratory and hypothesis generating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will reside in Baltimore City and surrounding areas. Cases will have&#xD;
      pathologically confirmed liver cancer or risk factors for HCC development. Risk factors&#xD;
      include chronic liver disease due to hepatitis B and/or C viral infection, nonalcoholic&#xD;
      steatohepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis. The study will be supported by an epidemiological&#xD;
      infrastructure developed by our University of Maryland School of Medicine resource contractor&#xD;
      for ongoing lung and prostate cancer case-control studies. The enrollment of controls will&#xD;
      begin concurrently with case accrual, and will continue for 5 years. Population-based&#xD;
      controls will be recruited using a triple eligibility criterion, such that controls eligible&#xD;
      for the lung/prostate study will be asked to complete a supplemental questionnaire for the&#xD;
      liver study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 400 primary HCC cases, 800 patients with chronic liver disease (high&#xD;
      risk non-cancer cases) and a sample of 800 population-based controls. The HCC and high risk&#xD;
      non-cancer cases will be recruited at two Baltimore hospitals, the Veterans Affairs Medical&#xD;
      Center, and the University of Maryland School of Medicine over a period of 13-15 years.&#xD;
      Controls will be identified through a Department of Motor Vehicle database and match cases by&#xD;
      age, gender, race and county of residency. The study will involve administration of a&#xD;
      questionnaire and collection of blood (or mouth wash) from all study subjects. Fresh-frozen&#xD;
      tumor and tumor surrounding non-cancerous specimens will be obtained from approximately 20&#xD;
      percent of the cancer patients. The cases will receive one questionnaire.&#xD;

&#xD;
        SELECTION OF POPULATION-BASED CONTROLS&#xD;
&#xD;
        Population-based controls will be identified through the Motor Vehicle Administration&#xD;
        (MVA), and matched on age (year of birth), race, gender and geography to cases. We sample&#xD;
        controls in proportion to the population size of their county of residence. Recruitment of&#xD;
        controls will start concurrently with case accrual, using the age, race and gender&#xD;
        frequency distribution of cancer patients in previous years. The sampling frame is&#xD;
        continually updated as we accrue information on the case distribution of age, race and&#xD;
        gender. We will exclude controls that do not have a listed home phone number. The following&#xD;
        check list will be used to verify eligibility of a control subject.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Subject provides informed consent and signs form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria-HCC CANCER CASES&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Liver cancer patients who are older than 90 years are excluded because of co-morbidity&#xD;
             considerations and the difficulty of matching those cases with population-based&#xD;
             controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Children and institutionalized patients are excluded from the proposed study. Very few&#xD;
             HCC patients at the 3 participating hospitals are younger than 18 years of age and HCC&#xD;
             incidence mainly occurs in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria-HCC HIGH-RISK NON-CANCER CASES&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. High Risk Non-Cancer patients who are older than 90 years are excluded because of&#xD;
             co-morbidity considerations and the difficulty of matching those cases with&#xD;
             population-based controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Children and institutionalized patients are excluded from the proposed study. Very few&#xD;
             HCC patients at the 3 participating hospitals are younger than 18 years of age and HCC&#xD;
             incidence mainly occurs in adults. High-Risk Non-Cancer cases who are younger than 18&#xD;
             years are excluded due to the need of matching with HCC cases and population controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria-POPULATION BASED CONTROLS&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Population based controls who are older than 90 years are excluded because of&#xD;
             co-morbidity considerations and the difficulty of matching with HCC cases and high&#xD;
             risk non-cancer cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Population controls who are younger than 18 years or are institutionalized are&#xD;
             excluded due to the need of matching with HCC cases and high-risk non-cancer cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Population controls with prior cancer with the exception of non-melanomic skin cancer&#xD;
             (squamous or basal cell).&#xD;
