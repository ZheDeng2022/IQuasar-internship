  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness and side effects of an experimental vaccine to&#xD;
      prevent recurrence of nasopharyngeal cancer. The likelihood of this cancer returning is&#xD;
      higher in patients whose original lesion was large, whose cancer had spread to the adjacent&#xD;
      lymph nodes, or who had surgery for metastatic disease (cancer that spread beyond the primary&#xD;
      site). Nasopharyngeal tumors are caused by a common virus called Epstein-Barr virus, which&#xD;
      produces a protein called LMP-2. Vaccination with specific pieces, or peptides, of the LMP-2&#xD;
      protein may boost the immune system's fight against the cancer. The vaccine injections are&#xD;
      mixed with an oil-based substance called Montanide ISA-51, which is intended to increase the&#xD;
      immune response to the peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older whose nasopharyngeal cancer has been controlled by&#xD;
      standard treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy and who are currently&#xD;
      free of disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a physical&#xD;
      examination and blood and urine tests. x-rays and other imaging studies are also done in&#xD;
      patients who have not had these tests recently. All candidates are tested for HLA tissue&#xD;
      type. Only patients with type HLA-A*1101 or HLA-A*2402 - the types on which the two vaccines&#xD;
      in this study are based - receive vaccine therapy; others are offered standard medical&#xD;
      treatment and observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive injections of one of two different vaccines&#xD;
      (LMP-2:340-349 or LMP-2:419-427) to determine which peptide may offer the best immunity. Each&#xD;
      treatment course consists of weekly immunizations for 8 consecutive weeks. The injections are&#xD;
      given under the skin of the thigh. After every other treatment course (about every 3 months),&#xD;
      patients undergo a series of x-rays and scans to look for tumor. The immunizations are given&#xD;
      at the NIH Clinical Center. Patients are monitored for 1 hour after each injection and have&#xD;
      blood tests and a physical examination to look for treatment side effects. Immunizations may&#xD;
      continue for up to 12 months as long as the cancer does not return.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed with blood tests every 12 weeks to monitor body functions. They also&#xD;
      undergo leukapheresis-a procedure to collect white blood cells-before starting treatment and&#xD;
      about 3 to 4 weeks after the fourth vaccine to evaluate how the vaccines affect the action of&#xD;
      the immune system cells. For this procedure, blood is drawn through a needle in the arm,&#xD;
      similar to donating blood. The blood is processed by a machine that separates and removes the&#xD;
      lymphocytes (white blood cells), and the rest of the blood is returned through a needle in&#xD;
      the other arm. Patients not receiving the vaccine also undergo leukapheresis to assess their&#xD;
      natural response to LMP-2. Some patients may have a biopsy-surgical removal of a small piece&#xD;
      of tissue under local anesthetic-of normal skin and tumor or lymph node tissue to examine the&#xD;
      vaccine's effects on the tumor immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who show no evidence of immunization against the LMP-2 protein after two courses of&#xD;
      vaccine treatment are subsequently be followed with observation alone. Those who do respond&#xD;
      to the vaccine are offered two additional courses of treatment to strengthen the response or&#xD;
      to be followed by observation alone. Patients whose disease recurs after completing the first&#xD;
      two treatment courses are taken off the study and referred back to their local physician or&#xD;
      to another study, if an appropriate one is available.&#xD;

      HLA-A*1101 and HLA-A*2402 positive patients with locally controlled anaplastic nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma at risk for loco-regional or distant recurrence will receive immunization with&#xD;
      peptides representing HLA-restricted T cell epitopes of the Epstein-Barr virus encoded latent&#xD;
      membrane protein-2 (LMP-2) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51. Patients will be allocated to&#xD;
      treatment according to their HLA phenotype. The immunologic potential of the vaccine will be&#xD;
      followed by enumerating the frequency of vaccines-specific CD8+ T cells in the peripheral&#xD;
      blood using tetrameric HLA/peptide complexes. This study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunologic effectiveness of peptide immunization in adjuvant settings in the context of&#xD;
      anaplastic NPC.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HLA-A*1101 and HLA-A*2402 patients, greater than 18 years of age, with advanced local&#xD;
             disease (T3-T4N0-1M0), nodal disease (T1-T2N2-3M0) and loco-regional disease&#xD;
             (T3-T4N2-3M0) at onset but presently controlled by standard therapy (combination of&#xD;
             chemotherapy and radiotherapy) or with completely resected metastatic disease, 3&#xD;
             months after the completion of their primary treatment will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
             All subjects will be judged disease free based on physical examination, ENT endoscopy,&#xD;
             CT scan of abdomen, chest, neck and nasal sinuses and MRI of the head. All subjects&#xD;
             must have received standard surgical, chemotherapy and radiation therapy appropriate&#xD;
             for their stage of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Currently, standard treatment for locally advanced NPC in the U.S. consists of&#xD;
             concomitant cisplatin with radiation followed by 3 courses of cisplatin and&#xD;
             5-fluorouracil. This, or comparable standard therapies will be considered part of&#xD;
             standard therapy and patients will be considered for accrual three or more months&#xD;
             after its completion. Patients must demonstrate evidence of local control with no&#xD;
             histological or radiological evidence of recurrent disease three months after the end&#xD;
             of standard therapy and be, otherwise, clinically disease free at the time of protocol&#xD;
             entry as documented by radiological studies within 6 weeks of patient entry. Physical&#xD;
             and histological evidence of disease recurrence at the time of patients' screening and&#xD;
             during follow up will be performed under the supervision of Dr. Carter Van Waes during&#xD;
             an out patient evaluation. Similar enrollment criteria will be used with patients who&#xD;
             do not bear HLA-A*1101 or HLA-A*2402. However, these patients will be followed by&#xD;
             observation only.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pathologic confirmation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by the NCI Laboratory of Pathology&#xD;
             (NPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl or less,&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Total bilirubin 1.6 mg/dl or less, except for patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who&#xD;
             must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. WBC 3000/mm(3) or greater,&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. platelet count 90,000 mm(3) or greater,&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. serum AST/ALT less than three times normal,&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice effective birth control during&#xD;
             this trial because the potential for teratogenic effects are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients may have had prior adjuvant treatment or may have had treatment for&#xD;
             metastatic disease and are now with no evidence of disease, including chemotherapy or&#xD;
             biotherapy, as long as 1 month has elapsed since prior systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Who are undergoing or have undergone in the past 3 weeks any systemic therapy except&#xD;
             surgery for their cancer, and must have recovered from any adverse effects of&#xD;
             treatment prior to entry, other than those that do not have clinical implications,&#xD;
             e.g. alopecia. In the case a patient has received surgical intervention; at least one&#xD;
             month should pass before enrollment in the study. All toxicity from previous therapy&#xD;
             must have resolved to less than or equal to Grade 1 by NCI-CTC v 3.0 before&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Who have active systemic infections, autoimmune disease or any known immunodeficiency&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        d. Who require systemic steroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        e. Who are pregnant (because of possible side effects on the fetus) or breastfeeding&#xD;
        (because of unknown effects on the developing child).&#xD;
&#xD;
        f. Who are known to be positive for hepatitis BsAG or HIV antibody (because of possible&#xD;
        immune effects of these conditions). Patients who may screen or have history positive for&#xD;
        hepatitis C may be enrolled if their transaminases levels are within the limits specified&#xD;
        in inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        g. Who have any form of active primary or secondary immunodeficiency or who have not&#xD;
        recovered immune competence after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. (The experimental&#xD;
        treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who&#xD;
        have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and&#xD;
        more susceptible to its toxicities.) Active or secondary immunodeficiency will be judged&#xD;
        based on the patient past medical history and normality of circulating T and B cell counts&#xD;
        (Normal range 650-2, 108 and 49 to 424 respectively, Department of Laboratory Medicine,&#xD;
        CC). In the similar fashion recovery from chemotherapy and radiation therapy will be&#xD;
        evaluated. Previous experience in patients with melanoma or renal cell carcinoma who&#xD;
        underwent chemotherapy of local radiation demonstrated that they immune response to common&#xD;
        T cell epitopes such as Flu or Cytomegalovirus are rapidly restored within the first month&#xD;
        from such treatment (unpublished observation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        h. Who have known hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study.&#xD;
