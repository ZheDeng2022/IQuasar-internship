  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of multiple biweekly intravenous doses of Replagal over&#xD;
      26 weeks in 25 children with Fabry disease and the way in which that agent can improve the&#xD;
      health of this patient population. Fabry disease is a genetic disorder inherited as an&#xD;
      X-linked recessive trait. It causes a deficiency in the enzyme alpha galactosidase, which&#xD;
      normally breaks down a lipid, or fatty substance, called ceramidetrihexosidase, a building&#xD;
      block in all cells of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deficiency in breaking down the lipid eventually causes that lipid to accumulate and&#xD;
      injure cells. Problems in the blood vessels, kidneys, heart, and nerves are the result. The&#xD;
      disease typically occurs in childhood or adolescence, with repeated episodes of severe pain&#xD;
      in the extremities and other symptoms. There is no definitive treatment, but pain management&#xD;
      is important in caring for patients with Fabry disease. Although it is not known exactly how&#xD;
      lipid accumulation brings about such problems, studies of another lipid storage disorder,&#xD;
      Gaucher's disease, have shown that the illness can be reversed if the lipid is removed when&#xD;
      an appropriate enzyme, Replagal, is given intravenously. In this study, the gene response of&#xD;
      the body's cells to Fabry disease will be described, as will any gene responses that change&#xD;
      when the enzyme is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 7 to 17 years of age who have Fabry disease may be eligible for this study. They&#xD;
      will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to determine complete blood count and chemistries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire on pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests pertaining to sweating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doppler blood flow study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diary for recording symptoms and the use of pain medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will go through the evaluation, over a period of about 5 days, either as an&#xD;
      inpatient or outpatient. Participants will receive an intravenous infusion of Replagal every&#xD;
      other week, at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg of body weight. Vital signs will be measured before the&#xD;
      infusion and immediately and after and 1 hour afterward. There will be careful monitoring for&#xD;
      allergic reactions and side effects. The infusion time takes approximately 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 6 months, with the possibility of being extended another 6 months-a&#xD;
      maintenance study in which patients will continue to receive Replagal at the same dose every&#xD;
      2 weeks.&#xD;

      The objectives of this clinical trial are to evaluate: 1) the safety of multiple biweekly&#xD;
      (i.e. every other week) intravenous (IV) doses of Replagal over 26 weeks in 25 children ages&#xD;
      7-17 years old with Fabry Disease, and 2) the pharmacokinetics of Replagal in this patient&#xD;
      population. Safety will be determined by standard clinical and laboratory measurements.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male hemizygote with Fabry Disease as documented by clinical evidence and by laboratory&#xD;
        evidence of alpha-galactosidase A deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Or&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female heterozygote with Fabry Disease as documented by gene analysis showing a mutation of&#xD;
        the alpha-galactosidase A gene. Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a&#xD;
        negative pregnancy test at baseline and agree to the use of effective contraception such as&#xD;
        oral contraceptive or double barrier method for study entry and while participating in the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7-17 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate general health (as determined by the investigators) to undergo the specified&#xD;
        phlebotomy regimen and protocol related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The child must assent to participate in the protocol and the parent(s) or legally&#xD;

        Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approved informed consent form after all&#xD;
        relevant aspects of the study have been explained and discussed with the child and the&#xD;
        child's parent(s) or legal guardian(s).&#xD;
