    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of treating uveitis, an eye&#xD;
      inflammation, with a monoclonal antibody called daclizumab. Monoclonal antibodies are&#xD;
      genetically engineered proteins made in large quantities and directed against a specific&#xD;
      target in the body. Daclizumab is designed to prevent a specific chemical interaction needed&#xD;
      for immune cells called lymphocytes to produce inflammation. In an ongoing NIH study of 10&#xD;
      adults with uveitis, 8 patients were able to decrease corticosteroids and other&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medicines they were taking while receiving daclizumab for months or even&#xD;
      years. Seven patients continue to take the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with active non-infectious intermediate or posterior&#xD;
      uveitis in both eyes who require treatment for their disease may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination to measure visual acuity and eye pressure, and examine the lens, retina,&#xD;
           pupils and eye movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure the number and types of blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography to check for abnormalities of eye blood vessels. A yellow dye&#xD;
           injected into an arm vein travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the&#xD;
           retina are taken with a special camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The&#xD;
           pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating&#xD;
           possible abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center for treatment and follow-up visits. The first&#xD;
      daclizumab treatment is given as a 90-minute infusion through a vein. A second IV infusion is&#xD;
      given 7 days later. If the treatment has successfully reduced the eye inflammation after 2&#xD;
      weeks, then subsequent treatments are given through injections under the skin once a month&#xD;
      for up to 1 year. Patients whose eye disease is not improved after 2 weeks stop the study&#xD;
      treatments and receive alternative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits are scheduled 7, 14, and 21 days after enrollment and at each treatment&#xD;
      visit to evaluate the response to treatment and drug side effects. During these visits,&#xD;
      patients repeat the exams done at screening. Extra blood samples are taken at certain visits&#xD;
      to measure blood levels of daclizumab and to perform clinical laboratory and immunology&#xD;
      tests. Fluorescein angiography is done at enrollment and after 1 year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis refers to intraocular inflammatory diseases that are an important cause of visual&#xD;
      loss. Standard systemic immunosuppressive medications used for uveitis can cause significant&#xD;
      toxic side effects, especially with prolonged use. Consequently, an effective treatment with&#xD;
      a safer side effect profile is highly desirable. Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody directed against the high affinity IL-2 receptor CD25 or Tac subunit. The IL-2&#xD;
      receptor system plays a central role in mediating immune responses. Blocking this system&#xD;
      impedes immune responses and can inhibit local inflammatory responses, including uveitis.&#xD;
      Pilot studies using intravenous or subcutaneous daclizumab treatments suggest that daclizumab&#xD;
      treatments at 1 mg/kg every 2-4 weeks for quiescent uveitis may effectively replace the other&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications in a majority of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because we have little experience using daclizumab for active uveitis, this feasibility study&#xD;
      will enroll five study participants that would normally be treated with systemic, high-dose&#xD;
      corticosteroids or other cytotoxic, systemic immunosuppressive medications. Since daclizumab&#xD;
      for other indications can be tolerated with repeated dosing at 8-10 mg/kg, we will administer&#xD;
      daclizumab to reach high serum levels with a pair doses at 8 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg two weeks&#xD;
      apart. The primary objective of this study is to collect preliminary information on the&#xD;
      utility of acute daclizumab therapy on active ocular inflammation. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      resolution of active disease defined as the reduction of vitreous haze by at least 2 steps&#xD;
      (from 2+ to Trace, or 1+ to none) and is assessed at 21 days after the initial daclizumab&#xD;
      injection. Secondary outcomes will include fluorescein retinal vascular leakage, CME,&#xD;
      anterior chamber cells, and visual acuity. In addition all adverse events will be collected&#xD;
      regardless of possible relation to daclizumab. Participants who show a 2 step reduction in&#xD;
      vitreous haze at day 21 will be permitted to continue SC daclizumab maintenance treatments&#xD;
      beginning at Day 28 at 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks for a year. At any time during the followup&#xD;
      period, if a participant loses greater than 3 lines of visual acuity from baseline study&#xD;
      treatments will be discontinued.&#xD;

          3. Participant's uveitis is currently treated or untreated at the time of enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant has best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA) in the worst eye of&#xD;
             20/400 or better (ETDRS logMAR less than 1.34);&#xD;

          5. Participant does not plan to undergo elective ocular surgery (e.g., cataract&#xD;
             extraction) during the study period;&#xD;
&#xD;

             treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A volunteer will not be permitted to enroll if they meet any one of the following exclusion&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Participant has lens opacities or obscured anterior ocular media upon enrollment such&#xD;
             that reliable evaluation and grading of posterior segment cannot be performed (except&#xD;
             that anterior chamber cells due to inflammation is not an exclusion);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant has a history of an active herpes zoster or varicella infection within 6&#xD;
             weeks before enrollment, or chicken pox exposure within 21 days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant has a known history of HIV infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant is currently enrolled in another investigational or interventional&#xD;
             therapeutic trial, or is using a therapy for a non-uveitis condition that would likely&#xD;
             affect immune responses or interfere with trial logistics, or has received any&#xD;
             investigational therapy within the 30 days prior to enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant has a history or diagnosis of Behcet's disease (since subsequent tapering&#xD;
             or withdrawal of concomitant immunosuppressive medications is not a standard-of-care&#xD;
             for Behcet's patients) or a primary diagnosis of anterior uveitis (e.g., HLA-B27&#xD;
             associated uveitis, or ocular conditions usually treated with local and not systemic&#xD;
             medications);&#xD;

             at the time of enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participant is currently pregnant or lactating;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participant has a history of cancer (other than a non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ&#xD;
             cervical cancer) diagnosed within the past 5 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participant has a non-ocular, medically significant co-morbid condition that impairs&#xD;
             normal activities, requires immunosuppression, or has a condition with a prognosis&#xD;
             that indicates a significant risk of disability or death if the condition were to&#xD;
             continue or be exacerbated during the study period, or a medical condition that would&#xD;
             likely have an impact on the participant's ability to comply with the visit schedule.&#xD;
             Such conditions may include, for example, recent heart attack, significant COPD,&#xD;
             brittle diabetes, kidney disease, severe emphysema, organ transplant (requiring&#xD;
             corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications), hepatitis or other liver&#xD;
             disease, or uncontrolled psychiatric illnesses.&#xD;
