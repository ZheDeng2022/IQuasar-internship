    <textblock>
      This study will determine which of four doses of GW873140 can safely be given to adults to&#xD;
      lower the amount of virus (HIV-1) in the body. GW873140 is a new type of anti-HIV drug called&#xD;
      a CCR5 receptor antagonist. CCR5 is a receptor on T cells (a type of white blood cell) where&#xD;
      HIV-1 enters and then infects the cell. GW873140 is intended to block the CCR5 receptor so&#xD;
      that HIV-1 cannot enter the cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-1-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      are screened with a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood&#xD;
      and urine tests. Some of the blood drawn is used to test the patient's HIV-1 type to see if&#xD;
      the study drug might lower the amount of HIV-1 in the blood. Women who can become pregnant&#xD;
      have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are hospitalized for 12 days. They are randomly assigned to take one of the&#xD;
      following four treatments for 10 days: 1) 200 mg of GW873140 once a day, or placebo (a&#xD;
      look-alike pill with no active ingredient); 2) 200 mg of GW873140 twice a day, or placebo; 3)&#xD;
      400 mg of GW873140 once a day, or placebo; or 600 mg of GW873140 twice a day, or placebo.&#xD;
      Participants record the meals they eat on a diary card. In addition, they undergo the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of HIV classification (day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of meal diary cards (days 1,2,3,4,5,8, and 10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of any HIV-associated conditions, other medications taken besides the study drug,&#xD;
           and well-being (days 1,2,3,4,5,8,10, and 11)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check of vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature (days&#xD;
           1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10, and 11)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight assessment (days 1 and 10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity of the heart (days 1,2,3,8, and 10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws for routine laboratory tests, to measure T-cell counts, and to measure HIV&#xD;
           levels (days 1,2,5,10, and 11)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine tests (days 1 and 10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to monitor the effect of GW873140 on lowering HIV counts (days 12, 15, 17,&#xD;
           and 19)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit (2 weeks after last drug dose--day 24)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medications taken and general well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check of vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The development of resistance to all currently marketed drugs for HIV infection has been&#xD;
      observed and is a major reason for failure of therapy. In particular, there is a great need&#xD;
      for drugs against new targets and having novel mechanisms of action against new targets. Most&#xD;
      of the currently approved drugs are targeted toward the inhibition of viral enzymes. However,&#xD;
      the process of viral entry and fusion has become an active area of research. Among the steps&#xD;
      involved in viral entry, binding of HIV to CD4 co-receptors on the cell surface is an&#xD;
      important and promising target for new drug development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GW873140 is a CCR5 antagonist that is in Phase I clinical development as a viral entry&#xD;
      inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. GW873140 has demonstrated in vitro antiviral&#xD;
      activity with an IC50 against CCR5-tropic HIV-1 of 1nM equals about 0.5ng/mL), that is&#xD;
      shifted 8-10 fold (10nM equals about 0.5ng/mL) in the presence of physiological&#xD;
      concentrations of human plasma proteins. A study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of escalating single (50-1200mg) and repeat (200-800mg BID) doses of&#xD;
      GW873140 has been conducted in 70 healthy volunteers (GW873140/001). Preliminary results&#xD;
      indicate that GW873140 is well-tolerated up to a dose of 1200 mg following single dose and&#xD;
      800 mg BID following multiple-dose. Additionally, food was shown to increase the AUC and Cmax&#xD;
      of a 400 mg single dose by 1.7-and 2.2-fold, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentrations above the protein binding corrected IC90 are achieved following oral dosing&#xD;
      and in vivo binding studies in healthy subjects demonstrate greater than 97% receptor&#xD;
      occupancy 2 and 12 hours after multiple doses and 68-88% receptor occupancy 24 hours after a&#xD;
      single dose, despite plasma concentrations below or near detectable limits.&#xD;

             had an elevation of lipase two times normal or greater and symptoms suggestive of&#xD;
             pancreatitis (i.e. nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B or C are not excluded from study&#xD;
        participation if they are clinically asymptomatic, liver enzymes are less than five times&#xD;
        normal, and they have no evidence of hepatic synthetic dysfunction (i.e. PT less than 1.5&#xD;
        times upper limit of normal).&#xD;
