      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholesterol is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. The current approach to&#xD;
      assessing this risk factor is to measure levels in the blood as if blood levels were a static&#xD;
      and fixed phenomenon. Cholesterol levels in the blood are in fact a complex product of&#xD;
      transport of cholesterol and lipids into and out of various compartments: (1) from the gut,&#xD;
      liver or periphery into the blood; (2) from the blood into the periphery and the liver; (3)&#xD;
      de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the liver; and (4) excretion from the liver as bile&#xD;
      acids. It is possible that one or more of these processes may serve as better risk factors&#xD;
      for atherosclerosis or coronary events than simple measures of cholesterol. This study&#xD;
      addresses a new and potentially important question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will utilize plasma samples from subjects participating in Cycle 6 of the&#xD;
      Framingham Offspring Study. The Framingham Offspring Study is a longitudinal community based&#xD;
      study initiated in 1971. A sample of 5,135 men and women, consisting of the offspring of the&#xD;
      original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses were enrolled for the study, the objective&#xD;
      of which was to identify common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) by following its incidence over a long period of time in a large group of&#xD;
      participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project includes a case-control study relating the new lipid findings to cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD), a cross-sectional study to establish normal values and associations with diet&#xD;
      and genotypes, and a prospective study of cardiovascular events during a 10-year follow-up&#xD;
      period. The specific aims are to 1) quantify circulating indicators of cholesterol&#xD;
      homeostasis [levels of phytosterols and cholestanol (surrogate measures of cholesterol&#xD;
      absorption) and cholesterol precursors (surrogate measures of cholesterol synthetic rates)]&#xD;
      in plasma samples from Framingham Offspring Study participants diagnosed with established CVD&#xD;
      and/or &gt;50% carotid stenosis (N=165) not taking lipid-lowering medication and control&#xD;
      subjects matched for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension and smoking status (n=330); 2)&#xD;
      evaluate the validity of using indicators of cholesterol homeostasis to predict CVD risk in&#xD;
      the Framingham Offspring Study-Cycle 6 participants by a) establishing adult normal ranges&#xD;
      for circulating levels of phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor (N=3378), b)&#xD;
      defining the relationship between phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels,&#xD;
      and lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels in plasma, c) defining the relationship&#xD;
      between phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels and selected dietary intake&#xD;
      data (energy, protein, fat, saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and trans fatty&#xD;
      acids, cholesterol, fiber and antioxidant supplements) and d) determining the relationship&#xD;
      between phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels and selected genotype data&#xD;
      related to CVD risk (gene loci of apo E, apo A-IV, scavenger receptor class B type 1 [SRB1],&#xD;
      and ATP-binding cassette [ABC] G5 and ABCG8 transporters); and 3) monitor clinical events in&#xD;
      the Framingham Offspring Study cohort throughout a 10-year period (1995-2005) and relate&#xD;
      these data to the phytosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol precursor levels. Measures of&#xD;
      cholesterol homeostasis will be quantified first in subjects identified in specific aim #1&#xD;
      and then the balance of subjects identified in specific aim #2, achievable now due to the&#xD;
      development of a gas chromatographic method using a single plasma sample. These data will be&#xD;
      assessed relative to dietary, biochemical and genotype data currently available for the&#xD;
      cohort. The results of the study will define the relationship between markers of cholesterol&#xD;
      absorption and synthesis, and CVD outcomes; establish reference values for measures of&#xD;
      cholesterol absorption and synthesis; and assess the predictive value of these measures to&#xD;
      identify high risk individuals relative to established risk factors.&#xD;
