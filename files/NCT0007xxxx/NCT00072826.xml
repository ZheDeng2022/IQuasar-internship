      This study will examine the effects of oral atorvastatin on the linings of blood vessels in&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell disease, plus the agent's effect on blood markers of inflammation&#xD;
      and blood vessel function. Sickle cell disease is a recessive genetic disorder and the most&#xD;
      common genetic disease affecting African Americans. Inherited are abnormal genes that make&#xD;
      hemoglobin, the substance within red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the&#xD;
      body. In the disease, sickle hemoglobin leads to rigidity or hardness of the red cells,&#xD;
      causing obstruction in small blood vessels, inflammation, and injury to organs when the flow&#xD;
      of blood to them is blocked. Some medications already prescribed for other diseases, such as&#xD;
      atorvastatin, which is used for lowering cholesterol levels, can improve blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 to 65 years of age who have sickle cell disease, who have not had an acute pain&#xD;
      episode within the previous week, and who are not pregnant or lactating may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. They will undergo a complete medical history; physical examination; baseline&#xD;
      blood tests; and echocardiogram, in which an ultrasound wand is placed against the chest wall&#xD;
      to get images inside the heart and blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients will have blood flow studies. During the procedure, they will lie in an&#xD;
      adjustable reclining chair for 5 to 6 hours. There will be 20- to 30-minute rests between&#xD;
      specific activities and blood samples will be drawn intermittently for testing. Small tubes&#xD;
      will be placed in the artery of the forearm at the inside of the elbow. Normal saline will be&#xD;
      infused into one tube. A small pressure cuff will be applied to the wrist and a larger cuff&#xD;
      to the upper arm. Both cuffs will be attached to an inflation device. A device like a rubber&#xD;
      band, a strain gauge, will be placed around the widest part of the forearm. When the pressure&#xD;
      cuffs are inflated, blood will flow into the arm, stretching the gauge proportion to blood&#xD;
      flow, and information will be recorded. Then light reflected from the patients' hand and the&#xD;
      blood flow in the forearm will be measured. Activity of the genes in the white blood cells&#xD;
      will be measured as well. Small amounts of sodium nitroprusside, widely used to reduce blood&#xD;
      pressure in people with dangerously high blood pressure, will be injected and blood flow will&#xD;
      be measured. Later, small amounts of acetylcholine will be injected. It usually causes blood&#xD;
      vessels to expand. After that, small amounts of L-NMMA will be injected. It usually decreases&#xD;
      local blood flow by blocking the production of nitric oxide in the cells lining the arm's&#xD;
      blood vessels. Then acetylcholine combined with L-NMMA will be injected. After that,&#xD;
      oxypurinol, an agent taken by many patients to prevent gout, will be injected. The procedures&#xD;
      will be repeated, with oxypurinol given along with each of the agents, and the measurement of&#xD;
      blood flow in the forearm will be measured after each drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterward, patients will be treated for 4 weeks at home with oral atorvastatin. They will be&#xD;
      asked to visit the Clinical Center every 2 weeks for collection of blood samples and an&#xD;
      examination. After 4 weeks of taking atorvastatin orally, they will be asked to return to&#xD;
      repeat the blood flow studies, but only the first half will be conducted. The part using&#xD;
      oxypurinol will not be needed. Regarding some of the blood samples collected during the&#xD;
      study, there will be an examination of the genes found in the white blood cells. Specific&#xD;
      attention will go to those genes that make proteins for cell-to-cell interaction and&#xD;
      inflammation, plus those that cause blood cells to stick to the lining of blood vessels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease&#xD;
      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for&#xD;
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Hemoglobin S polymerization leads to red&#xD;
      cell rigidity, microvascular obstruction, inflammation, and end-organ ischemic injury. Our&#xD;
      published data indicate that up to 50% of sickle cell patients have endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      due to impaired bioavailability of endogenous nitric oxide. Our studies indicate that this is&#xD;
      due in large part to scavenging of nitric oxide by cell-free hemoglobin, with additional&#xD;
      nitric oxide inactivation by superoxide. This suggests that therapies directed at restoring&#xD;
      NO bioavailability might be beneficial. In patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease,&#xD;
      the statin family of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase inhibitors significantly&#xD;
      reduce stroke and myocardial infarction and restore endothelial-dependent relaxation of&#xD;
      conducting arteries. Furthermore, statin therapy has now been clearly shown to reduce&#xD;
      C-reactive protein levels and clinical events in patients with coronary artery disease&#xD;
      independent of the effects on lipoproteins. The ability of statins to correct vascular&#xD;
      inflammation and endothelial dysfunction makes this class of agents attractive to attempt to&#xD;
      reverse these features of sickle cell pathobiology. This trial will aim to 1) establish the&#xD;
      effects of oral atorvastatin treatment on endothelial-dependent relaxation in patients with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease and endothelial dysfunction; 2) establish the effect of therapy on&#xD;
      peripheral blood markers of inflammation and vascular function, and peripheral blood proteome&#xD;
      and transcriptome profiles; and 3) investigate whether superoxide produced through xanthine&#xD;
      oxidase limits nitric oxide bioavailability in patients with sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to control for the possibility that advancing age, gender and ethnicity may&#xD;
      influence vascular reactivity, we will also enroll age and gender-matched African-American&#xD;
      controls in the baseline forearm blood flow portion of this study.&#xD;
