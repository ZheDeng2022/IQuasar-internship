      This small, preliminary study will examine whether multiple infusions of infliximab&#xD;
      (RemicadeÂ® (Registered Trademark)) can control inflammation in patients with active&#xD;
      scleritis. The sclera is the tough white outer coat enclosing the eyeball. Infliximab is a&#xD;
      combination of part human and part mouse proteins that block a natural body protein called&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNF appears to be involved in scleritis, and stopping its action&#xD;
      may help reduce the inflammation in the disease. The drug has been approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration for treating Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older with active non-infectious scleritis may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination, including a vision test and examination of the retina (back part of the&#xD;
           eye) and of the sclera and its blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire about vision and daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tuberculin skin test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test: Women who can have children are tested for pregnancy at study weeks 0,&#xD;
           14, 30, 38, and 46.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infliximab treatment: Infliximab is infused over a 2-hour period through a needle in a&#xD;
           vein, usually in the arm. The patient's vital signs are checked before the patient&#xD;
           begins each infusion starts and again before leaving the clinic. After the first two&#xD;
           infusions, if the disease remains quiet, other scleritis medications will be attempted&#xD;
           to be reduced to half the original dose over 8 to 12 weeks and possibly to nothing if&#xD;
           the patient continues to do well. Patients receive a maximum of 9 infusions over a&#xD;
           30-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws: About 4 tablespoons of blood are drawn at each visit to test for the number&#xD;
           and types of cells in the blood and to check for signs of inflammation and side effects&#xD;
           of the study medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are seen in the NEI clinic for infusions and to check the response to therapy. This&#xD;
      includes 13 clinic visits over 46 weeks, as follows: every 2 weeks for the first 2 weeks,&#xD;
      every 4 weeks thereafter for a total of 30 weeks for infusions, and then every 4 weeks for 16&#xD;
      additional weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may stop therapy if their scleritis is not controlled 10 weeks into the study&#xD;
      period; if they develop a flare of inflammation after initial control of the active&#xD;
      scleritis; if their vision loss is too large; or if their medications increase or other&#xD;
      medicines are added to control the scleritis. Patients whose vision decreases minimally,&#xD;
      stays the same, or improves may remain in the study.&#xD;

      We propose to investigate the possible efficacy of multiple infliximab infusions to control&#xD;
      the inflammation in participants presenting with active scleritis. This will be performed&#xD;
      using an open-label pilot study. Subjects will receive 5mg/kg intravenous infusions of&#xD;
      infliximab at 0, 2, 6 and 10 weeks. After these initial infusions, participants may contine&#xD;
      to receive 5 mg/kg dose infusions or may receive 8 mg/kg dose infusions depending on the&#xD;
      treamtent response. Treatment response is defined as a decrease in inflammation by at least 2&#xD;
      steps on the scale of grades 0-4 , or a decrease to 0 assessed at week 14. A combination of&#xD;
      thse two dose infusions (5 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg) will be given for the remainder of the study&#xD;
      according to set schedules. The primary outcome will be the ability to control active&#xD;
      scleritis defined as at least a 2-step decrease in sleral inflammation,scleritis within 14&#xD;
      weeks of initiating infliximab therapy. Secondary outcomes will be the amount of reduction in&#xD;
      concomitant immunosuppressive medication (measured using the grading scale in Section 4.5.2),&#xD;
      changes in pain, redness (measured using a visual analogue scale), photophobia, changes in&#xD;
      visual acuity (changes of 10 letters from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity will be&#xD;
      considered clinically significant), the typical time between flares, and numbers of flares&#xD;
      and times between flares while in the study.&#xD;
