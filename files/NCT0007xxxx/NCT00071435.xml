      This study will examine whether the motor cortex (the part of the brain that controls&#xD;
      movement) works properly in patients with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a disorder in&#xD;
      which voluntary movements are very slow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 40 and 75 years of age and patients with ascending PLS (a subset&#xD;
      of PLS) may be eligible for this study. Patients with ascending PLS have a slowing of&#xD;
      finger-tapping movements that corresponds to a particular abnormality of certain neuronal&#xD;
      (nerve cell) activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants perform a finger-tapping reaction time exercise while brain wave activity&#xD;
      (electroencephalography, or EEG) and muscle activity (electroymogram, or EMG) are measured.&#xD;
      The subject is seated in front of a computer screen. A signal appears on the screen and the&#xD;
      subject taps a key as quickly as possible in response to the signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the EEG, brain activity is recorded by placing electrodes (small metal discs) on the&#xD;
      scalp with an electrode cap or glue-like substance. A conductive gel is used to fill the&#xD;
      space between the electrodes and the scalp to make sure there is good contact between them.&#xD;
      The brain waves are recorded while the subject taps his or her fingers very slowly. For the&#xD;
      surface EMG, electrodes filled with a conductive gel are taped to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants also undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a strong magnetic&#xD;
      field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain. During the procedure, the subject lies&#xD;
      still on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner - a narrow metal cylinder. Scanning&#xD;
      time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes.&#xD;
      Subjects can communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan and can ask to be&#xD;
      moved out of the machine at any time.&#xD;

      Objective: Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) is a clinical syndrome of progressive spasticity.&#xD;
      Patients with PLS have slow voluntary movements. In PLS, degeneration of corticospinal tracts&#xD;
      disrupts the communication between the motor cortex and motor neurons. Normally, voluntary&#xD;
      movements are preceded by EEG waveform changes that begin before the movement occurs. These&#xD;
      waveforms are called movement related cortical potentials (MRCPs). The first part of the MRCP&#xD;
      represents neural activity in the motor cortex. The goal of this study is to determine&#xD;
      whether the motor cortex and pre-motor cortex operate normally to generate these intrinsic&#xD;
      signals for voluntary movement in patients with PLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with PLS of at least 3 years duration with slow finger tapping&#xD;
      movements will be studied. Patients must fulfill the clinical criteria for the ascending&#xD;
      subtype of PLS. They must also have a loss of corticospinal excitability as measured by&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation. Age matched normal volunteers will be studied as a control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Patients and normal volunteers will undergo a session of EEG recording while making&#xD;
      slow finger tapping movements. They will have an MRI of the brain, for the purpose of&#xD;
      localizing dipole positions of the MRCP components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters: The peak amplitudes of components of the MRCPs will be compared between&#xD;
      patients and a healthy control group as the primary outcome measure. Localization of the&#xD;
      dipoles of the components is a secondary outcome measure.&#xD;
