      This study will test a spinal cord reflex called reciprocal inhibition before, during, and&#xD;
      after learning a motor skill to see if the reflex becomes stronger by learning the movement.&#xD;
      People learn new motor skills throughout their lives. At first, performing a new skilled&#xD;
      movement such as riding a bicycle takes effort and is clumsy, but with practice, it becomes&#xD;
      relatively automatic. The motor cortex (a part of the brain) is very active when a new&#xD;
      skilled movement is learned, but becomes less active when the movement is over-learned. This&#xD;
      study will determine whether the spinal cord helps coordinate the pattern of activity between&#xD;
      groups of muscles once a motor skill is learned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      are screened with a medical history and neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are divided into two groups. Group 1 has movement training sessions only and&#xD;
      Group 2 has both movement training sessions and physiology sessions, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement training sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 15 minutes every weekday, participants practice moving their wrist back and forth to make&#xD;
      a cursor on the computer screen follow a target. Activity of the arm muscles is monitored&#xD;
      with surface electrodes taped to the skin. The sessions continue until the participant can&#xD;
      perform the movement well. Group 1 participants return to the clinic a week after the last&#xD;
      session to perform the movement again to see if their skill level has changed. Each session&#xD;
      lasts about 20 to 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiology sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      In three separate sessions, the reflex for reciprocal inhibition is measured before and at&#xD;
      several times during the movement task. This is done with nerve conduction studies. A probe&#xD;
      placed on the skin delivers a low-intensity electrical stimulus. Wires taped to the skin&#xD;
      record the nerve impulses. To measure reciprocal inhibition, several dozen stimuli are given&#xD;
      to two nerves in combinations. Each session lasts 2 to 3 hours.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a skilled movement is thoroughly learned, it can be performed relatively automatically.&#xD;
      The motor cortex is active when learning a new motor skill, but becomes less activated once&#xD;
      the skill has become over-learned. We hypothesize that learning a skilled movement is&#xD;
      associated with more efficient use of subcortical motor circuits. Subcortical motor circuits&#xD;
      can coordinate features of the intended movement such as the timing and patterns of&#xD;
      activation of different muscles. The goal of this study is to determine whether learning a&#xD;
      motor skill strengthens spinal interneuron circuits that facilitate the movement. Subjects&#xD;
      will learn to perform a movement consisting of alternating wrist movements. The strength of&#xD;
      reciprocal inhibition between antagonist muscles will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      22 healthy adult volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two experiments. Both experiments use a within-subjects design. The purpose of&#xD;
      the first experiment is to determine whether learning to accurately perform an alternating&#xD;
      wrist flexion and extension movement task is associated with reduced co-contraction of wrist&#xD;
      flexor and extensor muscles. Subjects will practice making accurate wrist flexions and&#xD;
      extensions to keep a cursor on a target for fifteen-minute sessions every weekday until they&#xD;
      are able to obtain 95% accuracy. Activity of the arm muscles will be monitored during the&#xD;
      sessions with surface electrodes on the arm muscles. The first experiment will also determine&#xD;
      the best training parameters for learning the task. In the second experiment, a second group&#xD;
      of subjects will learn the task using the best training parameters. The strength of the&#xD;
      reflex for reciprocal inhibition will be measured before, during and after training.&#xD;
      Reciprocal inhibition will also be measured after the movement has become highly learned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first experiment, the outcome will be the percent of movement time in which&#xD;
      co-contraction occurs, as recorded from surface electrodes, while the subject learns to&#xD;
      perform the movement to 95% accuracy. In the second experiment, the outcome measure is the&#xD;
      strength of spinally mediated reciprocal inhibition, as measured using reflexes.&#xD;
