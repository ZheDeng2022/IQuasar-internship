  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The&#xD;
      primary objectives of this study are to examine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      intravenous MCC-135 in limiting final infarct size, as measured by single photon emission&#xD;
      computed tomography (SPECT), in patients who require percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)&#xD;
      for a first-documented ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (AMI).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be male or female aged 18 years and older who present to the emergency room&#xD;
      (ER) &lt; 6 hours from onset of AMI symptoms. The AMI must be confirmed by a 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and documented in at least 2 leads. Each potential patient must be a&#xD;
      candidate for primary PCI and not have thrombolytic therapy planned. To be eligible, patients&#xD;
      must not have a prior history of ST-segment elevation MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups: A, B, and C. Group A&#xD;
      will receive MCC-135 4.5 mg/kg/48 hours; Group B will receive MCC-135 9.0 mg/kg/48 hours; and&#xD;
      Group C will receive placebo/48 hours. Three hundred thirty patients with a TIMI flow grade&#xD;
      of 0/1 are required to complete the study. Because patients will be enrolled and will receive&#xD;
      study medication prior to assessment of TIMI flow, it is expected that at least 414 patients&#xD;
      may need to be randomized in order to obtain the required 330 qualified patients. All&#xD;
      randomized patients will receive 48 hours of study medication, with ongoing assessments&#xD;
      during this period, and will have follow-up assessments on Days 3, 4, 5, 30, and 180 as&#xD;
      described below, regardless of preoperative TIMI flow grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following initial physical examination, vital signs, establishment of a separate and&#xD;
      dedicated IV access, baseline blood sampling, and confirmation of all study eligibility&#xD;
      requirements, patients will be randomized and begin receiving study drug as an adjunct to&#xD;
      standard therapy. Patients will begin study drug infusion as soon as possible, but &lt; 6 hours&#xD;
      following onset of AMI symptoms (i.e., symptoms of myocardial ischemia). Examples of ischemic&#xD;
      symptoms include chest, arm, and/or jaw pain, shortness of breath, nausea, diaphoresis, or&#xD;
      other symptoms that the investigator considers to be of ischemic origin. A negative result&#xD;
      from a urine pregnancy test must be obtained for females of childbearing potential prior to&#xD;
      the start of study drug infusion.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent must be obtained from the patient (or, in accordance with&#xD;
             state and federal laws and IRB regulations, emergency consent procedures may be&#xD;
             employed) before enrollment into the study.&#xD;

          2. The patient is a male or female at least 18 years of age.&#xD;

          5. The patient has symptoms of ischemia of at least 20 minutes continuous duration, the&#xD;
             onset of which occurred &lt; 6 hours prior to study drug infusion. Examples of ischemic&#xD;
             symptoms include chest, arm, and/or jaw pain, shortness of breath, nausea,&#xD;
             diaphoresis, or other symptoms that the investigator considers to be of ischemic&#xD;
