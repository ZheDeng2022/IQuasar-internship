    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is a disorder of major public health importance, accounting for the&#xD;
      majority of visual loss among working age Americans. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a&#xD;
      manifestation of diabetic retinopathy that produces loss of central vision. Data from the&#xD;
      Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) estimate that after 15 years of&#xD;
      known diabetes, the prevalence of diabetic macular edema is approximately 20 percent in&#xD;
      patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), 25 in patients with type 2 DM who are taking&#xD;
      insulin, and 14 percent in patients with type 2 DM who do not take insulin. The Early&#xD;
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) showed that moderate vision loss, defined as a&#xD;
      doubling of the visual angle (e.g., 20/20 reduced to 20/40), can be reduced by 50 percent or&#xD;
      more by focal/grid laser photocoagulation according to ETDRS protocol. Although several&#xD;
      treatment modalities are currently under investigation, the only demonstrated means to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of vision loss from diabetic macular edema are ETDRS laser photocoagulation, as&#xD;
      demonstrated by the ETDRS, and intensive glycemic control, as demonstrated by the Diabetes&#xD;
      Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study&#xD;
      (UKPDS). In the DCCT, intensive glucose control reduced the risk of onset of diabetic macular&#xD;
      edema by 23 percent compared with conventional treatment. Long-term follow-up of patients in&#xD;
      the DCCT show a sustained effect of intensive glucose control, with a 58 percent risk&#xD;
      reduction in the development of diabetic macular edema for the DCCT patients followed in the&#xD;
      Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, the study protocol involves the enrollment of patients &gt;18 years of age who have&#xD;
      DME involving or threatening the center of the macula and who have not had prior focal/grid&#xD;
      laser photocoagulation for DME. These are patients for whom the standard of care would be to&#xD;
      treat with laser photocoagulation. Eligible eyes will be randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      the modified-ETDRS technique or the mild macular grid (MMG) technique. Outcome assessments&#xD;
      will include Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), fundus photography, fluorescein angiography&#xD;
      and standardized best-corrected visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two phases: Phase 1 (the primary study), which consists of the first 12&#xD;
      months of follow up, during which a structured protocol is followed; and Phase 2, which&#xD;
      consists of the second and third years of follow up, during which the management of DME can&#xD;
      include techniques other than laser photocoagulation, at discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 1, follow-up visits will occur at 15 weeks (3.5 months) +14 days, 34 weeks (8&#xD;
      months) + 28 days, and 52 weeks (12 months) + 28 days. The primary outcome for phase 1 is at&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objectives of Phase 1 include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop standardized study procedures for future DME studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain outcome data (e.g. changes in retinal thickness, area of retinal thickening, area&#xD;
           of hard exudate, need for retreatment, onset of new areas of DME and changes in visual&#xD;
           acuity) following use of the modified-ETDRS photocoagulation technique for patients with&#xD;
           DME and various levels of retinopathy severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect pilot data using the MMG technique to determine whether a subsequent large scale&#xD;
           definitive trial should be conducted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (2nd and 3rd years of follow up) is being conducted to collect data on, and generate&#xD;
      hypotheses from, the long-term outcome of DME, irrespective of treatment received. Protocol&#xD;
      visits will occur at 2 years + 8 weeks and 3 years + 8 weeks. During this phase of the study,&#xD;
      therapies other than laser photocoagulation may be used to treat DME at the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion. Because treatment other than photocoagulation will be allowed after one year,&#xD;
      'pure' results regarding outcomes with each laser technique cannot be obtained in all groups,&#xD;
      but will be available in a subset of patients. The data are being collected at relatively low&#xD;
      cost and no risk over and above usual care. Therefore, the collection of potentially&#xD;
      hypothesis-generating data from exploratory analysis is justified and could be important in&#xD;
      designing future studies. Interpretation of the results of the above analyses will be&#xD;
      complicated by the lack of a standardized protocol with regard to which patients receive&#xD;
      treatment and what treatment is provided. Therefore, the results will be interpreted with&#xD;
      caution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 data collection may be useful for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of retreatment rates in patients who responded to laser such that no&#xD;
           additional treatment was required at 12 months. This is a long term analysis on a &quot;pure&quot;&#xD;
           group of patients and will provide important information on the DME recurrence rate and&#xD;
           need for retreatment in study eyes of those patients whose DME improved with either of&#xD;
           the two protocol-specified treatments received in Phase 1 such that further treatment&#xD;
           was not necessary at the 12-month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide long-term safety data for MMG. This is important due to the less well studied&#xD;
           nature of MMG, especially over the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide long-term outcome data on current standard treatment (modified ETDRS laser) in&#xD;
           today's patient populations to assist in powering future studies that will require at&#xD;
           least 3 years of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide data on outcome of intravitreal steroids in patients in whom laser treatment is&#xD;
           not successful. For many patients who still have DME at 12 months, it is anticipated&#xD;
           that intravitreal steroids will be administered. The continued follow up of these&#xD;
           patients will provide an opportunity to explore the effect of the steroids on retinal&#xD;
           thickness and visual acuity.&#xD;
