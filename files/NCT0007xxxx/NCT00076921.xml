      To characterize the development of tobacco control capacity with staff from the Chinese&#xD;
      Center's for Disease control (CDCs) at the provincial level and to have them develop and&#xD;
      implement population-level interventions to build awareness and knowledge concerning the&#xD;
      harms of smoking that could help lead to policy action being taken to protect the population&#xD;
      from the harms caused by smoking. Compare capacity, policy and, second-hand smoke exposure&#xD;
      and smoking rates in selected provinces to national levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      China is a particularly critical country for global tobacco control. It has the world's&#xD;
      largest number of smokers, approximately 350 million, and the immense market afforded by the&#xD;
      60 percent of men who smoke and the 95 percent of women who do not smoke represents a prize&#xD;
      target for the multinational tobacco companies. China has ratified the Framework Convention&#xD;
      for Tobacco Control (FCTC) and now needs to implement its provisions across a large and&#xD;
      diverse population. In this application, we propose a program of evidence-based community&#xD;
      interventions to be implemented at the province and local levels with the overall objective&#xD;
      of developing an approach for implementation nationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application builds on a long-standing partnership between the Chinese Center for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention (China CDC), the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) and the Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That partnership began in 1995 with an agreement&#xD;
      to collaborate on the conduct of China's 1996 national smoking survey. Our principal&#xD;
      collaborator over those years, Dr. Gong-Huan Yang, is now Deputy Director of the China CDC&#xD;
      and responsible for tobacco control at the national level. In the four years of funding to&#xD;
      date from the Fogarty International Center (FIC), we have carried out a project in selected&#xD;
      communities in three provinces, including urban and rural areas that provide a foundation for&#xD;
      the intervention approach in this proposal. Specifically, we have carried out quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative studies to assess barriers to tobacco control and readiness for&#xD;
      interventions, measured levels of airborne nicotine in key public environments, and developed&#xD;
      capacity-building approaches. Our original FIC supported study involved three countries,&#xD;
      China, Mexico and Brazil. However, this application will focus solely on China, as the latter&#xD;
      two countries developed the necessary infrastructure and capacity to conduct research,&#xD;
      publish their research findings, and seek further grants and government funding to sustain&#xD;
      progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application proposes a tobacco control study that will involve 7 provinces in a CDC-led&#xD;
      initiative to develop a systematic mix of approaches. The plan uses strategies based on&#xD;
      experiences from our work in China and from the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study for&#xD;
      Cancer Prevention (ASSIST) and anticipates barriers that have been identified in the data&#xD;
      collected to date. In the intervention provinces, the China CDC will team with the&#xD;
      provincial-level CDCs to assess capacity for tobacco control and the current status of&#xD;
      tobacco control, using an adapted version of the Strength of Tobacco Control (SOTC) index&#xD;
      developed for evaluating ASSIST. This systematic characterization will highlight capacity&#xD;
      needs. An extensive capacity development program, based in distance-based methods, will be&#xD;
      used. We have the overall objective of preparing the China CDC to implement a proven approach&#xD;
      to tobacco control at the national level. A household survey will be conducted and compared&#xD;
      to the national survey results. Second-hand smoking will be assessed in selected locations in&#xD;
      the 7 provinces.&#xD;
