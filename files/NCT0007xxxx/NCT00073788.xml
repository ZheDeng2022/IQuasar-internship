      To evaluate Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      American Indians.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a unique psychiatric condition characterized by a&#xD;
      persistent maladaptive reaction resulting from exposure to a stressful traumatic event(s). In&#xD;
      the United States general population PTSD has a lifetime prevalence of 5 percent in men and&#xD;
      10 percent in women. PTSD is known to produce alternations in the central and autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system and hormonal dysregulation. However, little is known about the long-term&#xD;
      consequences of PTSD on the cardiovascular system. PTSD is a common disorder among&#xD;
      reservation dwelling American Indians with a life-time prevalence of 12 percent in men and 23&#xD;
      percent in women. Similarly, cardiovascular disease (CVD), has emerged as a major health&#xD;
      problem in American Indians during the past decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study examines the relationship between PTSD and cardiac function in a population-based&#xD;
      sample of American Indians. The technical aims of this study involve: 1) the identification&#xD;
      of American Indian men and women ages 18-52 who have a lifetime history of PTSD and are free&#xD;
      from overt CVD; 2) the selection of an age-, sex-, and tribe-matched comparison group of&#xD;
      American Indians who have no history of PTSD and are free from known CVD; 3) a comprehensive&#xD;
      lifestyle and clinical evaluation of the PTSD and non-PTSD groups to assess CVD risk factors&#xD;
      such as smoking, exercise, obesity, blood pressure, concentrations of blood lipids, and&#xD;
      inflammatory and thrombogenic factors; and 4) a set of non-invasive tests of subclinical CVD&#xD;
      and other measures of CVD risk. These tests include positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion imaging to examine coronary flow reserve, high-resolution ultrasound of&#xD;
      the carotid arteries to measure carotid intima-media thickness, high-resolution ultrasound of&#xD;
      the brachial artery to determine flow-mediated vasodilation, and ambulatory&#xD;
      electrocardiographic monitoring, to assess heart rate variability (HRV). With these data, the&#xD;
      study addresses the specific aims, which are: 1) to determine whether individuals with PTSD,&#xD;
      compared with those without PTSD, show greater evidence of subclinical CVD, including a lower&#xD;
      coronary flow reserve, increased carotid intimamedia thickness, and reduced forearm&#xD;
      flow-mediated vasodilation; 2) to ascertain whether HRV is lower in individuals with PTSD&#xD;
      compared to those without PTSD; and 3) to investigate the role of lifestyle (e.g., smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol use, exercise, obesity), cultural (e.g., acculturation, religiosity), and biological&#xD;
      (e.g., blood pressure, blood lipid and glucose concentrations) mediators in the relationship&#xD;
      of PTSD with coronary flow reserve and HRV.&#xD;
