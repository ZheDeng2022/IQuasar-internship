  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the impact of CoQ10 and GPI 1485 on the progression of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, in order to determine whether it is reasonable to proceed with further&#xD;
      study of either of these agents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) affects nearly a million Americans, a number that will increase over&#xD;
      the coming decades as the population ages. While available medical therapies are usually&#xD;
      effective for controlling symptoms in the initial years following diagnosis, higher doses of&#xD;
      multiple agents are required over time, with increasing side effects and incomplete control&#xD;
      of symptoms. Although these treatments can dramatically improve the lives of patients with PD&#xD;
      initially, they do not address the underlying causes of the disease or the inevitable disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial will involve 42 trial centers in the United&#xD;
      States and Canada, and enroll 195 people with PD. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      neuroprotection trial is to identify agents capable of slowing the progression of PD. In the&#xD;
      trial, investigators will assess the impact of CoQ10, an antioxidant, and GPI 1485, a novel&#xD;
      immunophilin compound, on the progression of PD and determine if it is futile or non-futile&#xD;
      to proceed with further study of these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, subjects with early, untreated PD will be equally randomized into one of the&#xD;
      three study arms: 1.) the group that receives active CoQ10 and placebo instead of GPI 1485;&#xD;
      2.) the group that receives active GPI 1485 and placebo instead of CoQ10; or 3.) the group&#xD;
      that receives placebo instead of CoQ10 and GPI 1485. Subjects will remain on the blinded&#xD;
      study drug for 12 months.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women with idiopathic PD of less than 5 years duration from diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis must be confirmed by bradykinesia plus one of the other cardinal signs&#xD;
             (resting tremor, rigidity) being present, without any other known or suspected cause&#xD;
             of parkinsonism. The clinical signs must be asymmetric.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not require any therapy (including levodopa, dopamine agonists,&#xD;
             anticholinergics, amantadine, or selegiline) to treat symptoms of PD at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment. Subjects may have had prior exposure to any one of these agents, but&#xD;
             exposure with any agent may not have been longer than 60 days in duration and subjects&#xD;
             must not have been on any of these agents within 90 days prior to baseline. Once a&#xD;
             subject needs dopaminergic treatment, these medications may be added as part of best&#xD;
             medical management. The subject will still remain in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile must use a medically accepted&#xD;
             contraceptive regimen for at least 60 days before the baseline visit, and agree to&#xD;
             continue such use throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days after the final&#xD;
             dose of study drug. Reliable forms of contraception include oral, implanted, or&#xD;
             injected contraceptives; intrauterine devices in place for at least 3 months; or&#xD;
             adequate barrier methods in conjunction with spermicide (abstinence is considered an&#xD;
             acceptable contraceptive regimen). Women must have a pregnancy test unless they are at&#xD;
             least 2 years postmenopausal or surgically sterile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any of the following drugs within 180 days prior to baseline: neuroleptics,&#xD;
             metoclopramide, alpha-methyldopa, clozapine, olanzepine, and flunarizine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any of the following drugs within 90 days prior to baseline: methylphenidate,&#xD;
             cinnarizine, reserpine, amphetamine, or MAO-A inhibitors (pargyline, phenelzine, and&#xD;
             tranylcypromine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of atypical Parkinson's syndromes due to drugs (e.g., metoclopramide,&#xD;
             flunarazine), metabolic identified neurogenetic disorders (e.g., Wilson's disease),&#xD;
             encephalitis, or other degenerative diseases (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of CoQ10 or GPI 1485 90 days prior to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of minocycline or creatine 90 days prior to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of other investigational drugs within 90 days prior to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of freezing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impairment of postural reflexes (pull test score &gt; 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant medical condition (e.g., active GI illness, angina, active&#xD;
             neoplasm) or laboratory abnormality, which would in the judgment of the investigator&#xD;
             interfere with the subjects ability to participate in the study or to be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stereotaxic brain surgery for PD (e.g., pallidotomy, deep brain&#xD;
             stimulation, fetal tissue implantation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant structural brain disease that the investigator believes would&#xD;
             interfere with study evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant psychiatric disorders that may interfere with complying with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of known hypersensitivity or intolerability to CoQ10 or GPI 1485.&#xD;
