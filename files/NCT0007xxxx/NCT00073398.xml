    <textblock>
      This 2-phase study will determine the safety of treating patients with non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer with the genetically engineered HyperAcute-Lung cancer vaccine. It will establish the&#xD;
      proper vaccine dose and will examine side effects and potential benefits of the treatment.&#xD;
      The vaccine contains killed lung cancer cells containing a mouse gene that causes the&#xD;
      production of a foreign pattern of protein-sugars on the cell surface. It is hoped that the&#xD;
      immune response to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the&#xD;
      patient's own cancer cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern, causing the&#xD;
      tumor to remain stable or shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older with non-small cell lung cancer that has recurred or no&#xD;
      longer responds to standard treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be&#xD;
      screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, chest&#xD;
      x-rays, and lung function testing. CT, MRI, PET, and ultrasound scans of the chest may be&#xD;
      obtained if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive four vaccinations a month apart from each other. The vaccines will&#xD;
      be injected under the skin, similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase I of&#xD;
      the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the vaccine&#xD;
      cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase II will&#xD;
      look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be safe in&#xD;
      Phase I. Weekly blood samples will be drawn during the 4 months of vaccine treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 2 months for the first year after&#xD;
      vaccination and then every 3 months for the next 2 years for the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays and various scans (nuclear medicine/CT/MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FACT-L Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the patient's&#xD;
           general well-being. The questionnaire is administered before beginning treatment, before&#xD;
           each vaccination, and during follow-up visits after completing the treatment. It&#xD;
           includes questions on the severity of lung cancer symptoms and the ability to perform&#xD;
           normal activities of daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above procedures, 3 skin punch biopsies will be done at the vaccination&#xD;
      site to look for a local immune response. For this procedure, an area of skin is numbed with&#xD;
      an anesthetic and a 4 mm (about 1/4-inch) circular area is removed, using a sharp cookie&#xD;
      cutter-type instrument. Also, one blood sample per year will be collected for the next 15&#xD;
      years to monitor the safety of the gene transfer. Patients whose lung cancer spreads to the&#xD;
      skin, superficial soft tissues, or a superficial lymph node may be asked to undergo a biopsy&#xD;
      of the lesion to see what effect the treatment may be having on the tumor.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death with an estimated 174,400 new&#xD;
           cases and 162,400 deaths each year in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite attempts at early diagnosis and the development of new therapeutic agents, there&#xD;
           has been only limited improvement in the outcome for patients with advanced lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A enzyme called alpha(1,3)galactosyltranferase (alphaGT) that is not found in humans can&#xD;
           transfer sugars on to proteins in human cells that can make them highly immunogenic and&#xD;
           cause them to be rejected by the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antitumor vaccination using killed donor human lung cancer cells expressing alphaGT may&#xD;
           stimulate immune responses in patients against their own lung cancer because their lung&#xD;
           cancer may share antigens with the vaccine cells that have been made more immunogenic by&#xD;
           expression of alphaGT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the tumor response rate of anti-tumor vaccination using irradiated allogeneic&#xD;
           lung cancer cell lines genetically engineered to express the murine&#xD;
           alpha(1,3)galactosyltransferase enzyme in patients with advanced, recurrent or&#xD;
           refractory non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunological response of patients with lung cancer undergoing antitumor&#xD;
           vaccination with irradiated allogeneic lung cancer cell lines genetically engineered to&#xD;
           express murine alpha(1,3)galactosyltransferase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the survival distribution as well as the duration of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-small cell lung cancer (Adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell&#xD;
           anaplastic carcinoma and bronchoalveolar carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage IV, recurrent or treatment refractory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No exclusion for prior therapy. Prior therapy may include surgery, radiation,&#xD;
           immunotherapy, and chemotherapy regimens. EGFR inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies are&#xD;
           included as chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a granulocyte count of greater than or equal to 1000/microL,&#xD;
           platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL, hemoglobin greater than 10.0 gm/dL,&#xD;
           albumin greater than or equal to 3.0 gm/dL and acceptable hepatic and renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design (Phase II):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be intradermally vaccinated with 300 million&#xD;
           alpha(1,3)galactosyltranferase-expressing vaccine cells every 2-weeks to complete a&#xD;
           total of eight vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be monitored for tumor and immunological responses and safety.&#xD;
