  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease Type II) is caused by a deficiency of a&#xD;
      critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the&#xD;
      body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures&#xD;
      called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates&#xD;
      and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their&#xD;
      normal function. The objective of this protocol is to provide enzyme replacement therapy with&#xD;
      alglucosidase alfa on an expanded access basis, to severely affected patients with late-onset&#xD;
      Pompe disease for whom there is no alternative treatment and who do not meet the clinical&#xD;
      characteristics described in the inclusion criteria for participation in other Genzyme&#xD;
      Corporation-sponsored studies currently enrolling patients with late-onset Pompe disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient or the patient's legal guardian(s) must provide written informed consent&#xD;
             prior to any study-related procedures being performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has/had onset of symptoms compatible with Pompe disease after 12 months of&#xD;
             age. Age at onset of symptoms must be documented in the patient's medical record(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has documented GAA deficiency consistent with a diagnosis of Pompe&#xD;
             disease, or the patient has a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease by documented&#xD;
             genotype. Tissues used for determination of GAA deficiency may include blood, muscle&#xD;
             or skin fibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have the following conditions: a. The patient must be wheelchair&#xD;
             bound (unable to ambulate with the use of assistive devices, such as walker, cane, or&#xD;
             crutches) AND b. The patient requires the use of invasive ventilation (defined as the&#xD;
             use of any form of ventilatory support applied through an endotracheal tube).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test prior to dosing each month. In addition, all female patients of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must use a medically accepted method of contraception throughout the&#xD;
             program. Male patients who are sexually active must use a barrier method of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational product within 30 days prior to program enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major congenital abnormality;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant organic disease (with the exception of symptoms relating to&#xD;
             late-onset Pompe disease), including clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic,&#xD;
             pulmonary, neurologic, or renal disease, or other medical condition, serious&#xD;
             intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would preclude participation in the study or potentially decrease&#xD;
             survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient meets the clinical characteristics described in the inclusion criteria for&#xD;
             participation in other Genzyme Corporation-sponsored treatment study currently&#xD;
             enrolling patients with late-onset Pompe disease.&#xD;
