  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Valproic acid is a medication that is currently used in the prevention of seizures, bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, and migraine headaches. Researchers hope that it may improve the effects of&#xD;
      decitabine. Decitabine is a chemotherapy drug with known activity in leukemia and&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown synergy between demethylating agents and histone deacetylase&#xD;
      inhibitors. It has been shown that both DNA methylation and histone deacetylation work&#xD;
      together in affecting gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, drugs that inhibit DNA methylation and those that inhibit histone deacetylase can&#xD;
      reactivate silenced genes in combination better than they can individually. Decitabine (5&#xD;
      aza-2'deoxycytidine), a drug that produces marked DNA hypomethylator, has demonstrated&#xD;
      antileukemic activity at low doses. There are several drugs that have been shown to have&#xD;
      histone acetylase activity. One of these is valproic acid that has been used safely for many&#xD;
      years as an anti-seizure medication.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. FOR PHASE I COMPONENT OF THE STUDY: Patients with refractory or relapsed: acute&#xD;
             myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and myelodysplastic&#xD;
             syndrome (MDS) are eligible. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are&#xD;
             eligible if fludarabine based therapy has failed. Patients with chronic myeloid&#xD;
             leukemia (CML) are eligible if they have documented hematologic resistance to imatinib&#xD;
             mesylate or have not achieved or lost any cytogenetic response to imatinib mesylate&#xD;
             after 12 months of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Untreated patients older than 60 years of age with AML or MDS who refuse or are not&#xD;
             eligible for frontline chemotherapy, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Performance status of =/&lt; 2 by the ECOG scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Signed informed consent indicating that patients are aware of the investigational&#xD;
             nature of this study in keeping with the policies of UTMDACC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age &gt; 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have been off chemotherapy for 2 weeks prior to entering this study and&#xD;
             recovered from the toxic effects of that therapy, unless there is evidence of rapidly&#xD;
             progressive disease. Use of hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative&#xD;
             disease is allowed for the first two weeks on therapy. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) and&#xD;
             anagrelide must also be stopped 2 weeks prior to entering this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate liver function (bilirubin of &lt; 2mg%, SGPT &lt; 3 x ULN) and renal function&#xD;
             (creatinine &lt; 2mg%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of childbearing potential must practice contraception. Men and women must&#xD;
             continue birth control for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. INCLUSION OF PHASE II PORTION OF THE STUDY: As in the phase I portion but only&#xD;
             patients with AML or high-risk MDS (blasts &gt; or = 10%), including untreated patients&#xD;
             older than 60 years of age with AML or MDS who refuse or are not eligible for&#xD;
             frontline chemotherapy, will be eligible in this portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             or a family history of ornithine transcarbamylase disorder are excluded from this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive&#xD;
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, pancreatitis, psychiatric illness that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with history of hepatitis B, C, alcoholic liver disease or evidence of&#xD;
             hepatopathy will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients already receiving valproic acid or receiving other anticonvulsivants will be&#xD;
