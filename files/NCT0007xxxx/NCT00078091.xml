      This study will evaluate patients with a rare inherited condition called Bardet-Biedl&#xD;
      syndrome . The purpose of the study is to learn more about the genetics and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of this disorder. Patients may have the following problems: polydactyly&#xD;
      (extra fingers and toes); retinal dystrophy (changes in the retina that may lead to vision&#xD;
      problems, including blindness); obesity and diabetes (overweight and high blood sugar due to&#xD;
      failure of body organs to respond to insulin); cognitive dysfunction (difficulties with&#xD;
      learning and understanding); hypogenitalism (decreased functioning of the ovaries in women&#xD;
      and the testes in men); kidney anomalies (changes in the structure or function of the&#xD;
      kidneys); heart disease; and hepatic fibrosis (liver disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome may be eligible for this study. First-degree relatives&#xD;
      will also be enrolled for certain tests and procedures. Candidates are screened with a review&#xD;
      of their medical records, laboratory tests, and x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this study undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and family history and physical examination, including body measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to evaluation kidney, liver, heart, and hormonal function, and for genetic&#xD;
           studies and other research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual emission x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to measure the amount of total body fat.&#xD;
           For this test, the subject lies on a table for scanning with low-dose X-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomography (in adults) of the abdomen to measure abdominal fat. CT uses a small&#xD;
           amount of radiation to obtain images of internal body structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (in children) of the abdomen to measure abdominal fat. MRI&#xD;
           uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of internal body structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance tests to measure blood glucose and insulin levels. For this test,&#xD;
           the patient drinks a glucose (sugar) solution. Blood samples are drawn through an IV&#xD;
           catheter before the test begins and at 1, 2, and 3 hours after drinking the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete eye examination to look for retinal changes and to assess vision, and, if&#xD;
           medically needed, an examination of the ear, nose, and throat to check for hearing and&#xD;
           breathing abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of learning ability in patients over 5 years of age. For younger patients, a&#xD;
           parent is asked about the child's development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound study of the ovaries and uterus in females and of the testes in males.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs of the face, hands, feet, body, and genitalia, if the patient agrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meeting with investigators and a genetic counselor for review of test findings when the&#xD;
           studies are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relatives of patients have a complete medical and family history and physical examination.&#xD;
      Blood is drawn for assessment of kidney, liver, heart, and hormonal function and for genetic&#xD;
      study and other research purposes. Relatives over 5 years of age may have tests of learning&#xD;
      ability and cognition. For younger patients, a parent is asked about the child's development.&#xD;
      Relatives meet with investigators and a genetic counselor for review of test findings when&#xD;
      the studies are completed.&#xD;

      Although the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS: severe obesity, polydactyly, learning disabilities,&#xD;
      retinopathy, renal disease and cardiac malformations) was described more than 80 years ago,&#xD;
      it is only over the past few years that extensive data on the natural history and molecular&#xD;
      pathogenesis of this complex disorder have been reported. We now know that BBS can be caused&#xD;
      by mutations in at least 12, genes and, although it is typically inherited in an autosomal&#xD;
      recessive pattern, BBS may occasionally exhibit more complex inheritance. In this study, we&#xD;
      are defining the physical (body mass, percent and distribution of body fat) and metabolic&#xD;
      (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, serum levels of lipids and adipokines) characteristics of&#xD;
      glucose and fat metabolism in a cohort of adult and pediatric patients with BBS. We are also&#xD;
      characterizing the hypogenitalism in BBS, and attempting to determine its relationship, if&#xD;
      any, to the incidence of obesity in BBS. In addition, we are studying the retinal dystrophy,&#xD;
      the renal dysfunction, and the nature of the reported mental retardation/learning disability&#xD;
      that is found in many patients. We plan to correlate the phenotypic manifestations in our&#xD;
      subjects with the results of our mutation analysis studies. Our objective is to learn more&#xD;
      about the genetic alterations that may underlie the obesity and associated organ dysfunction&#xD;
      that characterizes BBS.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We are using the previously published clinical diagnostic criteria for BBS(21) to determine&#xD;
        study eligibility of probands. As outlined in that report, we are including patients who&#xD;
        present with four of the five primary features or three primary features and two secondary&#xD;
        features. Parents are also enrolled for genetic studies. We are not enrolling unaffected&#xD;
        siblings or recruiting control subjects, instead, results of testing are being compared to&#xD;
        previously published data obtained from appropriate non-BBS control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The initial determination of eligibility is made by review of prior clinical records. Some&#xD;
        patients are not characterized in sufficient detail to know if the person meets the&#xD;
        clinical criteria, yet we may suspect the diagnosis. In those cases, the subjects are&#xD;
        brought to NIH and undergo clinically appropriate testing to make the diagnosis. If that&#xD;
        clinical testing does not confirm the diagnosis, the patient or parents are given&#xD;
        appropriate clinical counseling and returned to the care of their personal physician. If&#xD;
        features later develop that allow the diagnosis to be made, they may re-enroll and undergo&#xD;
        further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Our study population includes patients of all ages and ethnic groups, and both genders. The&#xD;
        inclusion of children is essential to a research study that is correlating genotype with&#xD;
        phenotype, and is attempting an early identification of metabolic abnormalities that may be&#xD;
        best treated at an early age. Many of the age-dependent manifestations of BBS develop&#xD;
        during childhood and the average age of diagnosis is 9.2 years. Pregnant women and children&#xD;
        under the age of 5 yr do not undergo invasive research procedures (i.e. phlebotomy) or&#xD;
        procedures involving ionizing radiation (i.e. X-rays or DEXA scans) unless that procedure&#xD;
        would be performed as part of standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because cognitive dysfunction is known to be a component of BBS, some patients with&#xD;
        impaired cognition and understanding may be evaluated under this protocol. If the&#xD;
        investigators believe that an adult patient may not be competent to give informed consent&#xD;
        to participate, or does not understand the consent document and the procedures of the&#xD;
        study, that patient may be excluded from participation. We may request that the patient and&#xD;
        accompanying caregiver also be interviewed by an independent ethics panel to confirm that&#xD;
        he or she is competent to give consent and to participate if the team feels this would be&#xD;
        useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neither healthy volunteers unrelated to an affected patient nor lab personnel will be&#xD;
        enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will make efforts to obtain consent from all parents/guardians of minor subjects (i.e.&#xD;
        we would not allow a single parent to consent a child when both parents have parental&#xD;
        rights). If a single parent or guardian has sole custody/legal responsibility for a child&#xD;
        (e.g., a divorce with full custody to one parent or one parent is deceased), we will accept&#xD;
        consent from one parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both mothers and fathers of children with BBS (who are also typically enrolled in our&#xD;
        protocol, as described above) are eligible to participate in the interview portion of the&#xD;
        study. We hypothesize that mothers and fathers will, as groups, have slightly different&#xD;
        experiences with coping with courtesy stigma, although a couple may have convergent&#xD;
        beliefs, coping mechanisms, and experiences. As such, we predict that we will initially&#xD;
        conduct interviews with both parents of the same proband (assuming both parents are&#xD;
        interested in participating), although we may target either mothers or fathers only&#xD;
        following interim analysis of the interview transcripts.&#xD;
