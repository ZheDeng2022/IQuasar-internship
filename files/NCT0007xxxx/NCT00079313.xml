      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of imatinib (Gleevec(Registered&#xD;
      Trademark)) in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and atypical chronic&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia (CML). These conditions cause uncontrolled growth of malignant&#xD;
      (cancerous) cells in the bone marrow that prevents the bone marrow from functioning normally&#xD;
      in producing blood cells. The cancer cells also can spill over into the blood and invade&#xD;
      other organs of the body. Imatinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for&#xD;
      treating chronic myelogenous leukemia, which has characteristics similar to atypical CML and&#xD;
      to CMML, and data from other research suggests this drug may be able to produce a remission&#xD;
      in forms of leukemia other than CML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over 18 years of age with atypical CML or CMML may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (removal of a small&#xD;
      piece of bone marrow tissue through a needle inserted into the hip bone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants take imatinib capsules once a day for 2 years. If at any time during the study&#xD;
      the patient's blood counts begin to rise, disease symptoms develop, or the disease has&#xD;
      progressed, the dose of imatinib is increased each week until the disease progression is&#xD;
      stopped. Any patient whose disease does not response to treatment after 6 weeks of increased&#xD;
      dosing and 30 days at the maximum daily dose of 800 mg is taken off the study and referred&#xD;
      for different treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are seen by their referring physician every week for the first 4 weeks of the study,&#xD;
      every other week for the next 8 weeks, and then monthly until the study is completed. At each&#xD;
      visit, blood is drawn to monitor for drug side effects and response to therapy. In addition,&#xD;
      patients come to the NIH Clinical Center every 3 months for a complete history and physical&#xD;
      examination and for a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy every 6 months to assess the effect&#xD;
      of treatment on bone marrow cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who leave the study before 2 years are followed with laboratory monitoring for 6&#xD;
      months after stopping imatinib; those who remain on the drug for the full 2 years are&#xD;
      monitored for 1 year after stopping the drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of imatinib for&#xD;
      improving blood counts in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and atypical&#xD;
      chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a number of agents have been used to treat these diseases, most patients do not&#xD;
      respond to treatment. Imatinib has been shown in clinical trials to induce high rates of&#xD;
      responses in patients with chronic phase CML. Imatinib has also been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      inducing responses in a subset of patients with CMML and atypical CML and is also effective&#xD;
      in a subset of patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), another&#xD;
      myeloproliferative disorder. Because patients with several different myeloproliferative&#xD;
      diseases have been shown to experience dramatic responses to imatinib, we would like to&#xD;
      determine what proportion of patients with atypical myeloproliferative diseases (CMML and&#xD;
      atypical CML) will respond to this agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment, a thorough clinical evaluation will be performed. A baseline bone marrow&#xD;
      will be obtained to exclude acute leukemia or lymphoma and to assess the degree and nature of&#xD;
      the myeloproliferation. In order to minimize bone marrow suppression, other myelosuppressive&#xD;
      drugs will be tapered and discontinued during the first week of therapy with imatinib.&#xD;
      Complete blood counts will be performed weekly for the first month and every other week&#xD;
      thereafter. Clinical assessments will be performed every three months to assess for continued&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
