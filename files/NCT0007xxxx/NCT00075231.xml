  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a simplified lopinavir-ritonavir based&#xD;
      therapy will continue to keep the viral load to very low levels after initial treatment with&#xD;
      a combination of Kaletra® (lopinavir/ritonavir) plus Combivir® (lamivudine/zidovudine).&#xD;
