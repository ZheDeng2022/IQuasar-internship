      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine which areas of the brain are&#xD;
      involved in performing certain cognitive tasks. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio&#xD;
      waves to produce images of body tissues and organs that provide information about structure&#xD;
      and function of tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates must be native English speakers and must be right-handed. They must have no&#xD;
      history of nervous system disease or psychiatric disorder. Candidates are screened with&#xD;
      questionnaires and a neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo functional MRI scanning. For this procedure, the subject lies on a&#xD;
      stretcher that moves into the scanner - a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic&#xD;
      field. During the scan, he or she is asked to make various decisions about whether words are&#xD;
      related or not. Two words are presented visually, separated by a variable time delay. The&#xD;
      subject reads both words, decides as quickly and accurately as possible whether the two words&#xD;
      are related or not, and indicates the answer by pressing a button. The test takes about 2&#xD;
      hours. When it is completed, the subject completes a written questionnaire concerning his or&#xD;
      her experience in the scanner.&#xD;

      Objective. The purpose of the protocol is to extend the structured event complex (SEC) model&#xD;
      developed by the principal investigator. Grafman (Grafman, 1995) proposed that action&#xD;
      sequences are represented in form of SECs in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC). An SEC is a&#xD;
      goal-oriented set of events that is sequentially structured and represents thematic&#xD;
      knowledge, morals, abstractions, concepts, social rules, event features, event boundaries,&#xD;
      and grammars. There are both temporal and semantic associative relations between&#xD;
      subcomponents of SEC knowledge. We will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of&#xD;
      different regions within the PFC in processing associative relations. We will also&#xD;
      investigate how SECs differing in psychological dimensions such as temporal duration,&#xD;
      complexity, and familiarity are represented and activated in the PFC. We will further examine&#xD;
      the temporal and semantic organization of SEC subcomponents by investigating how the goal and&#xD;
      outcome structure of event knowledge is represented and activated in the PFC. Further, we&#xD;
      will investigate how the temporal location of events within SECs are represented and&#xD;
      activated in the PFC. We will also investigate how goals and outcomes specifying the temporal&#xD;
      order and duration of SEC subcomponents are processed within the PFC. Additional objectives&#xD;
      are to (1) investigate the neural representation of human emotions and decision-making based&#xD;
      on utility estimation; (2) investigate the relationships between cognitive and neural&#xD;
      substrates of moral emotions and judgment (Moll et al., 2002a; Moll et al., 2002b) with those&#xD;
      of the SEC model developed by the principal investigator (Grafman, 1995); and (3) probe a new&#xD;
      construct of cognitive dimensions incorporating critical explanatory variables in social&#xD;
      cognition such as moral emotions and social event knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. In nineteen separate studies, healthy, normal adult volunteers will&#xD;
      participate in experiments dealing with different kinds of associative relations in SECs&#xD;
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The experiments we are conducting will employ within-subject, rapid event-related&#xD;
      fMRI designs to determine whether different types of SEC associative and other types of&#xD;
      relations are stored in dissociable networks in the PFC. In nineteen experiments; we hope to&#xD;
      automatically activate lexical, event-based and temporally-based associative and other types&#xD;
      of relations in SECs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures. The data collected will consist of accuracy and response time measures of&#xD;
      cognitive performance reflecting automatic priming of associative relations and fMRI&#xD;
      activation images corresponding to each kind of associative relation, and accuracy and&#xD;
      response time measures of cognitive performance reflecting how temporal duration, complexity,&#xD;
      and familiarity are represented and activated. Experiments 10 and 11 will also record&#xD;
      donation choices made by the subjects. The results gained from this protocol will provide&#xD;
      further evidence for modifying, supporting, or rejecting aspects of the SEC model, and will&#xD;
      provide further evidence for modifying, supporting, or rejecting aspects of a framework of&#xD;
      social cognition such as moral behavior and social event knowledge.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In all the studies, subjects will consist of healthy, native English-speaking, right-handed&#xD;
        volunteers, as measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will range in age from 21 to 40 years old and they will be included regardless of&#xD;
        race or gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-native English speakers and non-right handers will be excluded as mentioned above, as&#xD;
        will non-neurologically normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects younger than 21 and older than 40 will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A pregnancy test will be employed with all women of childbearing age. The results must be&#xD;
        negative in order to proceed with the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any of the following: aneurysm clip; implanted neural stimulator; implanted&#xD;
        cardiac pacemaker or auto-defibrillator; cochlear implant; ocular foreign body, e.g. metal&#xD;
        shavings; permanent eyeliner; insulin pump; or irremovable body piercing will be excluded&#xD;
        from the study due to the possible dangerous effects of the magnet upon metal objects in&#xD;
        the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects taking central nervous system active medications will be excluded.&#xD;
