  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized study will assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of Pivanex and&#xD;
      docetaxel compared to docetaxel alone in patients with a type of lung cancer called non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. Pivanex is an investigational agent, and docetaxel is an approved drug.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Pivanex is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that induces tumor differentiation&#xD;
      and/or apoptosis. Pivanex has been well tolerated in clinical trials and has shown&#xD;
      preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Docetaxel is an&#xD;
      approved drug for second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Preclinical studies&#xD;
      indicate that the combination of Pivanex and docetaxel is synergistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This open-label randomized trial will evaluate whether combination therapy with&#xD;
      Pivanex and docetaxel provides clinical benefit over docetaxel alone in patients with&#xD;
      chemotherapy resistant non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with&#xD;
           combination therapy with Pivanex and docetaxel vs. docetaxel alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the time to disease progression, tumor responses, and safety profile of patients&#xD;
           with non-small cell lung cancer treated with combination therapy with Pivanex and&#xD;
           docetaxel vs. docetaxel alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study in patients with non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer who have previously been treated with no more than one prior platinum containing&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen. Patients are stratified by ECOG performance status (0-1 vs. 2),&#xD;
      response to prior platinum based chemotherapy (progression vs. CR/PR/SD) and prior taxane&#xD;
      therapy (yes vs. no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Patients receive the combination of Pivanex intravenously on Days 1-3 and&#xD;
           docetaxel intravenously on Day 4. Treatment repeats every 21 days until disease&#xD;
           progression or treatment withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously on Day 1. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
           days until disease progression or treatment withdrawal.&#xD;
