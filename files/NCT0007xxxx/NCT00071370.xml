      This study will evaluate how the state of being completely deprived of sleep has an effect on&#xD;
      recordings of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), in relation to&#xD;
      how alert someone is and how sleepy someone perceives himself or herself to be. EEG measures&#xD;
      electronic potential differences on the scalp. On the other hand, MEG is a non-invasive&#xD;
      technique for recording the activity of neurons in the brain, through recording of magnetic&#xD;
      fields caused by synchronized neural currents. It has the ability to detect seizures. Because&#xD;
      magnetic signals of the brain vary, this technique must balance two key problems: weakness of&#xD;
      the signal and strength of the noise. The EEG is sensitive to extra-cellular volume currents,&#xD;
      whereas the MEG primarily registers intra-cellular currents. Because electrical fields are&#xD;
      quite dependent on the conductive properties of the tissues, and magnetic fields are&#xD;
      significantly less distorted by tissue, the MEG has better spatial resolution. There is a&#xD;
      great deal of evidence that EEG and MEG provide complementary data about underlying currents&#xD;
      of ions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complex relationship of sleep and epilepsy is well known. Sleep has been used for many&#xD;
      years as a powerful EEG activator. Many researchers have supported the hypothesis that there&#xD;
      is a specific activating effect of sleep deprivation on epileptic discharges. Sleep&#xD;
      deprivation is defined as a sleepless state of longer than 24 hours. The increased use of MEG&#xD;
      in diagnosis could improve the procedure for evaluating patients before surgery for epilepsy,&#xD;
      by making invasive studies less necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older, with a diagnosis of epilepsy and with a documented last&#xD;
      routine EEG (at least 2 weeks earlier) and routine EEG on the day of a baseline MEG-EEG&#xD;
      without interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be rated according to the Epworth, Stanford, and Karolinska Sleepiness&#xD;
      Scales, to determine their subjective sleepiness. They will be randomly assigned to stay&#xD;
      awake all night or sleep in the hospital overnight. That is, a sleep deprivation and&#xD;
      non-sleep deprivation synchronized MEG-EEG recording will be performed in random order. Then&#xD;
      the sequence of sleep deprivation and non-sleep deprivation will be reversed within 14 to 21&#xD;
      days. During the recordings, the patient will either sit or lie with his or her head in a&#xD;
      helmet covering the entire head, with openings for the eyes and ears. Brain magnetic fields&#xD;
      will be recorded with a 275-channel OMEGA system. Throughout the session, visual and two-way&#xD;
      audio communication will be maintained with the patient. Recording sessions will last 90 to&#xD;
      180 minutes, with the patient allowed to take breaks after at least 10 minutes in a scanner.&#xD;
      Attempts will be made to encourage patients to stay awake and sleep for about the same amount&#xD;
      of time during each recording, to acquire comparable amounts of sleep and awake recordings.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to evaluate the activating effects of complete sleep deprivation (SD) on&#xD;
      synchronized MEG-EEG recordings, and on each of the components singly, in relation to the&#xD;
      degree of alertness during recording (awake vs. sleep) and the subjective degree of&#xD;
      sleepiness as assessed by standardized scales. We postulate that acute SD will increase the&#xD;
      diagnostic yield of synchronized MEG-EEG and activate both modalities (MEG, EEG) to the same&#xD;
      degree. The increased diagnostic utility of MEG could improve the epilepsy surgery evaluation&#xD;
      procedure for many patients by rendering invasive studies less necessary. The medical and&#xD;
      economic utilization of such expensive resources as MEG could thus be rationalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of this study will be epilepsy patients whose last routine interictal EEG&#xD;
      (performed at least two weeks earlier), subsequent pre-screening EEG and screening MEG-EEG&#xD;
      show no interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), and are therefore considered&#xD;
      non-diagnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design/Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a 275-channel Whole-head MEG System (CTF Systems 2001 Inc.). Patients will have a&#xD;
      screening, non-SD and SD MEG-EEG after their degree of sleepiness is assessed using the&#xD;
      Epworth, Stanford and Karnolinska sleepiness scales. Starting one day after the MEG-EEG, SD&#xD;
      and non-SDMEG-EEG will be performed in random order within 14-21 days of each other. This&#xD;
      will ensure an equal amount of sampling effect in SD and non-SD data sets. The MEG-EEG&#xD;
      session will last 90 to 180 minutes. Patients may take a break after at least 10 minutes in a&#xD;
      scanner. We will attempt to record a comparable amount of awake and sleep data. At least&#xD;
      thirty minutes of artifact-free baseline, non-SD and SD MEG-EEG will be analyzed. For the&#xD;
      purpose of blinding, each modality will be read independently by two readers, each of whom&#xD;
      will be blinded to the relationship of the MEG-EEG data to sleep deprivation, results&#xD;
      obtained by the other modality and subjective degree of sleepiness. Only interpretations of&#xD;
      each modality agreed upon by both readers will be accepted. When there is no agreement, a&#xD;
      third independent reader will resolve the disagreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of seizure foci detected and delineated&#xD;
      after SD on synchronized MEG-EEG recordings. Comparisons will also be made for each recording&#xD;
      modality and between them, according to the state of alertness during recording and&#xD;
      subjective feeling of sleepiness before each recording.&#xD;
