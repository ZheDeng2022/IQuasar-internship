  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil, and capecitabine,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. Combining chemotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen with bevacizumab works better in treating colorectal cancer. This&#xD;
      randomized phase III trial is studying giving two different combination chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      together with bevacizumab and comparing how well they work in treating patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced, metastatic, or recurrent colorectal cancer&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare overall survival in patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent&#xD;
      colorectal cancer treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab&#xD;
      vs capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare progression-free survival and time to treatment failure in patients treated with&#xD;
      these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare the response of patients with measurable disease treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.Compare toxicity rates of these regimens in these patients. V. Compare patient-reported&#xD;
      functional status and convenience of therapy in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Correlate germline polymorphisms of DNA repair (e.g., ERCC-1, XRCC1, GST-P1, XPD, and&#xD;
      ribonucleotide reductase), target enzymes (e.g., thymidylate synthase, dihydropyrimidine&#xD;
      dehydrogenase, and thymidine phosphorylase), angiogenesis (e.g., vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor), and growth factors (e.g., epithelial growth factor receptor) with survival,&#xD;
      progression-free survival, and toxicity from chemotherapy in patients treated with these&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Correlate tumor mRNA expression levels of similar DNA repair enzymes as well as enzymes&#xD;
      involved in angiogenesis with survival and progression-free survival in patients treated with&#xD;
      these regimens.Correlate tumor mRNA expression levels of similar target enzymes before&#xD;
      treatment with survival, progression-free survival, and toxicity in patients treated with&#xD;
      these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Zubrod&#xD;
      performance status (0 or 1 vs 2) and prior adjuvant therapy (yes vs no). Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on&#xD;
      day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours beginning on day 1. Patients are&#xD;
      further randomized to receive bevacizumab or placebo* IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE:&#xD;
      *As of 11/15/04, placebo is no longer part of treatment plan; all patients receive&#xD;
      bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine on days&#xD;
      1-15. Patients are further randomized to receive bevacizumab or placebo* as in arm I. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE:&#xD;
      *As of 11/15/04, placebo is no longer part of treatment plan; all patients receive&#xD;
      bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression. After disease progression,&#xD;
      patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for up to 4 years after&#xD;
      study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,200 patients (1,100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for&#xD;
      this study within 3 years.&#xD;
