  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open label study of ILX651 in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Approximately 60 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled in this study that is expected to last 18 months. All patients will be treated&#xD;
      with ILX651 administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 consecutive days once every 21 days.&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall response rate. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine the progression free survival, duration of response, time to&#xD;
      tumor progression, survival, safety/tolerability of ILX651, and to evaluate pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with&#xD;
             2 prior chemotherapy regimens (not including prior adjuvant therapy for stage I or II&#xD;
             disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease recurrence or progression after prior therapy with a platinum-based and a&#xD;
             taxane-based regimen, given either concurrently or separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease. Measurable lesions should be outside the field of radiation. Where&#xD;
             measurable lesions are within a previously irradiated field, there must be objective&#xD;
             evidence of progression of the lesion prior to patient enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have adequate organ and immune system function as indicated by the following&#xD;
             laboratory values, obtained less than or equal to 2 weeks prior to registration: A.&#xD;
             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 1,000,000,000. B.&#xD;
             Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL. C. Platelet count greater than or equal&#xD;
             to 100 x 1,000,000,000/L. D. Serum creatinine or calculated creatinine clearance less&#xD;
             than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or greater than or equal to 60 mL/min. E. Serum total&#xD;
             bilirubin within limits of normal values. F. AST and ALT less than or equal to 2 times&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal (ULN). G. Alkaline phosphatase within limits of normal&#xD;
             values&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anti-cancer therapy, major surgery, or irradiation must have been completed at least 3&#xD;
             weeks before enrollment in this study. Patient must have recovered from the acute side&#xD;
             effects incurred as a result of previous therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within&#xD;
             7 days of study enrollment. Men and women of reproductive potential must use an&#xD;
             effective contraceptive method while enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent (includes HIPAA authorization).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled congestive heart failure or angina, patients with a history&#xD;
             of myocardial infarction within 2 months of enrollment, or patients with cardiac&#xD;
             functional capacity Class III or IV as defined by the New York Heart Association&#xD;
             Classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously treated with &gt; 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced or metastatic&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy to the only site of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to study drug or its analogs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of investigational agents within previous 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known, active infection, or known HIV positive or presence of an AIDS related illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active secondary malignancy except minor skin cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of symptomatic active brain metastases, including leptomeningeal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant concurrent disease or illness, or psychiatric disorders or alcohol or&#xD;
             chemical abuse that would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise patient&#xD;
             safety or compliance, or interfere with the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;
