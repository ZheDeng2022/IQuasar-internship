  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated and compared the efficacy and tolerability of lapatinib and letrozole,&#xD;
      with letrozole and placebo in post-menopausal women with hormone receptor positive (ER&#xD;
      positive and/or PgR positive) advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who had not received&#xD;
      prior therapy for advanced or metastatic disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either lapatinib (1500 mg once daily orally) with&#xD;
      letrozole (2.5 mg once daily orally), or letrozole (2.5 mg once daily orally) with placebo&#xD;
      (which matched with lapatinib tablet). Randomization was stratified by site of disease (i.e.,&#xD;
      soft tissue/visceral disease versus bone only disease) and time since prior adjuvant&#xD;
      endocrine therapy (&lt;6 months or ≥ 6 months from discontinuation of adjuvant anti-estrogen&#xD;
      therapy (e.g. tamoxifen or raloxifene) or no prior adjuvant antiestrogen therapy). Study&#xD;
      therapy was administered daily until disease progression (objective or symptomatic) or&#xD;
      withdrawal from therapy (e.g., due to unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or other&#xD;
      reason). All subjects were to be followed for survival information until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 13 Apr 2015, after the introduction of the Long Term Follow UP (LTFU) phase (per protocol&#xD;
      amendment 07), subjects receiving study treatment with lapatinib plus letrozole, or letrozole&#xD;
      plus placebo had continued access to this study treatment until the occurrence of one of the&#xD;
      following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease progression (as determined by the Investigator),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug related AE which was considered by the investigator to warrant permanent&#xD;
           discontinuation of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject decided to withdraw from the study. Investigators collected AEs and/or SAEs&#xD;
           related to study participation, until 30 days following study treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
           Subjects who were being followed-up for OS but were not taking study medication, were&#xD;
           withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was terminated on 22-Mar-2018 (last subject last visit).&#xD;

        <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, if sooner. The date of documented PD is defined as the date of radiological PD as assessed by the investigator based on imaging data and also by the clinical assessment of symptomatic progression. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0), PD is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With PFS in the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population as Assessed by the Investigator</title>
          <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause, if sooner. The date of documented disease progression is defined as the date of radiological disease progression as assessed by the investigator based on imaging data and also by the clinical assessment of symptomatic progression. Per RECIST 1.0, disease progression is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

        <description>OR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving either a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Response was assessed via Response Evaluation criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The percentage of participants with response was calculated by using the formula: 100 * (number of participants with CR + number of participants with PR)/total number of participants. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD.</description>

        <title>Clinical Benefit (CB) in the HER2-Positive Population as Assessed by the Investigator</title>
        <description>CB is defined as the percentage of participants with evidence of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the baseline measurement.</description>

        <description>Quality of Life (QOL) was assessed using the FACT-B questionnaire, which was a 37-item (27 general and 10 breast cancer-specific questions) self-reporting instrument consisting of 5 dimensions: physical-, social/family-, emotional-, functional-well being, and a breast cancer subscale. Higher scores on the FACT-B scales (each ranging from 0 [not at all] to 4 [very much]) indicate a higher QOL. The score is transformed for FACT-B and results in a total score ranging from 0 to 144.

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) Score Using Observed Data</title>
        <description>FACT-G is a subscale of the FACT-B QOL questionnaire and consists of 27 questions grouped into 4 domains that measure a participant's physical, functional, social and family, and emotional well-being. FACT-G is assessed on a five-point Likert-type scale, with scores ranging from 0 to 4 (0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). The total score is calculated as the sum of the item scores on the subscale; the total ranges from 0 to 108, with higher score indicating a better quality of life.</description>

        <description>IHC is a commonly used test to assess the amount of the HER2 receptor protein on the surface of the cancer cells. The IHC test results in a score of 0 to 3+, which indicates the amount of HER2 receptor protein on the cells in a sample of breast cancer tissue. Tissue scores of 0 to 1+ indicate HER2 negativity; scores of 2+ and 3+ indicate HER2 positivity. Clinical benefit is defined as participants with CR, PR, or SD for =&gt;6-month period.</description>
