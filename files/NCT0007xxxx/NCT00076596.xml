    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the brain controls movements in patients with certain types of&#xD;
      cerebral palsy. In healthy people, one side of the body usually controls movements on the&#xD;
      other side of the body. In patients with cerebral palsy, this pattern may be altered, and one&#xD;
      side of the brain may control movements on the same side of the body. Information obtained&#xD;
      from this study may lead to improved rehabilitation therapy strategies for patients with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with cerebral palsy between 6 and 18 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. All candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and psychological testing. In addition, patients with cerebral palsy will have&#xD;
      hearing and vision tests, a review of their medical records, and a magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) scan if one has not been done within the past year. For this test, the patient lies on&#xD;
      a table that slides into a narrow metal cylinder with a strong magnetic field (the scanner).&#xD;
      The scanning time usually lasts between 45 and 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study also will be evaluated by a physiatrist and physical and&#xD;
      occupational therapists. They will be examined for muscle stiffness and reflexes. Their gait&#xD;
      and movements (e.g., how they pick up a glass of water) will be evaluated. They will be asked&#xD;
      about their ability to perform activities around the house and at school and whether a&#xD;
      wheelchair or walker is needed to get around. Patients may also be asked about how they are&#xD;
      dealing with their movement problems and how it affects their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo three tests, described below, to evaluate movement control. The&#xD;
      first two tests use electrodes (small metal discs) taped to the skin over the muscles in both&#xD;
      hands to measure muscle activity. A small disc placed on the fingers detects and measures the&#xD;
      hand movements. The third test uses magnetic pulses that stimulate the brain to study how the&#xD;
      brain controls movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantitative test of fine motor function: For this test, the subject taps buttons at&#xD;
           different speeds on a box attached to a computer. The test is similar to playing simple&#xD;
           computer games.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Long latency reflexes: For this test, the subject's hand is lightly strapped into a&#xD;
           holder that holds the hand still while a motor moves the index finger with sudden small&#xD;
           movements. These reflexes may also be tested using a gentle shock to the finger&#xD;
           delivered through a ring electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Transcranial magnetic stimulation: For this test, the subject sits in a comfortable&#xD;
           chair. An insulated coil is held on the scalp. A magnetic pulse from the coil stimulates&#xD;
           the brain. The subject may hear a click and feel a snap or pulling sensation on the&#xD;
           scalp under the coil. The stimulation may also cause twitching in the muscles of the arm&#xD;
           or leg. During the stimulation, the subject may be asked to move certain muscles or&#xD;
           perform other simple actions.&#xD;

      Although the capacity of the immature nervous system to recover after injury is superior to&#xD;
      that of the adult brain, children with cerebral palsy carry a great burden of morbidity for&#xD;
      their entire life. Functional outcome may be determined not only by characteristics of the&#xD;
      lesion (size, location, and timing) but also by the response of the brain to the lesion&#xD;
      (cortical re-organization). Little is known about how underlying limitations, such as&#xD;
      inefficient cortical re-organization, affect functional outcome and response to therapy in&#xD;
      children with cerebral palsy. Because of this, individual rehabilitation strategies are based&#xD;
      solely on the level of functioning rather than on the underlying impairment. Research&#xD;
      demonstrates that novel rehabilitation strategies can manipulate plasticity of the motor&#xD;
      cortex and, in this way, improve functional outcome in adults who have suffered a stroke.&#xD;
      There is preliminary evidence that these treatments may also benefit patients with cerebral&#xD;
      palsy. However, cortical re-organization after an injury to the developing brain may not be&#xD;
      similar to that which occurs after a stroke in the adult brain. It would be of benefit to&#xD;
      have a greater understanding of the impairments that arise from inefficient cortical&#xD;
      re-organization in children with cerebral palsy. It is also important to have the research&#xD;
      methodology to assess the effect of these novel treatments in order to measure their true&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortical re-organization can lead to enhanced participation of the unaffected hemisphere via&#xD;
      anomalous ipsilateral corticofugal motor projections. Recent evidence suggests that this form&#xD;
      of neural re-organization may not be efficient. Three different types of ipsilateral&#xD;
      projections are thought to exist: 1) fast-conducting developmental ipsilateral projections&#xD;
      that persist beyond the age at which they normally disappear; 2) slow-conducting ipsilateral&#xD;
      tracts present in healthy subjects that become more accessible after injury; 3)&#xD;
      fast-conducting projections that arise de novo from the ipsilateral primary motor cortex&#xD;
      after injury to the developing brain. Each type has a distinct neurophysiologic profile that&#xD;
      can be characterized using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the relationship between anomalous ipsilateral corticofugal motor projections and&#xD;
      functional outcome has not been examined in detail. There is preliminary evidence that the&#xD;
      presence of these anomalous ipsilateral projections is associated with poor outcome,&#xD;
      suggesting that they represent an inefficient cortical re-organization process. In addition,&#xD;
      the anomalous projections that arise de novo from the ipsilateral primary motor cortex appear&#xD;
      to have the worst prognosis. The proposed research study will characterize anomalous&#xD;
      ipsilateral corticofugal motor projections in a group of children with spastic hemiplegia and&#xD;
      spastic diplegia subtypes of cerebral palsy using TMS and EMG. We will evaluate functional&#xD;
      limitations of the hand in these children and will examine the relationship between each type&#xD;
      of ipsilateral pathway and functional outcome. In this way, it will be possible to determine&#xD;
      which anomalous ipsilateral projections are associated with poor function in patients with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will increase our understanding of the functional significance of these&#xD;
      ipsilateral projections and will make it possible to identify these ipsilateral projections&#xD;
      in individual children. The neurophysiologic techniques developed in this study will provide&#xD;
      essential research methodology to assess brain re-organization before and after novel&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
