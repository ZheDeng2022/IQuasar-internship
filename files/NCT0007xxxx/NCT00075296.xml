      This study will examine how the brains of depressed people function during learning and&#xD;
      respond to feedback. Participants perform a &quot;probabilistic reversal learning task&quot; to&#xD;
      determine whether depressed people perform worse on a task than non-depressed people when&#xD;
      they sometimes receive misleading negative feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right-handed healthy volunteers, people with major depression who are currently depressed or&#xD;
      have previously been depressed and people with bipolar depression between 18 and 50 years of&#xD;
      age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical and psychiatric&#xD;
      history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, blood and urine tests. They are also&#xD;
      interviewed to evaluate mood, sleep, energy, work and school performance, and social&#xD;
      relationships, and asked to answer questions to investigate whether any history of paranoia,&#xD;
      panic attacks, obsession, compulsions, suicidal thoughts, eating disturbances, and alcohol or&#xD;
      drug abuse is present. They complete rating scales for depression, anxiety, and negative&#xD;
      thinking; history of alcohol and tobacco use; physical movement; socioeconomic status;&#xD;
      overall level of functioning; and depression type. Finally, they undergo a battery of&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests to assess general intelligence, handedness, and specific cognitive&#xD;
      abilities, including memory and concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants perform the probabilistic reversal learning task either in a testing room seated&#xD;
      in front of a computer or lying down while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (FMRI). FMRI is a diagnostic test that uses a strong magnet and radio waves to obtain&#xD;
      pictures of brain structure and function. For the scan, the subject lies on a narrow bed with&#xD;
      a plastic-encased metal coil close to the head. The bed slides into the scanner - a small&#xD;
      tunnel about 6 feet long. All subjects, whether in the testing room or in the MRI scanner,&#xD;
      undergo the learning task as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two patterns are presented on a computer screen. One pattern is designated &quot;correct&quot; and the&#xD;
      other &quot;incorrect.&quot; Subjects are asked to choose the correct pattern on each try and are&#xD;
      provided feedback as to whether the response was right or wrong. Sometimes the rule changes,&#xD;
      and the pattern that was correct is now wrong, and vice versa, so that the new correct&#xD;
      pattern must be chosen. In addition, misleading feedback is sometimes given intentionally,&#xD;
      indicating the subject chose the wrong pattern when in fact the response was correct.&#xD;
      Subjects should change their response only when they are sure that the rule has changed, and&#xD;
      not because they were incorrectly told that they were wrong. For patients undergoing MRI,&#xD;
      blood flow in the different areas of the brain is measured during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the test, outside the scanner, participants undergo additional tests of attention,&#xD;
      memory, and concentration like those that were administered during the screening procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      When depressed subjects perceive they have failed while performing a neuropsychological task&#xD;
      their performance on subsequent trials becomes impaired. Elliott et al. showed that MDD&#xD;
      subjects were far more likely to fail on subsequent tasks after failure on one task than&#xD;
      controls. This effect has been described as an &quot;abnormal response' to negative feedback or a&#xD;
      'catastrophic response to perceived failure.'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Murphy et al. investigated this further using a probabilistic reversal learning task in which&#xD;
      subjects were faced with occasional negative feedback that was actually false. On each trial&#xD;
      of the task subjects choose one of two stimuli on screen, one considered correct and the&#xD;
      other incorrect, this is followed by feedback. Instructions prior to starting the task inform&#xD;
      the subject that sometimes the rule will change and the previously correct stimulus will be&#xD;
      incorrect, but sometimes the computer will give them incorrect feedback. They are instructed&#xD;
      to switch responding only when they are sure the rule has actually changed. MDD subjects&#xD;
      demonstrate intact acquisition and reversal of probabilistic learning but are impaired in&#xD;
      their ability to maintain a response in the face of misleading negative feedback. This&#xD;
      profile of impairment may be relatively specific to MDD as, for example, it is not found in&#xD;
      subjects with other neuropsychiatric conditions. This 'abnormal response' to negative&#xD;
      feedback may represent a significant link between negative affect and cognitive impairments&#xD;
      in depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the proposed study functional magnetic resonance images will be acquired while&#xD;
      subjects perform a version of the probabilistic reversal learning task. Four groups will take&#xD;
      part: MDD, bipolar depressed, unmedicated MDD in remission and healthy control subjects.&#xD;
      These images will be used to investigate differences in neural activation between the four&#xD;
      groups, to clarify whether this specific profile of behavioral response extends to bipolar&#xD;
      depressed subjects and to assess the mood state dependences of this effect. This would&#xD;
      increase understanding of the specific profile of performance on this task and neural basis&#xD;
      of this abnormal response to negative feedback that contributes to impairment of cognitive&#xD;
      performance in depression.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects will be between 18 and 50 years old. Male and female subjects will be&#xD;
        included. All subjects must be able to give written informed consent prior to participation&#xD;
        in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MDD Depressed Sample: Twenty five subjects (ages 18-50) male and female will be selected,&#xD;
        with primary MDD currently depressed as defined by DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MDD, in a&#xD;
        current major depressive episode and who have a first degree relative with MDD but no first&#xD;
        degree relatives with mania, alcoholism, or antisocial personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MDD Remission Sample: Twenty subjects (ages 18-50) male and female will be selected.&#xD;
        Remission is defined as a period of at least three months during which the subject has not&#xD;
        taken an antidepressant agent, with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; 21-item;&#xD;
        Hamilton 1960) scores in the non-depressed range (less than 8), and with no more than one&#xD;
        clinically significant depressive symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bipolar Depressed Sample: Twenty five subjects (ages 18-50) male and female will be&#xD;
        selected who meet DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I or II disorder and are currently in a&#xD;
        depressed phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Control Sample: Thirty subjects (ages 18-50) male and female who have not met&#xD;
        criteria for any major psychiatric disorder will be selected. From this large sample a&#xD;
        control subject will be matched to each depressed subject for age, gender, handedness and&#xD;
        IQ. The control subjects will have no known first degree relatives with mood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with any major medical or neurological disorder or who have received&#xD;
        psychotropic drugs or medication likely to influence cerebral blood flow or metabolism&#xD;
        within 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine [Prozac]), of scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bipolar subjects with rapid cycling or with current psychosis will be excluded from the&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Effective treatment will not be discontinued for the purposes of this protocol, subjects&#xD;
        will be identified who have never been treated or who have discontinued medication due to&#xD;
        lack of efficacy, noncompliance, physician order or other reasons prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who meet DSM-IV criteria for alcohol and/or substance abuse within 1 year prior&#xD;
        to screening or lifetime history of substance dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of childbearing potential who are known to be pregnant or who have a positive&#xD;
        pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who have experienced serious suicidal ideation within the past 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        General exclusions for MRI imaging, such as having had a cardiac pacemaker or ferromagnetic&#xD;
        object implanted through surgical intervention or accident (for example: shrapnel).&#xD;
