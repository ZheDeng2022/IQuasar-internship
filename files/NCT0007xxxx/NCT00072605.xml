  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine developed to protect against Ebola&#xD;
      virus infection and to determine if the vaccine induces an immune response to the virus. The&#xD;
      Ebola virus causes a disease called Ebola hemorrhagic fever. Symptoms begin with fever and&#xD;
      muscle aches and progress to breathing problems, severe bleeding, kidney problems, and shock.&#xD;
      The infection may be mild, but it can also lead to death. The vaccine used in this study is&#xD;
      made from small parts of Ebola genetic material. It cannot cause Ebola hemorrhagic fever to&#xD;
      develop in those who receive it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18 to 44 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, and complete an&#xD;
      &quot;assessment of understanding&quot; questionnaire to show that they understand the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on their order of entry into the study, participants are assigned to receive one of&#xD;
      three vaccine doses or placebo. The first group receives the lowest dose (2 milligram) of&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo. If this dose is safe, then the second group receives 4 mg, and if this&#xD;
      dose is safe, the third group receives 8 mg. Injections are given in a muscle in the upper&#xD;
      arm. Participants receive three injections, each 4 weeks apart (on study days 0, 28, and 56).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants record their temperature and symptoms in a diary card for 7 days following each&#xD;
      injection. They return to the clinic 2 to 3 days after each injection and then 2 weeks after&#xD;
      each injection until study week 10. Additional follow-up visits are then scheduled at weeks&#xD;
      12, 24, 38, and 52. At each visit, participants provide a blood and urine sample for testing&#xD;
      and have their vital signs, and lymph nodes checked, their weight measured, and their&#xD;
      symptoms reviewed. Additional laboratory tests may be requested between visits.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of an Ebola DNA&#xD;
      plasmid vaccine. The hypothesis is that the vaccine will be safe for human administration and&#xD;
      elicit immune responses to Ebola. Primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the investigational vaccine and the secondary objective is to evaluate immune&#xD;
      responses. Randomization assignment will be blinded to subjects, clinical investigators and&#xD;
      laboratory investigators.&#xD;
