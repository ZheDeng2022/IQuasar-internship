  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are large differences in health outcomes related to pregnancy and birth between&#xD;
      developed and developing countries. This study will investigate how infections, medical&#xD;
      history, health care behavior and psychosocial issues are associated with pregnancy outcomes&#xD;
      in Pakistan.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pakistan, the world's seventh most populous country of about 138 million people, is beset&#xD;
      with severe problems in its maternal and child health sector. The official maternal mortality&#xD;
      ratio for Pakistan is reported as 340 per 100,000 live births.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal to conduct a prospective observational study to identify the risk factors&#xD;
      for adverse pregnancy outcomes including reproductive tract infections such as BV, and other&#xD;
      physical, dental, nutritional, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to examine the association between BV in pregnant women at 20-26 weeks gestation&#xD;
      and various other biochemical infection markers with adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e.,&#xD;
      perinatal mortality [PNM], neonatal mortality, low birth weight [LBW], spontaneous preterm&#xD;
      delivery [SPTD], premature rupture of membranes [PROM], histological chorioamnionitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will explore the relationship of various health behaviors and health&#xD;
      status to the presence of perinatal infections. A total of 1,500 pregnant women will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. A matched case-control study will be conducted at the end of the data&#xD;
      collection period to evaluate the use of markers for the prediction of infection related&#xD;
      perinatal mortality and infection related SPTD. All investigators and laboratory personnel&#xD;
      will remain blinded to the identity of specimens through the use of unique study identifier&#xD;
      numbers. Collected data will then be unblinded, analysed, and correlated with the previously&#xD;
      collected demographic, obstetrics, and neonatal outcome, microbiology and histopathological&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the findings of this study, appropriate interventions to address reproductive tract&#xD;
      infection (RTI) could be developed and field-tested in Pakistan. We expect that these&#xD;
      interventions, once successfully field-tested, could be widely used to improve maternal and&#xD;
      child survival in Pakistan and other developing countries. Given the critical state of&#xD;
      maternal and child health in Pakistan, and considering the emerging evidence that infections&#xD;
      could lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, this study is extremely relevant and timely, and it&#xD;
      has the potential to contribute significantly toward the improvement of reproductive health&#xD;
      in Pakistan. Primary outcome is perinatal mortality. Secondary outcomes include birth weight;&#xD;
      spontaneous delivery occurring before 37 weeks gestation; rupture of fetal membranes before&#xD;
      37 weeks of gestation; and maternal death. The sample size was based on 25% prevalence of BV&#xD;
      in the control group; 10 percent dropout rate; 80 percent power; and a two-tailed type I&#xD;
      error of 0.05.&#xD;
