      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) and sargramostim&#xD;
      (GM-CSF), use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from&#xD;
      growing. Combining vaccine therapy with biological therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of giving vaccine therapy together&#xD;
      with BCG and sargramostim in treating patients who have undergone cystectomy for transitional&#xD;
      cell carcinomas.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine, Bacille Calmette&#xD;
           Guerin (BCG), and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in post-cystectomy patients with transitional&#xD;
           cell carcinoma of the bladder expressing NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the immunological profile (NY-ESO-1 antibody, CD8+ cells, and delayed-type&#xD;
           hypersensitivity) induced by this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive NY-ESO-1 protein vaccine mixed with BCG intradermally (ID) once weekly on&#xD;
      weeks 1 and 2. Patients then receive NY-ESO-1 protein mixed with sargramostim (GM-CSF) ID&#xD;
      once weekly on day 2 of weeks 3-6. Patients also receive GM-CSF subcutaneously alone on days&#xD;
      1, 3, 4, and 5 of weeks 3-6.&#xD;

    <description>All adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) (Version 3.0). A Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as:&#xD;
≥ Grade 2 autoimmune phenomena&#xD;
Asymptomatic bronchospasm or generalized urticaria&#xD;
≥ Grade 3 hematological and non hematological toxicities. To be dose limiting, an adverse event must have been definitely, probably, or possibly related to the administration of the study treatment. Patients who experienced a DLT were removed from study.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were obtained at baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 for the assessment of NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</description>

    <description>Blood samples were obtained at baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 for the assessment of NY-ESO-1 specific T-cell responses by ELISPOT. T-cell responses were monitored after in vitro sensitization with either overlapping peptides from NY-ESO-1 or recombinant adenovirus encoding NY-ESO-1 (adeno-NY-ESO-1), and with control peptides or recombinant vectors encoding Influenza-derived proteins.</description>

    <measure>Delayed-type Hypersensitivity (DTH) as Measured by the Number of Participants With Induration and/or Redness at Each Timepoint</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NY-ESO-1-specific DTH skin reaction was measured at baseline and weeks 3 and 8.The peptide solution (10 μg peptide in 0.1ml normal saline) was injected intradermally at a separate site from the vaccination to give a visible and palpable skin depot. Assessment of DTH reactions was performed 48 h after injection.&#xD;
The extent and intensity of DTH reactions was documented by measuring visible &quot;redness&quot;, palpable &quot;induration&quot; and other signs of local skin irritation or necrosis.</description>

NY-ESO-1 protein, 75 mcg, was administered by intradermal injection every week for 6 weeks. TICE®-strain BCG, 1 x 10E6 viable units in Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) negative patients and 1 x 10E5 viable units in PPD positive (induration greater than or equal to 10 mm) patients, were mixed with each protein vaccination for the first 2 weeks only. For the last 4 weeks GM-CSF, 100 mcg, was mixed with NY-ESO-1 protein given once a week for 4 weeks, intradermally. GM-CSF alone was given subcutaneously on the day prior to the administration of the co-mixture (NY-ESO-1 Protein/GM-CSF) and for 3 days after.</description>

        <description>All adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) (Version 3.0). A Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as:&#xD;
≥ Grade 2 autoimmune phenomena&#xD;
Asymptomatic bronchospasm or generalized urticaria&#xD;
≥ Grade 3 hematological and non hematological toxicities. To be dose limiting, an adverse event must have been definitely, probably, or possibly related to the administration of the study treatment. Patients who experienced a DLT were removed from study.</description>

NY-ESO-1 protein, 75 mcg, was administered by intradermal injection every week for 6 weeks. TICE®-strain BCG, 1 x 10E6 viable units in Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) negative patients and 1 x 10E5 viable units in PPD positive (induration greater than or equal to 10 mm) patients, were mixed with each protein vaccination for the first 2 weeks only. For the last 4 weeks GM-CSF, 100 mcg, was mixed with NY-ESO-1 protein given once a week for 4 weeks, intradermally. GM-CSF alone was given subcutaneously on the day prior to the administration of the co-mixture (NY-ESO-1 Protein/GM-CSF) and for 3 days after.</description>

          <description>All adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) (Version 3.0). A Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as:&#xD;
≥ Grade 2 autoimmune phenomena&#xD;
Asymptomatic bronchospasm or generalized urticaria&#xD;
≥ Grade 3 hematological and non hematological toxicities. To be dose limiting, an adverse event must have been definitely, probably, or possibly related to the administration of the study treatment. Patients who experienced a DLT were removed from study.</description>

For the last 4 weeks GM-CSF, 100 mcg, was mixed with NY-ESO-1 protein given once a week for 4 weeks, intradermally. GM-CSF alone was given subcutaneously on the day prior to the administration of the co-mixture (NY-ESO-1 Protein/GM-CSF) and for 3 days after.</description>

          <title>Delayed-type Hypersensitivity (DTH) as Measured by the Number of Participants With Induration and/or Redness at Each Timepoint</title>
          <description>NY-ESO-1-specific DTH skin reaction was measured at baseline and weeks 3 and 8.The peptide solution (10 μg peptide in 0.1ml normal saline) was injected intradermally at a separate site from the vaccination to give a visible and palpable skin depot. Assessment of DTH reactions was performed 48 h after injection.&#xD;
The extent and intensity of DTH reactions was documented by measuring visible &quot;redness&quot;, palpable &quot;induration&quot; and other signs of local skin irritation or necrosis.</description>
          <population>All participants who received at least one dose of study treatment and received the DTH test at the respective timepoint. One participant in Cohort 4 did not have HLA-A2 status tested.</population>
