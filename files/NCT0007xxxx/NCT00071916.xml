    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a group of African Americans and Caucasians with&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV), compare their response rates to combination treatment with pegylated&#xD;
      interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, and identify possible causes for racial differences in&#xD;
      response to therapy. The study will enroll a total of 260 participants, age 18 or older, over&#xD;
      a 10 period. In the next 5 years 132 subjects will be studied locally, including 112 African&#xD;
      Americans and 20 Caucasians. Participants will be recruited from the clinical practices of&#xD;
      the hepatologists (liver doctors) at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and&#xD;
      will also be selected from referrals at local hepatology clinics and the Memphis VA Hospital.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be treated with pegylated interferon alfa-2b injections once weekly and oral&#xD;
      ribavirin 2 times a day for up to 72 weeks. Study procedures include multiple blood draws.&#xD;
      Participants may be involved in study related procedures for up to 72 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) Memphis Hepatitis C Cooperative&#xD;
      Research Center was established in 2000 to support clinical and basic research in&#xD;
      understanding the basis for chronic disease in hepatitis C (HCV) infection and response to&#xD;
      therapy in clinically infected patients. The primary research goal is to understand why&#xD;
      African American (AA) patients with chronic hepatitis C are more susceptible to chronic&#xD;
      infection and why their response rate to combination therapy is only 50 percent or less of&#xD;
      that for non AA patients. The present study will support this ongoing work by continuing to&#xD;
      provide clinical samples from patients with chronic hepatitis C who are undergoing treatment.&#xD;
      The specific aims for the 2005-2010 Hepatitis C Cooperative Research Center are: to determine&#xD;
      how human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II-dependent immune regulation and T cell&#xD;
      specificities affect differences in immune responses to HCV and response to therapy in AA&#xD;
      patients compared to non AA patients; to determine if there is a difference in&#xD;
      interferon-induced signaling between patients that respond to therapy and those that do not;&#xD;
      and to measure and compare the sustained virologic response to standard treatment for&#xD;
      hepatitis C between AA and non AA patients. Researchers plan to continue enrollment of&#xD;
      patients to the &quot;African American Response to Therapy for Hepatitis C&quot; study (112 African&#xD;
      American patients and 20 Caucasian patients) in order to meet the current specific aims.&#xD;
      Participants will include adult African American and Caucasian patients with compensated&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C who have not been previously treated with interferon and/or ribavirin.&#xD;
      Patients meeting the entry criteria will be enrolled. The total number of patients to be&#xD;
      enrolled is 260 over a 10-year period. In the next 5 years 132 subjects (112 African&#xD;
      American, 20 Caucasian) will be studied locally. Patients will be recruited primarily from&#xD;
      the clinical practices of the hepatologists at UTHSC. Patients will also be selected from&#xD;
      referrals at local Gastroenterology Hepatology clinics and the Memphis Department of Veterans&#xD;
      Affairs (VA) Hospital. Patients will be treated with weight based pegylated interferon&#xD;
      alfa-2b once weekly and weight based ribavirin twice a day. Duration of treatment with both&#xD;
      pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin will be for up to 72 weeks. Treatment will be&#xD;
      discontinued at 24 weeks if there is persistent viremia and the patient wishes to discontinue&#xD;
      therapy. Ribavirin will be administered orally at a dose of 13 +/- 2 mg/kg per day twice&#xD;
      daily, with 200 mg capsules. Pegylated interferon alpha-2b will be administered by the&#xD;
      subcutaneous route.&#xD;

             inclusion into the protocol, the patient must have abstained from using the abused&#xD;
             substance for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of organ transplantation will be excluded.&#xD;

          -  Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preexisting psychiatric conditions; especially severe depression, or a history of&#xD;
             severe psychiatric disorder, such as major psychoses, active suicidal ideation and/or&#xD;
             suicidal attempt are excluded. Patients with a history of mild depression may enter&#xD;
             the protocol if they meet the following eligibility criterion and are monitored more&#xD;
             intensively. Mild depression includes either situational depression for a limited&#xD;
             period or depressive symptoms, which do not significantly interfere with the patient's&#xD;
             work or daily functions. All patients will complete the Center for Epidemiological&#xD;
             Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D is a 20-item self-report scale designed to&#xD;
             measure depressive symptomatology experienced during the week prior to the interview.&#xD;
             The items are scored on a four-point scale (0-3), with the total score ranging from&#xD;
             zero to 60. CES-D scores of 16-20 suggest minor depression, and scores greater than 20&#xD;
             suggest major depression. The score can be determined in real time. A score of 16 or&#xD;
             higher should prompt further questioning and consideration of treatment or referral to&#xD;
             psychiatry. Detailed follow-up of each patient may be individualized according to&#xD;
             his/her need; this would usually include predetermined visits.&#xD;
