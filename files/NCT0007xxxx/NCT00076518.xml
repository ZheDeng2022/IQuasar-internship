  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of fish oil supplements combined&#xD;
      with the drug fenofibrate in treating elevated triglyceride levels in people taking anti-HIV&#xD;
      drugs. The participants in this study will have shown no response to fish oil supplements or&#xD;
      fenofibrate alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has decreased the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality caused by HIV infection, its use has been associated with lipid abnormalities,&#xD;
      particularly elevations in serum triglycerides. Hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor in the&#xD;
      development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as pancreatitis.&#xD;
      Lipid-lowering drugs called fibrates have been part of the recommended treatment for elevated&#xD;
      triglycerides, but the response to fibrates is incomplete in a large proportion of people.&#xD;
      Fish oil capsules containing large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease&#xD;
      serum triglycerides. However, fish oil supplements or fibrates alone are often inadequate for&#xD;
      treating hypertriglyceridemia in people taking HAART. This study will determine whether the&#xD;
      combination of the two therapies will lower serum triglycerides in people on HAART more&#xD;
      effectively than either therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study comprises two steps. In Step I, participants will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either fish oil supplements or fenofibrate. Participants will be evaluated for treatment&#xD;
      response at Week 8. Those who have responded to their treatment will remain on their original&#xD;
      single agent therapy through Week 18. Those who have not responded to treatment at Week 10&#xD;
      will move on to Step 2 and begin combination therapy with both fenofibrate and fish oil until&#xD;
      Week 18. All participants will return at Week 22 for a follow-up visit. Except at the Week 10&#xD;
      visit, participants will be expected to fast prior to all study visits. Participants will&#xD;
      remain on their individual HAART regimens for the duration of the study.&#xD;

             regimen in the previous 3 months must be on stable HAART for at least 8 weeks&#xD;
             immediately prior to study entry.&#xD;
