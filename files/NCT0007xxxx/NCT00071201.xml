  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center phase 3, open-label, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of adefovir dipivoxil liquid suspension in patients&#xD;
      with chronic hepatitis B and varying degrees of renal impairment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 48 patients with chronic hepatitis B will be enrolled into four groups&#xD;
      representing varying degrees of renal function. Grouping will be achieved through estimation&#xD;
      of creatinine clearance (CLcr) using the Cockcroft-Gault method of calculation at the time of&#xD;
      screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Mild (Clcr = greater than or equal to 50 to less than 80 mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Moderate (Clcr = greater than or equal to 20 to less than 50 mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Severe (Clcr = greater than or equal to 10 to less than 20 mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4A-B: End stage renal disease (ESRD) including hemodialysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4A (Clcr = less than 10 mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4B (Patients undergoing hemodialysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit (day 0), blood and urine samples will be collected pre-dose (prior to 0&#xD;
      hour) after which patients will receive an oral dose of liquid adefovir dipivoxil according&#xD;
      to the treatment guideline outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters in plasma will be determined for the day 0 and week 12 visits for&#xD;
      all patients and at the week 48 visit for group 1, 2, 3, and 4A patients. Pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters in urine will be determined for the day 0, week 12 and week 48 visits for group 1,&#xD;
      2, 3, and 4A patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 4, 8, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44 visits, pharmacokinetic assessments in&#xD;
      plasma will be determined pre-dose (Ctrough levels) in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4A. For group 4B&#xD;
      patients, pharmacokinetic assessments will be determined at weeks 4 and 8 prior to and upon&#xD;
      completion of hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations of safety and efficacy will be conducted at 4 weekly intervals up to week 48 for&#xD;
      groups 1, 2, 3, and 4A, and up to week 12 for group 4B. At these visits, patients will&#xD;
      receive the next study medication allocation. Study medication administration will continue&#xD;
      for up to a total of 48 weeks.&#xD;
