  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well bortezomib works in treating patients with&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) that cannot be removed with surgery. Bortezomib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Proportion of confirmed tumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the confirmed and objective response rate. II. To assess patient outcome as&#xD;
      estimated by duration of response, time to disease progression, and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the adverse event rates associated with PS-341 in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the relationships between laboratory correlates (eg. IHC) and patient outcome&#xD;
      (eg p53 and disease progression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate alterations in laboratory correlates from pre-treatment measurements (ie, pre&#xD;
      and post treatment). The following immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays will be performed: IHC&#xD;
      of p53, IHC of p21, IHC of p27, IHC of NFkB, IHC of Ki67.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up&#xD;
      to 3 years from study entry.&#xD;
