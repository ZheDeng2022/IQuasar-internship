      This study will evaluate emotional processing biases in the brain while viewing facial&#xD;
      expressions in adults with current or remitted major depressive disorder and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to elucidate the neurophysiological abnormalities associated&#xD;
      with processing emotionally valenced stimuli in MDD. Neuroimaging technology has led to the&#xD;
      identification of specific abnormalities in the amygdala, ventral striatum and medial&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex in response to affective pictures. Much of the knowledge involving these&#xD;
      structures in emotion processing has been elucidated through animal models including&#xD;
      classical fear conditioning and reversal-learning paradigms. Functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) studies have applied similar techniques in humans to study emotional&#xD;
      processing. The amygdala has been shown to play a role in the learning of fear (aversive)&#xD;
      conditioning to emotional stimuli, the ventral striatum has been shown to play a role in&#xD;
      appetitive conditioning, and areas of the prefrontal cortex are recruited for extinction of&#xD;
      conditioned responses. These areas have also been implicated as key structures in the&#xD;
      abnormal expression of emotion in MDD. Dysregulation of connections between the amygdala and&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex has been hypothesized to influence depressed subjects' tendency to ruminate&#xD;
      on emotional events and memories, which may be associated with an inability to properly&#xD;
      regulate emotional processing through habituation and extinction mechanisms. Research&#xD;
      suggests that depressed individuals have an impaired ability to disengage from or habituate&#xD;
      to emotional stimuli perceived as sad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to studying emotional processing at a conscious, cortical level, significant&#xD;
      evidence suggests that many aspects of emotional processing occur below conscious awareness,&#xD;
      at a preconscious level. The technique of backward masking assesses the automaticity of&#xD;
      emotional processing and responses to affective stimuli. In MDD, backward masking serves to&#xD;
      avoid confounding interpretation by the presence of other cognitive processing, which may&#xD;
      result from depressed subjects perseverating on emotional stimuli. The proposed study builds&#xD;
      on previous fMRI research to investigate neurophysiological differences in the processing of&#xD;
      aversively conditioned emotional stimuli in depressed compared to healthy individuals. Using&#xD;
      fMRI technology and a variation of the paradigm developed by Morris et al., subjects with MDD&#xD;
      will be classically conditioned to the presence of an unmasked specific target face (angry or&#xD;
      sad) and the subsequent neural responses to the stimuli will be assessed utilizing the&#xD;
      backward masking technique. The BOLD hemodynamic response and rates of habituation and&#xD;
      extinction to the faces will be compared between depressed subjects with MDD and healthy&#xD;
      controls, currently depressed versus currently remitted subjects with MDD, and MDD subjects&#xD;
      pre- and post-antidepressant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present amendment proposes to include an additional paradigm in the testing battery. This&#xD;
      new paradigm has been extensively examined under different pharmacological manipulations, and&#xD;
      in healthy individuals undergoing fMRI but has yet to be examined in patient populations. The&#xD;
      task complements the paradigms presently included by extending the research to encompass&#xD;
      appetitive as well as aversive emotional processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be used to evaluate neural processes involved in emotional dysregulation&#xD;
      in MDD and may direct future research to potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment&#xD;
      of mood and anxiety disorders with abnormalities in emotional processing.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteers (n=65)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Control Sample (n = 30, phase 1; n = 15, phase 3; n=20, phase 5): Right-handed&#xD;
        subjects (ages 18-55) will be selected who have not met criteria for any major psychiatric&#xD;
        disorder, have no known first-degree relatives with mood disorders, and have a current&#xD;
        score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; 17 item) in the not depressed range&#xD;
        (less than or equal to 7). Control subjects will be matched to depressed subjects for age,&#xD;
        gender, and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MDD Samples (n =80)&#xD;
&#xD;
        MDD Sample-Currently Depressed (n = 30, phase 1; n = 15, phase 3; n=20, phase 5):&#xD;
        Right-handed subjects (ages 18-55) will be selected with primary MDD currently depressed by&#xD;
        DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MDD and current HDRS score in the moderately-to-severely&#xD;
        depressed range (greater than or equal to 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
        MDD Sample-Remitted Depressed (n = 15, phase 2): Right-handed subjects (ages 18-50) will be&#xD;
        selected with a past history of MDD by DSM-IV criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Relatives of MDD Subjects (n=45)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Right-handed subjects (ages 18-55) will be selected who have a first-degree relative with&#xD;
        MDD but do not themselves meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Subjects will be&#xD;
        matched to depressed and control subjects for age, gender, and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be recruited who are drug-na ve or who have not received psychotropic drugs&#xD;
        for at least 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine) prior to scanning. Effective medications will&#xD;
        not be discontinued for the purposes of the study. Subjects will also be excluded if they&#xD;
        have a) serious suicidal ideation or behavior, b) psychosis to the extent that the ability&#xD;
        to provide informed consent is in doubt, c) medical conditions or concomitant medications&#xD;
        (see Appendix III) that are likely to influence cerebral blood flow or neurological&#xD;
        function including cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine and neurological diseases, d) a&#xD;
        history of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year or a lifetime history of alcohol or drug&#xD;
        dependence (DSM-IV criteria), e) current pregnancy (as documented by pregnancy testing&#xD;
        prior to scanning), f) general MRI exclusion criteria, g) history of non-response to Zoloft&#xD;
        or of intolerable or adverse side effects during Zoloft treatment. Additional exclusion&#xD;
        criteria applied to control subjects are: a) subjects with a current or past history of&#xD;
        other axis I psychiatric conditions, b) subjects with first-degree family members with&#xD;
        current or past history of mood disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects beyond age 55 are excluded to reduce the biological heterogeneity encompassed by&#xD;
        the MDD criteria, and to reduce the variability of the BOLD signal. Subjects whose first&#xD;
        major depressive episodes arose temporally after other major medical or psychiatric&#xD;
        conditions will also be excluded, since their functional imaging results generally differ&#xD;
        from those reported in primary MDD.&#xD;
