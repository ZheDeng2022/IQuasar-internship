  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor&#xD;
      cell growth. This phase II trial is studying how well bortezomib works in treating patients&#xD;
      with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of PS-341 in patients with measurable advanced urothelial&#xD;
      transitional cell carcinoma who have not responded to, or have relapsed after one prior&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety and toxicity of PS-341 administered in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate duration of objective response, progression-free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a solitary site of disease (i.e., lung or nodal metastases) and who have a&#xD;
      partial response (PR) may be considered for surgical resection. Patients with a PR with&#xD;
      residual disease after salvage surgery are eligible to continue study therapy. Patients who&#xD;
      achieve a complete response, either through resection or bortezomib therapy, receive 2&#xD;
      additional courses of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-17&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
