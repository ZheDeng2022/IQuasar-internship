      This study will examine patients with non-small cell lung cancer metastasis, that is, the&#xD;
      distant spreading of tumors to the brain, and compare them with patients without brain&#xD;
      metastasis. The molecular and genetic events that permit tumor metastasis are not well&#xD;
      understood. There is intense investigation going on into the process in which tumor cells&#xD;
      escape the primary local tumor, spread to distant places in the body, and find and create&#xD;
      conditions that promote growth in those tissues. Metastasis of tumors such as lung cancer to&#xD;
      the brain is a common problem. Tumor cells will be analyzed with the use of microarrays. A&#xD;
      microarray is a tool for analyzing gene expression, consisting of a small membrane or glass&#xD;
      slide containing samples of many genes arranged in a regular pattern. The goal is to identify&#xD;
      a potential molecular signature. It is hoped that there will be discovery of why some&#xD;
      patients are more likely than others to develop a brain metastasis, which can have a major&#xD;
      negative effect on the quality of life and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age with known or evidence by radiology of a non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      metastatic to the brain, either squamous cells or adenocarcinoma tumors, or those who have&#xD;
      had a removal of a brain tumor for diagnosis or treatment may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures and tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Craniotomy, that is, surgical opening of the skull, and removal of the brain tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood specimens taken from a central vein or artery before the operation, throughout as&#xD;
           needed, and for several days afterward, to measure blood chemistries, blood count, and&#xD;
           so forth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and imaging of the central nervous system before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine or serum, or both, pregnancy test of women of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also undergo blood tests at 3-month intervals after surgery for up to 5 years.&#xD;
      The purpose is to determine if there are tumor cells in the blood, which may explain how they&#xD;
      reached the brain.&#xD;

      Introduction: The molecular and genetic events that permit tumor metastasis are not well&#xD;
      understood. The process whereby tumor cells escape the primary, local tumor, spread to&#xD;
      distant sites in the body and find and create conditions conducive to growth in these&#xD;
      disparate tissues remains an area of intense investigation. Metastasis of epithelial tumors,&#xD;
      such as lung cancer, to the brain is a common problem, with significant consequences with&#xD;
      respect to neurological dysfunction and shortening of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To study two subset of patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastatic&#xD;
      to the brain, to identify genes and proteins that facilitate metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 78 patients with NSCLC (n=39 squamous cell (SQ), and n=39 adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (AC) tumors) metastatic to the brain to compare with published microarray studies of&#xD;
      non-metastatic NSCLC patients with these tumor types as well as with one another to help&#xD;
      explain the differential trend toward metastasis in some patients with NSCLC and not others,&#xD;
      as well as the differential trend to brain metastasis in the AC subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Risks and Benefits: Less than minimal risk to the patients to sample tissue&#xD;
      already removed from the brain as part of medically-necessary surgery and to sample blood. No&#xD;
      direct benefit to the patient is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Estimate and Potential Meaning for the Field: That this very detailed investigation&#xD;
      of the genes and proteins expressed differentially between the non-metastatic and metastatic&#xD;
      NSCLCs, as well as between SQ and AC subtypes will identify new or previously-unsuspected&#xD;
      targets for new therapies to either prevent the development of brain metastasis or to treat&#xD;
      brain metastases more effectively.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A patient with a known or with radiographic evidence of a NSCLC neoplasm metastatic to&#xD;
             the brain, either SQ or AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Medically-indicated (diagnostic and/or therapeutic) brain tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Informed consent from female patient, age 18 or older. In general, patients less than&#xD;
             18 years of age rarely have NSCLC metastatic to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Inability to provide informed consent prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Medical conditions that cannot be corrected prior to surgery that would be standard&#xD;
             contraindications for craniotomy (brain tumor patients).&#xD;
