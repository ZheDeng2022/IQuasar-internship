  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease Type II) is caused by a deficiency of a&#xD;
      critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the&#xD;
      body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures&#xD;
      called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates&#xD;
      and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their&#xD;
      normal function. The objective of this protocol is to provide enzyme replacement therapy with&#xD;
      rhGAA on an expanded access basis, to severely affected patients with infantile-onset Pompe&#xD;
      disease for whom there is no alternative treatment and who do not meet the clinical&#xD;
      characteristics described in the inclusion criteria for participation in other Genzyme&#xD;
      Corporation-sponsored study currently enrolling patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient or the patient's legal guardian(s) must provide written informed consent&#xD;
             prior to any study-related procedures being performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have a diagnosis of infantile-onset Pompe disease as defined by: a)&#xD;
             The patient has/had onset of symptoms compatible with Pompe disease by 12 months of&#xD;
             age adjusted for gestation, if necessary. Age at onset of symptoms must be documented&#xD;
             in the patient's medical record(s). AND b) The patient has documented GAA deficiency,&#xD;
             i.e., below the laboratory-defined cut-off value as determined by the laboratory&#xD;
             performing the GAA enzyme activity assay. Tissues used for determination of GAA&#xD;
             deficiency may include blood, muscle or skin fibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients less than or equal to 6 months of age must have one of the following: a)&#xD;
             Cardiomyopathy, defined as a LVMI determined by cross-sectional echocardiography; OR&#xD;
             b) a requirement for invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support, where non-invasive&#xD;
             ventilation is defined as any form of ventilatory support applied without the use of&#xD;
             an endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients greater than 6 months of age must have 2 of the following: a) Cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
             defined as a LVMI determined by cross-sectional echocardiography; b) a requirement for&#xD;
             invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support, where non-invasive ventilation is&#xD;
             defined as any form of ventilatory support applied without the use of an endotracheal&#xD;
             tube; OR c) Severe motor delay, defined as failure to perform gross motor skills&#xD;
             achieved by 90% of normal aged peers on the Denver Developmental Assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient or his/her legal guardian(s) must have the ability to comply with the&#xD;
             clinical protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major congenital abnormality;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant organic disease (with the exception of symptoms relating to&#xD;
             infantile-onset Pompe disease), including clinically significant cardiovascular,&#xD;
             hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, or renal disease, or other medical condition, serious&#xD;
             intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would preclude participation in the study or potentially decrease&#xD;
             survival.&#xD;
