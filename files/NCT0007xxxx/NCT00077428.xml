  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well bortezomib followed by doxorubicin at the time of&#xD;
      disease progression works in treating patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or&#xD;
      metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (cancer) of the head and neck. Bortezomib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing&#xD;
      so they stop growing or die. Combining bortezomib with doxorubicin may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Determine the objective tumor response in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced, recurrent, or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck treated with&#xD;
      bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary I. Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug. II.&#xD;
      Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the toxic&#xD;
      effects of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the objective tumor response, time to&#xD;
      progression, and overall survival of patients who progress on single-agent bortezomib and are&#xD;
      then treated with doxorubicin and bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. VI. Determine the profile&#xD;
      and concentration of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines in serum of patients before and in&#xD;
      response to this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Correlate the expression of biomarkers which may be affected by the ubiquitin-proteasome&#xD;
      degradation pathway (NF-kB, p53, p27, cyclin D1, cyclin E, vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      [VEGF], MVD, V-CAM, and N-CAM) on tumor tissue with the clinical activity of bortezomib in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease&#xD;
      progression continue to receive bortezomib as above and doxorubicin IV over 2-5 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 14 courses in the absence of further&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 8 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.3 years.&#xD;
