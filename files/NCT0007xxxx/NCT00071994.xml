    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who have advanced&#xD;
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the ability of ZD1839 to improve progression free survival in patients with&#xD;
      advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate response rate of ZD1839 in advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the effect of ZD1839 on measurable disease in patients with unresectable&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate the effect of ZD1839 on serum alpha-fetoprotein levels in patients with abnormal&#xD;
      pretreatment serum levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate toxicity of ZD1839 in advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Investigate biologic markers for outcome in patients with unresectable hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma treated with ZD1839.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral gefitinib daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for 3 years from study entry.&#xD;

                       expression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;=&#xD;

             of birth control) for the duration of their participation in the study; should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;

          -  Patients must not have had prior systemic chemotherapy, biologic therapy or&#xD;
             antiangiogenesis therapy; prior therapy with interferon alpha or interferon beta for&#xD;
             treatment of hepatitis B or C is allowed provided&#xD;

          -  Patients must not have a history of other malignancies that are active and require&#xD;
             therapy (other than local therapies for non melanoma skin cancers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have known brain metastases; their poor prognosis would present&#xD;
             challenges and their tendency to develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would&#xD;
