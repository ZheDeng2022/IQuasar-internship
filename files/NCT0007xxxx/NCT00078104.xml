      This study will evaluate how well different medications work to relieve pain following third&#xD;
      molar (wisdom tooth) extraction. Scientists believe that hormone-like substances called&#xD;
      prostanoids contribute to pain following oral surgery. Prostanoids are produced by&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. This study will examine how different medicines inhibit the COX&#xD;
      enzymes and reduce the amount of prostanoids, and thus the amount of inflammation and pain.&#xD;
      The study will also look at genetic factors involved in the production of prostanoids and the&#xD;
      response to pain medication. (Only the bottom two wisdom teeth are extracted for this study.&#xD;
      Patients whose top wisdom teeth also need to be removed will have those teeth extracted, also&#xD;
      free of charge, at least 2 weeks after the first surgery.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 16 and 35 years of age who are in general good health and&#xD;
      who require third molar extraction may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened&#xD;
      with a medical history and oral examination, including dental x-rays as needed to confirm the&#xD;
      need for third molar removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of surgery, patients have blood drawn to obtain DNA for genetic study. Women&#xD;
      of childbearing age have a urine pregnancy test. One hour before surgery, patients receive a&#xD;
      dose of rofecoxib (Vioxx® (Registered Trademark)), acetaminophen (Tylenol® (Registered&#xD;
      Trademark)), or placebo (a pill with no active ingredient). A half-hour before surgery, they&#xD;
      receive either a standard painkiller called keterolac (Toradol® (Registered Trademark))) or&#xD;
      placebo through an arm vein. All patients also receive the sedative midazolam (Versed®&#xD;
      (Registered Trademark)), also through an arm vein, to induce drowsiness and a local&#xD;
      anesthetic (lidocaine) to numb the mouth. After the mouth is numbed, but before the wisdom&#xD;
      teeth are extracted, a biopsy (removal of a small piece of tissue) is conducted in the area&#xD;
      of the cheek next to the wisdom tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery, a small piece of tubing is placed into both extraction sites. Every 20&#xD;
      minutes for the next 3 hours, inflammatory fluid is collected from the tubing to measure&#xD;
      chemicals that are believed to cause pain and swelling. Patients complete questionnaires&#xD;
      every 20 minutes to rate their pain. Those who still have pain an hour after surgery may&#xD;
      request and receive a &quot;rescue drug&quot; called tramadol (Ultram® (Registered Trademark)) for pain&#xD;
      relief. Patients remain in the clinic from 3 to 6 hours to monitor the effects of the study&#xD;
      drugs as the anesthetic wears off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery a second biopsy is done to measure any changes in the chemicals being produced&#xD;
      in response to the surgery. For this biopsy, patients are assigned to one of two groups - one&#xD;
      group has the second biopsy within 3 hours of surgery, before taking the rescue drug, and the&#xD;
      other group returns to the clinic the next morning for a biopsy 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
      Patients in the second group leave the clinic after surgery with two pain medications&#xD;
      (tramadol and the study drug) and forms to record pain ratings at home. They are permitted to&#xD;
      take only the pain medications provided and only at certain times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of their participation in the study, all patients are given the pain medication&#xD;
      flurbiprofen (Ocufen® (Registered Trademark)) to take at home.&#xD;

      Two cyclooxygenase isozymes, COX-1 and -2, are known to catalyze the rate-limiting step of&#xD;
      prostaglandin synthesis and are the targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.&#xD;
      Recently, the presence of a variant of COX-1, named COX-3, has been demonstrated that is&#xD;
      especially sensitive to acetaminophen and strongly expressed in brain tissue. The proposed&#xD;
      study will examine prostanoid suppression in the periphery by inhibition of COX-1, -2, and&#xD;
      -3, and evaluate the time course of expression of COX isoenzymes in terms of level of mRNA&#xD;
      and protein itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (N equals 88) will be healthy volunteers scheduled for the surgical removal of&#xD;
      impacted third molars. Using a double-blinded, randomized, parallel study design, subjects&#xD;
      will be allocated to one of four treatment groups and will be administered a dose of blinded&#xD;
      medication or placebo. One hour prior to oral surgery, rofecoxib 50 mg, acetaminophen 1000 mg&#xD;
      or placebo in two groups will be administered orally. Half hour prior to surgery, ketorolac&#xD;
      30 mg or placebo, will be administered intravenously. Microdialysis will be performed with&#xD;
      sample collection concurrent with pain report over the immediate postoperative period of&#xD;
      three hours, and the collected transudate will be analyzed by ELISA to evaluate prostanoid&#xD;
      (prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2) production. Subjects within each group will be further&#xD;
      randomized to have a biopsy collected at baseline prior to surgery and either at the time&#xD;
      when a subject asks for rescue drug within 3 hours or at 24 hours following surgery. The&#xD;
      biopsies will be frozen in liquid nitrogen and assayed later by RT-PCR for levels of COX-1,&#xD;
      COX-2, or COX-3 mRNA, and by microarray for evaluation of change in overall mRNA expression.&#xD;
      A portion of the biopsy samples will be immunostained to reveal the tissue-specific pattern&#xD;
      of each COX isoenzymes expression within the inflammatory tissue, and another part of the&#xD;
      biopsy samples will be analyzed by Western blot to quantify the amount of protein. Fifty ml&#xD;
      of blood will be collected from all subjects, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)&#xD;
      in the genes regulated by inflammatory responses such as COX-1, COX-2, PGE receptors (EPs),&#xD;
      and microsomal PGE synthase (mPGES) genes, will be analyzed to investigate the role of&#xD;
      genetic factors in individual differences of drug responses. The analgesic effect of the&#xD;
      drugs will be assessed in the clinic every 20 minutes for the first three hours after&#xD;
      extractions, and on the next morning before taking any medication using two pain intensity&#xD;
      assessment instruments: a category scale, and a visual analog scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that non-selective COX inhibitor, the selective COX-2 inhibitor, and the&#xD;
      selective COX-3 inhibitor will differentially alter prostanoid production over the time&#xD;
      course evaluated, and that primary sensory neurons innervating in the inflammatory tissues&#xD;
      may differentially express COX isoenzymes that differ in sensitivity to prototypic NSAIDs,&#xD;
      coxibs, and acetaminophen. We also anticipate that several SNPs will contribute to the&#xD;
      individual differences in COX expression and drug responses, which has implications for&#xD;
      individual variation in pain, analgesic responses, and neuronal plasticity.&#xD;
