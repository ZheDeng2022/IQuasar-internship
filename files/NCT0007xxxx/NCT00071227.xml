  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new formulation of triamcinolone&#xD;
      acetonide for the treatment of retinal blood vessel disorders. Triamcinolone is a steroid&#xD;
      drug that decreases inflammation and scarring and is routinely used to treat eye inflammation&#xD;
      or swelling. The commercially available form of this drug is associated with potentially&#xD;
      harmful side effects thought to be due to preservatives in the preparation. This study will&#xD;
      use a formulation that does not contain these potentially harmful preservatives. Preliminary&#xD;
      findings from other studies suggest that injection of steroids in the eye can reduce retinal&#xD;
      thickening and improve vision. However, they may also cause mild discomfort and lead to&#xD;
      vision-threatening conditions. The effects of the drug on the conditions under study in this&#xD;
      protocol are not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the following conditions involving disorders of retinal blood vessels may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Choroidal neovascularization associated with age-related macular degeneration (50 years&#xD;
           of age and older)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion (18 years of age and older)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetic macular edema ((18 years of age and older)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and eye pressure, and to&#xD;
           examine pupils, lens, retina and eye movements. The pupils will be dilated with drops&#xD;
           for this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected&#xD;
           into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina&#xD;
           are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if&#xD;
           any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel&#xD;
           abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indocyanine green angiography to identify feeder vessels that may be supplying abnormal&#xD;
           blood vessels. This procedure is similar to fluorescein angiography, but uses a green&#xD;
           dye and flashes an invisible light.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography to measure retinal thickness. This test shines a light into&#xD;
           the eye and produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. These measurements are&#xD;
           repeated during the study to determine if retinal thickening is getting better or worse,&#xD;
           or staying the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stereoscopic color fundus photography to examine the back of the eye. The pupils are&#xD;
           dilated with eye drops to allow examination and photography of the back of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triamcinolone acetonide injection to treat the eye. A numbing eye drop, an antibiotic&#xD;
           eye drop, and an injected antibiotic are put in the eye before triamcinolone acetonide&#xD;
           is injected into the eye's vitreous (jelly-like substance inside the eye). After the&#xD;
           injection, the patient lies on his or her back for 30 minutes. An antibiotic eye&#xD;
           ointment is used for 2 days following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure liver and kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients return to the clinic for follow-up visits 1, 4, and 7 days, and 1 month after the&#xD;
      first treatment. Patients whose condition does not improve after 3 months do not receive any&#xD;
      more injections, but return for eye examinations at least once a year for 3 years. Patients&#xD;
      whose condition improves with treatment return for follow-up visits 6 and 9 months after the&#xD;
      first injection and then every 6 months for 2 more years. At each visit, a determination is&#xD;
      made whether another injection is needed. After each repeat injection, patients return for&#xD;
      follow-up visits at 1, 4, and 7 days after the injection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The use of intravitreal injections of corticosteroid (triamcinolone acetonide) appears to be&#xD;
      a promising treatment for a variety of ocular diseases associated with inflammation. To date,&#xD;
      the only drug available, 'Kenalog-40 Injection' produced by Bristol Myers Squibb, has not&#xD;
      been formulated for intraocular use. This formulation when used intraocularly has been&#xD;
      associated with cases of non-bacterial endophthalmitis, which is thought to be due to the&#xD;
      presence of benzyl alcohol and/or polysorbate 80. Both are suspected irritants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a novel preservative-free formulation&#xD;
      of triamcinolone acetonide (TAC-PF) at four dosage levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be an open-label, single-masked, randomized Phase I study that will&#xD;
      investigate the safety and potential efficacy of the new formulation of TAC-PF. Sixteen&#xD;
      participants with retinal vascular disease will be randomly assigned to receive via&#xD;
      intravitreal injection at one of 4 dose levels (1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, or 16 mg) of TAC-PF.&#xD;
      Depending on a participant's response, injections may be repeated at up to 3 month intervals.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be an assessment of post-injection intraocular toxicity related&#xD;
      events including increased inflammation, increased intraocular pressure, significant&#xD;
      decreases in BCVA, cataract formation, retinal detachment, and intraocular hemorrhage. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be an improvement of 15 letters in best-corrected visual acuity&#xD;
      (BCVA, ETDRS) from baseline to year 3, and decreases in retinal thickening and area of&#xD;
      leakage.&#xD;
