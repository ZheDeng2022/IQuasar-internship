  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of tigecycline in the treatment of subjects with selected&#xD;
      serious infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacteria, eg, Acinetobacter baumannii,&#xD;
      Enterobacter species, Klebsiella pneumoniae or other resistant gram-negative pathogens, for&#xD;
      whom antibiotics have failed or who cannot tolerate other appropriate antimicrobial&#xD;
      therapies. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the clinical response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects aged 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Isolation of a resistant gram-negative pathogen, eg, Enterobacter species,&#xD;
             Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or other resistant gram-negative&#xD;
             pathogens, alone or as 1 isolate of a polymicrobial infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resistant gram-negative organisms are defined by the likely presence of ESBL or&#xD;
             related mechanisms which limit the therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of&#xD;
             complicated infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any concomitant condition or taking any concomitant medication that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, could preclude an evaluation of a response or make it&#xD;
             unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy or follow-up assessment will be&#xD;
             completed or that will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's&#xD;
             participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated length of antibiotic therapy &lt; 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to tigecycline or other compounds related to this&#xD;
             class of antibacterial agents (eg, tetracyclines, minocycline, doxycycline)&#xD;
