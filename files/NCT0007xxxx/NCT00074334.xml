      RATIONALE: The TP-38 toxin can locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells.&#xD;
      Giving TP-38 toxin directly into the tumor may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of TP-38 toxin&#xD;
      administered directly into the brain and to see how well it works in treating young patients&#xD;
      with recurrent or progressive supratentorial high-grade glioma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the maximum safe volume rate and maximum tolerated infusion concentration&#xD;
                of TGFa-PE38 toxin (TP-38) infused through 2 or 3 catheters in pediatric patients&#xD;
                with recurrent or progressive supratentorial high-grade glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Describe the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Estimate the efficacy of this drug, in terms of post-infusion survival, in these&#xD;
                patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I and II&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the prevalence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and&#xD;
                phosphorylation (activity) in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Correlate EGFR expression with qualitative measures (e.g., histology, grade, and&#xD;
                other tumor characteristics) and tumor response, survival, and progression-free&#xD;
                survival in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II Only&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Estimate the objective response rate in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Estimate the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients in the phase I portion of the&#xD;
      study are stratified according to the number of successfully placed catheters (3 catheters vs&#xD;
      2 catheters). Patients in the phase II portion of the study are stratified according to time&#xD;
      of recurrence of high-grade glioma (first vs second or greater) and by surgery extent&#xD;
      (surgical resection vs stereotactic biopsy) for those with first recurrence only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Patients undergo stereotactic biopsy or resection of the tumor followed by&#xD;
           intratumoral (or tumor bed) catheter placement for treatment infusion. Within 12-48&#xD;
           hours after intratumoral (or tumor bed) catheter placement, patients receive TGFa-PE38&#xD;
           toxin (TP-38) intratumorally through 2 or 3 catheters over 33 to 124 hours. Treatment&#xD;
           continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients (in each stratum) receive escalating volumes until the maximum safe&#xD;
      volume (MSV) is determined. Cohorts of 3-6 patients (in each stratum) receive escalating&#xD;
      concentrations at the MSV until the maximum tolerated infusion concentration (MTIC) is&#xD;
      determined. The MSV and MTIC are defined as the volume and concentration preceding that at&#xD;
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MSV and MTIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I patients are followed post catheter placement, daily during TP-38 infusion, at 30&#xD;
      days, and then every 2 months for 1 year. Phase II patients will be followed for an&#xD;
      additional year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-105 patients (6-60 for phase I and 45 for phase II) will be&#xD;
      accrued for this study.&#xD;
