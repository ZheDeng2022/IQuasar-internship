  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the use of the humanized Mik-Beta-1 (Hu Mik-(SqrRoot) 1) monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody in patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis&#xD;
      (HAM/TSP). Some patients infected with the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) virus&#xD;
      develop HAM/TSP, a disease in which the immune response to HTLV-1 becomes directed against&#xD;
      the person's own body in what is called an autoimmune response. Hu-Mik-Beta-1 is a&#xD;
      genetically engineered antibody that blocks the action of a chemical produced by the body&#xD;
      during infection or inflammation called interleukin 15 (IL-15). Blocking IL-15 may prevent&#xD;
      the autoimmune response that results in HAM/TSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with HAM/TSP may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, and an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram. Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline visit(s): Repeat physical examination and blood and urine tests, as well as the&#xD;
           following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lumbar puncture: A local anesthetic is injected to numb the skin of the lower back.&#xD;
                A needle is inserted in the space between the bones where the cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
                that bathes the brain and spinal cord circulates below the spinal cord. About 4&#xD;
                tablespoons of fluid is collected through the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test uses radio waves and magnets to produce&#xD;
                images of body tissues and organs. The patient lies on a table that slides into a&#xD;
                metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During part of the scan, a&#xD;
                contrast agent is injected to brighten the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Apheresis: This procedure is used to collect large quantities of white blood cells.&#xD;
                Whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and directed into a&#xD;
                machine that separates it into its components by spinning. The white cells and&#xD;
                plasma are removed and the rest of the blood (red cells and platelets) is returned&#xD;
                to the body through the same needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hu Mik-Beta-1 treatment: Infusions of Hu Mik-Beta-1 are given through a vein every 3&#xD;
           weeks for nine doses. The first treatment requires at least an overnight hospital stay;&#xD;
           subsequent infusions are given in the outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood and urine tests and a physical examination at every treatment visit and a skin&#xD;
           test at one treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research tests at the end of the 24-week treatment period, including lumbar puncture&#xD;
           (spinal tap), MRI scan, and apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After completing treatment, patients have three follow-up clinic visits for blood and&#xD;
           urine tests, and a skin test at one follow-up visit.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a phase I trial we wish to determine the toxicity and provide preliminary clinical&#xD;
      response information following the administration of humanized MiK-beta-1 (Hu MiK-Beta1), a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody directed toward IL-2/IL-15R Beta (CD122), in patients with&#xD;
      HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). This antibody blocks the&#xD;
      action of IL-15, a cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of HTLV-I associated diseases and&#xD;
      autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAM/TSP affects about 1% of patients infected with the human T lymphotropic virus type 1&#xD;
      (HTLV-I), manifesting as progressive myelopathy. Several features of the immune response in&#xD;
      HAM/TSP indicate that IL-15 may be critical to its pathogenesis. HTLV-I transactivates IL-15&#xD;
      and IL-15 R alpha expression through its tax protein, and supports the activation of&#xD;
      lymphocytes in HAM/TSP, as evidenced by their spontaneous proliferation in ex vivo culture.&#xD;
      We showed that the antibody HuMiK-Beta1 could inhibit this spontaneous lymphoproliferation.&#xD;
      In addition, IL-15 has been shown to have a preferential positive effect on the survival of&#xD;
      CD8+ T-cells, especially those of the memory phenotype. In HAM/TSP, an extraordinarily high&#xD;
      frequency of tax specific CD8+ T-cells in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid is&#xD;
      postulated to participate in the damage to the central nervous system. We have demonstrated&#xD;
      that the addition of Hu MiK-Beta1 to ex vivo cells from HAM/TSP patients led to a marked&#xD;
      decline in tax specific CD8+ T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the Study and Outcome Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single center, open label trial, four subjects with HAM/TSP will receive 0.5 mg/kg Hu&#xD;
      MiK-beta1 dosed every three weeks for a total of five doses, and two subjects with HAM/TSP&#xD;
      will receive placebo (normal saline) under the same dosing schedule. In addition, following&#xD;
      the completion of the 0.5 mg/kg dose administration in four subjects with HAM/TSP, a dose&#xD;
      escalation study will be performed with three subjects with HAM/TSP receiving 1.0 mg/kg of Hu&#xD;
      MiK-beta1 at three week intervals for a total of five doses per subject, and three subjects&#xD;
      with HAM/TSP receiving 1.5 mg/kg of Hu MiK-beta1 at three week intervals for a total of five&#xD;
      doses per subject A Total of 10 subjects will receive study drug/placebo. We anticipate&#xD;
      consenting up to eighteen subjects to allow for up to eight dropouts. Participants who&#xD;
      withdraw voluntarily (not due to toxicity) after initiation of the study are considered&#xD;
      dropouts. If this occurs prior to receiving three doses of the study medication the subjects&#xD;
      can be replaced and should have three follow-up evaluations at four-week intervals following&#xD;
      the last dose of the study drug. Patients who voluntarily drop out after receiving at least 3&#xD;
      doses of the study drug will remain in the study and continue the protocol-specific&#xD;
      evaluations. Toxicity will be assessed using standard criteria. The clinical response will be&#xD;
      evaluated using standardized scales including expanded disability status scale, Scripps&#xD;
      neurologic rating scale and ambulation index. In addition, viral and immunologic outcome&#xD;
      measures will include assays of spontaneous lymphoproliferation analysis of HTLV-I tax&#xD;
      tetramer specific CD8+ cells, HTLV-I proviral load determination and T-cell phenotype&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
