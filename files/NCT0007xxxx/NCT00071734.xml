  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the central regions and brain activation patterns associated with&#xD;
      simple vocal behaviors under conditions of normal auditory feedback-when people hear&#xD;
      themselves speak. Such feedback plays a major role in learning and maintaining human voice&#xD;
      control. But voice control can be harmed by neurological injury or disease, reducing the&#xD;
      ability of a person to orally communicate. Research has shown that auditory feedback is&#xD;
      continuously monitored, brought about by both automatic and voluntary corrections in the&#xD;
      amplitude (loudness) and frequency of (pitch) of the human voice. This study aims to&#xD;
      determine which areas of the brain have activity dependent on the level of blood oxygen. It&#xD;
      will provide new knowledge about basic vocal motor control and provide a basis for&#xD;
      investigations into the integration of hearing and speaking in human vocal expression&#xD;
      throughout life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants 18 to 45 years of age with normal hearing and voice function and with a steady&#xD;
      heart rate may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated by a speech-language specialist, regarding a history of voice&#xD;
      health and measures of voice function. They will be tested on their ability to vary voice&#xD;
      amplitude and frequency and tested on their hearing. Also, they will undergo an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram to determine their heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study, participants will undergo an MRI scan. During the MRI scan, patients will lie&#xD;
      still on a table that can slide in and out of a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong&#xD;
      magnetic field. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans between 45&#xD;
      and 90 minutes. Patients may be asked to lie still for up to 90 minutes at a time. As the&#xD;
      scanner takes pictures, there will be loud knocking noises, and patients will wear headphones&#xD;
      to muffle the sound. The headphones will also enable patients to hear their voice. The&#xD;
      patient's head will be positioned with a coil of 25 to 30 cm diameter and supported by a&#xD;
      headrest. A microphone will be placed about 2 cm from the patient's mouth for communication&#xD;
      and collection of data. Also, an angled mirror will be attached to the head coil, so that the&#xD;
      patient can look outside of the scanner. By way of a projection screen, the patient will&#xD;
      receive a visual cue to vocalize, or use his or her voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to repeatedly do some of the following vocalization tasks: (1) rest,&#xD;
      (2) hum or sigh without voicing (exhale), (3) hum or sigh audibly, (4) hum audibly while&#xD;
      increasing or decreasing voice frequency, and (5) hum audibly while increasing or decreasing&#xD;
      voice amplitude. During the scan, patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at&#xD;
      all times and may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. Some scans may be done in a&#xD;
      3 Tesla scanner. It is the latest advance in MRI, with a stronger magnetic field than in the&#xD;
      more common 1.5 Tesla scanner. Functional MRI is done while a person is performing tasks,&#xD;
      such as moving a limb or speaking. The fMRI scan will take about 1 hour.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Auditory feedback plays a uniquely prominent role in the learning and maintenance of human&#xD;
      voice control. Yet much of what is known about central voice motor control has come from&#xD;
      research in non-human primates during production of genetically-determined vocalizations that&#xD;
      do not rely upon auditory feedback. Extrapolation from studies of bat echolocation suggest&#xD;
      that midbrain networks underlie automatic audiovocal error correction in humans; however,&#xD;
      bats and humans differ greatly in anatomical and physiology.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Males and females of any race or ethnicity will be eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers must be between the ages of 18 and 45 with normal hearing and voice function.&#xD;
        Participants will be further selected for having a steady heart rate. A history of voice&#xD;
        training is not required, but participants must be able to produce grossly independent&#xD;
        voice F0 and amplitude changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraindications to participation include: pregnancy, cardiac pacemaker or auto&#xD;
        defibrillator, artificial heart valve, neural pacemaker, surgical metal clips in the brain,&#xD;
        eye, or on blood vessels, cochlear implants, ocular implants or foreign bodies such as&#xD;
        metal shavings or splinters, insulin pump, implanted drug infusion device, shrapnel, bullet&#xD;
        or shot wound, and tattooed makeup. Participants will be screened with the NMR Center&#xD;
        Safety Screening Questionnaire which also includes items such as intraventricular shunts,&#xD;
        transdermal medication patches, wire sutures, bone/joint pins, screws, nails, or plates,&#xD;
        and body piercings. Given that surgical staples, orthopedic pins, orthodontic braces and&#xD;
        dental implants are no longer considered absolute contraindications in MRI, Dr. Saxon or&#xD;
        Dr. Kearney will approve or disapprove participation in the study based on their judgment&#xD;
        of the MR compatibility of these items, using published guides including those referenced&#xD;
        above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will be also excluded if they are found to be pregnant, report any tendency&#xD;
        toward claustrophobia or are unable for any reason to lie still within an MR scanner.&#xD;
