  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adding extended-release galantamine&#xD;
      hydrobromide, compared with adding placebo, to current atypical antipsychotic therapy is well&#xD;
      tolerated and effective in improving cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Galantamine acts on acetylcholinesterase, and has been shown to effectively treat cognitive&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Previous cellular research of nicotinic&#xD;
      receptors has shown promising results, and it is theorized that the nicotinic system of&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia may be abnormal and may play an important role in the cognitive&#xD;
      symptoms associated with schizophrenia. It is also postulated that galantamine may improve&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and apathy in patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. Atypical antipsychotic medications are effective treatment for&#xD;
      schizophrenia patients but some symptoms remain. Therefore, galantamine may be a useful&#xD;
      cotreatment for schizophrenia patients on atypical antipsychotic treatment. This is a pilot&#xD;
      dose-ranging, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance),&#xD;
      double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being&#xD;
      taken, or at what dosage), placebo-controlled multicenter study that examines the effects of&#xD;
      taking extended-release galantamine hydrobromide (16 or 24 mg once daily) or placebo on the&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia patients who are already taking an&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotic medication. The safety of combined treatment is also examined.&#xD;
      Measures of effectiveness include the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to measure&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia; the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale to&#xD;
      measure change over the course of the study; the Brief Assessment of Cognition in&#xD;
      Schizophrenia (BACS) for verbal memory and learning, working memory, motor function,&#xD;
      attention, verbal fluency, and executive functioning; the Continuous Performance Test (CPT)&#xD;
      for sustained attention and distractability; reaction time test (RTT) and finger tapping test&#xD;
      (FTT) for psychomotor speed; Lexical and Semantic Fluency Test (LSFT) for language skills. As&#xD;
      schizophrenia patients are a population with high nicotine use, and galantamine may act on&#xD;
      nicotine receptors, blood levels of nicotine are also measured as varying nicotine levels&#xD;
      could alter the effects of galantamine. The null hypothesis that there is no difference&#xD;
      between the 2 groups (galantamine cotreatment and placebo) will be tested for each of the&#xD;
      efficacy measurements (total PANSS, BACS, and CGI scores) at Week 8. Measures of safety&#xD;
      include physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      measurement of plasma prolactin concentrations, pregnancy test for women, and incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events. Adverse events that might be related to the medications are also monitored&#xD;
      using the Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale (SAS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating&#xD;
      Scale (BARS), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Extended-release&#xD;
      galantamine hydrobromide or matching placebo capsules for once-daily dosing. Patients take 8&#xD;
      milligrams (mg) per day during Week 1, 16 mg per day during Week 2, and 16 mg or 24 mg per&#xD;
      day (depending on randomization) during Weeks 3 to 8. Treatment groups are placebo capsule,&#xD;
      16 mg capsule, 24 mg capsule.&#xD;
