  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters (blood concentrations)&#xD;
      of i.m. paliperidone palmitate after administration in 2 different injection sites (deltoid&#xD;
      or gluteal).&#xD;

      An i.m. paliperidone palmitate long-acting formulation is under development with the aim to&#xD;
      provide a sustained and stable level of paliperidone during each treatment cycle. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the similarity in pharmacokinetic (blood levels) and safety&#xD;
      profile after 2 intramuscular injections of paliperidone palmitate in the arm (deltoid&#xD;
      muscle) and the buttock (gluteal muscle), in the dose range that will be covered in later&#xD;
      Phase 3 trials (25 - 150 mg eq.). This is a repeated-dose, open-label, parallel group study&#xD;
      in patients with schizophrenia. The study consists of an up to 5-day screening period, an up&#xD;
      to 3-day tolerability period, a 14-day washout period, and a 64-day treatment period. As&#xD;
      paliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone, all patients will be exposed to oral&#xD;
      risperidone during the screening period to confirm that they do not develop allergic&#xD;
      reactions to risperidone, and to help the investigator to assign patients to 1 of the 2&#xD;
      treatment doses. There will be a washout of at least 2 weeks after the last oral risperidone&#xD;
      intake before patients receive the first injection of paliperidone palmitate. Each treatment&#xD;
      group (arm or buttock injection) will receive 2 consecutive i.m. injections of the&#xD;
      long-acting formulation of paliperidone palmitate with a one-week interval. Whole blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected for the determination of paliperidone palmitate and paliperidone&#xD;
      concentrations in plasma. Whole blood samples will be obtained by venipuncture (needle stick)&#xD;
      immediately before (pre-dose) and at 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the 1st and 2nd&#xD;
      injections of paliperidone palmitate. Following the collection of the 96-hour blood sample&#xD;
      after the 2nd injection, additional samples will be collected every 3 to 7 days through the&#xD;
      end of the 64-day treatment period. Safety will assessed throughout the study by monitoring&#xD;
      adverse events; changes in clinical laboratory results; tardive dyskinesia will be rated&#xD;
      using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), akathisia will be rated according to&#xD;
      the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), extrapyramidal symptoms will be evaluated using the&#xD;
      Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS); physical examinations; electrocardiograms (ECGs); and&#xD;
      patient evaluation of the injection site. Paliperidone palmitate (25 or 150 mg eq.), 2 i.m.&#xD;
      doses administered at a 1-week interval. Depending on the randomized treatment group, each&#xD;
      patient will receive 3 doses of oral risperidone: either 1 mg once daily for 3 days or 2 mg&#xD;
      once on the 1st day, 4 mg once on the 2nd day, and 6 mg once on the 3rd day.&#xD;
