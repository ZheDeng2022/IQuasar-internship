      Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. This phase I trial&#xD;
      is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating patients with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the toxicity associated with repeated vaccination with an admixture of&#xD;
      recombinant vaccinia viruses (rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM vaccine&#xD;
      admixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the toxicity of adding GM-CSF to the admixture of the rV-MUC-1 and&#xD;
      rV-TRICOM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess host immune reactivity following rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM with and without GM-CSF&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether vaccination with rV-MUC-1 and rV-TRICOM with and without GM-CSF is&#xD;
      associated with antitumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive vaccination comprising recombinant vaccinia-MUC-1 and recombinant&#xD;
      vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine intradermally on days 1 and 29 (for a total of 2 doses) in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of recombinant vaccinia-MUC-1 and&#xD;
      recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The&#xD;
      MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 10 patients (including 5&#xD;
      HLA-A2-positive patients) receive vaccination as above at the MTD and sargramostim (GM-CSF)&#xD;
      subcutaneously on days 1-4 and 29-32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, monthly until disease progression, and then annually for up&#xD;
      to 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-22 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

             investigator is incompatible with the protocol; subjects with active infections&#xD;
             requiring antibiotics are not eligible until the infection has cleared and the&#xD;
             antibiotics have been stopped for at least 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have had prior vaccinia (smallpox) exposure, determined by subject&#xD;
             history, medical documentation, or scar characteristic of vaccinia exposure; there&#xD;
