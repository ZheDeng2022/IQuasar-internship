      This study will examine how depression, anxiety, and migraine run in families. It will help&#xD;
      in defining the risk factors for physical, mental, and health problems-as well as define ways&#xD;
      that those problems may be prevented and treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A broad range of ages among family members will be included to evaluate the patterns of how&#xD;
      these disorders are expressed throughout people's lives. Children of all ages will be&#xD;
      included, and those ages 8 to 17 will be interviewed directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be collected through criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
      Mental Disorders IV as well as the spectrum, or range, of mood disorders and co-existing&#xD;
      conditions. A member of the study team will visit the participants at home or will do an&#xD;
      interview by telephone. Participation will take approximately 3 to 4 hours. Children will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires given by the research team as well as questionnaires that they will&#xD;
      do by themselves. The questions will pertain to the children's health, including physical and&#xD;
      mental health and medical history, social relationships, problems, skills, and ways of&#xD;
      dealing with important or stressful issues in their lives. These questionnaires will take up&#xD;
      to 1 hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health history gathered from adult participants will pertain to height, weight, exercise, and&#xD;
      general function. Women will be asked about the use of oral contraceptives, estrogen, and&#xD;
      progesterone. In addition, there will be questionnaires on personality and temperamental&#xD;
      traits, that is, behavior and impulsiveness. Questions will also involve social intuition,&#xD;
      family and other environmental factors, general functioning, and basic demographics such as&#xD;
      ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status, marital status, education level, and employment&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families enrolled in this phase of the research will be invited to participate in the next&#xD;
      phase. There would be follow-up to evaluate the development of mood disorders, subtypes, and&#xD;
      syndromes across the lifespan.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chief goal of this study is to identify the endophenotypes of the spectrum of mood&#xD;
      disorders using the methods of genetic epidemiology, developmental psychopathology and&#xD;
      clinical psychiatry/psychology. The major research questions focus on the specificity of&#xD;
      familial transmission of the mood disorder spectrum (i.e., symptoms, symptom clusters,&#xD;
      subtypes) and the role of comorbidity with anxiety disorders and migraine syndromes in&#xD;
      defining subtypes of mood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to recruit 800 probands with bipolar I, bipolar II, major depression, panic/GAD,&#xD;
      phobias, migraine, and unaffected controls, ascertained through both psychiatric and&#xD;
      non-psychiatric clinical settings and systematic community samples, in order to enhance&#xD;
      generalizability to the population. Approximately 2750 first-degree adult relatives and&#xD;
      spouses, 350 child offspring (ages 7-17) will comprise the family study component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study employs a retrospective cohort family study for the association between mood and&#xD;
      other mental and physical disorders in probands and their relatives. Probands and relatives&#xD;
      will be evaluated using structured diagnostic interviews and standardized diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      followed by clinical validation interviews and diagnostic consensus procedures. Assessment&#xD;
      instruments will collect information on the DSM-IV criteria as well as the spectrum of mood&#xD;
      disorders and comorbid conditions. In addition, DNA will also be collected from participants.&#xD;
      A subset of families also complete electronic diaries and measures of light exposure and&#xD;
      activity in this protocol, and will be invited to participate in another protocol to undergo&#xD;
      more comprehensive evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and other functional domans to&#xD;
      identify biologic markers and endophentypes for mood and related disorders. Data from the two&#xD;
      protocols will be linked. A subset of families will also be followed forward over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the familial aggregation of mood disorder subtypes and their&#xD;
      co-aggregation with migraine and anxiety disorders with diagnoses based on clinical review of&#xD;
      the diagnostic interviews, family history information and clinical evaluation of study&#xD;
      participants when relevant using traditional family study measures of association. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include associations between mood disorders with the data collected from laboratory,&#xD;
      biological, and functional assessments that have been collected as part of the clinical study&#xD;
      and their familial correlations. Moving forward, these data will be collected as part of a&#xD;
      new protocol and linked with the interview and mobile assessment data collected in this&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
