  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DTGM belongs to a new generation of drugs designed to target leukemic cells. To achieve this,&#xD;
      DTGM takes advantage of the ability of naturally-produced growth factor (GM,&#xD;
      granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor) to deliver a drug (diphtheria toxin) to cells;&#xD;
      preferably leukemic cells. It then attaches to the cells and allows the toxin to enter the&#xD;
      leukemic cells and destroy them.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of malignant myeloid progenitor cells express receptors for GM-CSF. The fusion&#xD;
      of GM-CSF with diphtheria toxin allows a targeting of cells with GM-CSF receptors for effects&#xD;
      of the toxin while sparing GM-CSF receptor-lacking multipotent stem cells. The great majority&#xD;
      of AML cells express GM-CSF receptors and DT388GMCSF has shown selective killing of AML and&#xD;
      CMML progenitors in vitro while sparing normal progenitor cells. When administered as a&#xD;
      single bolus to rodents, adequate blood DT388GMCSF biological activity was found to kill&#xD;
      several logs of leukemic cells. A phase I clinical trial of DT388GMCSF given as a daily bolus&#xD;
      i.v. infusion for up to 5 consecutive days was completed in 38 patients. The study defined&#xD;
      liver toxicity as the DLT. The liver toxicity was observed only in patients &gt; 50 years and&#xD;
      receiving steroids. Responses were seen in four patients consisting of one complete remission&#xD;
      and 3 partial remission of short duration. Peak drug levels were inversely proportional to&#xD;
      pre-treatment DT388GMCSF antibody levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the observed significant preclinical activity in AML and CMML, clinical activity&#xD;
      in chemorefractory patients with AML, the association of toxicities with steroid exposure,&#xD;
      and association of the drug level with antibody titer that could be decreased with DT388GMCSF&#xD;
      exposure, the current follow up phase I trial is designed based on a new administration and&#xD;
      is a dose - finding trial also aimed to better determine and control side effects, improve&#xD;
      drug pharmacokinetics and provide initial insight into antileukemic activity of this novel&#xD;
      agent, delivered at a prolonged intermittent schedule.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with refractory or relapsed AML ( marrow blasts &gt; 20% ), must have failed&#xD;
             induction therapy or have relapsed after CR duration &lt; 6 months following induction&#xD;
             therapy, untreated or refractory to salvage chemotherapy. Relapsed AML patients with&#xD;
             CR duration &gt; 6 months or previously untreated patients refusing chemotherapy and not&#xD;
             considered for treatments of higher priority are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who failed at least one course of&#xD;
             chemo- or biological therapy( including trial of erythropoietin), or patients with&#xD;
             relapsed CMML. Previously untreated CMML patients with HB &lt; or = 12 g / dL, not&#xD;
             eligible for protocols of higher priority or not wishing to receive chemotherapy.&#xD;
