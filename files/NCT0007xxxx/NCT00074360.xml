      This study is divided into two parts; each designed to answer a separate but related&#xD;
      question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Which brain regions are activated in humans by the rewarding properties of ethanol&#xD;
      administration?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is it possible to demonstrate a conditioned response to a stimulus paired with rising blood&#xD;
      alcohol concentrations (BAC) in humans and can this response be observed in the brain using&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) techniques?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1. In order to determine which brain regions are activated by the rewarding properties&#xD;
      of ethanol administration, we propose to use Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI&#xD;
      techniques to test the hypothesis that during the time of rising and peak BAC, mesolimbic,&#xD;
      mesocortical, and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) terminal areas of the brain will show&#xD;
      significant increases in cerebral blood flow. Healthy, non-alcoholic subjects will be given&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) ethanol or placebo infusions on separate days. The infusions will have three&#xD;
      phases. On each day, during the first phase a saline infusion will be used to measure basal&#xD;
      brain blood flow. The second phase will be an ethanol infusion delivered at rates calculated&#xD;
      to produce a BAC of 0.08 plus or minus 0.005 g/dl at 10 minutes. The rate of the infusion for&#xD;
      the next 10 minutes (third phase) will be calculated to maintain BAC at the target level of&#xD;
      0.08 plus or minus 0.005 g/dl for the duration of the infusion. On the placebo day, subjects&#xD;
      will receive a saline infusion at the same set of rates for phases two and three as used&#xD;
      during their ethanol infusion. Continuous multi-slice fMRI data will be collected during each&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2. In order to investigate conditioned response to ethanol, three groups of healthy,&#xD;
      non-alcoholic subjects will be given a series of IV infusions on separate days. The&#xD;
      experimental group will receive ethanol infusion paired with a conditioned stimulus (CS)&#xD;
      which will be presented while the BAC is rising. One control group (I) of healthy,&#xD;
      non-alcoholic subjects will also be given a series of intravenous ethanol infusions on&#xD;
      separate days, but these infusions will not be paired with a CS. The other control group (II)&#xD;
      will be given only saline infusions during the CS presentation. After three training&#xD;
      sessions, all three groups will undergo an fMRI scan during which the CS will be paired with&#xD;
      saline infusion. This will allow the response to the CS alone to be observed. After 10&#xD;
      minutes of CS presentation, the ethanol infusion will begin and continue for another 15&#xD;
      minutes. Conditioned response (CR) will be demonstrated if the experimental group shows&#xD;
      greater increase in BOLD signal than the control groups in motivation areas such as&#xD;
      mesolimbic, mesocortical, and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) terminal areas of the brain in&#xD;
      response to the CS while they receive the saline infusion. Control group II will also undergo&#xD;
      an fMRI scan and will be given saline infusion followed by ethanol infusion during their last&#xD;
      15 minutes in the scanner to control for the non-specific effects of repeated infusions &amp;&#xD;
      scans on BOLD response to ethanol. If we are able to produce a CR in brain regions associated&#xD;
      with motivation, it may be possible to use this CR as an experimental model for human alcohol&#xD;
      craving.&#xD;

      This study is designed to answer four questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Which brain regions are activated in humans by the rewarding properties of ethanol&#xD;
           administration?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How does ethanol administration affect the brain response to visual cues known to evoke&#xD;
           positive or negative emotion?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do individuals who regularly drink in ethanol in large amounts (heavy drinkers) differ&#xD;
           from individuals who do not regularly drink large amounts of ethanol (social drinkers)&#xD;
           in how ethanol affects brain function?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does ethanol administration affect the brain regions activated in a risk-taking task in&#xD;
           social drinkers and heavy drinkers?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine which brain regions are activated by the rewarding properties of&#xD;
      ethanol administration, we propose to use Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI&#xD;
      techniques to test the hypothesis that during the time of rising and peak BAC, mesolimbic,&#xD;
      mesocortical, and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) terminal areas of the brain will show&#xD;
      significant increases in cerebral blood flow. Healthy, subjects who are not seeking treatment&#xD;
      for an alcohol use disorder will be given intravenous (IV) ethanol or placebo infusions on&#xD;
      separate days. An ethanol infusion will delivered at rates calculated to produce a BAC of&#xD;
      0.08 plus or minus. An ethanol infusion will delivered at rates calculated to produce a BAC&#xD;
      of 0.08 plus or minus 0.005 g/dl at 15 minutes. Then the rate of the infusion will be&#xD;
      adjusted so that for the next 30 minutes (second phase) BAC will be maintained at the target&#xD;
      level of 0.08 0.005 g/dl. On the placebo day, subjects will receive a saline infusion at the&#xD;
      same set of rates as used during their ethanol infusion. Continuous multi-slice fMRI data&#xD;
      will be collected during each infusion. During each infusion, BOLD response to visual stimuli&#xD;
      designed to evoke emotion will also be examined. In addition, we will compare the BOLD&#xD;
      response of healthy social drinkers to that of healthy heavy drinkers. We will also compare&#xD;
      the BOLD response elicited by risk-taking during the ethanol infusion to that during the&#xD;
      placebo infusion in both social and heavy drinkers.&#xD;
