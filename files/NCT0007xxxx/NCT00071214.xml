      Two part clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of StaphVAX in adults on&#xD;
      hemodialysis. Part A will evaluate the prevention of bacteremic infections in End Stage Renal&#xD;
      Disease (ESRD) patients during the interval between 3 and 35 weeks after a single dose of&#xD;
      StaphVAX. Part B of this study is designed to assess immunogenicity of a second [booster]&#xD;
      dose of vaccine in patients completing Part A, and the cumulative (Part A + B) efficacy.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Eligible subjects must already be receiving chronic hemodialysis treatment from the centers&#xD;
        participating in this study. Interested subjects should discuss enrollment with their&#xD;
        nephrologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of chronic end-stage renal disease with maintenance on hemodialysis&#xD;
             continuously for at least eight (8) weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemodialysis access using native vessel fistula or synthetic/heterologous graft (not&#xD;
             catheter).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expectation of compliance with protocol procedures, and visit schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test in females of child-bearing potential (serum -HCG within&#xD;
             7 days prior to each study drug injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known serious S. aureus infection within 3 months of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known recurrent S. aureus infection of the current graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active viral or bacterial infection or symptoms/signs consistent with such an&#xD;
             infection with the two weeks prior to injection of investigational product. Mild&#xD;
             intercurrent viral illness with a temperature of 100.6F or less does not require&#xD;
             exclusion, if in the judgement of the investigator this illness will not interfere&#xD;
             with the evaluation of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV infection (testing not required for protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity or previous anaphylaxis to polysaccharides or&#xD;
             polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines or to components of such vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected abuse of any drugs, prescribed or illicit, in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs (including systemic&#xD;
             glucocorticoids, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate,&#xD;
             cyclosporine, mycophenolate, human immune globulin in excess of 0.2 g/Kg per month,&#xD;
             any monoclonal antibody specific for any human leukocyte subset or cytokine, or any&#xD;
             interferon preparation), except low-dose physiologic replacement glucocorticoid&#xD;
             therapy (Less than or equal to 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known malignancy or treatment for malignancy within the past six months, other than&#xD;
             basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of investigational drugs, products, or devices within 30 days prior to vaccine&#xD;
             injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, places the&#xD;
             subject at undue risk or potentially jeopardized the quality of the data to be&#xD;
             generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous administration of StaphVAX&#xD;
