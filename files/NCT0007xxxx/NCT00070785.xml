  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of people of different ethnic backgrounds to develop&#xD;
      immune responses against the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A common virus, EBV is present in 90&#xD;
      percent of healthy people and usually does not cause problems. Most people are infected in&#xD;
      childhood, have no symptoms, and are unaware of their infection. People infected as&#xD;
      adolescents or adults may develop infectious mononucleosis, which usually resolves&#xD;
      completely. However, in immune suppressed people, like those who have had a transplant, EBV&#xD;
      can cause fatal cancers. It can also cause certain cancers such as Burkitt's lymphoma,&#xD;
      Hodgkin's lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in people who are not immune suppressed.&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is 100 times more common in people of Asian origin (particularly&#xD;
      southern Chinese) compared with Caucasians. This difference may be the result of genetic,&#xD;
      rather than environmental, factors. This study will examine whether the same proteins&#xD;
      produced by EBV in the cancer cells react differently in people of different ethnic&#xD;
      background in a way that could explain the differences in predisposition for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older of Caucasian or Chinese ancestry may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates of Chinese ancestry must be born in China (including&#xD;
      Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, or be first generation offspring of parents born in these&#xD;
      places).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a blood sample drawn and will undergo lymphapheresis - a procedure for&#xD;
      collecting large numbers of white blood cells called lymphocytes. The blood sample is tested&#xD;
      for blood counts and HLA type, a genetic marker of the immune system. HLA molecules help&#xD;
      determine the way the body's immune cells respond to virus. HLA typing is similar to blood&#xD;
      typing. Usually done to match stem cell or organ transplants, HLA testing may also be used to&#xD;
      try to identify factors associated with an increased risk of certain diseases or conditions.&#xD;
      HLA type is strongly associated with ethnic background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For lymphapheresis, blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating&#xD;
      blood. The blood flows from the vein through a catheter (plastic tube) into a machine that&#xD;
      separates it into its components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells are removed&#xD;
      and the rest of the blood (red cells, plasma and platelets) is returned to the body through a&#xD;
      needle in the other arm. The procedure takes 2 to 3 hours. The collected white cells are used&#xD;
      for research for this study, including the ability to react to EBV proteins, and are then&#xD;
      destroyed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Epstein Barr virus (EBV) can induce in immune compromised patients fatal lymphoproliferative&#xD;
      lesions that regress upon reversion of immune suppression or adoptive transfer of&#xD;
      EBV-specific CD8+ T cells. EBV can also induce neoplastic lesions in immune competent hosts&#xD;
      including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). EBV-specific&#xD;
      CD8+ T cell responses can occur in patients with these cancers that are qualitatively similar&#xD;
      but quantitatively diminished compared to EBV-primed normal individuals. Although these&#xD;
      cancers share several features, they are characterized by divergent patterns of expression of&#xD;
      EBV proteins. In particular, NPC expresses preferentially the latent membrane protein (LMP) 2&#xD;
      with or without expression of LMP 1 and intermediate expression of the Epstein-Barr nuclear&#xD;
      antigen. Thus, there is interest to develop LMP 2-directed immunizations for patients with&#xD;
      NPC with the hope that enhancement of the insufficient natural immunity may lead to tumor&#xD;
      regression. Since, the incidence of NPC is tightly associated with ethnic background&#xD;
      (principally Southern Chinese) and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) phenotype, diverse&#xD;
      populations may display distinct reactivity patterns toward EBV epitopes that may in turn be&#xD;
      responsible for their respective predisposition to acquire NPC. Although, several LMP 2&#xD;
      epitopes have been described, to our knowledge, no systematic mapping across diverse&#xD;
      ethnicity complemented with high-resolution HLA typing has ever been done. We, therefore,&#xD;
      propose to map immune dominant epitopes of LMP 2 in EBV primed normal individuals of&#xD;
      Caucasian or Asian (Chinese) ethnicity by measuring interferon (IFN)-gamma transcript levels&#xD;
      in circulating lymphocytes exposed to a library of overlapping nonamer peptides encompassing&#xD;
      the full sequence of LMP 2. High resolution, sequence-based HLA typing will complement the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal volunteers, age greater than or equal to 18 years of Caucasian or Chinese ancestry&#xD;
        will be eligible for the study. Chinese ancestry will be defined as being born in China&#xD;
        (including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore) or being first generation offspring of parents&#xD;
        born in China (including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore).&#xD;
&#xD;
        ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals must weigh at least 110 pounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential participants must pass the criteria for blood donors established by the American&#xD;
        Association of Blood Banks according to the routine screening performed within the&#xD;
        Department of Transfusion Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential participants should pass a brief physical exam to exclude potential cardiac&#xD;
        problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WBC 3000/mm(3) or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelet count 90,000 mm(3) or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Negative pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ante-cubital veins compatible with the apheresis process. Apheresis center nurses will&#xD;
        assess the ante-cubital veins of all subjects prior to enrollment. If their veins are&#xD;
        judged to be too small to support the intravenous catheter required for the procedure, they&#xD;
        will be excluded. If at the time of each apheresis procedure the nurses are unable to&#xD;
        obtain adequate ante-cubital vein access, the subject will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of previous exposure to EBV infection will not represent inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential participants will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Who are undergoing or have undergone in the past 3 weeks any form of systemic therapy that&#xD;
        may affect immune function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Who have active systemic infections, autoimmune disease or any known immunodeficiency&#xD;
        disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Who require systemic steroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Who are positive for hepatitis B (s)AG or HIV antibody (because of possible immune effects&#xD;
        of these conditions). HIV testing will be performed prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Who have any form of active primary or secondary immune deficiency.&#xD;
