  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 3-AP and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving 3-AP together with gemcitabine&#xD;
      may kill more tumor cells. This phase II trial is studying how well giving 3-AP together with&#xD;
      gemcitabine works as second-line therapy in treating patients with progressive or recurrent&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the antitumor response rate (by tumor measurement per the RECIST criteria) in&#xD;
      patients taking this combination in the setting of second line treatment for NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the rate of stable disease, time to treatment progression, duration of&#xD;
      response, and survival of patients taking this combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the safety and tolerability of this combination in this phase II trial of&#xD;
      patients with relapsed NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the potential effects of MDR polymorphisms in patients taking Triapine® in&#xD;
      this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of Triapine® and gemcitabine on RRM1, RRM2, and p53R2 protein&#xD;
      expression per IHC and gene expression per RT-PCR from baseline diagnostic paraffin embedded&#xD;
      blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate both germline (peripheral blood) and tumor DNA for the presence of p53&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine^®) IV over 2 hours and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days&#xD;
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for up to 1.5 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC);&#xD;
             cytology alone is not acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have progressive or recurrent NSCLC, and must have failed one and only&#xD;
             one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease; patients must not have&#xD;
             received prior gemcitabine chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, as defined by RECIST, within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (SGOT) &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dL, or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute granulocyte count &gt;= 1500/mm3 and WBC &gt;= 3000/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed any radiation therapy &gt;= 3 weeks prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed prior cytotoxic chemotherapy &gt;= 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
             registration and have recovered from adverse effects from the chemotherapy to =&lt; Grade&#xD;
             1, or baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases which have been treated are eligible if the patient is&#xD;
             &gt; 3 weeks post completion of treatment for their brain metastases, and patient is&#xD;
             neurologically stable; patients with previous brain metastases who have not yet&#xD;
             received therapy specifically intended for their brain metastases are not eligible to&#xD;
             enroll in this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Triapine® is a heterocyclic&#xD;
             carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Triapine®, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with Triapine®; women must not be pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding due to the absence of information regarding the use of these agents in&#xD;
             these populations; a negative serum pregnancy test is required within 14 days of study&#xD;
             entry; the effects of Triapine® on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because heterocyclic carboxaldehyde&#xD;
             thiosemicarbazones as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to&#xD;
             be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with Triapine®&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have an active second malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have, at the time of registration, uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
             including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements;&#xD;
             furthermore, since hypoxemia may cause serious adverse events in persons with serious&#xD;
             cardiac and/or pulmonary disease, patients at the time of registration with a history&#xD;
             of myocardial infarction within the prior 6 months, or with symptomatic congestive&#xD;
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical&#xD;
             intervention (with the exception of chronic, stable, asymptomatic atrial&#xD;
             fibrillation), or pulmonary disease requiring oxygen are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have dementia or active psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have used any investigational agent in the month before study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to Triapine® or other agents used in this&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a clinical history of G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase)&#xD;
             deficiency; persons at high risk for this condition (patients of African, Asian, or&#xD;
             Mediterranean origin/ancestry) must undergo specific clinical testing at protocol&#xD;
             entry for this condition; patients testing positive for G6PD deficiency are excluded&#xD;
             from protocol entry&#xD;
