      This study will examine the role of the spinal cord in improving leg movements after physical&#xD;
      training in healthy people. The results of this study may be helpful in developing new&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapies for people with impaired leg function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      will be screened with a brief medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo EMG-H reflex measurement while pedaling on a stationary bicycle.&#xD;
      For this test, the subject is given an electrical stimulation at the nerve at the back of the&#xD;
      knee while pedaling on a stationary bicycle. The shock produces a jerky movement called the&#xD;
      &quot;H reflex.&quot; The muscular activity causing these reflexes is measured using electrodes (small&#xD;
      metal disks) filled with a conductive gel and taped to the skin over the calf muscle. The&#xD;
      nerve is stimulated at four different frequencies during the experiment. While cycling, pedal&#xD;
      resistance changes, making it harder or easier to pedal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On study day 1, participants have EMG-H reflex measurement to determine baseline performance,&#xD;
      then a training session to prepare for the actual test, and then a post-training test to&#xD;
      measure performance again. The test is repeated on days 2, then between days 5 and 8, and&#xD;
      again between days 11 and 14. The screening and first visit last 2 hours; the remaining test&#xD;
      visits are 1 hour each. The bicycling time is only 15 minutes during training and 5 minutes&#xD;
      at each test session.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to determine whether the development of a motor memory in the human spinal cord&#xD;
      circuitry (expressed as a down regulation of the monosynaptic soleus H reflex) after a brief&#xD;
      period of learning of a locomotor skill, is intrinsically encoded at the spinal cord level or&#xD;
      if it is determined by descending suprasegmental influences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study would be useful for designing new rehabilitation strategies based&#xD;
      upon manipulation of peripheral inputs aimed at activating spinal cord circuitry for motor&#xD;
      recovery independent of the higher centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy (70) healthy volunteers (median age 21-65) will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete one training session (using a recumbent cycle ergometer) and will be&#xD;
      tested physiologically and behaviorally once before training and four times after training&#xD;
      through 14 to 16 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess homosynaptic depression of the soleus H reflex (an expression of the&#xD;
      excitability of the alpha-motorneuron pool), a phenomenon that is not susceptible to&#xD;
      descending suprasegmental influences but depends on the history of information arriving to&#xD;
      the alpha-motorneuron from the periphery. Amount of homosynaptic depression will be&#xD;
      correlated with the behavioral learning assessed by improvement in control of stepping speed.&#xD;
