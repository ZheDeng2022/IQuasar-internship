  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 trial will investigate the safety of a modified stem cell transplant procedure&#xD;
      for treating advanced breast cancer. Patients with cancers can sometimes benefit greatly from&#xD;
      transplants of stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into blood cells).&#xD;
      In addition to producing new bone marrow and restoring normal blood production and immunity,&#xD;
      the donated cells fight any residual tumor cells that might have remained in the body, in&#xD;
      what is called a &quot;graft-versus-tumor&quot; effect. However, severe problems, or sometimes even&#xD;
      death, may follow these transplants as a result of the high-dose chemotherapy and radiation&#xD;
      that accompany the procedure. Also, donated immune cells called lymphocytes, or T cells,&#xD;
      sometimes attack healthy tissues in a reaction called graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD),&#xD;
      damaging organs such as the liver, intestines and skin. This study will use the following&#xD;
      strategies to try to reduce these risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Induction chemotherapy&quot; to reduce patients' immunity in an attempt to prevent rejection&#xD;
           of the donated stem cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning chemotherapy that is easier for the body to tolerate and&#xD;
           involves a shorter period of complete immune suppression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Removal of lymphocytes from the donor stem cells for transfusion in small quantities at&#xD;
           monthly intervals following the stem cell transplant to reduce the risk of GVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transplant of specific lymphocytes called Th2/Tc2 cells that may increase the percentage&#xD;
           of donor stem cells accepted by the patient without significantly increasing GVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with advanced (stage IV) breast cancer that does not&#xD;
      respond to standard therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a&#xD;
      medical history, physical and dental examinations, x-ray studies and bone marrow biopsies to&#xD;
      evaluate disease status, blood and urine tests (including a blood test for genetic match with&#xD;
      the donor), and lung and heart function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have a central venous line (large plastic tube) placed into a major vein. This&#xD;
      tube stays in the body during the entire treatment period for infusing the donated stem cells&#xD;
      and T lymphocytes, giving medications, including chemotherapy and other drugs, antibiotics,&#xD;
      and blood transfusions, and withdrawing blood samples. Treatment starts with induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy, in which patients receive one or two cycles of the anti-cancer drugs&#xD;
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. (One cycle consists of 4 days on drug therapy followed by a&#xD;
      17-day rest period.) G-CSF, a drug that boosts white cell production, is also given to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of infection. Several days before the transplant procedure, patients begin&#xD;
      conditioning chemotherapy with higher doses of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Three days&#xD;
      after the conditioning therapy is completed, the stem cells are infused. To help prevent both&#xD;
      rejection of the donor stem cells and GVHD, patients receive cyclosporine (first by vein and&#xD;
      later by mouth) for several weeks after the transplant. Infusions of donor lymphocytes begin&#xD;
      about 6 weeks after the transplant to boost the immune system and enhance the&#xD;
      graft-versus-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may leave the hospital when they are able to eat and drink, have no fever or&#xD;
      infection, and have a normal or near-normal white cell count. They return for follow-up&#xD;
      visits twice a week for the first 100 days after the transplant, then every 3 months, then 6&#xD;
      months and then yearly for at least 5 years post-transplant. The visits include a medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, and blood draws, as well as disease staging with CT scans&#xD;
      every month for the first 6 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In CC# 00-C-0119 we were able to demonstrate that allogeneic T cells could mediate a&#xD;
           clinically relevant graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect against MBC after a&#xD;
           reduced-intensity, T cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
           (alloHSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Responses were observed after establishment of complete lymphoid chimerism, which was&#xD;
           frequently delayed and required the use of planned donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). DLI&#xD;
           were associated with a significant incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In murine models, in vitro generated T cells of Th2/Tc2 phenotype can facilitate&#xD;
           engraftment of HLA disparate allografts with significantly reduced GVHD as compared to T&#xD;
           cell replete allografts that have not been manipulated. In addition, Th2/Tc2 cells&#xD;
           provide an anti-tumor effect through the perforin/granzyme pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic Th2/Tc2 cells may facilitate rapid allo-engraftment post-transplant with&#xD;
           reduced GVHD. In addition, the perforin-mediated anti-tumor activity of Th2/Tc2 cells&#xD;
           should provide earlier benefit compared with T-cell depleted allografts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the safety, as defined by the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease, and&#xD;
      feasibility of administering in vitro generated donor T cells of Th2/Tc2 phenotype to augment&#xD;
      a T cell depleted allograft (T cell exchange) after reduced-intensity conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with measurable, metastatic breast cancer and an HLA matched sibling donor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have received treatment with a taxane, an anthracycline, a hormonal agent&#xD;
           and/or Herceptin, if the tumor expresses the respective receptors, and at least one&#xD;
           treatment for metastatic disease that has not resulted in a complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donors will initially have lymphocytes collected to generate the Th2/Tc2 product and&#xD;
           then have blood stem cells collected following mobilization with filgrastim. The stem&#xD;
           cell product will be T-cell depleted, and the T-cell dose will be adjusted to 1 x 10(5)&#xD;
           CD3+ cells/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive induction (immune depleting) chemotherapy with the goal of&#xD;
           reducing circulating CD4+ cell less than 50/microliter prior to proceeding to alloHSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine&#xD;
           and cyclophosphamide. This will be followed by infusion of the T cell depleted&#xD;
           allograft, which will be supplemented with Th2/Tc2 cells (i.e. T cell exchange).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cyclosporine will be discontinued after 40 days to permit a full GVT effect. Patients&#xD;
           may receive donor lymphocyte infusions at days +42, +70, +98 post-transplant to further&#xD;
           potentiate a GVT effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be enrolled in three cohorts, with escalating Th2/Tc2 cell doses (0.5 -&#xD;
           12.5 x 10(7) cells/kg) given in a phase-I manner.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria - Recipient:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with measurable stage IV breast cancer. Patients with central nervous system&#xD;
             CNS metastases are eligible if the CNS metastases have been treated and remained&#xD;
             stable a minimum of four weeks after the completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for treatment of&#xD;
             distant metastases and achieved less than a complete response to this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients must have received prior therapy with a taxane (e.g. paclitaxel) and an&#xD;
                  anthracycline (e.g. doxorubicin) as part of either adjuvant therapy or treatment&#xD;
                  of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients whose tumor expresses estrogen and/or progesterone receptors must have&#xD;
                  received at least one hormonal therapy (e.g. Tamoxifen) as part of either&#xD;
                  adjuvant therapy or treatment of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients whose tumor expresses Her2-neu must have received trastuzumab (Herceptin&#xD;
                  ) as part of either adjuvant therapy or treatment of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients who have undergone prior autologous stem cell transplantation are&#xD;
                  eligible for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients 18 - 75 years of age. The upper age limit was chosen in order not to be&#xD;
             discriminatory, provided that patients meet all other eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky performance status greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Left ventricular ejection fraction has to be greater than or equal to 45% by either&#xD;
             MUGA or 2-D echo. This test will repeated immediately after induction and prior to&#xD;
             transplantation. Patients who do not have the minimally required function will be&#xD;
             removed from trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. DLCO greater than or equal to 50% of the expected value when corrected for Hb. This&#xD;
             test will repeated immediately after induction and prior to transplantation. Patients&#xD;
             who do not have the minimally required function will be removed from trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl and a creatinine clearance greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 50 ml/min/1.73 m(2). This test will repeated immediately after induction and&#xD;
             prior to transplantation. Patients who do not have the minimally required function&#xD;
             will be removed from trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Direct bilirubin less than or equal to 2.5 mg/dl, SGOT less than 4x high normal value.&#xD;
             Values above these levels may be accepted, at the discretion of the PI or study&#xD;
             chairperson, if such elevations are thought to be due to liver involvement by&#xD;
             malignancy. This test will repeated immediately after induction and prior to&#xD;
             transplantation. Patients who do not have the minimally required function will be&#xD;
             removed from trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must be HIV-, HbsAg-, and Hepatitis C antibody negative. The high degree of&#xD;
             immune suppression that will be used in this study may lead to the activation or&#xD;
             progression of these viral illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Not pregnant or lactating. Patients of childbearing potential must use an effective&#xD;
             method of contraception. The effects of the chemotherapy, the subsequent transplant&#xD;
             and the medications used after the transplant are highly likely to be harmful to a&#xD;
             fetus. The effects upon breast milk are unknown and may be harmful to the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Consenting sibling matched at 6/6 HLA antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Provision for a Durable Power of Attorney.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Ability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria - Donor:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 18 - 75 years. As the potential for cerebrovascular and cardiac complications may&#xD;
             potentially increase with age, 75 years has been chosen arbitrarily as the upper age&#xD;
             limit. However, if it is determined after initial accrual of patients in this upper&#xD;
             age range that this procedure is relatively safe, the age range may be extended.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. No physical contraindications to stem cell donation (i.e. severe atherosclerosis,&#xD;
             auto-immune disease, cerebrovascular accident, prior malignancy. Patients with severe&#xD;
             atherosclerosis by history will receive a cardiology consult and be judged eligible on&#xD;
             a case by case basis. The exclusion of patients with a prior malignancy will be&#xD;
             evaluated on a case by case basis. If it is felt by the investigators that the risk of&#xD;
             potential transfer of malignant cells is far outweighed by the potential benefit of&#xD;
             the procedure the patient may be eligible to serve as a donor. Persons with a history&#xD;
             of non-hematologic malignancy must have undergone potentially curative therapy for&#xD;
             that malignancy and 1) have had no evidence of that disease for 5 years, and/or 2) be&#xD;
             deemed at low risk for recurrence (less than or equal to 20% at 5 years). Such persons&#xD;
             will be considered eligible for stem cell donation at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
             investigator, who will evaluate the possible benefit to the potential transplant&#xD;
             recipient and the risk of disease transmission in consultation with Department of&#xD;
             Transfusion Medicine staff. Prospective donors with a history of non-hematologic&#xD;
             malignancy who have received potentially curative therapy and are in remission, but&#xD;
             whose estimated risk of recurrence is greater than 20% at 5 years, will be considered&#xD;
             on an individual basis in consultation with the NCI IRB. Any prospective transplant&#xD;
             recipient whose donor has a history of malignancy will be counseled about the&#xD;
             theoretical risk of transmission of cancer from the donor to the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Donors must be HIV-negative, HbsAg, and Hepatitis C antibody negative. As donors are&#xD;
             providing an allogeneic blood product there is the potential risk of transmitting&#xD;
             these viral illnesses to the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Donor must not be pregnant or breastfeeding an infant. A donor who is lactating must&#xD;
             substitute formula feeding for her infant during the period of cytokine&#xD;
             administration. Filgrastim may be secreted in human milk, although its bioavailability&#xD;
             from this source is not known. Limited clinical data suggest that short-term&#xD;
             administration of filgrastim or sargramostim to neonates is not associated with&#xD;
             adverse outcomes. Donors of childbearing potential must use an effective method of&#xD;
             contraception during the time they are receiving cytokines. The effects of cytokine&#xD;
             administration on a fetus are unknown and may be potentially harmful. The effects upon&#xD;
             breast milk are also unknown and may potentially be harmful to the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria - Patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active infection that is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant&#xD;
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent (as determined by&#xD;
             principal investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria - Donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant&#xD;
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of hypertension that is not controlled by medication, stroke, or severe heart&#xD;
             disease. Individuals with symptomatic angina will be considered to have severe heart&#xD;
             disease and will not be eligible to be a donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Anemia (Hb less than 11 gm/dl) or thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000 per&#xD;
             ml).&#xD;
