      in Subjects with Osteoarthritis (OA) of the Knee(s).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a 52-week open label study wherein subjects are required to apply the study drug on&#xD;
      the knee(s) three times a day. Subjects are required to return to the clinic every 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Visit (Day 1) At the End-of-Study/Final Visit, Day 84 of Study No. WL-1001-05-01&#xD;
      (or preferably &lt; 30 days following this visit) subjects will be invited to enroll in this&#xD;
      long-term open label Study WL-1001-05-04. Subjects will sign a written informed consent prior&#xD;
      to being enrolled into the long-term open label study. If enrolled at the final visit or &lt; 30&#xD;
      days after the final visit of Study No. WL-1001-05-01, the final visit physical examination&#xD;
      and laboratory examination will serve as baseline for this study. If enrolled &gt; 30 days after&#xD;
      the final visit, a new physical examination and laboratory examination will be completed upon&#xD;
      enrollment into this study. The subjects will complete an OA Pain Score and Subject Global&#xD;
      Evaluation (SGE) for their Target Knee, the same knee designated as the Target Knee in Study&#xD;
      No. WL-1001-05-01. A 13-week supply of study drug and subject diaries for the next 13 weeks&#xD;
      will be dispensed to each subject. Instructions on how to apply the study drug will be&#xD;
      reviewed with the subjects. Subjects will also be instructed to complete their diaries daily&#xD;
      (Adverse Events Log and Other Medications Log) and to return their completed diaries and&#xD;
      study drug tubes at each clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period (Days 1- 365) Subjects will apply study drug to their Target Knee three&#xD;
      times a day for 52 weeks. If the subject's other knee is affected by osteoarthritis pain, it&#xD;
      may be treated with the study drug as well. The study drug tubes will be weighed prior to&#xD;
      being dispensed to the subject. Each tube will also be weighed when the subject returns them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each clinic visit, the study staff will review the diaries with each subject for&#xD;
      completeness and legibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete the OA Pain Score and Subject Global Evaluation at clinic visits on&#xD;
      Day 1 and Weeks 13, 26, 39, and 52. Concurrent medications, adverse events, and study drug&#xD;
      compliance will be reviewed and recorded by the study staff throughout the Treatment Period&#xD;
      at clinic visits on Weeks 13, 26, 39, and 52 (End-of-Study/Final Visit). At the week 52 visit&#xD;
      (End-of-Study/Final Visit), a physical examination and laboratory examination will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 365 (End-of-Study/Final Visit) the subject will be discharged after all procedures&#xD;
      have been completed.&#xD;
