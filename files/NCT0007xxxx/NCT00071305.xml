      This study will evaluate the magnetoencephalography (MEG) alone and together with&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) in non-invasive presurgical evaluation. It will look at the&#xD;
      contribution of those methods in determining the location of the epilepsy seizure, compared&#xD;
      with doing so through an invasive method. EEG measures electronic potential differences on&#xD;
      the scalp. On the other hand, MEG is a non-invasive technique for recording the activity of&#xD;
      neurons in the brain, through recording of magnetic fields caused by synchronized neural&#xD;
      currents. It has the ability to detect seizures. Because magnetic signals of the brain vary,&#xD;
      this technique must balance two key problems: weakness of the signal and strength of the&#xD;
      noise. The EEG is sensitive to extra-cellular volume currents, whereas the MEG primarily&#xD;
      registers intra-cellular currents. Because electrical fields are quite dependent on the&#xD;
      conductive properties of the tissues, and magnetic fields are significantly less distorted by&#xD;
      tissue, the MEG has better spatial resolution. There is a great deal of evidence that EEG and&#xD;
      MEG provide complementary data about underlying currents of ions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older who have epilepsy that is not relieved, and who are&#xD;
      considered candidates for surgery and who accept epilepsy surgery, may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before they have surgery, participants will either sit or lie down, with their head in a&#xD;
      helmet covering the entire head, with openings for the eyes and ears. Brain magnetic fields&#xD;
      will be recorded with a 275-channel OMEGA system. Throughout the session, visual and two-way&#xD;
      audio communication will be maintained with the patient. Acquiring data from the participant&#xD;
      will be conducted during several sessions, each lasting from 10 to 60 minutes, not exceeding&#xD;
      a total of 120 minutes. If the first recording is not of sufficient quality, the patient may&#xD;
      have it repeated once or twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those participants who are found to have a clear seizure focus will proceed directly to&#xD;
      surgery that is part of their treatment. Those whose seizure focus is ambiguous will proceed&#xD;
      to invasive monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed in the outpatient clinic at intervals of 1, 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months. They may periodically undergo reimaging as considered appropriate.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use magnetoencephalography (MEG) alone, and in combination with EEG (MEG-EEG), to&#xD;
      study the contribution of each method and their combination to the localizing yield of the&#xD;
      non-invasive pre-surgical evaluation as compared to the invasive method. We will also&#xD;
      correlate seizure origin and localizing data with surgical outcome, and, in retrospect,&#xD;
      calculate the proportion of patients in whom invasive monitoring could have been avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be patients with medically refractory localization-related&#xD;
      epilepsy who will be undergoing epilepsy surgery as part of their standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design/Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a 275-channel whole-head MEG System (CTF Systems 2001 Inc). Patients will undergo&#xD;
      a supine resting MEG-EEG recording prior to any surgical procedure. The resulting data will&#xD;
      be integrated with the data obtained during the patient's standard pre-surgical evaluation,&#xD;
      and compared with the invasive data obtained during chronic invasive monitoring (if&#xD;
      clinically indicated), and/or intra-operative electrocorticography (all patients-standard of&#xD;
      care). When analyzing the data, readers will be blinded to the results of the other modality&#xD;
      (MEG vs. EEG, non-invasive vs. invasive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed in the outpatient clinic at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month intervals.&#xD;
      Surgical outcomes will be graded according to the Engel and International League Against&#xD;
      Epilepsy (ILAE) outcome scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this protocol will not in themselves indicate or lead to epilepsy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of seizure foci detected and delineated&#xD;
      both non-invasively and invasively. The secondary outcome measures will be the proportion of&#xD;
      patients with seizure foci co-localized invasively and non-invasively, the correlation of the&#xD;
      obtained localizing data from both modalities with surgical outcome, and the correlation&#xD;
      between the anatomical location of the epileptogenic zone and surgical outcome.&#xD;
