      This study will determine: 1) whether learning a task with the dominant hand is accompanied&#xD;
      by changes in the area of the brain that controls hand movement, and 2) how the brain is able&#xD;
      to make these changes. Previous studies have shown that practicing a motor task can change&#xD;
      brain excitability, but it is not known how well brain excitabilities are changed during&#xD;
      motor learning. This study will measure changes in activity of the part of the brain that&#xD;
      controls hand movement before, during, and after exercising the hand on a response pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates who have not been evaluated at NIH within the past year will be screened with a&#xD;
      brief interview about their current state of health and clinical and neurological&#xD;
      examinations. Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning a finger movement/reaction time task&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this procedure, participants sit in front of a computer monitor with the index, middle,&#xD;
      ring, and little fingers placed flat on four corresponding buttons of a response pad. They&#xD;
      are asked to press one of the four buttons as fast as they can in response to an asterisk&#xD;
      displayed on the monitor. The position of the asterisk indicates which button to push.&#xD;
      Subjects perform nine sets of 120-button pushes with a 15-minute rest between each set.&#xD;
      During the rest period, subjects undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (described below),&#xD;
      which causes twitches in the hand muscles. The electrical activity corresponding to the&#xD;
      twitches is recorded by attaching electrodes (small metal disks) to the skin over the hand&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this test, an insulated wire coil is held over the scalp. A brief electrical current&#xD;
      passes through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that electrically stimulates the brain.&#xD;
      The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the scalp under the coil. The&#xD;
      stimulation may also cause twitching in the muscles of the face, arm, or leg. During the&#xD;
      stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other&#xD;
      simple actions.&#xD;

      Objective: We aim to show that the development of implicit knowledge of a motor task is&#xD;
      associated with decrease in intracortical GABA-related inhibition (ICI) in the trained&#xD;
      muscles (accompanying increasing MEP amplitudes) and increase in ICI in non-trained&#xD;
      neighboring muscles and that, after the knowledge becomes explicit, ICI modifications become&#xD;
      less prominent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be useful to know the role of ICI during learning. As some interventions or drugs&#xD;
      are known to modify GABA activity, this study may even provide a rationale for using these&#xD;
      interventions and drugs to enhance plastic changes in patients with impaired motor learning&#xD;
      capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that learning a motor task with one hand can be transferred to the&#xD;
      contralateral hand (37, 43, 45, 46, 47). Studies have demonstrated that learning a finger&#xD;
      sequence task (Serial Reaction Time test, SRTT) with the dominant-hand (trained) can be&#xD;
      transferred to the contralateral hand (un-trained) (43,49,50). In this additional experiment&#xD;
      we propose to investigate the effect of disrupting M1 (by using 1 Hz TMS, inhibitory effect)&#xD;
      on motor learning in the trained hand (dominant) and in the un-trained hand (non-dominant).&#xD;
      Evidence has shown that there is transcallosal connections between M1 of both hemispheres&#xD;
      (40). Since M1 is active during implicit learning (41, 42) we expect 1 Hz TMS stimulation&#xD;
      (inhibitory effect) over M1 will deteriorate implicit learning in the trained hand (dominant)&#xD;
      as well as in the un-trained hand (non-dominant). This will be evaluated by assessing their&#xD;
      effect on reaction times and accuracy of motor performance in both hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 72 healthy volunteers, aged 18-40 will participate in the study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either the test session or the control session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Subjects will complete a unique session. They will perform a serial-reaction-time&#xD;
      task. The subjects will be instructed to push a button on a 4-button pad in response to a&#xD;
      visual GO signal (which can appear at 4 different positions) using the appropriate digit and&#xD;
      the appropriate button. There will be 9 blocks of 120 trials each. In the test group, in&#xD;
      blocks 1, 4 and 7 the Go signal appears in a random order; in blocks 2-3, 5-6 and 8-9 the&#xD;
      same 12-trial sequence is repeated 10 times. In the control group Go signals will appear in a&#xD;
      random order in all blocks. Subjects won't be informed about the sequence but will be asked&#xD;
      to notify anything they noticed about the task. If they do notice and report about a sequence&#xD;
      they will be considered as having explicit knowledge. Between each block subjects will&#xD;
      receive transcranial magnetic stimulations to assess ICI. ICI will be assessed on subjects at&#xD;
      rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Behavioral effect of the motor training will be assessed by measuring the&#xD;
      mean reaction times (RT) for digits II and V and the percentage of correct responses for each&#xD;
      block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implicit learning will be assessed by the difference in RTs between block 3 and 4 and between&#xD;
      block 6 and 7. Time at which explicit learning occurs will be assessed by verbal report and&#xD;
      the degree of explicit learning by the number of correct items when repeating the sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implicit learning will be assessed in the trained hand (dominant) (see above) and in the&#xD;
      un-trained hand. The un-trained hand will be tested by asking subjects to repeat two random&#xD;
      blocks (familiarization) and two sequence blocks. One of these sequence blocks is a&#xD;
      repetition of the same sequence that they learned with the dominant hand. The other sequence&#xD;
      block is a new sequence containing the same number of characters as the previous sequence.&#xD;
      Implicit learning on the un-trained hand will be assessed by the difference in RTs, between&#xD;
      random block and the sequence block. In addition, implicit learning on the un-trained hand&#xD;
      will be evaluated by testing the difference between the two sequence blocks repeated by the&#xD;
      un-trained hand. The time at which explicit learning occurs will be assessed by verbal report&#xD;
      and the degree of explicit learning by the number of correct items when repeating the&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracortical inhibitory processes will be assessed by measuring the amount of ICI in trained&#xD;
      muscles (first dorsal interosseus: FDI and adductor digit minimi: ADM) and a non-trained&#xD;
      muscle (opponens pollicis brevis: OPB).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal volunteers (aged 18 to 40 years) who are willing to participate and who have not&#xD;
        participated yet in a protocol using a serial reaction time task (SRRT) and who are not or&#xD;
        were not a piano player.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with current use or history of alcohol or drug abuse, psychiatric disorder&#xD;
        requiring hospitalization or prolonged treatment, head injury with loss of consciousness,&#xD;
        epilepsy, and neurological disease. Subjects receiving drugs acting primarily on the&#xD;
        central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following exclusion criteria are due to the use of trans cranial magnetic stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with cardiac pacemakers, intracardiac lines, implanted medication pumps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with eye, blood vessel, cochlear, or eye implants, subjects with increased&#xD;
        intracranial pressure as evaluated by clinical means, subjects with metal in the cranium&#xD;
        except in the mouth, subjects with dental braces, metal fragments from occupational&#xD;
        exposure or surgical clips in or near the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since this protocol utilizes paired pulse stimulation, there is no reason to exclude&#xD;
        pregnant women. However, women in the last trimester of pregnancy will not be studied&#xD;
        because they will likely be uncomfortable for three hours training.&#xD;
