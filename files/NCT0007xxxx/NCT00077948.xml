  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-blocker medications have been shown to improve heart function and prolong the lives of&#xD;
      patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Some people with advanced CHF have difficulty&#xD;
      taking beta-blocker medications due to troublesome side effects, such as low blood pressure&#xD;
      and/or low heart rate, severe tiredness, dizziness, or shortness of breath. In other words,&#xD;
      they have difficulty tolerating beta-blocker medications. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if enoximone can improve a patient's ability to tolerate a beta-blocker medication.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, it has become evident that certain beta-blocking agents (beta-blockers)&#xD;
      exert a favorable effect on the natural history of mild to moderate chronic heart failure&#xD;
      (CHF), including reducing mortality and hospitalization rate. However, as heart failure&#xD;
      becomes more severe, beta-blockers become difficult to administer because of myocardial&#xD;
      depression leading to hemodynamic intolerance. A recent clinical study demonstrated that&#xD;
      subjects who could not tolerate the beta-blocker metoprolol experienced improved tolerability&#xD;
      when low-dose, oral enoximone was administered prior to the introduction of metoprolol and&#xD;
      during ongoing treatment. This study will investigate the hypotheses that by stabilizing&#xD;
      subjects on enoximone first, advanced CHF subjects who are intolerant of beta-blockade will&#xD;
      be able to 1) tolerate the effects of beta-blocker therapy, and 2) have clinical benefit that&#xD;
      is due to the combination of both enoximone and extended-release metoprolol succinate (ER&#xD;
      metoprolol). Support for these hypotheses will be sought by demonstrating that, as compared&#xD;
      to placebo, low-dose, oral enoximone plus ER metoprolol will increase left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF), improve symptoms of heart failure, and improve submaximal exercise&#xD;
      tolerance in subjects with CHF.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be considered an eligible subject, all of the following entry criteria must be&#xD;
        met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be competent to provide informed written consent. Subjects must sign an&#xD;
             IRB/IEC approved informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy with symptoms of NYHA Class&#xD;
             III or IV chronic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a LVEF of less than or equal to 35%, measured within 60 days of the&#xD;
             Screening Visit. LVEF must be assessed by radionuclide ventriculography (MUGA). If the&#xD;
             subject has experienced any cardiovascular events, has undergone any interventions, or&#xD;
             received any changes in treatment that may have affected LV function since the most&#xD;
             recent EF measurement, an LVEF measurement must be completed prior to the subject&#xD;
             being randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a left ventricular end diastolic dimension (LVEDD) of &gt;2.7 cm/m2 as&#xD;
             measured by 2-D ECHO within 12 months of the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be on optimal conventional heart failure therapy (with the exception of&#xD;
             a beta-blocker), including an ACEI for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit,&#xD;
             or the subject must have had a trial of an ACEI and proven to be intolerant, or the&#xD;
             subject must be taking an ARB for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit or&#xD;
             proved to be intolerant. Optimal conventional therapy may also include spironolactone,&#xD;
             digitalis glycosides, diuretics, or other vasodilators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have failed the initiation, or the up-titration, of a beta-blocker drug&#xD;
             due to hemodynamic intolerance within 12 months prior to the Screening Visit. Failure&#xD;
             to tolerate beta-blockade for hemodynamic reasons is defined as worsening signs and&#xD;
             symptoms of chronic heart failure, hypotension accompanied with symptoms, or evidence&#xD;
             of organ hypoperfusion, which in the judgment of the treating physician precluded&#xD;
             further treatment with the beta-blocker. This beta-blocker intolerance must have been&#xD;
             documented prior to Screening, and a narrative description of the intolerance must be&#xD;
             approved by Myogen prior to Randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;

             pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have undergone a cardiac revascularization, valvular surgery, or&#xD;

             criteria: 1) angina diagnosed as unstable at any time within the 60 days prior to the&#xD;
             Screening Visit or 2) angina is the primary symptom that limits daily physical&#xD;
             activity&#xD;
&#xD;
