      This study will collect quantities of white blood cells from patients infected with the&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) for research on the interactions between HCV and the human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in people infected with both of these agents. Several studies&#xD;
      have shown that infection with HIV adversely affects liver disease due to HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who are infected with both HCV and HIV or with HCV alone&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates must not have liver failure and must not be&#xD;
      undergoing treatment for HCV at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood cells. This procedure allows&#xD;
      collection of larger numbers of cells than would be possible with simple blood drawing. For&#xD;
      the procedure, blood is removed through a needle in the vein of one arm and spun in a machine&#xD;
      that separates the blood into its components. The white cells are extracted and the rest of&#xD;
      the blood is re-infused through the same needle or through a needle in the other arm. The&#xD;
      procedure takes approximately 1-3 hours, depending on the amount of white cells being&#xD;
      collected. A maximum of three leukapheresis procedures are done. If additional procedures are&#xD;
      required, the patient will sign a new consent form. Procedures will be limited to no more&#xD;
      than three times a year, or once every 4 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Hepatitis B (HBV) infection are known to cause morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality especially among those who are coinfected with Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
      HCV infected individuals who are also coinfected with HIV have more rapid progression of&#xD;
      liver disease, abnormal diagnostic serologies, higher levels of HCV viremia, and markedly&#xD;
      lower levels of therapeutic responses to the standard combination therapy with peginterferon&#xD;
      and ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying immunopathogenesis of HCV and HBV infection, progression of liver disease, and&#xD;
      interactions with HIV are not yet clearly understood. A clear understanding of the immune&#xD;
      correlates of protection against HCV and HBV are important in development of a vaccine for&#xD;
      HCV and novel immune-based therapeutics for the cure of HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit individuals who are coinfected with HIV and HCV and/or HBV as well as&#xD;
      those who are monoinfected with HCV or HBV. The study will enroll 2 groups. Participants in&#xD;
      the first group (hereafter referred to as Group 1) will consist of participants recruited for&#xD;
      research and clinical related blood draws, leukapheresis, and liver biopsies for long term&#xD;
      study participation. Participants in the second group (hereafter referred to as Group 2) will&#xD;
      consist of participants with known or suspected HCV and/or HBV who need assistance with&#xD;
      diagnosis or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 1 will be apheresed or undergo blood draw several times after&#xD;
      enrollment and may be followed for up to 10 years. Participants in Group 2 will be evaluated&#xD;
      for HBV and/or HCV infection or complications, or receive treatment. The expectation is that&#xD;
      may be followed for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukapheresis is used in Group 1 in order to obtain sufficient cells to pursue the following&#xD;
      objectives: delineating B cell response to CD4+ T cell help, delineating CD8+ T factors&#xD;
      associated with suppression of viral replication and normalization of immune function,&#xD;
      characterizing natural killer function relative to HCV and/or HBV disease, and identifying&#xD;
      biomarkers for progression of liver disease. The required number of mononuclear cells needed&#xD;
      to perform these experiments can be easily and safely obtained using leukapheresis procedures&#xD;
      in the Clinical Center Apheresis Unit. Participants who do not meet apheresis criteria may&#xD;
      participate through routine blood draws to contribute to this research. All participants in&#xD;
      Group 1 may also receive a liver biopsy at NIH (every 3 years for HIV/HCV coinfected and all&#xD;
      HBV infected and every 5 years for HCV monoinfected subjects) to assess the progression of&#xD;
      liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plans for Group 2 HBV and/or HCV will be in accordance with standard medical&#xD;
      practice, and the number and length of additional visits and diagnostic evaluations will vary&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
