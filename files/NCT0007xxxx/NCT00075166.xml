      This study will compare the effectiveness of craniotomy to that of stereotactic surgery (SRS)&#xD;
      for the treatment of metastatic brain tumors - tumors that first develop elsewhere in the&#xD;
      body and then travel to the brain. Craniotomy is surgical removal of the tumors through an&#xD;
      operation. SRS consists of highly focused radiation doses to the tumors. Neither treatment is&#xD;
      experimental and both have shown benefits to patients with metastatic brain tumors. This&#xD;
      study will determine whether one treatment is superior to the other in prolonging patient&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 21 years of age and older with one to three metastatic brain tumors may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Participants will have a medical history and physical examination, blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, an electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray. They will then be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      undergo either surgery or SRS. Before either procedure, patients will have a magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scan. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain&#xD;
      images of the brain. Patients scheduled for SRS will have a computed tomography (CT) scan in&#xD;
      addition to the MRI. CT uses X-rays to obtain images of the brain. During the CT, a contrast&#xD;
      agent is injected through an IV tube placed in a vein to enhance the CT images. For both the&#xD;
      MRI and CT tests, the patient lies on a table that slides into a cylindrical scanner. The MRI&#xD;
      usually lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, while the CT scan lasts for about 30 to 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for surgery will have general anesthesia or local anesthesia with&#xD;
      sedation. They will be in intensive care after the surgery until their condition is stable.&#xD;
      Before being discharged home, they will have another MRI scan. The surgical sutures or&#xD;
      staples will be removed 7 to 10 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for SRS will have their scalp numbed with medicine and their head will be&#xD;
      placed in a head frame. A CT scan will be done on the morning of the procedure to plan the&#xD;
      treatment. Around noon, the treatment, which consists of brief exposures to radiation, will&#xD;
      be administered with the patient positioned comfortably on a treatment couch. The treatment&#xD;
      will be completed in 1 to 2 hours, after which the head frame will be removed. After a brief&#xD;
      period of observation, the patient will be discharged home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to NIH for follow-up visits within 4 weeks after surgery or SRS and then&#xD;
      every 3 months after that for a medical history, physical examination, and MRI scan, and to&#xD;
      complete a quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;

      Introduction: Metastatic brain tumors occur more frequently than primary brain tumors and&#xD;
      occur in approximately 25% of patients who die of cancer each year. The main treatment goals&#xD;
      for patients with brain metastases are the relief of neurological symptoms and long-term&#xD;
      control of the tumors. Glucocorticoids and external beam whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)&#xD;
      comprise the current standard of care and increase median survival from one month to three to&#xD;
      six months. Patients with three or less tumors (greater than 70% of patients) also commonly&#xD;
      undergo surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with the goal of lengthening survival. Two&#xD;
      prospective randomized trials have shown a significant survival benefit for patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgical resection of single tumors in combination with WBRT compared to patients&#xD;
      receiving WBRT alone. Although there have been no prospective randomized studies comparing&#xD;
      SRS and WBRT to WBRT alone, there have been numerous large retrospective series reporting a&#xD;
      significant survival benefit from SRS. To date, a prospective randomized trial comparing&#xD;
      surgery to SRS has not been reported. Despite the lack of rigorous data, there are proponents&#xD;
      for each of these treatment modalities. Those in favor of surgery cite the ability to achieve&#xD;
      a complete resection in most cases, the almost immediate relief of symptoms, and the low rate&#xD;
      of local recurrence. Those in favor of SRS cite an equivalent degree of local tumor control&#xD;
      compared to surgery, the relative ease of the one day outpatient procedure, and the ability&#xD;
      to treat lesions in deeper brain structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: We plan to determine in a prospective randomized manner if surgery is superior to&#xD;
      SRS for prolonging survival in patients with one to three surgically accessible brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients aged twenty one years and older with one to three brain metastases&#xD;
      will be assessed for enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to undergo either&#xD;
      surgery or SRS for their tumors. Patients will then be followed at regularly scheduled&#xD;
      intervals for the duration of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure will be time of survival following treatment.&#xD;
      Among the secondary outcomes that will be measured over time are tumor recurrence or&#xD;
      progression, neurologic sign or symptom development, functional independence, steroid and&#xD;
      anticonvulsant use, and overall quality of life.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. be 21 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. have a histologically confirmed primary malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. be able to undergo an MRI scan of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. have one to three intraparenchymal brain metastases as identified on a brain MRI scan&#xD;
             with intravenous contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. have contrast enhancing tumor(s) that are well circumscribed and less than or equal to&#xD;
             4.0 cm in any dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. be appropriate for either procedure as determined by both a neurosurgeon and a&#xD;
             radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. have tumor(s) in the midbrain, pons, or medulla - patients undergoing surgical&#xD;
             resections in these areas are highly likely to develop significant neurological&#xD;
             deficits or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. have tumors within 10 millimeters of the optic apparatus (nerves and chiasm) or the&#xD;
             area postrema - patients undergoing SRS to these areas are at significant risk of&#xD;
             developing permanent blindness or intractable nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. be poor operative candidates from an anesthetic point of view secondary to other major&#xD;
             medical illnesses - the risk of undergoing general anesthesia outweighs the potential&#xD;
             benefit of undergoing surgical resection of a brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. have a coagulopathy demonstrated by an abnormal prothrombin time, activated partial&#xD;
             thromboplastin time, or thrombocytopenia (platelet count less that 150,000&#xD;
             platelets/mm3) - the risk of developing uncontrollable intra-operatively bleeding&#xD;
             outweighs the potential benefit of undergoing surgical resection of a brain&#xD;
             metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. have radiographic or cerebrospinal fluid specimen evidence of widespread&#xD;
             leptomeningeal metastasis - neither surgery nor SRS is a useful treatment modality for&#xD;
             this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. significant psychiatric impairments which, in the opinion of the investigators, will&#xD;
             interfere with the proper administration or completion of the protocol - self&#xD;
             explanatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. acute or untreated infections (viral, bacterial or fungal) - patients with active&#xD;
             infections are highly likely to have spread of their infections to the brain as a&#xD;
             result of a craniotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. be pregnant at the time of the randomized treatment - general anesthesia and surgery&#xD;
             may subject the fetus to unacceptable risks. Also, the NIH does not offer full&#xD;
             obstetrical services in the event that medical care to the mother and/or fetus is&#xD;
             required. Pregnant women presenting with brain metastases will be referred to&#xD;
             facilities offering OB/GYN services.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. be prisoners or other institutionalized individuals - these individuals are at risk of&#xD;
             being susceptible to undue influences to participate in a research protocol against&#xD;
             their free will.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. have a diagnosis of germ cell tumor, lymphoma or small cell lung cancer - these tumors&#xD;
             are highly radiosensitive and should therefore be treated with radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. have any of the following: aneurysm clip, implanted neural stimulator, implanted&#xD;
             cardiac pacemaker or auto defibrillator, cochlear implant, ocular foreign body or&#xD;
             implant [e.g. metal shavings, retinal clips], or insulin pump as these items would be&#xD;
             contra-indications to undergoing an MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. have an allergy to iodine or shellfish or have previously had an allergic reaction to&#xD;
             iodinated-contrast agents as this is a contra-indication to undergoing a contrast&#xD;
             enhanced CT of the brain - a contrast enhanced CT of the brain is required for the&#xD;
             planning of SRS.&#xD;
