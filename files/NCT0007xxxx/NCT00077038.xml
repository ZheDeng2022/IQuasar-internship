      This study will examine how the brain works when people look at an object, follow a moving&#xD;
      object with their eyes, and reach out their hand to an object. Different areas of the brain&#xD;
      work together in reaching out a hand to an object. These areas are also important for&#xD;
      concentrating on objects or following them with the eyes. This study will use&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) to observe more precisely how discrete parts of the brain work&#xD;
      during these movements. MEG is a new technique for recording magnetic field changes produced&#xD;
      by brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers 20 years of age and older who are right-handed and who have no&#xD;
      history of brain or eye disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened&#xD;
      with a medical history and brief physical examination. They will complete questionnaires for&#xD;
      MEG screening and for determining handedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo MEG recording and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For MEG, the subject&#xD;
      sits comfortably in front of a computer screen, and a cone containing magnetic field&#xD;
      detectors is lowered onto the head. Electrodes are placed on both sides of the outer part of&#xD;
      the eyelids and just above and below the left eye to monitor eye movement. During MEG,&#xD;
      subjects perform the following tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eye fixation: A small white cross and a white ring appear on the center of the computer&#xD;
           screen. Another white ring moves slowly around the screen in random fashion. Subjects&#xD;
           keep their eyes fixed on the central cross and concentrate on the ring at the center,&#xD;
           ignoring the moving ring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ocular tracking: The same cross and rings in task 1 appear on the screen, but in this&#xD;
           task the subjects follow the moving ring with their eyes and ignore the cross and ring&#xD;
           in the center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Peripheral manual tracking task (right hand): In addition to the cross and rings in task&#xD;
           1, a small white disc-shaped cursor appears on the screen. Using their right hand,&#xD;
           subjects use a joystick to move the cursor as precisely as possible to follow the moving&#xD;
           ring, while keeping their eyes fixed on the central cross.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Peripheral manual tracking task (left hand): The same as task 3, except using the left&#xD;
           hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Central manual tracking: The cross, rings, and joystick are the same as in task 3.&#xD;
           Subjects move the cursor to follow the moving ring as precisely as possible, while&#xD;
           following the moving ring with their eyes and ignoring the cross and ring in the center&#xD;
           of the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects practice each task before MEG recording starts. Then they perform each task twice in&#xD;
      random order, with a 1- or 2-minute break between tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who do not have previous MRI images filed in NINDS's database undergo MRI scanning.&#xD;
      MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues.&#xD;
      The scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Subjects lie still on&#xD;
      a table that can slide in an out of the cylinder. They can communicate with the MRI staff at&#xD;
      all times during the procedure.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that the parieto-frontal network is activated by visuomotor&#xD;
      behavior in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect frontal and parietal cortical activity during a visuomotor task with frequency&#xD;
      modulated visual stimuli using magnetoencephalography (MEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reveal how the parieto-frontal activities change according to different conditions of&#xD;
      attention, gaze, and motor output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right handed normal volunteers with no known history of neurological or ophthalmological&#xD;
      diseases will be recruited to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a combination of a frequency tagging method and an MEG. Visual stimuli are&#xD;
      presented, flickering in specific (tagged) frequencies. The cortical distribution of the&#xD;
      visual information is estimated from the tagged frequency response of the MEG signal. We will&#xD;
      use a visuomotor tracking task with a multifactorial task design (attention, target motion,&#xD;
      position in retinal coordinate, and manual tracking) to evaluate the effect of each factor&#xD;
      separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the adaptive linear-filter technique known as synthetic aperture magnetometry&#xD;
      (SAM) to estimate the source location and strength of the tagged frequencies. The estimated&#xD;
      cortical source activity power at the frontal and parietal cortices will be group analyzed&#xD;
      with multiple logistic models and by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with correction for&#xD;
      multiple comparisons.&#xD;
