  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine heart function using two imaging techniques - echocardiography&#xD;
      (ultrasound) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - to evaluate newly developed software for&#xD;
      echocardiograph machines. MRI and ultrasound both provide images of the heart structure and&#xD;
      function. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain the pictures, while&#xD;
      echocardiography uses sound waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with any form of heart disease and healthy volunteers 21 years of age and older may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Candidates must be and able to undergo magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      and must not have an irregular heart rhythm, heart valve disease, a pacemaker, defibrillator&#xD;
      implant, insulin pump, or other metallic implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have two ultrasound examinations and two magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      examinations, as described below. All the tests will be completed within 24 to 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography :&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this test, a small probe is passed over the chest. Sound waves emitted from the probe&#xD;
      bounce off the heart and are beamed back into the echo machine where they are recorded. The&#xD;
      sonographer does a baseline test, which is evaluated by the physician. Then, after a 10- to&#xD;
      20-minute break, portions of the test are repeated. The entire exam takes about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For MRI, the subject lies on a table that slides into a long doughnut-shaped scanner. A small&#xD;
      tube is placed in a vein in the hand or arm to give fluids and to infuse gadolinium, a&#xD;
      contrast material that brightens the images. Heart rate and blood pressure are monitored&#xD;
      during the study, which takes about 3 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to study the reproducibility of strain rate (SR)&#xD;
      echocardiography in normal volunteers and patients with cardiovascular disease. Tissue&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound is a technology which has been validated for the analysis of global and&#xD;
      regional left ventricular function and strain and SR measurements are derived from tissue&#xD;
      Doppler imaging (TDI) data. Over the last few years, several improvements in echo machine&#xD;
      hardware and software have facilitated the rapid acquisition and analysis of tissue Doppler&#xD;
      data, and therefore, strain and strain rate information has become easily accessible. Recent&#xD;
      publications have demonstrated the usefulness of these techniques in the analysis of systolic&#xD;
      and diastolic function of the left ventricle, and in the detection of regional wall motion&#xD;
      and ischemia. Several protocols recently initiated in the Cardiovascular Branch involve&#xD;
      echocardiographic imaging and include applications of TDI as their primary or secondary&#xD;
      endpoints. Therefore, the purpose of this protocol is to allow development of standardized&#xD;
      acquisition and analysis methods of TDI for our cardiology protocols and to evaluate the&#xD;
      reproducibility of TDI, SR, and strain measurements.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults older than 18 years will be recruited for the CAD group. Since regional wall motion&#xD;
        abnormalities, coronary artery disease, and heart failure are rare in subjects under 21, we&#xD;
        will limit this group to adults only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults older than age 18 who have undergone surgical repair of Tetralogy of Fallot will be&#xD;
        recruited. Normal controls will be age-matched to this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with pulmonary artery shunts placed within the last 6 months are not eligible to&#xD;
        undergo MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant or lactating (patients with uncertain pregnancy status will be required to have a&#xD;
        screening urine or blood pregnancy test).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Chronic atrial fibrillation; frequent PVC's (more than 1 every 10 heart beats).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, or other metallic implant which would exclude subject&#xD;
        from MRI examination (examples: central nervous system aneurysm clips, implanted neural&#xD;
        stimulator, cochlear implant, ocular foreign body, insulin pump, metal shrapnel or bullet).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with hemoglobinopathies or renal disease with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) less&#xD;
        than 20 ml/min will be excluded from MRI sequences involving administration of MRI contrast&#xD;
        agents.&#xD;
