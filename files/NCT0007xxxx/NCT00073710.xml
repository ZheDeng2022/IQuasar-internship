        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is ≥ 20 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is diagnosed with ESRD, and must be on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) three&#xD;
             times a week for at least 2 months prior to the Screening Phase and expected to remain&#xD;
             on HD for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal&#xD;
             for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy or hysterectomy), or is of childbearing potential and practicing one of&#xD;
             the following methods of birth control:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Contraceptives (oral or parenteral) for three months prior to study drug&#xD;
                  administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In a monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female, subject is not breastfeeding and has a negative serum pregnancy test prior&#xD;
             to the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had an intact PTH value &gt; 200 pg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum calcium level &lt; 10.2 mg/dL at Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum phosphorus level &lt; 6.5 mg/dL at Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ca´P product ≤ 65 at Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must voluntarily sign and date an informed consent, approved by an Institutional&#xD;
             Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), prior to the conduct of any&#xD;
             study-specific procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to vitamin D&#xD;
             or vitamin D related compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has chronic gastrointestinal disease, which in the Investigator's opinion, may&#xD;
             result in clinically significant GI malabsorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver function defects defined as &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal for liver enzyme&#xD;
             or &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal coagulation levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is taking maintenance calcitonin, glucocorticoids in an equivalent dose &gt; 5 mg&#xD;
             prednisone, or other drugs that may affect calcium or bone metabolism, other than&#xD;
             females on stable (same dose and product for 3 months) estrogen and/or progestin&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For any reason, subject is considered by the Investigator to be an unsuitable&#xD;
             candidate to receive pharmacological doses of vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has received any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to the Treatment&#xD;
             Phase.&#xD;
