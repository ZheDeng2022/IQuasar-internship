      This study will examine the role of an amphetamine in improving the effect that electrical&#xD;
      nerve stimulation has over brain flexibility associated with motor training in patients who&#xD;
      experienced a stroke more than 1 year before. Chronic stroke is the main cause of long-term&#xD;
      disability among adults. Previous studies have shown that electrical stimulation given over&#xD;
      the skin may improve patients' recovery of motor function. Furthermore, it is known that&#xD;
      amphetamines can improve the effects of sensory stimulation such as touch. Use dependent&#xD;
      plasticity refers to a process in which the performance of simple, repetitive finger&#xD;
      movements leads to encoding the details of those actions in the primary motor cortex of the&#xD;
      brain. Plasticity in this sense refers to the capacity for change in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have had a stroke, who have no history of other&#xD;
      neurological and psychiatric illnesses, and who are able to contrite and perform simple&#xD;
      attentional tasks and other tasks may be eligible for this study. There will also be healthy&#xD;
      participants as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an electrocardiogram. They will also go through a practice session of&#xD;
      about 3 hours in which they become familiar with the different tasks required in the study:&#xD;
      motor training, pinch force, and the Jebsen-Taylor Test-which requires doing as fast as&#xD;
      possible actions that include writing, lifting small common objects, turning pages, or&#xD;
      lifting light or heavy objects. Then during the study, patients will be involved in a variety&#xD;
      of sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor training alone for about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor training, amphetamine (or placebo), and electrical stimulation for about 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor training, amphetamine, and no electrical stimulation for about 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) scan will be done. Patients will lie still on a table&#xD;
      that can slide in and out of a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Scanning&#xD;
      time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes.&#xD;
      Patients may be asked to lie still for up to 60 minutes at a time. As the scanner takes&#xD;
      pictures, there will be loud knocking noises, and the patients will wear earplugs to muffle&#xD;
      the sound. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the&#xD;
      scan and may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During another procedure called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a wire coil will be&#xD;
      held over the scalp. A brief electrical current will be passed through the coil, creating a&#xD;
      magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Patients will hear a click and may feel a pulling&#xD;
      sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be muscle twitches of the face, arm, or leg.&#xD;
      Patients may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions so&#xD;
      that the coil can be positioned appropriately. The stimulation is usually not painful,&#xD;
      although sometimes strong contractions of the scalp muscles can cause discomfort or a&#xD;
      headache. Patients can ask to have the procedure discontinued at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the electrical stimulation procedure, three pairs of electrodes will be placed on the&#xD;
      skin. A quite brief pulse of current will pass between the electrodes, creating the&#xD;
      electrical field that activates the brain. Patients will feel a brief stinging around the&#xD;
      electrodes. Regarding the amphetamine, patients will take it orally on up to four different&#xD;
      occasions. Usually they will take 10 mg of Dexedrin before testing.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no universally accepted strategy to promote recovery of motor function after chronic&#xD;
      stroke, the main cause of long-term disability among adults. It is desirable to develop&#xD;
      strategies to enhance motor training in this patient group. A recent study in stroke patients&#xD;
      and healthy volunteers demonstrated that somatosensory nerve stimulation prior to motor&#xD;
      training leads to improvements in use-dependent plasticity (UDP), a process thought to&#xD;
      underlie recovery of motor function after brain injury (Sawaki et al., unpublished&#xD;
      information). Interestingly, the effects of sensory input on cortical plasticity can be&#xD;
      enhanced by a single dose of amphetamine. The objective of this protocol is to further&#xD;
      enhance the effect that somatosensory nerve stimulation has on motor training by means of&#xD;
      pre-medication with amphetamine. This effect over motor training will be measured by the&#xD;
      magnitude of training-induced UDP. Our hypothesis is that the amphetamine-enhanced effects of&#xD;
      somatosensory nerve stimulation will increase the magnitude of training-induced UDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study 24 patients with chronic strokes and 24 healthy age- and gender matched&#xD;
      normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will participate in 5 different randomized sessions on separate days. The first&#xD;
      session will be a familiarization with the behavioral tasks. A second experiment will consist&#xD;
      of training with no further interventions to obtain baseline UDP changes. In another two&#xD;
      sessions, subjects will be premedicated in a blind manner with amphetamine or placebo before&#xD;
      administration of somatosensory nerve stimulation followed by motor training to induce UDP.&#xD;
      In the last experiment, the participants will be premedicated with amphetamine and will be&#xD;
      exposed to sham somatosensory stimulation prior to the motor training to induce UDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure will be the magnitude of UDP (training-induced changes in&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked kinematic responses). Secondary outcome measures are&#xD;
      pinch force; and a functional measure of activities of daily life (ADL): Jebsen-Tailor-Test.&#xD;
      To better understand the mechanisms underlying the proposed behavioral gains, we will use TMS&#xD;
      to identify changes in corticomotor excitability.&#xD;
