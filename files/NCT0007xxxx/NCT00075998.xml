      -  Purpose: A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the&#xD;
           efficacy and safety of 200 Âµg of recombinant Interferon gamma-1b administered by&#xD;
           subcutaneous (SC) injection, compared with placebo, in patients with IPF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrollment: Approximately 800 patients will be enrolled from approximately 80 centers in&#xD;
           North America and Europe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization: 2:1 active-to-placebo ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration: at least 2 years active drug or placebo (rescue therapy will be permitted for&#xD;
           patients who meet predefined criteria)&#xD;

      INSPIRE, the largest and most comprehensive clinical trial ever conducted in IPF, has now&#xD;
      completed enrolling patients with mild to moderate IPF. Eligible patients will receive either&#xD;
      Interferon gamma-1b or placebo for a minimum of 2 years.&#xD;
