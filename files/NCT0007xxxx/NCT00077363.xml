  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine together with tipifarnib works&#xD;
      in treating women with taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop&#xD;
      growing or die. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes&#xD;
      necessary for their growth. Giving capecitabine together with tipifarnib may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate in patients with&#xD;
      taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treated with capecitabine plus tipifarnib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate toxicity in patients with taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treated&#xD;
      with capecitabine plus tipifarnib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate progression free survival, time to treatment failure, and overall survival in&#xD;
      patients with taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treated with capecitabine plus&#xD;
      tipifarnib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses beyond documentation&#xD;
      of CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with&#xD;
             manifestations of metastatic progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one objective measurable disease parameter as defined by&#xD;
             RECIST criteria; tumor measurements and evaluation of non-measurable sites must be&#xD;
             performed within 4 weeks prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In order to be eligible for inclusion, patients must meet all of the following&#xD;
             criteria with regard to prior cytotoxic therapy: (1) prior treatment with an&#xD;
             anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin, epirubicin) either in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant&#xD;
             setting and/or for metastatic disease, (2) prior treatment with a taxane (i.e.&#xD;
             paclitaxel, docetaxel) for metastatic disease, or relapse while receiving adjuvant&#xD;
             taxane therapy (3) progressive disease while receiving taxane therapy or up to 30 days&#xD;
             after receiving the last taxane dose, (4) no more than three prior cytotoxic regimens&#xD;
             for metastatic disease, (5) no prior treatment with capecitabine or 5-flourouracil for&#xD;
             metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior hormonal therapy in either the metastatic or adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting is&#xD;
             allowed, but patients must have been off such therapy for greater than or equal to 1&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No prior radiotherapy other than to the conserved breast, to the postmastectomy chest&#xD;
             wall or to a limited field involving less than 25% of marrow - containing bone&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Previously irradiated tumors cannot be used to assess a clinical response;&#xD;
                  patients will not be eligible for this study if the previously irradiated tumors&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have previously received tipifarnib or other farnesyl transferase&#xD;
             inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be disease-free of prior malignancies for &gt; 5 years with the exception&#xD;
             of curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin or carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl or measured (or calculated)&#xD;
             creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/minute&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Granulocytes &gt; 1500/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm^3&#xD;

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) =&lt; 3 x upper limit of normal (unless liver is involved by&#xD;
             tumor, in which case SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) can be =&lt; 5 x upper limit of normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding since there is no information regarding&#xD;
             the use of these agents in this population; a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             is required within 14 days prior to registration if pre- or perimenopausal (i.e., last&#xD;
             menstrual period within one year of registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential are strongly advised to use an accepted and effective&#xD;
             method of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with current or previously treated brain metastases are ineligible; patients&#xD;
             who are taking enzyme inducing anticonvulsant medications are also not eligible (e.g.,&#xD;
             phenobarbital, phenytoin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had prior organ allograft or received immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not&#xD;
             limited to, chronic nausea/vomiting, complete or partial bowel obstruction,&#xD;
             dysphagia/odynophagia with inability to swallow pills, ongoing or active infection,&#xD;
             symptomatic cardiovascular disease, or other chronic medical or psychiatric conditions&#xD;

             in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received previous treatment with cytotoxic drugs, and/or&#xD;
             radiotherapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to registration; concurrent radiation therapy is not&#xD;
             permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because of the potential for a drug interaction between warfarin and both tipifarnib&#xD;
             and capecitabine, patients taking warfarin adjusted to an elevated INR are not&#xD;
             eligible; patients taking prophylactic low-dose warfarin (i.e., 1 mg daily) are&#xD;
             eligible, but a PT and INR are required within 2 weeks of registration and must be&#xD;
             normal&#xD;
