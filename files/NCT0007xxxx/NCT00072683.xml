  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's purpose is to determine whether tolvaptan can safely and effectively return the&#xD;
      body's balance of sodium and water toward normal, and to characterize and quantify the&#xD;
      potential clinical benefits of this treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration below the lower limit of normal and&#xD;
      is the most frequently encountered electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients.&#xD;
      Generally speaking, most cases of hyponatremia are mild. However, as the serum sodium falls&#xD;
      below 130 mEq/L, the possibility of significant morbidity and mortality increases, and most&#xD;
      clinicians will initiate corrective therapy for serum sodium values approaching 130 mEq/L and&#xD;
      lower. The reasons for treating hyponatremia relate both to the symptoms, which may be quite&#xD;
      disturbing to patients, as well as to potential outcomes including permanent neurological&#xD;
      damage and death. There is also growing awareness of the association between hyponatremia and&#xD;
      increased mortality in patients with heart failure.A common theme underlying the occurrence&#xD;
      of hyponatremia whether in the setting of congestive heart failure, hepatic failure with&#xD;
      ascites, or the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) is the non-osmotic&#xD;
      secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The presence of excess AVP leads to fluid retention&#xD;
      and hyponatremia. Agents that antagonize AVP, causing proportionally more water diuresis than&#xD;
      solute excretion, could offer a significant treatment option for patients with hyponatremia,&#xD;
      compared to fluid restriction alone. Treatment of hyponatremia, particularly in clinical&#xD;
      settings such as decompensated congestive heart failure, is difficult as conventional&#xD;
      diuretics cause neurohormonal activation and further stimulate the inappropriate release of&#xD;
      vasopressin, leading to additional retention of free water and aggravation of hypoosmolality.&#xD;
      Similarly, for cirrhosis with ascites and SIADH, conventional diuretics are either minimally&#xD;
      effective or completely contraindicated. An alternative approach to symptom relief and&#xD;
      treatment of hyponatremia may be the use of vasopressin antagonists, which increase free&#xD;
      water clearance with proportionally less effect on sodium excretion. Tolvaptan is an oral&#xD;
      vasopressin antagonist with relative affinity for the V2 receptor which has been shown to&#xD;
      induce a diuresis with proportionally more free-water than sodium loss. The current study is&#xD;
      being undertaken in order to evaluate whether tolvaptan, an oral AVP inhibitor, will be&#xD;
      effective in correcting mild to moderate hyponatremia, and to elucidate the effect of this&#xD;
      correction on the subject's well-being.&#xD;
