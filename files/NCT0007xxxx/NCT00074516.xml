      This study will test the effectiveness of a combination of anti-rejection medicines in&#xD;
      preventing complications typically seen in cystinosis patients undergoing kidney transplants.&#xD;
      Cystinosis is a rare disease affecting children that causes growth retardation and kidney&#xD;
      failure. Kidney transplant is the standard treatment for kidney failure in these patients,&#xD;
      followed by immunosuppression to prevent organ rejection. The standard drug regimen for&#xD;
      immunosuppression includes steroids, which can lead to other serious complications. This&#xD;
      study will look at combination therapy that does not include steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 7 years of age and older with cystinosis who are candidates for a kidney transplant&#xD;
      at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center may be eligible for this 5-year study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Kidney transplant: Patients undergo kidney transplant surgery under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Central line placement: A large intravenous catheter (plastic tube, or IV line) is&#xD;
           placed in a vein in the chest or neck under local anesthesia before the transplant&#xD;
           surgery. The line remains in place for some time during the hospitalization to&#xD;
           administer immunosuppressive medications, antibiotics, and blood, if needed. The line is&#xD;
           also used to collect blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Leukapheresis: This procedure for collecting white blood cells is done before the&#xD;
           transplant. The cells are studied to evaluate the patient's immune system. Whole blood&#xD;
           is withdrawn through a catheter in an arm vein or through the central line and directed&#xD;
           into a machine that separates the blood components by spinning. The white cells are&#xD;
           removed and the red cells and plasma are returned to the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Immunosuppressive medication following transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adults receive thymoglobulin at the time of the transplant and for 3 days after&#xD;
                surgery; mycophenolate mofetil daily after the transplant; tacrolimus twice a day&#xD;
                once the kidney is working well; and sirolimus daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Children receive daclizumab the day of the transplant, day 4 after surgery, and at&#xD;
                weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 15, 19, and 23, and mycophenolate mofetil daily after the&#xD;
                transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Follow-up visits: After discharge from the hospital, patients return to the Clinical&#xD;
           Center for follow-up at 6 months, at 1 year, and then yearly for 5 years. A physical&#xD;
           examination is done the first four visits, and blood and urine samples are collected at&#xD;
           every visit. Kidney biopsies (removal of a small amount of kidney tissue through a thin&#xD;
           needle) are done at 6 months, 1, 3, and 5 years after the transplant. The biopsied&#xD;
           tissue is examined to evaluate how well the kidney is responding to the&#xD;
           immunosuppression medicines, to determine whether more or less medication is needed, and&#xD;
           to evaluate how the patient is responding to the donor kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Routine laboratory tests, coordinated by the patient's local physician, are done 2 to 3&#xD;
           times a week for the first 2 to 3 months after transplantation, then weekly for several&#xD;
           more months, and at least monthly for life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive disorder due to impaired cystine transport across the&#xD;
      lysosomal membrane, resulting in abnormal cystine accumulation throughout the body. Fanconi&#xD;
      syndrome manifests in the first year of life, and end-stage renal failure occurs at ~10 years&#xD;
      of age, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. Oral cysteamine therapy delays but does&#xD;
      not always prevent the need for a renal allograft in cystinosis, which accounts for ~3% of&#xD;
      all pediatric transplants in the United States. With improvements in immunosuppression,&#xD;
      short-term graft and patient survival is quite good for cystinosis patients, although not as&#xD;
      good as for patients with ESRD due to structural defects. Long-term graft survival can be&#xD;
      affected by the non-renal complications of cystinosis, which persist after renal&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to establish standards for the transplantation of kidneys into&#xD;
      patients with nephropathic cystinosis using steroid-sparing immunosuppression. Our goals are&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyze the long and short term outcome of cystinosis patients following living and&#xD;
           cadaveric kidney transplantation using steroid-free immunosuppression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine a consistent clinical approach to recipients with cystinosis in the immediate&#xD;
           post-operative period, specifically regarding fluid and electrolyte management,&#xD;
           retention of native kidneys, and timing of the re-initiation of cystinosis therapy after&#xD;
           transplantation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the immunologic impact of cystinosis by monitoring immune responses using a&#xD;
           number of in vitro assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will receive a living donor or cadaveric kidney transplant with&#xD;
      steroid free immunosuppression. Graft function, histology and graft and patient survival will&#xD;
      be measured. Progression of cystinosis in other organ systems will be monitored. Additional&#xD;
      studies on the graft will include transcriptional analysis of inflammatory and immunologic&#xD;
      mediators. Serum will be assayed for inflammatory mediators and peripheral white blood cells&#xD;
      assayed for immune function. This study will represent the first comprehensive, prospective&#xD;
      analysis of kidney transplantation in patients with cystinosis.&#xD;
