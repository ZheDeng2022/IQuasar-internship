  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (also known as tenofovir DF or Viread) is used with other&#xD;
      anti-HIV drugs to treat HIV infection. Taking tenofovir DF every day may also prevent HIV&#xD;
      infection. This study will determine if taking a tenofovir DF tablet every day is safe and&#xD;
      effective in preventing HIV infection. Participants in the study will be sex workers in Phnom&#xD;
      Penh, Cambodia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cambodia has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in Southeast Asia. At the end of 2002,&#xD;
      HIV infection rates among Cambodian sex workers ranged from 14.8% to 28.8%. Tenofovir DF is a&#xD;
      nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that was licensed for the treatment of&#xD;
      HIV-1 infection by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2001. This&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial will determine if a daily oral 300 mg dose of tenofovir DF is safe&#xD;
      and effective in preventing HIV-1 infection. This is a collaborative study between the&#xD;
      University of California, San Francisco, the University of New South Wales, and the Ministry&#xD;
      of Health of Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine hundred and sixty HIV uninfected female sex workers in Phnom Penh will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the trial. Participants will be randomized to receive either 300 mg of tenofovir DF or&#xD;
      placebo daily for 12 months. Participants will be evaluated for rates of HIV infection,&#xD;
      adherence to the drug regimen, and changes in risk behaviors. All participants will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the trial for side effects and toxicity. Participants will be involved&#xD;
      in the study for 14 months.&#xD;
