        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant solid tumor&#xD;
             or lymphoma. Malignancy must be advanced and require systemic therapy. Malignancy must&#xD;
             be one for which no standard therapy is available or the patient must not be a&#xD;
             candidate for standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Status of &gt;= 70%,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of &gt;= 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be aged &gt;= 18 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5&#xD;
             mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/minute/1.73m2,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by ANC &gt;= 1,500 mm3 and&#xD;
             platelets &gt;= 100,000 mm3, must have adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin&#xD;
             &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL and alanine transaminase (ALAT) and aspartate transaminase (ASAT) &lt;= 2.5&#xD;
             times the upper limits of normal (ULN) (unless related to liver metastases in which&#xD;
             case &lt;= 5 x ULN),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration&#xD;
             of the study, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must give written informed consent prior to any study-specific screening&#xD;
             procedures with the understanding that the patient may withdraw consent at any time&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had radiation to &gt;= 25% of their bone marrow (e.g., pelvic&#xD;
             radiation) within 4 weeks of E7820 treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from any clinically significant chemotherapy or&#xD;
             radiotherapy related toxicity at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received investigational drugs or other antineoplastic therapy&#xD;
             within 28 days of E7820 treatment,&#xD;

          -  Patients who have had major surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. -- Women of childbearing potential with&#xD;

             growth on sequential MRI or CT scans),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are known to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B&#xD;
             core antibody, hepatitis C antibody, or human immunodeficiency virus,&#xD;
&#xD;
