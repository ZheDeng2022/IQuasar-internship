  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore factors that affect obesity and obesity-related diseases in both&#xD;
      Caucasians and African Americans. By looking at the rate at which the human body burns&#xD;
      calories while at rest (resting energy expenditure, or REE) and at the rate at which fat&#xD;
      travels through the blood (fatty acid flux), this study will examine the relationship between&#xD;
      REE and fatty acid flux, both of which are determinants of obesity. Researchers will compare&#xD;
      the test results of Caucasians and African Americans to determine if race has an effect on&#xD;
      the relationship between REE and fatty acid flux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers must be between 18 and 49 years of age. Equal numbers of typical weight,&#xD;
      overweight, and obese participants will be recruited. Candidates will be screened with a&#xD;
      physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood tests, and will be interviewed about diet&#xD;
      and exercise habits, family and medical history, and employment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be placed on a two-week maintenance diet (prepared by a dietician to&#xD;
      regulate and maintain calorie consumption) and must visit an outpatient clinic for weight&#xD;
      measurement for 10 consecutive weekdays. During the two-week diet, participants will also&#xD;
      undergo two 20-minute computerized scans to measure abdominal and body fat. At the end of the&#xD;
      two weeks, participants will then be hospitalized for two days to allow researchers to&#xD;
      conduct blood tests, oral glucose tests, and a physical examination to measure REE and fatty&#xD;
      acid flux levels for comparison.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty percent of Americans are obese. Women are more severely affected than men.&#xD;
      African-Americans are more severely affected than Caucasians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the metabolic consequences of obesity, it is essential to know the rate at&#xD;
      which free fatty acids (FFA) are released from adipose tissue. Circulating FFA contribute to&#xD;
      the complications of obesity particularly diabetes and heart disease. As there are sex and&#xD;
      race differences in the prevalence of all these conditions there may be sex and race&#xD;
      differences in FFA flux. FFA flux represents the rate at which FFA circulate. FFA flux is the&#xD;
      result of three processes going on at the same time, (1) the rate FFA are released from&#xD;
      adipose tissue, (2) the rate circulating FFA are used for energy, and (3) the rate FFA leaves&#xD;
      the circulation to re-enter adipose tissue. No data is available on whether sex and race&#xD;
      differences in FFA flux exist. Further, when comparing subjects of different size, sex and&#xD;
      race, it is unknown whether FFA flux should be corrected for lean body mass or resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if there are sex and race differences in FFA flux and to ensure adequate&#xD;
      enrollment of both African American and Caucasians, this investigation is a collaborative&#xD;
      effort between the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland and the Mayo&#xD;
      Clinic in Olmsted County, Minnesota. The greater Washington, DC, metropolitan area, where NIH&#xD;
      is located, has a large African-American community whereas over 90 percent of residents of&#xD;
      Olmsted County are Caucasians. Therefore, sex differences in FFA flux in African Americans&#xD;
      will be mainly studied at the National Institutes of Health. Sex differences in FFA flux in&#xD;
      Caucasians will be mainly studied at the Mayo Clinic. But, to confirm the ability to combine&#xD;
      data from two different sites, some Caucasians will be enrolled at NIH and some African&#xD;
      Americans will be enrolled at the Mayo Clinic. The results of the two studies will be&#xD;
      combined to determine if there are race differences in FFA flux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At NIH, 50 African-Americans (25M, 25W, age range 18-49 years) and 14 Caucasians (7M, 7W age&#xD;
      range 18-49 years) will be enrolled. Equal numbers of normal weight, overweight and obese&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited. As outpatients, participants will be placed on weight maintaining&#xD;
      diets for two weeks and then admitted for a two-day hospital stay. On each in-hospital&#xD;
      morning, resting energy expenditure will be measured and stable isotopes infused to measure&#xD;
      FFA flux. Stable isotopes are naturally occurring forms of elements, which are safe and&#xD;
      non-radioactive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the study of African-Americans at NIH it will be possible to determine if (a) the rate&#xD;
      of FFA release in African-Americans is more highly related to lean body mass or to resting&#xD;
      energy expenditure, and (b) if there is a sex difference in this relationship. Then as&#xD;
      described above, the results from the Mayo Clinic and NIH will be combined to determine if&#xD;
      there are race differences in the FFA flux.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A total of 134 subjects, age range 18 to 49 will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  64 African-Americans (32 men, 32 women)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  56 Caucasians (35 men, 35 women)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Within each racial group equal numbers of normal weight, overweight and obese subjects will&#xD;
        be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        African-Americans: Individuals will be considered to be African-American if they&#xD;
        self-identify as African-American and were born in the United States. Further they must&#xD;
        describe both parents as being African-American and born in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: We will recruit subjects between the ages of 18 and 49 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Weight: Enrollees must weigh less than 136 kg (300 lbs) and have a BMI less than 36&#xD;
        kg/m(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Screening Blood Work: To enroll subjects must have normal hemoglobin levels, electrolyte&#xD;
        panel and normal kidney, thyroid and liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hysterectomy: Women who have had hysterectomies may participate as long as they are less&#xD;
        than or equal to 49 years of age and have normal gonadotropin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Weight and Exercise Regimens: Subjects must report that they have been weight stable for at&#xD;
        least 3 months and will not initiate a rigorous exercise regimen during participation in&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: As above, subjects less than 18 years or greater than 49 years will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Weight: Subjects greater than 136 kg (300 lbs) or BMI greater than 36 kg/m(2) will not be&#xD;
        enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medications: Subjects taking medications that are known to affect the parameters under&#xD;
        investigation will be excluded. Some examples of such medications are: oral contraceptives,&#xD;
        depoprovera, antihyperglycemic medications, antihypertensives, hypolipidemics, steroids or&#xD;
        antiobesity agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical conditions, specifically: Diabetes, Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Breastfeeding: Women who are breastfeeding or have an infant less than four months of age&#xD;
        will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy: Pregnant women will be excluded from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Minority Status other than African-American: After the sample size necessary to achieve&#xD;
        clinically relevant data is calculated, the plan is to seek permission from the IRB to&#xD;
        expand this study by the enrollment of other minorities.&#xD;
