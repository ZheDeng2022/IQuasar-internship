  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect biological samples for use in research experiments aimed at better&#xD;
      understanding the clinical features of certain diseases. The specimens may be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of known therapies, refine treatment approaches, identify&#xD;
      potential new therapies, and explore opportunities for disease prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following individuals 2 years of age or older may be eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a cancerous solid tumor or a cancerous or non-cancerous blood disorder who&#xD;
           are being screened for or who are enrolled in a treatment study at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
           Center&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HLA-compatible donor family members (18 years of age or older) of the above patients who&#xD;
           are being evaluated for or are enrolled in an NIH study as a stem cell transplant donor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a cancerous solid tumor or a cancerous or non-cancerous blood disorder or&#xD;
           a bone marrow failure condition who cannot participate in an NIH treatment protocol or&#xD;
           travel to the NIH Clinical Center and who are referred for participation through their&#xD;
           home health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research samples will be collected from participants when blood is drawn or bone marrow,&#xD;
      urine, or stool is collected, or tumor or other tissue is biopsied as part of their general&#xD;
      medical care. Investigators may periodically request an additional sample of blood, stool, or&#xD;
      urine. Participants who are 18 years of age or older may donate a large number of white blood&#xD;
      cells through a procedure called leukapheresis. This procedure is not part of general medical&#xD;
      care and would be done for research purposes only. For apheresis, a catheter (plastic tube)&#xD;
      is placed in a vein in the subject's arm. Blood flows from the vein into a cell separator&#xD;
      machine, where the white cells are separated from the red cells, platelets, and plasma by a&#xD;
      spinning process. The white cells are removed and collected, and the rest of the blood is&#xD;
      returned to the subject through a second tube placed in the other arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to collect blood, bone marrow, urine, stool, oral samples,&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal samples and/or both malignant and non-malignant tissue from patients who are&#xD;
      either being evaluated for enrollment, are consented to NIH Clinical Center treatment&#xD;
      protocols, or are receiving therapy for their disease through home health care providers.&#xD;
      Since a substantial proportion of the clinical and translational research in the NHLBI&#xD;
      involves patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation, this protocol will also be&#xD;
      open to people identified as suitable HLA compatible donors for patients undergoing&#xD;
      evaluation for or already enrolled in an allogeneic stem cell transplant protocol or&#xD;
      receiving a stem cell transplant through their home health care providers. These HLA&#xD;
      compatible donors will serve as a source of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (peripheral&#xD;
      blood draws or leukapheresis) for use in evaluating allogeneic graft versus host and&#xD;
      graft-versus-tumor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to provide a mechanism for collection, tracking, storing,&#xD;
      dispensing, analyzing, and disposing of these laboratory research samples from patients and&#xD;
      HLA matched donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no primary endpoint.&#xD;
