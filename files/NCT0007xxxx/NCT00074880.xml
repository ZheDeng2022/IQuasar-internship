    <textblock>
      This study will examine how heart stiffness and a weak atrium affect exercise capacity and&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The atrium is the booster&#xD;
      pumping chamber of the heart that helps the ventricle (main pumping chamber), to fill&#xD;
      properly. HCM is an inherited disease in which the ventricle becomes thickened and, in some&#xD;
      patients, stiff. The stiffness makes it difficult for the ventricle to fill and empty,&#xD;
      causing breathing difficulty, fatigue, and reduced exercise capacity. Scar formation and a&#xD;
      weakened atrium can cause the heart to stiffen. Information gained from this study may guide&#xD;
      doctors in prescribing medicines to reduce scarring or improve atrial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 21 years of age and older with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG), blood tests, Holter monitor, and echocardiogram. A Holter monitor is&#xD;
      a device about the size of a Walkman that is connected to three wires that are attached to&#xD;
      the chest. It is worn for 24 hours to provide continuous monitoring of heart rhythm. An&#xD;
      echocardiogram uses a small probe that emits sound waves to produce images of the heart. The&#xD;
      probe is moved across the chest and the reflection of the sound waves from the chambers of&#xD;
      the heart produce images showing the heart's thickness and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures over 3 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous cannula insertion: A plastic tube is inserted into an arm vein for&#xD;
           collecting blood samples to measure substances that the heart and circulatory system&#xD;
           release at rest and during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impedance cardiography: A small current of electricity is passed across the chest and&#xD;
           electrodes similar to those used for an EKG test are placed to measure blood flow in the&#xD;
           area of the current.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary artery catheterization: A catheter (plastic tube) is inserted into a vein&#xD;
           either in the arm, under the collarbone, or in the neck and advanced to the right atrium&#xD;
           and ventricle. The catheter remains in place during the echocardiogram tilt and bicycle&#xD;
           exercise tests (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram tilt test: The patient lies flat on a table. After a few minutes, the&#xD;
           table is tilted so that the patient's head is just above his or her feet for a short&#xD;
           while, then is positioned flat again, and then tilted so the feet are just above the&#xD;
           head. Echocardiographic measurements and blood samples are taken at intervals to examine&#xD;
           heart function during changes in posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram bicycle stress test: The patient exercises for as long as possible on a&#xD;
           bicycle-like machine while lying on his or her back. Echocardiographic measurements and&#xD;
           blood samples are taken at intervals during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treadmill stress test: The patient runs for as long as possible on a treadmill that&#xD;
           increases in difficulty. The patient wears a facemask or mouthpiece through which small&#xD;
           amounts of gases are added in order to measure the ability of the heart and lung to&#xD;
           increase their effectiveness with exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digoxin loading: Only patients who demonstrate limited exercise capacity and for whom&#xD;
           digoxin is not a risk will undergo this procedure. A medicine that makes the heart&#xD;
           contract more strongly, digoxin is used to treat certain heart abnormalities. Patients&#xD;
           are given doses of either digoxin or placebo (a look-alike injection with no active&#xD;
           ingredient) at 4-hour intervals over a 24-hour period and then repeat the tilt test and&#xD;
           the bicycle and treadmill exercise tests&#xD;

      Primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiac disease characterized by&#xD;
      thickening (hypertrophy) of the left ventricular (LV) wall, dyspnea and/or fatigue in the&#xD;
      setting of a normal or supra-normal LV ejection fraction. The specific mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      heart failure-related symptomatology in non-obstructive HCM are poorly defined, but as the&#xD;
      vast majority of HCM patients with heart failure have apparently preserved LV contractile&#xD;
      function, their symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue are presumed due to perturbations of the&#xD;
      relaxation/filling phase (diastole) of the cardiac cycle, which has been termed &quot;diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction&quot;. In fact, diastole is mechanistically complex and involves LV pressure decay&#xD;
      (relaxation), chamber compliance and atrial contractile function. LV end-diastolic volume,&#xD;
      which represents fiber stretch, governs LV contractile function and stroke volume via the&#xD;
      Frank-Starling mechanism. End-diastolic fiber stretch is, in turn, dependent on late&#xD;
      diastolic filling due to atrial ejection. This atrial &quot;booster pump&quot; is load-dependent and&#xD;
      also responsive to inotropic effect. The interaction of atrial inotropic reserve, LV&#xD;
      end-diastolic pressure (atrial afterload) and LV compliance (which mediates LV end-diastolic&#xD;
      pressure and volume) may be generically considered as &quot;atrio-ventricular coupling&quot; which, in&#xD;
      theory, should be at least partially responsible for modulations in exercise-induced&#xD;
      augmentation of cardiac output related to enhancement of LV end-diastolic volume or &quot;preload&#xD;
      reserve&quot;. Previous studies have suggested that limitations of preload reserve may explain&#xD;
      exercise-associated symptoms of congestive heart failure. The potential ability of new&#xD;
      technologies to accurately assess atrio-ventricular coupling as it relates to preload reserve&#xD;
      present opportunities for investigation into mechanisms of heart failure operative in&#xD;
      patients with stiff left ventricles with intact systolic function. Elucidation of these&#xD;
      previously unapproachable mechanisms may be important in targeting therapy and the design and&#xD;
      analysis of future interventional trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, we hypothesize that exercise intolerance in HCM patients is due to&#xD;
      limited LV preload-reserve which, in turn, is mediated by disequilibrium of atrio-ventricular&#xD;
      coupling and, possibly, limitations in atrial inotropic reserve. We will test novel analytic&#xD;
      tools, including measures of LV compliance and load-independent atrial systolic fuction&#xD;
      (atrial systolic elastance), in attempts to dissect out the components of atrio-ventricular&#xD;
      coupling which underly HCM-associated symptoms and reduced preload reserve. Further, we will&#xD;
      assess serum and cardiac MRI markers of myocardial fibrosis to determine the effect of&#xD;
      collagen remodeling on LV relaxation, compliance and atrial afterload. Finally, we will&#xD;
      examine the effects of short-term cardiac glycoside (inotropic) therapy on atrial systolic&#xD;
      elastance, preload reserve and exercise tolerance. The results of this investigation will be&#xD;
      implemented in the design of subsequent interventional protocols targeted towards mechanisms&#xD;
      of the stiff heart syndrome.&#xD;
