  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal goal of this clinical trial is to assess the ability of cenersen sodium (EL625)&#xD;
      to improve cancer responsiveness to the established AML therapeutic agent Idarubicin used&#xD;
      alone or in combination with Cytarabine (Ara-C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cenersen sodium is a drug that is designed to block the effects of a protein called p53.&#xD;
      Laboratory evidence shows that blocking p53 will make many types of cancer, including acute&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia (AML), more sensitive to a variety of established cancer therapeutics&#xD;
      while making normal tissues more resistant to the toxic effects of these agents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to assess the ability of cenersen sodium (EL625) in&#xD;
      combination with Idarubicin alone or with Cytarabine to either: (1) induce remissions in&#xD;
      patients who have previously failed to go into remission in response to chemotherapy; or (2)&#xD;
      provide patents who have relapsed after going into a chemotherapy-induced remission with a&#xD;
      longer remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cenersen sodium is one of a new class of drugs called antisense oligonucleotides (oligos).&#xD;
      Oligos are designed to block the production of specific proteins and thereby inhibit their&#xD;
      function. Cenersen sodium targets p53, a widely studied protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cancer, p53 occurs either in the un-mutated (&quot;normal&quot;) or mutated forms. The majority of&#xD;
      participants in this trial are expected to have un-mutated p53. Cenersen sodium is&#xD;
      anticipated to sensitize cancers with un-mutated p53 to most established cancer therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      p53 has a pivotal role in protecting the body from cells that have suffered genetic damage&#xD;
      and, as a result, do not function properly. The protein first senses the level of the damage&#xD;
      and then forces the damaged cell to respond to the damage either by repairing itself or&#xD;
      committing suicide. In general, the greater the level of damage the more likely the cellular&#xD;
      response will be suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many cancer therapeutics, including both chemotherapy and radiation, cause the types of&#xD;
      genetic damage that activate p53 and, consequently, cause either damage repair or cellular&#xD;
      suicide. Laboratory studies suggest that cancer cells have a host of defenses that reduce the&#xD;
      chances that these cells will respond to genetic damage by committing suicide. So compared to&#xD;
      normal cells, cancer cells are more likely to repair the damage caused by cancer therapeutics&#xD;
      while normal cells are more likely to commit suicide. Thus, blocking un-mutated p53 is more&#xD;
      likely to prevent repair in cancer cells while preventing suicide in normal cells. This&#xD;
      provides the basis for a differential effect of cenersen sodium on cancer cells verses normal&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When p53-dependent repair is prevented in cancer cells they begin to copy their damaged&#xD;
      genetic information in preparation for cell division. This copying of the genetic damage&#xD;
      triggers a p53-independent backup suicide mechanism and, as a result, the cancer cells are&#xD;
      eliminated. This is the presumed mechanism whereby cenersen sodium is able to sensitize&#xD;
      cancer cells with normal p53 function to numerous cancer therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At higher doses however, chemotherapy sometimes blocks cells from copying their genes in&#xD;
      preparation for division. Thus, it is possible that a chemotherapeutic agent used at a high&#xD;
      dose could block any sensitizing effect that cenersen sodium might otherwise have on the&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapeutic agent Idarubicin is known to produce the type of genetic damage that&#xD;
      effects p53 expression, causes p53-dependent responses and has been shown to be made more&#xD;
      effective at killing cancer cells by cenersen sodium. Cytarabine (Ara-C) is the most widely&#xD;
      used chemotherapeutic agent for AML. Cenersen sodium does not appear to sensitize cancer&#xD;
      cells to Cytarabine and at higher doses Cytarabine may reduce the capacity of cenersen sodium&#xD;
      to sensitize cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, this AML study will examine the effects of Cenersen sodium used in combination with&#xD;
      Idarubicin and one of three different doses of Cytarabine (i.e. 0, 0.1 and 1.0 gm/m2/day), on&#xD;
      the responsiveness of participants to these chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
