      Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining GTI-2040 with docetaxel in treating&#xD;
      patients who have recurrent, metastatic, or unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, prostate cancer, or other solid tumors. GTI-2040 may stop the growth of cancer cells&#xD;
      by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. It may also increase the effectiveness of&#xD;
      docetaxel by making the tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Combining GTI-2040 with&#xD;
      docetaxel may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose of GTI-2040 and docetaxel in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent, metastatic, or unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, prostate&#xD;
      cancer, or other solid tumors (phase I study closed to accrual as of 8/5/2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the objective&#xD;
      tumor response rate in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the stable disease rate, time to disease progression, objective response&#xD;
      duration, and duration of stable disease in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the pharmacokinetics of GTI-2040 when administered in combination with docetaxel&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Correlate the pharmacokinetics of GTI-2040 with the biological and toxic effects of this&#xD;
      regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Correlate baseline and post-treatment levels of ribonucleotide reductase activity in&#xD;
      tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumoral expression of c-myc, ras,&#xD;
      pRAF1, pMAPK, and markers of apoptosis with clinical outcome in patients treated with this&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (closed to accrual as of 8/5/2004): Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days&#xD;
      1-14. Patients also receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 3 during course 1 and on day 1&#xD;
      for all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of GTI-2040 and docetaxel until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is defined&#xD;
      as the dose preceding the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Patients receive GTI-2040 and docetaxel at the RP2D as in phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-48 patients (12-18 for phase I [closed to accrual as of&#xD;
      8/5/2004] and 15-30 for phase II) will be accrued for this study within 4-16 months.&#xD;
