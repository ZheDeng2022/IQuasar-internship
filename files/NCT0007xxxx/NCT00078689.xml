  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the combination of the drugs daclizumab and sirolimus can&#xD;
      effectively treat adults with uveitis, an eye inflammation. Daclizumab is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody that is designed to prevent a specific chemical interaction needed for immune cells&#xD;
      called lymphocytes to produce inflammation. Sirolimus is an immune-suppressing drug that also&#xD;
      controls lymphocyte activity and is marketed to prevent organ rejection in kidney&#xD;
      transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with non-infectious uveitis in one or both eyes who are&#xD;
      being treated with daclizumab and have not had a relapse or disease flare for 6 months before&#xD;
      entering this trial may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical&#xD;
      history and physical examination, blood tests, complete eye examination, and pregnancy test&#xD;
      for women who can have children. Women of child-bearing potential who enroll in this study&#xD;
      will have a pregnancy test every 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, participants have the following additional exams:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography: This test is done to check for abnormalities of eye blood&#xD;
           vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in&#xD;
           the eyes. Pictures of the retina are taken with a special camera that flashes a blue&#xD;
           light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the&#xD;
           retina, indicating possible abnormalities. This test is done at enrollment and after 1&#xD;
           year, unless additional tests are needed for medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pelvic ultrasound and urine test: These tests are done at enrollment and after 1 year to&#xD;
           check the kidneys, lymph nodes, and pelvic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: Blood tests are done at enrollment and every 3 to 6 months for laboratory&#xD;
           and immunology study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive daclizumab subcutaneously (under the skin) or in infusions at regularly&#xD;
      scheduled visits for 52 weeks. At each treatment, blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate, and&#xD;
      temperature are monitored. After the first 52 weeks, patients whose disease remains quiet&#xD;
      increase the time between injections to 6 weeks and then to 8 weeks. Patients who are doing&#xD;
      well at this time may stop daclizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One or 2 days after the first daclizumab treatment, patients receive 6 mg of sirolimus by&#xD;
      mouth. Their blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate, and temperature are monitored for at&#xD;
      least 60 minutes. Two days after the first dose, patients begin 2-mg maintenance doses every&#xD;
      other day for 2 weeks. If there are no intolerable side effects, the dose is increased to 2&#xD;
      mg daily for the next 2 weeks. Patients who have no intolerable side effects at that dose&#xD;
      continue the medication for another 4 weeks. Patients who experience intolerable side effects&#xD;
      may decrease the medication to every other day or withdraw from the study. After week 78 of&#xD;
      the study, if the daclizumab treatments are stopped, the sirolimus dose is reduced within 8&#xD;
      weeks and may eventually be discontinued if the patient continues to do well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience any of the following will leave the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammation flare that requires concomitant treatment with additional systemic&#xD;
           immunosuppressive medications, such as prednisone or cyclosporine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease flares more than twice in the first year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any disease flares in the second year&#xD;

      We propose to investigate the possible efficacy of combination daclizumab and sirolimus&#xD;
      therapy to induce peripheral immune tolerance in participants presenting with non-infectious&#xD;
      intermediate and posterior uveitis. This will be performed using a Phase I/II pilot study.&#xD;
      Subjects on daclizumab monotherapy will receive a 6 mg loading dose of oral sirolimus at week&#xD;
      0, followed by a 2 mg dose every other day for 2 weeks. If tolerated, the subject will be&#xD;
      increased to a 2 mg daily dose. After one year of combination therapy, the subject will be&#xD;
      tapered off daclizumab first and then sirolimus. The primary outcome will be the ability of&#xD;
      the participant to be successfully tapered off daclizumab and sirolimus while their disease&#xD;
      remains quiet (vitreous haze less than or equal to Trace) for 24 weeks on no systemic&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications (approximately week 134).&#xD;
