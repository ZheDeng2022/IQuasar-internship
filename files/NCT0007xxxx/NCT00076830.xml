    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation and treatment of patients with a suspected connective tissue&#xD;
      disorder. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments; rather, patients receive&#xD;
      standard care. The study is designed to: 1) allow NICHD's staff to learn more about&#xD;
      connective tissue disorders, 2) train physicians in the evaluation and treatment of these&#xD;
      disorders; and 3) establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for other NICHD protocols&#xD;
      for connective tissue disorders. (Participants in this protocol will not be required to join&#xD;
      another study; the decision will be voluntary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of all ages with a suspected connective tissue disorder and their unaffected family&#xD;
      members may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo diagnostic procedures that may include a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, X-ray studies, eye examinations, and blood drawing, as well as other specialized&#xD;
      tests, when needed. Additional tests may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test for DNA genetic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy: Removal of a small piece of tissue for microscopic examination. The area of&#xD;
           skin selected for the biopsy is numbed and a small circle of skin, usually from the&#xD;
           upper arm, is removed with a surgical cookie cutter-like instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves&#xD;
           to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. The patient lies on a table that&#xD;
           slides into a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. Ear plugs are worn to muffle&#xD;
           loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur with electrical switching of the magnetic&#xD;
           fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomography (CT) scans: This test allows the doctor to view the organs inside&#xD;
           the body in small sections. The patient lies in a doughnut-like machine. Scanning can be&#xD;
           done from different angles, allowing a three dimensional picture of the part of the body&#xD;
           being studied. It may be done with or without injection of a contrast material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referral to appropriate sub-specialists when potential complications are found.&#xD;

      This protocol seeks to formalize the application of accepted diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      measures in the study of individuals with known or suspected bone-related connective tissue&#xD;
      disorders, including Osteogenesis Imperfecta and melorheostosis. It is our intent to attract&#xD;
      a broad array of such individuals for the purposes indicated above. This protocol will also&#xD;
      serve as a basis for permitting collaborations with other investigators regarding rare,&#xD;
      illustrative, or poorly defined human diseases.&#xD;
