      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin, fluorouracil, capecitabine, and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or&#xD;
      die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether&#xD;
      leucovorin and fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin is more effective than capecitabine&#xD;
      with or without oxaliplatin in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying four different chemotherapy regimens to&#xD;
      compare how well they work in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma treated with leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil with vs without&#xD;
           oxaliplatin or capecitabine with vs without oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these fluorouracil-based vs&#xD;
           capecitabine-based regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the failure-free and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the toxic effects and adverse events associated with these regimens in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the limited health assessments of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the health economics associated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment&#xD;
      arms and receive 12 weeks of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (MdG regimen): Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and&#xD;
           fluorouracil IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up&#xD;
           to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with disease progression during or within 8 weeks of the completion of this regimen&#xD;
      may cross over and receive second-line therapy on arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (OxMdG regimen): Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and&#xD;
           oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours beginning on day&#xD;
           1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with disease progression during or within 8 weeks of the completion of this regimen&#xD;
      may receive second-line therapy or supportive care off-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III (Cap regimen): Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-15.&#xD;
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with disease progression during or within 8 weeks of the completion of this regimen&#xD;
      may cross over and receive second-line therapy on arm IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm IV (OxCap regimen): Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral&#xD;
           capecitabine twice daily on days 1-15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4&#xD;
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with disease progression during or within 8 weeks of the completion of this regimen&#xD;
      may receive second-line therapy or supportive care off-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are then re-evaluated at least every 6 weeks and begin another 12 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy at any evidence (e.g., clinical, radiological, or tumor marker) of disease&#xD;
      progression. Patients with chemo-sensitive disease may repeat alternating 12-week therapy&#xD;
      sessions and evaluation periods indefinitely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 12-14 weeks, at 24 weeks, and then every 3 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 460 patients (115 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 2 years.&#xD;
