      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that over 50 percent of adults aged 65 and older report some sleep&#xD;
      disruption, while about 20 percent suffer from chronic insomnia. Obstructive sleep apnea, a&#xD;
      major cause of daytime drowsiness, occurs in an estimated 20-60 percent of older people,&#xD;
      depending on the definition used and the specific population being studied. Despite the high&#xD;
      prevalence of sleep disorders in the elderly, there have been relatively few studies focused&#xD;
      on the consequences. Most studies have been limited by cross-sectional design, small sample&#xD;
      size, or lack of comprehensive and objective assessment of sleep. The study, Outcomes of&#xD;
      Sleep Disorders in Older Men, will take advantage of the established cohort that has been&#xD;
      recruited for the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study (5U01AR045647-Dr. Eric Orwoll,&#xD;
      PI). MrOS, a 7-year study that began in July 1999, is a multi-center prospective study of&#xD;
      approximately 6,000 men aged 65 and older. During the MrOS baseline visit, a broad variety of&#xD;
      measurements were collected, including body composition and body fat distribution by dual&#xD;
      energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and quantitative computed tomography, bone density,&#xD;
      anthropometry, performance-based tests of strength and balance, medical history, medication&#xD;
      use, smoking and alcohol use, and other parameters. Blood, urine, and DNA specimens have been&#xD;
      archived for use in future studies of importance to the health of older men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subcohort of 3,000 MrOS participants, comprehensive and accurate assessments of sleep&#xD;
      will be added using in-home polysomnography, wrist actigraphy, questionnaires and other&#xD;
      measures; and prospective adjudication of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, to the&#xD;
      extensive measures that have already been performed or planned in the MrOS cohort study.&#xD;
      These new measures will enable testing of several important hypotheses: 1) to characterize&#xD;
      the associations between sleep disruption and subsequent CVD events during 3.5 years of&#xD;
      follow-up, 2) to determine if sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      total and cause-specific mortality in older men, 3) to test whether sleep disturbances are&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of falls and decreased physical function, 4) to test whether&#xD;
      sleep disturbances are associated with impaired cognitive function in older men, and 5) to&#xD;
      test whether sleep disorders are associated with bone density and fracture risk in older men.&#xD;
      The bank of MrOS specimens will be supplemented to allow for testing of future hypotheses&#xD;
      concerning the role of sleep in the development of age-related diseases and conditions.&#xD;
