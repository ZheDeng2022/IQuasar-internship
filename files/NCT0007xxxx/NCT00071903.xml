    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the tendency to have thrombosis, or the formation of blood&#xD;
      clots inside blood vessels, has a role in the development of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC). PTC&#xD;
      causes symptoms and signs of isolated elevated blood pressure in the cranium, or covering of&#xD;
      the brain. The disorder can lead to significant, negative effects on the visual system.&#xD;
      Increased pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid, that is, fluid around the brain, is a factor,&#xD;
      but the cause of the disorder is not clear. There has been documentation of clustering of PTC&#xD;
      within families. It suggests that potential genetic polymorphisms-abilities to take on&#xD;
      different forms-may become evident after exposure to conditions known to trigger PTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombosis comes about by interactions between genetic and environmental or acquired factors,&#xD;
      or both, resulting in a blood clot at a specific time and location. Because the disease&#xD;
      occurs in episodes, the interaction of the genetic and nongenetic risk factors is important.&#xD;
      Cystinosis is a recessive disorder caused by deposits of cystine within the lysosomes of&#xD;
      cells-that is, sac-like cell parts that contain various enzymes. Involvement of the kidneys&#xD;
      remains the primary characteristic, eventually leading to renal failure. Of all of the risk&#xD;
      factors that make it easier for blood clotting, a high level of a substance called&#xD;
      homocysteine is of particular interest. Too much homocysteine in blood plasma is a common&#xD;
      finding in patients with kidney failure, and it has been recently identified as an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for diseases of the blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of all ages who meet the Dandy criteria for PTC may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Pregnant women will be excluded. There will also be a control group of nephropathic&#xD;
      cystinosis patients who do not have PTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, to evaluate the eye and nervous systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood for DNA and other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of cerebrospinal fluid, through a procedure called lumbar puncture or spinal&#xD;
           tap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of patients will generally last 3 to 4 days. For the collection of&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid, the patient's skin on the back will be numbed with a local anesthetic. A&#xD;
      special needle will be inserted into the back, and a small amount of the fluid will be drawn&#xD;
      through the needle. There will be pain for a minute, although there can be a headache lasting&#xD;
      24 hours. Also, there may be bruising, local pain, bleeding, or infection where the needle&#xD;
      enters. Patients may also have a magnetic resonance imaging scan of their head. During the&#xD;
      MRI scan, patients will lie still on a table that slides in and out of a metal cylinder&#xD;
      surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI&#xD;
      staff at all times and may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During the follow-up of cystinosis patients under protocol #78-HG-0093 &quot;Use of Cysteamine in&#xD;
      the Treatment of Cystinosis&quot;, we found that 6 of our NIH patients developed papilledema and&#xD;
      were diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), whose occurrence has not been previously&#xD;
      reported in cystinosis. The goal of this protocol is to identify the role of thrombosis&#xD;
      susceptibility in the development of PTC in nephropathic cystinosis patients in view of our&#xD;
      recent findings regarding genetic susceptibility to thrombosis in PTC in general. We propose&#xD;
      a case-control study. A total of 9 nephropathic cystinosis patients who developed PTC and 9&#xD;
      control nephropathic cystinosis patients without PTC will be screened based upon a thrombosis&#xD;
      susceptibility screening panel, including total homocysteine, protein C and S, antithrombin&#xD;
      III, fibrinogen, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor XI levels, testing for PT, PTT, activated&#xD;
      protein C resistance, antiphospholipid antibodies (ACA panel and Lupus AC) and screening for&#xD;
      FV Leiden mutation, FV G1628A polymorphism, FV R2 allele, Prothrombin 20210 mutation and&#xD;
      5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T polymorphism in patients with&#xD;
      severe homocysteinemia (greater than or equal to 100 micro mol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the prevalence of the factors that lead to thrombosis susceptibility in the&#xD;
      cases and controls.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria include only a confirmed diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri (past or&#xD;
        present) in a patient with nephropathic cystinosis. Patients will be diagnosed as having&#xD;
        pseudotumor cerebri based upon modified Dandy criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. signs and symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. no localizing neurological signs with the exception of unilateral or bilateral sixth&#xD;
             nerve palsy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. neuroimaging study showing no mass lesion or hydrocephalus;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. elevated opening pressure with normal cerebrospinal fluid contents on lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Nephropathic cystinosis patients of all ages who meet the Dandy criteria for PTC will be&#xD;
        considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant patients will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
