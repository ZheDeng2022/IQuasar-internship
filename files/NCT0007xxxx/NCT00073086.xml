      This study will evaluate and treat people with SARS, a new type of pneumonia (lung infection)&#xD;
      originating in China. SARS is caused by a new virus that is easily transmitted from person to&#xD;
      person. This study will look at the course of the disease; determine how the virus affects&#xD;
      the body and how the body fights the infection; and evaluate diagnostic tests to quickly&#xD;
      identify the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older with probable or suspected SARS may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Close contacts of patients with SARS, patients who recovered from SARS, and NIH health&#xD;
      care workers involved in the care of patients will also be enrolled. Patients with SARS who&#xD;
      require hospitalization will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. Because SARS spreads&#xD;
      easily, hospitalized patients will be in a room by themselves and will not be allowed any&#xD;
      visitors. They will not leave their room except for tests, such as x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a full medical examination, including a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and blood tests. In addition, the participants undergo various tests and&#xD;
      procedures as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probable and suspected SARS patients may be hospitalized or may be seen as outpatients.&#xD;
           They are provided the treatment judged best for their disease, usually according to&#xD;
           expressed or published recommendations. The best treatment for SARS is not yet known,&#xD;
           and there have been no studies evaluating therapies. Outpatients are seen three times a&#xD;
           week for 2 weeks, once a week for 4 more weeks, and then at 6 months. Patients have&#xD;
           mouth and throat swabs taken three times a week for the first 2 weeks, then once a week&#xD;
           for 4 more weeks. Blood is drawn three times a week for the first 2 weeks, then once at&#xD;
           weeks 3, 4, and 6. If virus is still detectable after 6 weeks, nose washings and throat&#xD;
           swabs are repeated until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row. In addition,&#xD;
           patients provide urine and stool samples, have a chest x-ray and electrocardiogram, and&#xD;
           undergo bronchoscopy and bronchial lavage. For the bronchoscopy, a bronchoscope&#xD;
           (pencil-thin flexible tube) is passed into the large airways of the lung, allowing the&#xD;
           physician to examine the airways. Cells and secretions from the airways are rinsed from&#xD;
           the lung with salt water. A brush the size of a pencil tip is passed through the&#xD;
           bronchoscope to scrape cells lining the airways and pieces of tissue are collected for&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Close contacts of patients are evaluated twice a week for 2 weeks, then once a week for&#xD;
           2 more weeks. Blood is drawn at the first visit and then at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Mouth and&#xD;
           throat swabs, nose washings, and sputum collections are done twice a week for 2 weeks,&#xD;
           then once a week for 2 more weeks. Urine and stool samples are collected once a week for&#xD;
           4 weeks. If virus from the nose or throat is still detectable after 4 weeks, weekly nose&#xD;
           washings and throat swabs continue until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row.&#xD;
           Blood may also be drawn during the weekly visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recovered SARS patients provide blood, urine, and stool samples and have a mouth and&#xD;
           throat swab and nose aspiration to see if the SARS virus is present. For the nasal&#xD;
           aspiration, salt water is put in the nose and then suctioned out. Usually, these tests&#xD;
           are done only once. If virus is detected, however, the nose washing, throat swabs and&#xD;
           blood tests are repeated once a week until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health care workers document their contact with patients, use of isolation procedures&#xD;
           and equipment, and any unexpected events that occur during contact. They are evaluated&#xD;
           for symptoms of infection and provide a blood sample once a month&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since mid February 2003, there have been reports of atypical pneumonias originating in China&#xD;
      which have subsequently been termed the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS has&#xD;
      subsequently spread to multiple countries including the United States, and is accompanied by&#xD;
      a higher than anticipated morbidity and mortality. Because of world travel and the apparent&#xD;
      easy transmissibility of this disease reported in other nations, the number of patients with&#xD;
      SARS may continue to rise. The primary purpose of this protocol is to evaluate and treat&#xD;
      persons with SARS. Other goals will be to characterize the clinical course of SARS by also&#xD;
      evaluating close contacts of people with SARS, as well as those that have recovered from&#xD;
      SARS. Additional goals of the protocol are to elucidate the pathophysiology of SARS,&#xD;
      characterize the immune response during SARS, and evaluate diagnostic tests for the rapid&#xD;
      identification of SARS in clinical specimens. Further knowledge about SARS may lead to&#xD;
      effective forms of therapy and improve mortality from this disease.&#xD;
