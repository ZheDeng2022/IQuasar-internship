      To test the hypothesis that the responsiveness of major and emerging cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      risk factors to changes in diet composition clusters within families depending on genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility factors.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through dietary change has considerable&#xD;
      potential for a beneficial impact on public health. On a population basis, moderation of both&#xD;
      lipid profiles and blood pressure can be accomplished readily with a prudent diet.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, individual response to dietary impact on CVD risk factors varies widely,&#xD;
      presumably as a result of genetic differences. In particular, Blacks who constitute a&#xD;
      subpopulation with documented increased risk of morbidity and mortality from CVD would&#xD;
      disproportionately benefit from interventions designed to maximize the impact of dietary&#xD;
      change tailored to individual genetic makeup. Therefore, study of the influence of diet on&#xD;
      CVD risk factors, along with enhanced understanding of the genetic components involved, would&#xD;
      greatly potentiate chronic disease interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted in response to a Request for Applications issued in October, 2001 on&#xD;
      the Interaction of Genes and the Environment in Shaping Risk Factors for Heart, Lung, Blood,&#xD;
      and Sleep Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-generational family lines will be identified in Blacks with elevated low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein-C (LDLC) in probands. The population will be fed a controlled diet contrasting an&#xD;
      established heart healthy regimen with a typical American one. Concomitant rigorous genetic,&#xD;
      anthropometric, and behavioral evaluation will provide data with which to analyze individual&#xD;
      differences in response to consistent dietary intake. In Specific Aim 1, Black,&#xD;
      two-generational, families will be recruited and provided interventional diets designed to&#xD;
      reduce (or not) LDL-C and blood pressure. In Specific Aim 2, non-genetic predictors of CVD&#xD;
      risk factor response will be identified through extensive assessments of baseline behavioral&#xD;
      characteristics, anthropometric features, and metabolic factors. In Specific Aim 3, the&#xD;
      underlying genetic factors that predispose to response (or the lack of) to dietary&#xD;
      interventions will be identified through the examination of polymorphisms in candidate genes&#xD;
      and the identification of susceptibility loci by linkage analyses. In Specific Aim 4,&#xD;
      interactions between diet, CVD risk factor response and genetic factors will be dissected&#xD;
      through measures of potential mediating metabolic pathways.&#xD;
