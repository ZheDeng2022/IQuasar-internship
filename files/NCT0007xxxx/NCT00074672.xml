  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore what occurs between sensory and motor systems in restless legs&#xD;
      syndrome (RLS). Patients with RLS have uncomfortable sensations in the legs, usually in the&#xD;
      evening or early part of the night. Most patients also have periodic involuntary leg&#xD;
      movements. The condition tends to worsen over time, resulting in severe discomfort and sleep&#xD;
      disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with RLS between 18 and 80 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. All candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical and&#xD;
      neurological evaluations, electroymogram (measure of muscle activity), overnight sleep study,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG, measurement of the electrical activity of the heart), and blood and&#xD;
      urine tests. They may also have brain or spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or&#xD;
      computerized tomography (CT) scans and a chest X-ray. Participants must stop taking all&#xD;
      medications prohibited by the study for 2 days or more before the study starts and throughout&#xD;
      its duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo prepulse inhibition tests to assess nervous system function. The&#xD;
      participant sits comfortably in a quiet room. Several cables are attached to the face and&#xD;
      legs using a special cream that conducts electrical signals through the cables to recording&#xD;
      equipment. Nervous system activity is evaluated while the subject is at rest and after&#xD;
      sensory stimulation (stimulating the nerves in the legs and face with a very brief electrical&#xD;
      current of mild to moderate intensity). At times, the subject receives a short, mild sound&#xD;
      stimulation delivered through earphones. The testing session takes 4 to 6 hours.&#xD;

      Background - Restless leg syndrome (RLS), a condition affecting millions of Americans, is&#xD;
      characterized by uncomfortable sensory symptoms relived by voluntary or involuntary&#xD;
      movements. Objectives -To test our hypothesis that sensorimotor gating is deficient in RLS.&#xD;
      Methods - In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical study, sensorimotor gating will be&#xD;
      assessed through the use of validated electrophysiological tests of prepulse inhibition, in&#xD;
      17 adult patients with RLS and 17 matched healthy controls. Risks and benefits -Risks&#xD;
      involved in this study are minimal, and deemed reasonable in relation to potential benefits.&#xD;
      This investigation will lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of RLS.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet all of the following inclusion criteria at screening will be eligible to&#xD;
        participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects aged 18 to 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For patients only, diagnosed with primary RLS based on the presence of a&#xD;
             characteristic clinical history and the IRLSSG diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Normal physical and neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is willing to adhere to protocol requirements as evidenced by written,&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No clinically significant abnormalities on clinical chemistry or hematology&#xD;
             examination at the pre-study medical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Negative pre-study urine drug screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will not be enrolled or will be&#xD;
        immediately excluded from the study, as appropriate:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to compromise&#xD;
             scientific integrity of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient unwilling or unable to stop their usual mediations for RLS;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects unable or unwilling to discontinue a prohibited concomitant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects unwilling to sign an informed consent or to comply with protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with clinical and/or biological evidence of secondary RLS (e.g. renal failure&#xD;
             (end-stage renal disease), iron deficient, anaemia or pregnancy at baseline).&#xD;
