    <textblock>
      Subject's are being asked to take part in this study because he or she has a type of cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to the meninges (tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no known effective treatment for this specific disease or the subject has received&#xD;
      all of the treatments that are known to work for his or her specific disease without success.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no other effective treatment for this type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the highest dose of gemcitabine, an anti-cancer drug, that can safely be&#xD;
           given directly into the spinal fluid of children and adults whose cancer no longer&#xD;
           responds to standard treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to find out what effects (good and bad) gemcitabine has when given directly into the&#xD;
           cerebrospinal fluid (called intrathecal administration) in children and adults with&#xD;
           neoplastic meningitis (cancer that has spread to the lining of the brain and spinal&#xD;
           cord);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine if gemcitabine is beneficial to the patient;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to understand how gemcitabine is handled by the body after intrathecal administration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY? Before participating in this study, there will be a screening&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine will be received directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that circulates&#xD;
      around the brain and spinal cord) through an Ommaya reservoir (or other similar type of&#xD;
      reservoir). An Ommaya reservoir is a surgically implanted catheter that is used to inject&#xD;
      medication or to withdraw cerebrospinal fluid from the fluid chambers in the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be hospitalized overnight following their first dose of gemcitabine. If the&#xD;
      first dose is well tolerated, further doses of gemcitabine will be administered in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic with close observation for a minimum of 2 hours after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 1-6 Cohort 1a (first three patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine will be given once a week for 6 weeks. Patients may continue therapy if the&#xD;
      disease has not worsened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 1-6 (all other patients enrolled on this study):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine will be given twice a week for 6 weeks. Patients may continue therapy if the&#xD;
      disease has not worsened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 7-12:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine will be given once a week for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 13-29 (approximately):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine will be given twice monthly for 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 30-52 (approximately):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine will be given monthly for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, the first patients treated in the study will receive a low dose of&#xD;
      gemcitabine. If that dose does not cause severe side effects, the next group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose of gemcitabine than given to the earlier group, or may receive a lower dose if&#xD;
      side effects occur. In addition, the first three patients treated on this study will receive&#xD;
      the gemcitabine once weekly. If this is tolerated, subsequent patients will receive the&#xD;
      medication twice weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the first dose of gemcitabine investigators would like to draw special blood and&#xD;
      spinal fluid samples to help learn how much of the drug is in the blood and spinal fluid.&#xD;
      These studies are called pharmacokinetics. A total of 10 samples will be collected. The blood&#xD;
      samples may be collected from an intravenous catheter or a central venous catheter. The&#xD;
      spinal fluid samples may be collected either via Ommaya reservoir or lumbar reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to intrathecal gemcitabine, the patient may receive other chemotherapy, not given&#xD;
      directly into the fluid surrounding the brain and spine, as recommended by his or her doctor&#xD;
      for the treatment or prevention of cancer outside the lining of the brain and spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum length of treatment with gemcitabine is one year. However, at the end of the&#xD;
      study, monthly check-ups are required to monitor the disease and to make sure that any side&#xD;
      effects from the study drug have stopped.&#xD;

    <description>Schedule&#xD;
Induction: At Dose Level 1athe first cohort of patients will receive intrathecal gemcitabine on a weekly basis for a total of 6 weeks. If that is tolerated, the subsequent cohort will receive intrathecal gemcitabine on a twice-weekly basis (Dose Level 1b) for a total of 6 weeks. Subsequent cohorts (Dose Levels 2 - 6) will receive intrathecal gemcitabine on a twice weekly basis for a total of 6 weeks (12 doses).&#xD;
In the absence of disease progression or DLT, patients may proceed to consolidation.&#xD;
Consolidation: Intrathecal gemcitabine will be administered weekly for a total of 6 doses. The first dose of consolidation will be given 1 week after the last induction dose. In the absence of disease progression or DLT, patients may proceed to maintenance.&#xD;
Maintenance: Intrathecal gemcitabine will be given twice monthly for 4 months and monthly thereafter. In the absence of progressive disease or dose-limiting toxicity, the total duration of therapy will be 1 year.</description>

             is no conventional therapy. Patients with CNS leukemia/lymphoma must be refractory to&#xD;
             conventional therapy, including XRT (i.e. 2nd or greater relapse). Neoplastic&#xD;
             meningitis is defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukemia/Lymphoma: CSF cell count &gt; 5 uL AND evidence of blast cells on cytospin&#xD;
                  preparation or by cytology.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Solid tumor: Presence of tumor cells on cytospin preparation or cytology OR&#xD;
                  presence of meningeal disease on MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients &gt; 10 years old: Karnofsky performance status of &gt;/= 50%. Patients &lt;/=10 years&#xD;
             old: Lansky performance status of &gt;/= 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have recovered from the acute neurotoxic effects of all prior chemo, immuno, or&#xD;
             radiotherapy and must be without uncontrolled significant systemic illness (e.g.&#xD;
             infection). Must not have received any systemic CNS-directed therapy within 3 weeks or&#xD;
             craniospinal irradiation within 8 weeks prior to starting treatment on study. Must not&#xD;
             have received any intrathecal therapy within 1 week prior to starting treatment on&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a platelet count &gt;40,000/uL and HCT &gt;30% and an ANC of &gt; 1000/uL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have adequate liver function, total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg, SGPT &lt; 5 times upper&#xD;
             limits of normal; adequate renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 2 times upper limits of&#xD;
             normal for age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have or be willing to have an intraventricular access device such as an&#xD;
             Ommaya reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving other therapy (either intrathecal or systemic) designed to treat&#xD;
             their leptomeningeal disease. However, patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy to&#xD;
             control systemic disease or bulk CNS disease will be eligible, provided that the&#xD;
             systemic chemotherapy is not a phase I agent, an agent that significantly penetrates&#xD;
             the CSF, or an agent known to have serious unpredictable CNS side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nuclear Medicine CSF flow studies are required within the 2 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
             for all solid tumor patients. In leukemia/lymphoma patients a CSF flow study is only&#xD;
             required if CSF analysis or an MRI suggests that there is a blockage to CSF flow.&#xD;
             Patients with clinical evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus are not eligible for this&#xD;
             protocol. Nor are patients with compartmentalization of CSF flow as documented by&#xD;
             radioisotope Indium111 or Technetium99-DTPA flow eligible for this protocol. If a CSF&#xD;
             flow block or compartmentalization is demonstrated, focal radiotherapy to the site of&#xD;
             the block to restore flow followed by a repeat CSF flow study demonstrating clearing&#xD;
             of the blockage is required for the patient to be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have clinically significant abnormalities of serum electrolytes,&#xD;
             including calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt are not&#xD;
             eligible unless they are shunt-independent and there is evidence that their shunt is&#xD;
             nonfunctional&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have leukemia/lymphoma with a concomitant bone marrow relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing age must not be pregnant or lactating. (Male and female patients&#xD;
             who are fertile must be willing to use an effective means of birth control to avoid&#xD;
             pregnancy.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be free of uncontrolled infection except HIV (i.e., AIDS-related lymphomatous&#xD;
             meningitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must NOT be receiving any other investigational agents and must not have received any&#xD;
             other investigational agent within 14 days prior to study treatment. The 14-day period&#xD;
             should be extended if the investigational agent is known to have delayed toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with impending spinal cord compression, CNS involvement requiring local XRT&#xD;
             (e.g. optic nerve), or isolated bulky ventricular or leptomeningeal based lesions are&#xD;
             not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant CNS radiation therapy is not permitted. (Patients are not permitted to&#xD;
             receive radiation to any port that encompasses any part of the brain or spine while on&#xD;
             study.) Patients may receive radiation therapy to extra-CNS sites, e.g. painful bone&#xD;
             metastases not in the craniospinal axis.&#xD;
