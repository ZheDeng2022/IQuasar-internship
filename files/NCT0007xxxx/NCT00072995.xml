      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness for weight loss and weight maintenance&#xD;
      of four diets differing in macronutrient composition: moderate in fat (40 percent energy)&#xD;
      with two different protein levels (15 percent and 25 percent), and low in fat (20 percent&#xD;
      energy), also with 15 percent and 25 percent protein levels. The study is only accepting&#xD;
      participants in the Boston, Massachusetts or Baton Rouge, Louisiana area. For further&#xD;
      enrollment information in Boston or Baton Rouge, see Eligibility Criteria or Design&#xD;
      Narrative.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is a growing problem whose importance is reflected in the resources that are expended&#xD;
      each year by a large section of the population on weight reduction drugs and therapies.&#xD;
      Although numerous weight loss diets are available, there is little agreement in the&#xD;
      scientific literature or the lay press as to the amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrates&#xD;
      that would comprise the most efficacious diet for weight loss and long term weight loss&#xD;
      retention. Reliable information about the effectiveness of low calorie diets with differing&#xD;
      macronutrient composition is clearly needed and of paramount importance to inform the choice&#xD;
      of a weight reduction diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study tests the effectiveness for weight loss and weight maintenance of four diets&#xD;
      differing in macronutrient composition: moderate in fat (40% energy) with two different&#xD;
      protein levels (15% and 25%), and low in fat (20% energy), also with 15% and 25% protein&#xD;
      levels. The moderate-fat diet will be patterned after a Mediterranean diet. All four dietary&#xD;
      approaches will be low in saturated fat, and will involve reduction in total energy intake.&#xD;
      Each diet is deemed practical and suitable for public health recommendations, and each would&#xD;
      be expected to have a favorable effect on cardiovascular disease risk factors. All&#xD;
      participants will receive a state-of-the-art behavioral therapy program standardized across&#xD;
      the two centers in Boston and Baton Rouge. An estimated 800 men and women, age 30-70 years,&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) 25-40 kg/m2, will be randomized among the 4 dietary treatments. The&#xD;
      primary outcome variable will be change in total body weight from baseline to 2 years.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes related to obesity are body fat, BMI, waist circumference, visceral fat,&#xD;
      and hepatic and skeletal muscle fat. Other outcomes are psychological factors (diet&#xD;
      satisfaction, satiety, food craving, dietary restraint, disinhibition and hunger, and quality&#xD;
      of life); major cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, low density lipoprotein [LDL]&#xD;
      cholesterol, high density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, and triglycerides); prevalence of&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome; blood glucose, insulin, and hemoglobin A1C; emerging cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors (apolipoprotein B, VLDL and LDL particles with apolipoprotein C-III,&#xD;
      lipoprotein[a]); microalbuminuria; and bone mineral content. The primary results will be&#xD;
      straightforwardly applicable to public health and clinical guidelines for obesity and will&#xD;
      increase our understanding of the biology of obesity and weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is only accepting participants in the Boston, Massachusetts or Baton Rouge,&#xD;
      Louisiana area. For Boston participants, contact: 617-998-1047 or www.poundslost.org. For&#xD;
      Baton Rouge participants, contact: schoensj@pbrc.edu or 225-763-2623.&#xD;
