      This study will evaluate the usefulness of a new procedure for evaluating asthma in children.&#xD;
      The method measures the pH (a measure of acidity and alkalinity) of exhaled breath condensate&#xD;
      (water vapor created by the lungs). The condensate contains products of the lungs that may be&#xD;
      associated with lung inflammation. Investigators will determine if the pH of the exhaled&#xD;
      breath condensate correlates well with known asthma indicators, such as number of&#xD;
      hospitalizations, school absenteeism, use of rescue medication, and others. Test results will&#xD;
      be compared with findings from healthy normal volunteers. No experimental treatments or&#xD;
      medicines are used in this study. Patients who require treatment for their asthma will&#xD;
      receive standard care with medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration and used&#xD;
      widely in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with asthma and healthy normal volunteers between 6 and 17 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. You must complete the study before your 18th birthday. Candidates&#xD;
      are screened with a medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with asthma undergo the following tests and procedures over six clinic visits,&#xD;
      including an initial visit and follow-up visits at 4-8 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw in children over 6 years of age. Medications are available to decrease the&#xD;
           pain associated with blood drawing.(initial visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergen skin testing: Drops of up to 16 allergens are placed on the arm. The skin under&#xD;
           each drop is scratched and the area is observed for an allergic reaction. (4- 8-week&#xD;
           follow-up visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expired nitric oxide testing: The child breathes into a balloon to collect a portion of&#xD;
           the gases exhaled form the lungs. This test measures the amount of nitric oxide, which&#xD;
           correlates with bronchial inflammation. (all visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exhaled breath condensate: The child breathes into a plastic tube surrounded by a cold&#xD;
           metal sleeve for 10 to 15 minutes. The water vapor created by the lungs (the same vapor&#xD;
           that forms when breathing outside on a cold day) is collected and the pH measured. (all&#xD;
           visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary (lung) function test: The child blows very hard into a tube attached to a&#xD;
           machine to measure the airflow from the child's lungs. This test measures airflow from&#xD;
           the lungs. (all visits) The children are given small plastic device called a peak flow&#xD;
           meter - a device used to measure lung function - to use at home. Children whose lung&#xD;
           function is less than 80% of the predicted value for their age may be given medicine to&#xD;
           see if their lung function improves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of the patient's symptoms, sick days, medicines or actions taken to get over the&#xD;
           illness; review of peak flow reports; and review of action plan. (3-, 6-, 9-, and&#xD;
           12-month visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls will have the expired nitric oxide test, exhaled breath condensate test, and&#xD;
      pulmonary function test at each visit at the initial and over two additional visits scheduled&#xD;
      6 months apart.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The onset of asthma is often during childhood, and when the child is atopic, it is more&#xD;
      likely to persist into adulthood. Diseases such as asthma have a higher prevalence in&#xD;
      childhood; and management that alters the morbidity of allergic disease in children may&#xD;
      impact disease outcomes in future years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease in childhood and accounts for the highest rate&#xD;
      of hospitalizations in the ages between 0-4 years. Unfortunately, there are few noninvasive&#xD;
      objective measurements of pulmonary health in children. Current techniques include&#xD;
      determination of peak flow, spirometry, and measurement of nitric oxide (NO). Bronchial&#xD;
      inflammation is a central feature of asthma and anti-inflammatory therapy is the mainstay of&#xD;
      treatment. Expired NO (eNO) has been shown to correlate with bronchial inflammation. However,&#xD;
      the collection of NO has only been available in research settings due to the limitations of&#xD;
      collection and analysis. In contrast, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is easily obtained and&#xD;
      pH analysis technically simple.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of pH in EBC is a novel, non-invasive technique in clinical study as a means to&#xD;
      evaluate the severity of pulmonary inflammation. In the protocol described, we will evaluate&#xD;
      the utility of EBC in the measurement of airway disease in 60 children with asthma and&#xD;
      compare them to 30 healthy cohorts in the same age range. We will determine if EBC pH is&#xD;
      reflective of the degree of morbidity in children by correlating measurements with known&#xD;
      parameters of disease including: 1) number of hospitalizations, 2) absenteeism from school,&#xD;
      3) number of asthma exacerbations, 4) loss of work days (if applicable), 5) extent of rescue&#xD;
      medication usage, 6) spirometry to evaluate obstruction, and 7) NO as a measurement of&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated and then categorized based on the National Asthma Education and&#xD;
      Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines. We will measure the pH from EBC in children age 6 to&#xD;
      less than 18 years of age and compare findings to clinical data, spirometry, and expired NO.&#xD;
      In this way, we will determine if EBC is a potentially useful non-invasive measurement of&#xD;
      airway disease. It is hoped that measurements of EBC will be helpful in identifying those&#xD;
      children in which the addition of an anti-inflammatory medication is appropriate. We will&#xD;
      also attempt to measure inflammatory mediators to determine if they can be used to assess&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method may also be useful in detecting airway inflammation due to an infectious agent&#xD;
      before a systemic reaction (fever, respiratory distress, or cough) is apparent in children&#xD;
      with various immunodeficiency diseases such as chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), recurrent&#xD;
      respiratory infections without a defined host defect (RIND), or Job's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 30 healthy control children in the same age range to compare the EBC pH&#xD;
      values in children without allergic or other chronic pulmonary diseases. In addition, we will&#xD;
      recruit 30 children (10 in each group) with CGD, RIND, and Job's to compare exhaled breath&#xD;
      condensate pH and exhaled nitric oxide values to those from children with allergic airway&#xD;
      inflammation to determine if these methods are useful for early diagnosis of infectious&#xD;
      airway inflammation.&#xD;
