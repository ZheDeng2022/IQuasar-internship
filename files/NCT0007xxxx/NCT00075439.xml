  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well gefitinib works in treating patients with&#xD;
      progressive metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the 6 month progression free survival rate in patients with progressive,&#xD;
      advanced neuroendocrine tumors treated with ZD1839.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Objective tumor response rate. II. Progression free survival and time to progression. III.&#xD;
      Improvement in circulating hormone levels. IV. Overall survival V. We will explore the&#xD;
      molecular characterization of these tumors in attempt to understand the role of EGFR&#xD;
      expression and its inhibition with ZD1839 in neuroendocrine tumors. The measurements will be&#xD;
      performed on pretreatment and post-treatment tumor biopsies when possible: EGFR expression&#xD;
      and gene amplification (IHC for EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR, ISH for gene amplification);&#xD;
      Activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway (IHC for phosphorylated MAPK); Cell proliferation&#xD;
      (Ki-67 staining); Apoptosis (TUNEL assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type&#xD;
      (carcinoid vs islet cell and other neuroendocrine tumors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up&#xD;
      to 2 years from study entry.&#xD;

    <description>If patients are lost to follow-up or discontinue active monitoring prior to 6 months post-registration, we will consider censoring them for the evaluation of the primary endpoint. Here, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate the final success proportion (ie, 6 month success rate with a 95% confidence interval). Otherwise, ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases; Note: These patients are excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;

             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy; Note: These&#xD;
             patients are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions&#xD;
             with ZD1839 and because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies&#xD;
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination and anti-retroviral therapy when&#xD;
             indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent or recent use (≤ 7 days prior to ZD1839 administration) of phenytoin,&#xD;
             carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin, oxcarbazepine, rifapentine, modafinil, or St.&#xD;
             John's Wort; Note: Because these drugs induce CYP3A4 enzymes and can cause reductions&#xD;
             in ZD1839 plasma concentrations below levels thought to be biologically active,&#xD;
             patients with concurrent or recent use of these drugs are excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of other invasive malignancy ≤ the previous 3 years, except for adequately&#xD;
             treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
