      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term objectives of this research program are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To advance the mission of the VHA Boston Healthcare System to deliver comprehensive&#xD;
           quality healthcare that meets the needs of patients (in this case, who have been&#xD;
           unresponsive to standard smoking cessation treatment) through research and clinical&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To expand upon our knowledge of the feasibility and effectiveness of commonly-used&#xD;
           treatments for nicotine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To further explore variables related to mood and coping that may contribute to or&#xD;
           prevent successful reduction and cessation of smoking behavior among veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short-term objectives of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of two adjunctive treatments (a&#xD;
           mood-focused exposure-based treatment, Mood Tolerance, with Nicotine Replacement Therapy&#xD;
           [MTNRT] and mood-focused affect-management treatment, Mood Management, with Nicotine&#xD;
           Replacement Therapy [MMNRT]) aimed at reduction and cessation of smoking behavior among&#xD;
           veterans who were previously non-responders to smoking cessation treatment in the VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To inform equivocal findings in the literature regarding the role of mood as trigger for&#xD;
           smoking behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore selected mood, coping, and individual difference variable that may be&#xD;
           predictive of successful abstinence from cigarettes among veterans.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short-term objectives of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of two adjunctive treatments (mood-focused exposure-based&#xD;
           treatment, Mood Tolerance, with Nicotine Replacement Therapy [MT-NRT] and mood-focused&#xD;
           affect-management treatment, Mood Management, with NRT [MM-NRT] aimed at reduction and&#xD;
           cessation of smoking behavior among veterans who were previously non-responders to&#xD;
           smoking cessation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine specific variables that may serve as mechanisms of action for successful&#xD;
           treatment (i.e., mood and coping variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objectives of this research program are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To advance the mission of the VA to deliver comprehensive quality healthcare that meets&#xD;
           the needs of patients who have been unresponsive to standard smoking cessation&#xD;
           treatment, through research and clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To reduce the exorbitant healthcare costs of nicotine dependence (ND) to the VA, and to&#xD;
           improve veterans' physical and psychological well-being, healthcare utilization, and&#xD;
           mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate effectiveness of common treatments for ND.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore mechanisms of action related to efficacy of treatment for ND among veterans&#xD;
           (i.e., changes in mood and coping.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-cell, single-blind, randomized, treatment outcome study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and twenty-eight smoking outpatients who have previously participated in standard&#xD;
      group smoking cessation treatment (treatment non-responders, with NRT) will be recruited&#xD;
      through the VA Boston Outpatient Health Psychology Clinic. Advertising flyers posted&#xD;
      throughout the Boston VA Medical Center and Outpatient Clinic will be used to supplement this&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested and eligible patients will sign an informed consent form, which will be thoroughly&#xD;
      reviewed with each participant and co-signed by the investigators. Baseline evaluation of the&#xD;
      participants will take approximately 90 minutes. This evaluation will include assessment of&#xD;
      smoking-related variables, moods, and affect-regulation and coping strategies, as well as&#xD;
      carbon monoxide (CO) levels in expired breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. This will involve&#xD;
      meeting with a pharmacist, primary care physician, psychiatrist, or nurse practitioner to be&#xD;
      screened for use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; transdermal patch) and to initiate NRT&#xD;
      use. A member of the research team will continue to monitor the participant's physical health&#xD;
      during the course of the treatment. In addition, the participant will attend treatment groups&#xD;
      once a week for 15 weeks. These treatment groups will be conducted by a member of the&#xD;
      research team or clinical students supervised by the PI. Each of these groups will last 90&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first follow-up appointment will take place in the week after completion of the&#xD;
      treatment. Additional follow-up assessments will take place at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months&#xD;
      subsequent to the first follow-up appointment. These assessments will be almost identical to&#xD;
      the baseline assessment, and will last approximately 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-four participants have been enrolled in this study; 12 of whom are currently actively&#xD;
      involved in the protocol. No data have been analyzed or presented yet.&#xD;
