      This study will determine if the brain regions in blind people that would normally be&#xD;
      involved in vision are used instead to remember touch. Blind people have an enhanced sense of&#xD;
      touch compared to sighted people, and they also perform better on tests for certain kinds of&#xD;
      memory. This study will examine and compare the results of a touch memory test in blind and&#xD;
      sighted people to determine what brain areas are involved in responding to touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blind people and sighted volunteers between 18 and 80 years of age who have no psychiatric&#xD;
      problems or neurological problems (other than blindness) may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical interview and examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo one or both of the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral experiment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sighted participants are blindfolded during this experiment. Subjects sit comfortably in&#xD;
      front of a table. They are presented with a number of surfaces placed on a table one at a&#xD;
      time and are given 10 seconds to feel each surface with the index finger on their dominant&#xD;
      hand. They must concentrate and memorize the surfaces as best they can. After a 15-minute&#xD;
      break, they are again presented with a series of surfaces and given 10 seconds to feel each&#xD;
      one. This time, they must say as quickly as possibly whether the surface is one they touched&#xD;
      previously or is a new surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues.&#xD;
      In this study, subjects undergo MRI scanning of the brain while performing the same touch&#xD;
      test described above. For the MRI, the subject lies on a table that slides into the scanner.&#xD;
      The MRI machine detects change in the brain regions involved in performing the task.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the blind, areas of the brain that would normally respond to visual stimuli instead of&#xD;
      process information from other sensory modalities such as the somatosensory and auditory&#xD;
      domains. Recent studies have shown that the visual cortex of the blind participates in&#xD;
      higher-order processing of auditory information including verb generation and retrieval of&#xD;
      verbal memories. Because tactile information plays a similarly crucial role when vision is&#xD;
      missing (i.e. to read Braille), it has been suggested that the ability to encode and recall&#xD;
      tactile information in the blind is superior to that in the sighted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of this protocol is to determine if tactile memory is superior in early&#xD;
      blind subjects relative to that in late blind and sighted control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to determine if the visual cortex of blind people can participate in&#xD;
      higher-order processing of tactile information such as tactile encoding recognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our experiments will make use of early blind, late blind, and sighted control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1: We will quantify the ability of our study populations to encode into and&#xD;
      retrieve from episodic tactile memory. Subjects will be presented with a series of surfaces&#xD;
      that they are to palpate and commit to memory, after which they will rest for ten to fifteen&#xD;
      minutes. The old surfaces will then be presented again with a same number of new surfaces&#xD;
      randomly interleaved. Subjects are to discriminate old from new surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2: We will identify cortical areas associated with successful tactile memory&#xD;
      encoding and retrieval in blind individuals and sighted controls using functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI). Subjects will perform the memory task from Experiment 1 while in&#xD;
      the MRI machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1: The primary outcome measure will be recognition memory, a corrected measure of&#xD;
      the number of old stimuli correctly remembered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2: The primary outcome measure will be the number of voxels significantly&#xD;
      activated in primary visual cortex in early blind subjects as compared to late blind subjects&#xD;
      and sighted controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect the magnitude of visual cortex activation in the early blind during a tactile&#xD;
      memory task to correlate with superior performance on the task.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Early Blind Subjects: Only compliant early blind subjects between the ages of 18 and 80&#xD;
        years who have little to no visual perception due to diseases affecting the peripheral&#xD;
        components of the visual system, i.e., blind subjects without any further neurological&#xD;
        problems, and with normal MRI brain scans, will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Late Blind Subjects: Only compliant late blind subjects who have lost their vision after&#xD;
        age 4 years due to diseases affecting the peripheral components of the visual system, i.e.,&#xD;
        blind subjects without any further neurological problems, and with normal MRI brain scans,&#xD;
        will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sighted controls: Only compliant adult healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 80&#xD;
        years with no history of neurological and psychiatric illness who are able to concentrate&#xD;
        and to perform simple attention tasks are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Blind subjects: Early and late blind subjects (aged 18 to 80) will be included in this&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sighted subjects: Healthy sighted (normal or corrected-to normal vision) matched in age,&#xD;
        sex, and handedness to the early blind subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Furthermore, any individual who is on medication with potential influence on nervous system&#xD;
        function, who has a history of surgery with metallic implants or known history of metallic&#xD;
