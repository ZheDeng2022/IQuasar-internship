  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if paliperidone ER is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      adults with schizophrenia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paliperidone is being developed as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The extended-release (ER) formulation of paliperidone was developed to deliver&#xD;
      paliperidone at a relatively constant rate over a 24-hour period to improve the tolerability&#xD;
      profile and decrease the potential for orthostatic hypotension. This study is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 2 fixed dosages of paliperidone ER compared&#xD;
      with placebo in adult patients with schizophrenia. This is a multicenter, double-blind&#xD;
      (neither the patient nor the physician will know if placebo or drug is being given and at&#xD;
      what dose), randomized (patients will be assigned to different treatment groups based solely&#xD;
      on chance), placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized into 1 of 4 treatment groups to receive oral dosages of paliperidone ER 6&#xD;
      mg or 12 mg, olanzapine 10 mg, or placebo once daily for a 6-week period. The study includes&#xD;
      a screening period of up to 5 days, followed by 6-week double-blind treatment phase.&#xD;
      Following the double-blind treatment phase, eligible patients (those who have completed the&#xD;
      6-week double-blind phase or who discontinue due to lack of efficacy after a minimum of 21&#xD;
      days) may enter a 52-week open-label extension phase with paliperidone ER monotherapy. While&#xD;
      patients are hospitalized, efficacy will be assessed twice during the first week and at the&#xD;
      end of the second week, and after patients are discharged from the hospital, they will return&#xD;
      to have efficacy and safety assessments performed on a weekly basis through the end of the&#xD;
      6-week double-blind phase. Efficacy will be evaluated throughout the 6-week double-blind&#xD;
      phase by completion of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S), Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP),&#xD;
      Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale, Revision 4 (SQLS-R4), and Sleep Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
      (VAS). The efficacy response will be measured by the change from baseline score to end of&#xD;
      double-blind phase for PANSS, PSP, CGI-S, SQLS-R4, and Sleep VAS. Safety will be monitored&#xD;
      throughout the study and includes assessments of the incidence of adverse events; measurement&#xD;
      of extrapyramidal symptoms using 3 rating scales (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale [AIMS],&#xD;
      Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale [BARS], Simpson-Angus Rating Scale [SAS]); measurement of vital&#xD;
      signs (laying down and standing blood pressure, pulse, temperature); electrocardiograms; and&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests. Double-blind: 6 mg or 12 mg fixed dose of paliperidone ER,&#xD;
      olanzapine 10 mg or matching placebo taken orally once daily for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label extension: start on paliperidone ER 9 mg taken orally once daily; maintained on a&#xD;
      flexible dosage of paliperidone ER (3, 6, 9, or 12 mg/day) for 52 weeks.&#xD;
