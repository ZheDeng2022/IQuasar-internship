      This study will examine the action of sensory tricks on an occurrence known as surround&#xD;
      inhibition when there is a disorder of muscle tone affecting a single body part in isolation.&#xD;
      Surround inhibition refers to a situation that suppresses unwanted movements, known as&#xD;
      dystonia, in surrounding muscles during voluntary actions. There are tricks-various&#xD;
      actions-that people use to temporarily stop those unwanted movements. Such tricks can include&#xD;
      touching the affected body part, placing an object in the mouth, pulling the hair, and&#xD;
      others. Often these tricks are beneficial early in the illness but become less effective as&#xD;
      it progresses. This study is guided by a hypothesis that sensory tricks will restore surround&#xD;
      inhibition and by another hypothesis that it is the application of the tricks, not simply&#xD;
      sensory input, that is effective in doing that restoring. Emphasis is on cervical dystonia,&#xD;
      involuntary actions affecting the neck, in which the tricks commonly involve the cheeks and&#xD;
      chin. The technique used in the study is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 and older who have cervical dystonia with at least one effective trick and&#xD;
      patients with no effective trick may be eligible for this study. There will also be a control&#xD;
      group of healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to show the sensory trick and may be asked to be videotaped.&#xD;
      During the TMS procedure, they will be seated in a comfortable chair, with hands placed on a&#xD;
      pillow on the lap. Small electrodes-soft strips that stick to the skin-will be placed on the&#xD;
      skin to record the electrical activity of some muscles in the neck that are activated by the&#xD;
      stimulation from TMS. In TMS, there will be a wire coil held over the scalp. A brief&#xD;
      electrical current will be passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates&#xD;
      the brain. Patients will hear a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the&#xD;
      coil. There may be muscle twitches of the face, arm, or leg. In addition, patients may be&#xD;
      asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions so that the coil can&#xD;
      be positioned appropriately. Patients will sometimes be asked to bite down and tap their&#xD;
      teeth slightly for about 1-1/2 minutes at a time. They will be asked to show the sensory&#xD;
      trick. The stimulation is usually not painful, although sometimes strong contractions of the&#xD;
      scalp muscles can cause discomfort or a headache. Patients can ask to have the procedure&#xD;
      discontinued at any time. The testing session takes about 2 hours, done on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism of sensory tricks on surround&#xD;
      inhibition in the motor cortex in focal dystonia. Sensory tricks or Geste antagoniste, are&#xD;
      various manoeuvres used by dystonic patients to transiently diminish their spasms. Many of&#xD;
      these manoeuvres involve motor as well as sensory input and here we use the term 'tricks' to&#xD;
      refer to both phenomena. Little is known of this unique feature that is an evidence for the&#xD;
      abnormality of sensorimotor integration in focal dystonia. The relief of dystonic symptoms by&#xD;
      the application of tricks suggests its potential as a clue to the understanding of the yet&#xD;
      unclear mechanism of dystonia. There is evidence that surround inhibition, a cortical&#xD;
      phenomenon that functions to suppress unwanted movements in surrounding muscles during&#xD;
      voluntary actions, is impaired in dystonia. Since tricks transiently relieve the dystonic&#xD;
      symptoms, we hypothesize that the mechanism of tricks is the normalization of surround&#xD;
      inhibition which is defective in dystonia.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Nineteen patients age 18 or over with cervical dystonia with a minimal of one effective&#xD;
        trick, 15 patients age 18 and over with cervical dystonia with no effective trick will be&#xD;
        recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For patients, the selection criteria are the presence of cervical dystonia and the minimal&#xD;
        of one sensory trick in the patient with trick group, and no trick in the patient without&#xD;
        trick group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The interview of dystonic patients will be focused on medical history, neurologic&#xD;
        examination and effectiveness of the patient's tricks which will be accessed by measuring&#xD;
        the degree of head rotation before and during trick application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis of dystonia will rely on review of medical record, history, and clinical&#xD;
        evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the patients that are receiving botulinum toxin injections, the evaluation will be done&#xD;
        3 months after their last injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Their gender, age, or ethnic origin will not provide bias for inclusion to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There is no evidence of higher prevalence of dystonia in any particular race, thus the&#xD;
        races and ethnicity of the subjects recruited for this study will approximate that of the&#xD;
        general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Fifteen normal subjects age 18 and over will be recruited for the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The controls will not have dystonia or any other neurological condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects will sign an informed consent prior to participation in the trial, and the&#xD;
        trial will be approved by the NINDS IRB committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for the trial covering both the normal control and dystonia group will&#xD;
        include;&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any concurrent medical or surgical condition as well as neurological or psychiatric&#xD;
             illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any individual who is on medications with potential influence of the nervous system&#xD;
             function (antidepressants, antianxiolytics, anticonvulsants, antipsychotic,&#xD;
             antiparkinsonian, hypnotics, and stimulants).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have received Botulinum toxin injections within 3 months of starting the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Individual who has a pacemaker, an implanted medical pump, a metal plate or medical&#xD;
             object in the skull or eye (for example, after brain surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Individual with a history of seizures.&#xD;
