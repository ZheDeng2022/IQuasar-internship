  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 3-AP and doxorubicin in&#xD;
      treating patients with metastatic or refractory solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop&#xD;
      growing or die. 3-AP may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for&#xD;
      tumor cell growth and may help doxorubicin kill more cancer cells by making them more&#xD;
      sensitive to the drug.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To find the maximal tolerated dose for the combination of doxorubicin and Triapine® in&#xD;
      patients with refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To find the severity and frequency of toxicity associated with this combination and to&#xD;
      observe for and record any antitumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of Triapine®/doxorubicin on the ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl&#xD;
      radical in vivo by EPR spectroscopy in buccal mucosal cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes and&#xD;
      in tumor biopsies. Formation of low molecular weight iron-Triapine® chelates will also be&#xD;
      assessed by EPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of Triapine®/doxorubicin on cell cycle in vivo by measuring&#xD;
      S-phase arrest in buccal mucosal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effect of Triapine®/doxorubicin on MDR gene expression and polymorphisms&#xD;
      in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the effect of Triapine®/doxorubicin on ribonucleotide reductase R2 mRNA and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination. VI. To measure the formulation&#xD;
      of circulating isoprostanes as an indicator of oxidative stress with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 3-AP (Triapine^®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes on day 1 and 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 2 hours&#xD;
      on days 1-4. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 3-AP (Triapine®) until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an&#xD;
      additional 6 patients are treated at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed until disease progression.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients&#xD;
             with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have LVEF &gt; 45%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have baseline screening for G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase)&#xD;
             deficiency; G6PD must be no lower than the lower limit of normal prior to starting&#xD;
             study treatment; patients who are above the upper limit of normal may enroll in the&#xD;
             trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of Triapine® on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason&#xD;
             and because heterocyclic carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazones as well as other&#xD;
             therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more&#xD;
             than 4 weeks earlier; patients with grade =&lt; 1 adverse events from prior therapies are&#xD;
             eligible at the investigator's discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Triapine® or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Triapine® is a heterocyclic&#xD;
             carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Triapine®, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with Triapine®; these potential risks may also&#xD;
             apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with Triapine® or other agents administered during the&#xD;
             study; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known G6PD deficiency are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe pulmonary disease requiring oxygen and patients with baseline&#xD;
             hypoxia (&lt; 95% oxygen saturations) are excluded&#xD;
