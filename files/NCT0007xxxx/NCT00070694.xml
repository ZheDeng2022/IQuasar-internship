  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether a highly specific and powerful 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A&#xD;
      (5-HT2A) antagonist, M100907, combined with escitalopram, is responsible for an&#xD;
      antidepressant effect. Major affective disorders are common and can be chronic and life&#xD;
      threatening. Yet as many as 50 to 75 percent of patients get only a partial response to the&#xD;
      use of antidepressants. Some do not respond to medications in the category of serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)-or they experience side effects that sharply interfere with daily&#xD;
      life. This study will determine the extent to which M100907 improves sleep and improves&#xD;
      fatigue in people who are treated, and how it reduces cognitive impairment, that is,&#xD;
      limitations to awareness, in the depressive syndrome. It will also look at allele frequencies&#xD;
      as being covariates in the analysis and to collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 to 65 years of age who meet the criteria for major depression, without psychotic&#xD;
      features, may be eligible for this study. Women of childbearing potential must be using two&#xD;
      medically accepted contraception methods and must agree to a (Beta)-HCG (human chorionic&#xD;
      gonadotropin, a polypeptide hormone produced by the human placenta) test at the screening and&#xD;
      at several intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In random groups, participants will receive treatment with escitalopram and either M100907 or&#xD;
      a placebo. The timing of escitalopram can be adjusted to manage side effects. If already&#xD;
      taking any other medications for psychiatric purposes, participants will be tapered from&#xD;
      those medications and monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test of vital signs, lying and standing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-lead electrocardiogram (SCG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric examination for screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thyroid screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood for chemistry and hematology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis B and C/HIV screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beta-HCG pregnancy test, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine drug screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Asburg Depression&#xD;
           Rating Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of the Antidepressant Treatment History&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sleep study will be conducted during the steady state period and again toward the end of&#xD;
      the double blind treatment period. Each study will involve 2 consecutive nights of&#xD;
      polysomnographic recording done by an EEG technologist experienced in using the technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major Affective Disorders are common and often chronic life threatening illnesses.&#xD;
      Furthermore a significant fraction of patients do not respond to treatment with serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's), have only a partial response with continued significant&#xD;
      morbidity and functional impairment, or suffer from drug induced side effects that decrease&#xD;
      the individuals' quality of life. Side effects from SSRI's include gastrointestinal symptoms,&#xD;
      anxiety, sleep disturbance, and sexual dysfunction. Evidence from recent clinical trials and&#xD;
      preclinical studies suggests that blockade of 5-HT2 receptors may have antidepressant effects&#xD;
      when combined with reuptake blockade of serotonin at serotonin transporters. In order to&#xD;
      better determine whether 5-HT2A receptors are responsible for this effect we propose to study&#xD;
      the highly specific and potent 5-HT2A antagonist, M100907, in combination with escitalopram&#xD;
      in SSRI resistant major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects aged 18-65 will be studied who prospectively are shown to be treatment resistant to&#xD;
      the SSRI escitalopram. Subjects will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive&#xD;
      continued open treatment with escitalopram+M100907 or continued escitalopram+placebo.&#xD;
      Subjects will have weekly mood and safety ratings during this randomized period for four&#xD;
      weeks. At that time subjects who were initially randomized to placebo (and are&#xD;
      non-responders) will be switched to active drug for four weeks of randomized treatment while&#xD;
      the active group continues an additional four weeks of combination therapy. Those meeting&#xD;
      remission criteria will be eligible to extend therapy in open treatment with the combination&#xD;
      therapy for an additional period of up to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the potential for M100907 to improve sleep architecture in general and slow wave sleep&#xD;
      in particular, sleep will be studied using polysomnographic methods before and after&#xD;
      randomization. Sleep disturbance is also a well-known side effect of SSRI's, and the addition&#xD;
      of M100907 may improve sleep disturbance related to the affective disorder itself or to&#xD;
      iatrogenic SSRI effects on sleep. Examination of improvement in sexual side effects,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal side effects, headache frequency, and anxiety will also be investigated in&#xD;
      the comparison of addition of M100907 versus placebo in escitalopram treated subjects. DNA&#xD;
      samples will be collected for neurotransmitter-related genetic polymorphisms for covariance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, 5-HT2A receptors on cortical apical dendrites sit in a crucial location to influence&#xD;
      cognitive processing and excitatory transmission. Since some 5-HT2A antagonists can lead to a&#xD;
      down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptors and their altered distribution, as well as increased&#xD;
      prefrontal cortical monoamine levels, neuropsychological testing to compare between and&#xD;
      within subjects treated with M100907 and placebo may increase our understanding of the&#xD;
      importance of serotonin receptors in cognition and depression. Subjects will be studied&#xD;
      neuropsychologically before and twice following randomization. If M100907 enhances cognition&#xD;
      in depression this would be an important advance given the high rates of impairment in&#xD;
      functioning and residual cognitive difficulties observed in patients with depression.&#xD;

        have at least moderate level of major depression (HAM-D = 20) who do not have psychotic&#xD;
        depression and are resistant to treatment based on both retrospective and prospective&#xD;
        rating are treatment refractory to specified antidepressants. Subjects are excluded who&#xD;
        have failed antidepressants of similar mechanism to M100907. Female subjects must use two&#xD;
        forms of birth control and subjects will be excluded based on medical criteria outlined in&#xD;
        the full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No subjects who have previously been treated with the investigational product will be&#xD;
