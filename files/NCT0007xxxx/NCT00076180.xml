  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the use of the humanized Mik-beta-1 (Hu-Mik-beta1) antibody in&#xD;
      patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGL). Patients with T-LGL often&#xD;
      have reduced white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, and increased numbers of&#xD;
      abnormal cells called large granular lymphocytes (LGLs). Patients may have recurrent&#xD;
      infections, anemia, or abnormal bleeding. Hu-Mik-beta1 attaches to LGL cells and blocks the&#xD;
      action of growth factors called interleukins that stimulate LGL growth. Blocking these&#xD;
      interleukins may stop T-LGL leukemia cells from growing. This study will determine the dose&#xD;
      and frequency of treatment with Hu-Mik-(SqrRoot) 1 that can safely be given to patients to&#xD;
      coat the surface of their leukemic cells with antibody, determine how long the antibody lasts&#xD;
      in the blood after injection, and examine the side effects and possible benefits of the drug&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients age 18 or older with T-LGL may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be&#xD;
      screened with a medical history and physical examination, review of pathology studies, skin&#xD;
      biopsy, evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis if present, chest x-ray, computerized tomography&#xD;
      (CT) scans and other imaging studies as needed, bone marrow biopsy, and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a single dose of Hu-Mik-beta1 by a 90-minute infusion through a&#xD;
      vein. Groups of patients will be treated with increasing doses (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/kg) of&#xD;
      the antibody. Patients who develop serious drug side effects are taken off the study. The&#xD;
      treatment requires a 3- to 4-day hospital stay. In addition to Hu-Mik-(SqrRoot) 1 treatment,&#xD;
      patients will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood for 8 days following the dose of Hu-Mik-beta1 to measure blood&#xD;
           levels of the antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits of 1 to 2 days at 22, 29, and 43 days after the dose of the antibody&#xD;
           and then every 3 months for a total of 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy if one has not been done within 6 weeks before entering&#xD;
           the study, and a repeat biopsy if complete remission of T-LGL is achieved after&#xD;
           completing treatment. For the biopsy, an area of the hip is numbed and a special needle&#xD;
           is used to draw bone marrow from the hipbone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies, such as chest x-ray and CT scan of the body after completing treatment&#xD;
           if the screening scans showed abnormalities due to the T-LGL leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymph node biopsy in individuals with enlarged superficial lymph nodes due to T-LGL&#xD;
           leukemia to see if the treatment is reaching the leukemia in the lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may or may not be a direct benefit from participating in this study. However, the&#xD;
      results may help in the treatment of future patients.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia is a chronic lymphoproliferative&#xD;
           disorder associated with granulocytopenia, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although agents such as cyclosporine and methotrexate have shown activity in T-LGL,&#xD;
           treatment of T-LGL has remained largely undefined and symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The shared IL-2R/Il-15R Beta receptor (CD122) is over expressed on T-LGL cells and may&#xD;
           stimulate growth T-LGL cells through its interaction with IL-15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hu-Mik-Beta1 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to IL-2R/IL-15R Beta&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hu-Mik-Beta1 may inhibit the growth and exert cytotoxic activity against T-LGL cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
           Hu-Mik-Beta1 when administered to patients with T-LGL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the dose of Hu-Mik-Beta1 required to saturate IL-2R/IL-15R Beta (CD122) on&#xD;
           -T-LGL cells in the peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics and serum die-away curve of Hu-Mik-Beta1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide preliminary information on the clinical response following single dose&#xD;
           administration of Hu-MiK-Beta1 in patients with CD122 expressing T-LGL leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      --T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have a granulocyte count of less than 1000/microL, or hemoglobin less than 10&#xD;
      gm/dL, or be transfusion dependent, or platelets less than 100,000/ microL, or any&#xD;
      combination of these unless receiving a hematopoietic growth factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-LGL cell count greater than or equal to 1000/microL (CD3 plus/CD8 plus/usually CD57&#xD;
           plus) by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may be receiving a stable dose of a hematopoietic growth factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohorts of 3 patients each will be treated with a single intravenous dose of&#xD;
           Hu-Mik-Beta1 at 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be observed for adverse events for 6-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed pharmacokinetic studies and determination of CD122 receptor saturation will be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response will be evaluated using hematological, flow cytometry, molecular and clinical&#xD;
           evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An additional 3 patients will be accrued at the highest dose or MTD to aid in design of&#xD;
           a Phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients participating in Phase I will also be eligible to participate in Phase II.&#xD;
