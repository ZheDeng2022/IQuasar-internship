    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a new immunosupressive therapy, Daclizumab, and compare it with&#xD;
      antithymocyte globulin (ATG) to treat cytopenia, that is, the deficiency of cellular elements&#xD;
      of the blood, in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Daclizumab is an anti-interleukin-2 receptor&#xD;
      (IL-2) antibody. MDS, also known as myelodysplasia, is a disorder that can cause anemia,&#xD;
      spontaneous bleeding, and greater risk of infections. Although the bone marrow can still&#xD;
      produce some blood cells, very few reach the bloodstream. The cause of MDS is not known,&#xD;
      although its behavior is. Many patients need transfusions of red blood cells. They may also&#xD;
      develop leukemia, which is often quite resistant to treatment with chemotherapy. However, the&#xD;
      progression of the disorder to leukemia is usually slow, taking many years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have MDS may be eligible for this study. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood for tests including blood counts, liver and kidney function, and&#xD;
           antibodies against common viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow sample to confirm the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will randomly receive either ATG or Daclizumab. If they are in the group to&#xD;
      receive ATG, they will be admitted as inpatients to undergo the first 10 to 14 days of&#xD;
      treatment. If they do not already have a catheter in one of the large veins of the neck,&#xD;
      chest, or arm, one will be placed. ATG will be given through the catheter. Blood counts and&#xD;
      other blood analysis will be monitored daily while the patients are treated. After about 10&#xD;
      days, they will be released, to be under the care of their referring physicians. Those&#xD;
      participants who are in the group to receive Daclizumab will receive a total of five doses,&#xD;
      one every 2 weeks, over 8 weeks, given through a vein as a 15-minute infusion. The first,&#xD;
      third, and fifth dose will be given at the outpatient clinic. The second and fourth doses can&#xD;
      be given either at the clinic or by the patients' primary hematologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed as outpatients at 3-month intervals for the first year, and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for the next 3 years. Afterward, follow-up will be yearly. A small sample&#xD;
      of blood will be drawn at the visits. Also, bone marrow examinations will be requested at the&#xD;
      6-month intervals for the first 3 years of treatment. If the treatment that patients are&#xD;
      assigned to does not work, after 6 months, they will be eligible to receive the other&#xD;
      treatment-provided that they have complied with the required blood tests and visits to the&#xD;
      clinic required to assess the patients' safety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Many bone marrow failure syndromes in humans are now recognized to result from immunological&#xD;
      mechanisms. These diseases include aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, and some types of&#xD;
      myelodysplasia. Patients with these conditions, who may suffer variable degrees of anemia,&#xD;
      leukocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia, alone or in combination, have been shown to respond to&#xD;
      a wide variety of immunosuppressive agents, ranging from corticosteroids to cyclosporine&#xD;
      (CSA) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG), however, nonresponse and relapse continues to be a&#xD;
      problem. Why some patients do not respond initially or others respond and then relapse is&#xD;
      unclear. Autoreactive T cells may be resistant to the effect of ATG/CsA (nonresponders),&#xD;
      while in others residual autoreactive T cells expand post-treatment leading to hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell destruction and recurrent pancytopenia (relapse). Therefore, novel, less toxic&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimens that increase response rates and hematologic recovery and decrease&#xD;
      relapse rates are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such novel therapy, Daclizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin-2 receptor (lL-2R)&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody (mAb), acts against activated lymphocytes, thus sharing an important&#xD;
      mechanism of action with ATG. The mAb is much less toxic than ATG and may be administered to&#xD;
      outpatients at relatively infrequent intervals (every 2 weeks). Treatments with ATG alone and&#xD;
      CsA alone have demonstrated varying degrees of success in alleviating the cytopenia of MDS.&#xD;
      Our experience suggests that ATG rather than CSA is the more effective agent inducing&#xD;
      hematological responses in susceptible MDS patients and that certain variables including the&#xD;
      patient's age, whether or not they were HLA DR15, and days of red cell transfusion dependence&#xD;
      prior to treatment were predictive of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose this randomized phase II study to evaluate and compare a new&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy, Daclizumab, with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) to treat the&#xD;
      cytopenia of MDS in a population of subjects with intermediate or high predicted probability&#xD;
      of response.&#xD;
