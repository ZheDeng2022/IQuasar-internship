      This study will examine how the anti-HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (KaletraÂ®&#xD;
      (Registered Trademark)) affects the function of the endothelium (lining of the arteries).&#xD;
      Medications such as protease inhibitors can dramatically change the course of HIV infection&#xD;
      in many patients; however, among their side effects is development of abnormal lipid levels&#xD;
      resulting in high cholesterol and insulin resistance. These side effects may damage the&#xD;
      lining of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, leading to premature coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. The study will determine whether lopinavir/ritonavir directly affects endothelial&#xD;
      function and whether it alters cholesterol levels, glucose tolerance, and markers of&#xD;
      inflammation in people who take the drug for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates must be HIV-negative and have no history of heart disease, hypertension, or&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. They must not have smoked for at least 6 weeks before entering the study.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests&#xD;
      (including a pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential), and electrocardiogram. In&#xD;
      addition, candidates will have an oral glucose tolerance test (see description below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lopinavir/ritonavir: 4 weeks (3 capsules twice a day) beginning study day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flow-mediated vasodilatation test (study days 0 and 29) - An ultrasound device for&#xD;
           measuring the size of the brachial artery (artery in the upper arm) is placed just above&#xD;
           the elbow. The size of the artery is measured before and 5 minutes after blood flow to&#xD;
           the arm is stopped for 5 minutes, using a blood pressure cuff. The artery is also&#xD;
           measured before and after taking nitroglycerin, a medicine that dilates blood vessels.&#xD;
           These measurements tell how well the drug treatment works on the cells lining the&#xD;
           brachial artery, which is an indicator of coronary artery function. This test takes&#xD;
           about 1.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forearm blood-flow test (study days 1 and 30): Small tubes are inserted into an artery&#xD;
           and vein in the forearm at the inside of the elbow. Blood pressure cuffs are placed&#xD;
           around the upper arm and wrist, and a strain gauge (a rubber band-like device) is placed&#xD;
           around the forearm. When the blood pressure cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the&#xD;
           forearm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the blood flow. When the&#xD;
           devices are in place, a salt water solution is injected in the small tube in the artery.&#xD;
           After 20 minutes, small doses of the following drugs are given through the catheter at&#xD;
           various intervals: 1) L-NMMA (blocks production of nitric oxide, a substance produced by&#xD;
           the blood vessels that causes them to dilate); 2) sodium nitroprusside (dilates blood&#xD;
           vessels, increasing blood flow); 3) acetylcholine (lowers blood pressure); and 4)&#xD;
           acetylcholine plus L-NMMA. The effect of the different drugs on blood flow in the&#xD;
           forearm is measured. The study takes about 2 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests (screening and study days 1,15, 30, and 44)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (at screening and on study day 30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test (at screening and on study day 30) - A blood sample is&#xD;
           collected. Then, the subject drinks 300 milliliters of a glucose solution (a liquid that&#xD;
           contains sugar dissolved in water). Two hours after drinking the solution, blood is&#xD;
           drawn again to examine how the body responds to the increase blood sugar levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With the advent of the highly active antiretroviral (ARV) therapy era, patients with human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have had significantly decreased mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      Concomitant with more patients chronically taking antiretroviral therapy, there has been an&#xD;
      increase in atherogenic lipoprotein profiles (high cholesterol, high triglycerides, low&#xD;
      HDL's), insulin resistance, fat redistribution and coronary artery disease. HIV viral&#xD;
      replication, anti-retroviral treatment regimens, lipids, glucose intolerance, host immune&#xD;
      response or a combination of factors may contribute to the increase in cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors. HIV positive patients, independent of the effect on lipids, appear to have increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk. Studies are not entirely consistent, but the most convincing study to&#xD;
      date, the D.A.D. study from EURO-SIDA, shows a 27% relative increased rate of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction per year of exposure over the first seven years of ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lopinavir-ritonavir is one of the most commonly used antiretroviral therapy. It also produces&#xD;
      lipid abnormalities. Thus, an important part of the investigating factors contributing to&#xD;
      atherosclerosis would be to determine if this drug can adversely influence endothelial cells&#xD;
      in the absence of HIV infection or low CD4 counts. This would suggest that this drug directly&#xD;
      or indirectly could predispose to atherosclerosis. Endothelial function is an important&#xD;
      contributor to atherosclerosis. Invasive and non-invasive methods to evaluate endothelial&#xD;
      cell function have been validated as predictors of coronary artery disease. These techniques&#xD;
      have been used at NIH for clinical investigation for many years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to determine whether there is a pathologic effect on endothelial&#xD;
      function from the lopinavir/ritonavir. By measuring endothelial function in HIV non-infected&#xD;
      subjects both before and after four weeks of therapy, we will be able to investigate whether&#xD;
      the medications have a direct toxic effect on the endothelium. Collection of metabolic data&#xD;
      will allow us to evaluate whether endothelial function occurs in conjunction or separate from&#xD;
      lipoprotein and glucose metabolic changes. As ARV options increase, it may be possible to&#xD;
      choose specific regimens that may minimize acceleration of cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      associated with endothelial dysfunction, especially in patients with other cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors. These findings may help elucidate the pathophysiology of premature&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in HIV positive patients and also plan interventions to minimize&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and subsequent cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
