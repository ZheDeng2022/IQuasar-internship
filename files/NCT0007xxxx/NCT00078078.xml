    <textblock>
      Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), one of the most common inborn errors of organic acid&#xD;
      metabolism, is heterogeneous in etiology and clinical manifestations. Affected patients with&#xD;
      cblA, cblB and mut classes of MMA are medically fragile and can suffer from complications&#xD;
      such as metabolic stroke or infarction of the basal ganglia, pancreatitis, end stage renal&#xD;
      failure, growth impairment, osteoporosis, and developmental delay. The frequency of these&#xD;
      complications and their precipitants remain undefined. Furthermore, current treatment&#xD;
      protocol outcomes have continued to demonstrate substantial morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
      patient population. Increasingly, solid organ transplantation (liver, and/or kidney) has been&#xD;
      used to treat patients. Disordered transport and intracellular metabolism of vitamin B12&#xD;
      produces a distinct group of disorders that feature methylmalonic acidemia as well as&#xD;
      (hyper)homocysteinemia. These conditions are named after the corresponding cellular&#xD;
      complementation class (cblC, cblD, cblF, cblJ and cblX) and are also heterogenous, clinically&#xD;
      and biochemically. The genetic disorders underlying cblE and cblG feature an isolated&#xD;
      impairment of the activity of methionine synthase, a critical enzyme involved in the&#xD;
      conversion of homocysteine to methionine and these disorders feature (hyper)homocysteinemia.&#xD;
      Lastly, a group of patients can have increased methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine in the&#xD;
      blood or urine caused by variant(s)in recently identified (ACSF3) and unknown genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we will clinically evaluate patients with methylmalonic acidemia and&#xD;
      cobalamin metabolic defects. Routine inpatient admissions will last up to 4-5 days and&#xD;
      involve urine collection, blood drawing, ophthalmological examination, radiological&#xD;
      procedures, MRI/MRS, skin biopsies in some, and developmental testing. In a subset of&#xD;
      patients who have or will receive renal, hepato- or hepato-renal transplants or have an&#xD;
      unusual variant or clinical course and have MMA, a lumbar puncture to examine CSF metabolites&#xD;
      will be performed. In this small group of patients, CSF metabolite monitoring may be used to&#xD;
      adjust therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives will be to further delineate the spectrum of phenotypes and characterize&#xD;
      the natural history of these enzymopathies, query for genotype/enzymatic/phenotype&#xD;
      correlations, search for new genetic causes of methylmalonic acidemia and/or homocysteinemia,&#xD;
      identify new disease biomarkers and define clinical outcome parameters for future clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will consist of participants previously evaluated at NIH, physician referrals,&#xD;
      and families directed to the study from clinicaltrials.gov as well as the Organic Acidemia&#xD;
      Association, Homocystinuria Network America and other national and international support&#xD;
      groups. Most participants will be evaluated only at the NIH Clinical Center. However, if the&#xD;
      NIH team decides that a patient under the age of 2 years is a candidate subject for this&#xD;
      research protocol, that patient may enroll at the Children s National Medical Center (CNMC)&#xD;
      site, pending approval by Dr Chapman, the Principal Investigator of the CNMC location&#xD;
      Individuals may also enroll in the tissue collection only part of the study at the UPMC&#xD;
      Children s Hospital of Pittsburgh or share medical history and clinical data via telemedicine&#xD;
      visits remotely. Outcome measures will largely be descriptive and encompass correlations&#xD;
      between clinical, biochemical and molecular parameters.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients of any gender, ethnicity, and over 1 month of age with biochemical or genetic&#xD;
        diagnosis of methylmalonic acidemia or cobalamin disorders are eligible to enroll in this&#xD;
        protocol. The primary reason for expanding enrollment to young children is because&#xD;
        individuals with cobalamin C deficiency (cblC) develop a maculopathy often in utero or&#xD;
        early infancy yet the natural history of the disease progression in these early years has&#xD;
        not been well defined. Our colleagues at the National Eye Institute have documented the&#xD;
        retinal findings in the largest cohort of individuals with cblC and have developed an&#xD;
        expertise in this disorder. A recent report suggests that early treatment may significantly&#xD;
        improve the retinal disease and will be the focus of a future clinical trial at the NIH&#xD;
        Clinical Center requiring a need for more natural history data from birth to early&#xD;
        childhood. Children ages 1 month to 2 years or under 12 kg will be reviewed by the&#xD;
        Pediatric Consult Service prior to scheduling and if approved will be evaluated in the&#xD;
        outpatient clinic for limited evaluations blood draw, eye exam, consults. Affected infants&#xD;
        that are not approved by the Pediatric Consult Service or are not stable enough to travel&#xD;
        may enroll remotely by telemedicine to include in natural history data collection, such as&#xD;
        medical history and laboratory result sharing and interpretation, molecular genetic&#xD;
        testing, genetic counseling, nutrition consult with dietary food log analysis,&#xD;
        neurocognitive assessments. Affected individuals of any of the other disorders under study,&#xD;
        younger than 2 years may be evaluated at Children s National Medical Center (CNMC) as part&#xD;
        of an evolving agreement in the Translational Program in Pediatrics, if they are deemed&#xD;
        eligible for participation by the NIH team and the CNMC team. Patients will be diagnosed&#xD;
        based on a determination of MMA and homocysteine levels in plasma and urine. Most will have&#xD;
        their complementation class known or pending. Molecular genetic analyses to determine&#xD;
        mutations will be expected to have been performed prior to acceptance into the study. Some&#xD;
        patients who have not yet had these laboratory tests will be admitted to the protocol based&#xD;
        upon metabolic parameters and clinical history. This latter category of patients might&#xD;
        include individuals with a suspected genetic but unknown type of MMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The PI/AI may decline to enroll a patient for reasons such as being medically unstable,&#xD;
        residing in a hospital, sub-optimal metabolic control or for any concerns arising after&#xD;
        review of the laboratory and clinical data; any patient who requires dialysis once or&#xD;
        more/week and weighs &lt;40 kg; any patient who is being treated for an intercurrent infection&#xD;
        with antibiotics or has evidence of an acute infection and has metabolic symptoms; any&#xD;
        patient who does not have a regular/local metabolic, genetic or endocrine physician and/or&#xD;
        a family physician, pediatrician, or internist; any patient who may be metabolically&#xD;
        unstable but not acutely ill; and any patient or family who may not be able to institute&#xD;
        recommendations for appropriate testing and care before visiting the NIH. Each family may&#xD;
        be contacted by the NIH team prior to a pending admission to confirm that the patient is&#xD;
        metabolically stable and ready to visit the NIH in a state of relative health, with an&#xD;
        adequate supply of special formulas, medications, supplements, and if needed, medical&#xD;
        equipment such as feeding pumps and replacement parts for feeding tubes. A subset of&#xD;
        participants will be enrolled in the tissue collection part of the study only (i.e. if they&#xD;
        are too sick to travel).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women may be eligible to enroll in the study if they are affected with&#xD;
        methylmalonic acidemia or a cobalamin disorder or are family members of an affected&#xD;
        subject. Pregnant women are not excluded because it is important to learn more about the&#xD;
        effects of these disorders in pregnant participants and the fetus. This research involves&#xD;
        no more than minimal risk to the fetus. Affected subjects who are pregnant or become&#xD;
        pregnant during their participation on the study will not be withdrawn, but will be&#xD;
        excluded from some procedures until the pregnancy is concluded. Affected subjects who are&#xD;
        pregnant may undergo procedures as part of their clinical care, including blood draws,&#xD;
        genetic studies, and consultations, according to the clinical judgement of the clinical&#xD;
        team. Pregnant participants will be excluded from some procedures such as stable isotope,&#xD;
        GFR testing, and MRI until the pregnancy is concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with methylmalonic acidemia or cobalamin disorders of any age, gender and&#xD;
        ethnicity, undergoing a transplantation surgery at UPMC Children s Hospital of Pittsburgh,&#xD;
        are eligible to participate in the tissue collection arm of the study. Pregnant women will&#xD;
        be excluded from tissue collection at the UPMC Children s Hospital of Pittsburgh.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the healthy volunteers, eligibility criteria include individuals that are age 18 and&#xD;
        over.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria include: women who are pregnant, individuals being treated with&#xD;
        antibiotics, individuals with kidney or liver disease, individuals on a special diet such&#xD;
        as a high protein diet or taking protein supplements and individuals with severe&#xD;
        claustrophobia or other anxiety disorders.&#xD;
