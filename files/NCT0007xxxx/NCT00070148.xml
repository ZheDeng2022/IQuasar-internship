      RATIONALE: Oxandrolone and megestrol may help prevent weight loss and improve quality of life&#xD;
      in patients with cancer. It is not yet known whether oxandrolone is more effective than&#xD;
      megestrol in preventing weight loss and improving quality of life in patients who are&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying oxandrolone to see how well it works&#xD;
      compared to megestrol in preventing weight loss and improving quality of life in patients who&#xD;
      are receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the lean body mass and weight of patients with solid tumors and weight loss who&#xD;
           are receiving chemotherapy when treated with oxandrolone vs megestrol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the health-related quality of life of patients treated with these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      disease stage (I-III vs IV), concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no), and gender. Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral oxandrolone twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral megestrol once daily. In both arms, treatment continues&#xD;
           for 12 weeks in the absence of excessive weight loss or gain or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life, weight, and body composition are assessed at baseline, at 1, 2, and 3 months&#xD;
      during study therapy, and then at 1 month after study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62-155 patients (31-77 per treatment arm) will be accrued for&#xD;
      this study within 2 years.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years with no pre-existing or uncontrolled medical or psychological illness&#xD;
             that would impair a patient's ability to provide informed consent or to complete&#xD;
             protocol therapy or quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of one month planned chemotherapy remaining at the time Oxandrin or&#xD;
             Megestrol acetate is begun. Oral chemotherapy medications, biologicals, and monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies are included in eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed solid tumor (see exceptions in ineligibility list)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients with a history of breast cancer, gynecologic cancer, and hormonally&#xD;
             responsive germ cell tumors must be disease free &gt; 5 years to be eligible for this&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with non-melanoma skin cancers and carcinoma in situ of the cervix are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of weight loss of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. &gt; 5% total body weight during the previous 6 months OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. &gt; 3% in previous month OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Progressive weight loss on 2 consecutive visits despite attempts at dietary,&#xD;
                  behavioral, or pharmacologic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.5mg/dl, SGOT and SGPT &lt; 2 times upper limit of normal, total&#xD;
             bilirubin &lt; 2.5 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow 1 tablet twice a day or 20 cc of liquid each day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to meet their nutritional requirements via the oral route with&#xD;
             food and/or oral supplements or via enteral tube feedings. However, Oxandrin pills&#xD;
             must be administered orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are taking warfarin for maintenance of central venous catheter patency&#xD;
             are eligible for this trial if their INR &lt; 1.2. Because of the interaction between&#xD;
             warfarin and Oxandrin, the maintenance dose of warfarin in eligible patients should be&#xD;
             halved to keep the INR at 1-1.2. For example, if a patient is taking 1 mg of warfarin&#xD;
             at study entry, it is recommended that the dose be decreased to 0.5 mg per day, their&#xD;
             dose should be decreased to every other day, every third day, etc. to keep the INR at&#xD;
             &lt; 1.2. The INR must be checked weekly until stable at &lt; 1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients can be receiving concurrent RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing or planned treatment with corticosteroid medications, estrogens, progestins&#xD;
             (including Megestrol acetate) or any other steroid hormone during the study period.&#xD;
             Patients who receive intermittent corticosteroids as part of a pre-chemotherapy&#xD;
             antiemetic regimen are eligible for this study. Patients treated with Oxandrin or&#xD;
             Megestrol acetate &lt; 3 months before study entry are not eligible. Patients taking&#xD;
             dronabinol or any other appetite stimulant must be off medication for a minimum of 3&#xD;
             days prior to start of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had the following are ineligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female breast, gynecologic, or hormonally responsive germ cell tumors in the last 5&#xD;
             years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary or metastatic malignant brain tumors that have not been stable or demonstrate&#xD;
             progressive disease in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma or other hematologic malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men &gt; 40 years of age should have a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level checked if&#xD;
             not monitored in the past year. Those patients with PSA &gt; 4 ng/mL will be excluded&#xD;
             from participation in the study. If required, the PSA should be done within 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hypercalcemia, nephrosis or the nephrotic phase of nephritis or&#xD;
             uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, unstable angina&#xD;
             or Cushing's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with recent (within 6 months) active thromboembolic disease or recent&#xD;
             myocardial infarction (within 3 months of study entry).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic anticoagulation: Patients currently on oral anticoagulants (warfarin) are not&#xD;
             eligible unless they are taking low doses of warfarin for catheter patency. If a&#xD;
             patient develops thromboembolic disease while on treatment, they may remain on study.&#xD;
             It is recommended that they receive a standard loading dose of coumadin on day 1.&#xD;
             because of the interaction between Oxandrin and Coumadin (Oxandrin elevates the INR),&#xD;
             patients will subsequently require a much lower dose of Coumadin. The effect of these&#xD;
             combined medications should develop within 24 to 48 hours. The recommended Coumadin&#xD;
             dose should be decreased to 20% of what is normally required for sufficient&#xD;
             anticoagulation. (Example: If patient would normally receive 5 mg every day, they&#xD;
             should only receive 1 mg every day.) PT/INR results should be monitored frequently&#xD;
             with dosage adjustment as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant ascites, pleural effusions or edema which may inhibit oral food intake or&#xD;
             invalidate weight determinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetic medications are allowed, however patients taking sulfonyureas are ineligible.&#xD;
             Below is a list of commonly used sulfonyureas (Note: This is a helpful guide, not a&#xD;
             complete list.):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Glimepiride (Amaryl®), glyburide (DiaBeta®), chlorpropamide (Diabinese®),&#xD;
        glipizide(Glucatrol®), combined glyburide and metformin (Glucovance®) and orinase&#xD;
        (Tolbutamide®).&#xD;
&#xD;
        There is no contraindication for concomitant use of insulin and oxandrolone (Oxandrin®) if&#xD;
        required by the patient. Any patient on insulin or other oral hypoglycemics should&#xD;
        self-monitor to prevent hypo &amp; hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of priapism (persistant erections) and sickle cell anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a BMI(Body Mass Index) ≥ 35&#xD;
