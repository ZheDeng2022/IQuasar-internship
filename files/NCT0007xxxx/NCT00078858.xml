      This phase I/II trial studies whether stopping cyclosporine before mycophenolate mofetil is&#xD;
      better at reducing the risk of life-threatening graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) than the&#xD;
      previous approach where mycophenolate mofetil was stopped before cyclosporine. The other&#xD;
      reason this study is being done because at the present time there are no curative therapies&#xD;
      known outside of stem cell transplantation for these types of cancer. Because of age or&#xD;
      underlying health status, patients may have a higher likelihood of experiencing harm from a&#xD;
      conventional blood stem cell transplant. This study tests whether this new blood stem cell&#xD;
      transplant method can be made safer by changing the order and length of time that immune&#xD;
      suppressing drugs are given after transplant.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether the incidence of life-threatening GVHD can be reduced after unrelated&#xD;
      donor peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using&#xD;
      nonmyeloablative conditioning with earlier discontinuation of cyclosporine (CSP) and extended&#xD;
      administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in patients with hematologic malignancies and&#xD;
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD to protocols 1463 and 1641.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the utilization of corticosteroids to protocols 1463 and 1641.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare survival to that achieved under protocol 1463 and 1641.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      days -4 to -2, and undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBMC transplant on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to&#xD;
      80 with taper to day 150 and mycophenolate mofetil PO or IV thrice daily (TID) on days 0-30,&#xD;
      BID on days 31-150, and then taper to day 180. Treatment continues in the absence of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 24 months and&#xD;
      then yearly for 5 years.&#xD;
