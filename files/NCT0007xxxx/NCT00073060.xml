      This study will examine the effects of repeated apheresis procedures on bone density and&#xD;
      calcium balance. Apheresis is a procedure for collecting large numbers of a specific blood&#xD;
      component, such as white cells (leukapheresis) or platelets (plateletpheresis). For the&#xD;
      procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and is directed through a&#xD;
      machine that separates it into its components by spinning. The desired cells are removed and&#xD;
      the rest of the blood is returned to the donor, either through the same needle or through a&#xD;
      needle in the other arm. A blood thinning medicine called citrate is added to the&#xD;
      cell-separating machine. Citrate reduces the ionized calcium levels in the blood, which&#xD;
      prevents the blood from clotting. When the blood is returned to the donor, the donor also&#xD;
      receives the citrate. This lowers the donor's ionized calcium levels which may irritate nerve&#xD;
      and muscle cells, causing tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet during the procedure.&#xD;
      The reduced ionized calcium levels result in increased parathyroid hormone levels in the&#xD;
      donor, can effect bone calcium stores. In addition, some of the citrate that is returned to&#xD;
      the donor is excreted in the urine along with calcium, which causes further loss of calcium&#xD;
      from the body. It is not known if the calcium loss during apheresis in people who undergo&#xD;
      this procedure repeatedly has any long-term effects on body calcium balance and bone calcium&#xD;
      stores. This study will measure bone density and calcium balance in long-term platelet and&#xD;
      white cell donors and compare the findings with those of whole blood donors, who do not&#xD;
      receive citrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people between 18 and 80 years of age who weigh between 110 and 300 pounds, do not&#xD;
      have a metal prosthesis, and are not pregnant may be eligible for this study. Participants&#xD;
      undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood donors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection 2 weeks before blood donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I removed undergo standard whole blood donation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan to assess bone density by measuring bone calcium stores. For this procedure,&#xD;
           the subject lies still on a table while the spine, hip, and whole body are scanned using&#xD;
           a small amount of radiation. The forearm is also scanned while the subject is seated.&#xD;
           The scan may be repeated after 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plateletpheresis and leukapheresis donors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard platelet or white cell donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collections immediately prior to and after donation, and on the first,&#xD;
           fourth, and fourteenth days after donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample collections at the beginning and at the end of the apheresis procedure and&#xD;
           on the first, fourth, and fourteenth days after the donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan at the beginning of the study (no earlier than 2 weeks after their latest&#xD;
           apheresis donation). The scan may be repeated after 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some apheresis donors may be asked to have a second procedure in which they take calcium&#xD;
           according to standard guidelines for plateletpheresis and leukapheresis. During the&#xD;
           second procedure, platelet donors will take oral calcium tablets before starting&#xD;
           plateletpheresis. White cell donors will receive calcium intravenously (through a vein)&#xD;
           during the second leukapheresis. For this second procedure, the donors provide&#xD;
           additional blood and urine samples as described above.&#xD;

      Approximately one million plateletpheresis procedures are performed each year in the U.S.,&#xD;
      including 3,500 in the Platelet Center of the Department of Transfusion Medicine, NIH.&#xD;
      Healthy donors are eligible to undergo plateletpheresis as often as 24 times per year. During&#xD;
      plateletpheresis, citrate anticoagulant is added to the blood collection pathway to prevent&#xD;
      clotting in the apheresis device, and is infused into the donor during the procedure.1-3&#xD;
      Adverse effects related to citrate administration are common; the most well-studied is acute&#xD;
      hypocalcemia due to the formation of calcium-citrate complexes. Recent studies in our&#xD;
      Department indicate that changes in serum calcium, PTH, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase,&#xD;
      and vitamin D levels are also present and may be sustained for up to 24 hours after&#xD;
      apheresis. Observations from European studies suggest that serial plateletpheresis donation&#xD;
      may be associated with reduced bone density; however, those studies did not include a control&#xD;
      group, and involved paid donors, who generally were generally younger, allowed to donate more&#xD;
      frequently, and not representative of the population demographics of the U.S. In addition to&#xD;
      volunteer plateletpheresis donors, the NIH Department of Transfusion Medicine maintains a&#xD;
      registry of approximately 500 persons who undergo leukapheresis procedures to provide&#xD;
      components for in vitro research use, for which they receive compensation. These research&#xD;
      apheresis procedures use the same devices as plateletpheresis donations, and also require&#xD;
      citrate anticoagulant infusions. However, the procedure duration and total dose of citrate&#xD;
      administered may be twice as great as that which occurs during plateletpheresis. Leukocyte&#xD;
      and plateletpheresis donors may undergo more than 100 apheresis procedures during the course&#xD;
      of their participation in the donor program at NIH. The impact of serial, frequent, long-term&#xD;
      apheresis donations on total body calcium balance and bone density are unknown. In this&#xD;
      study, we will measure bone density and laboratory tests in 75 NIH plateletpheresis donors,&#xD;
      75 NIH research leukapheresis donors, and in a control group of 150 age, gender, and race&#xD;
      matched NIH whole blood donors. The apheresis study groups will each include at least 50&#xD;
      frequent donors (greater than 50 donations during the past 10 years) and 20 donors with less&#xD;
      than 25 lifetime donations. Comprehensive laboratory evaluations of the effect of citrate&#xD;
      administration on bone metabolism and body calcium and magnesium metabolism before and after&#xD;
      apheresis will be performed. Similar laboratory and bone density measurements will be&#xD;
      performed in 75 subjects who donate platelets at facilities outside of NIH (non-NIH donors),&#xD;
      and who undergo plateletpheresis at more frequent intervals than NIH donors. The effect of&#xD;
      intravenous calcium administration on apheresis-induced changes in these laboratory&#xD;
      parameters will also be assessed. This information will have a major impact on our&#xD;
      understanding of the short and long-term adverse effects of citrate administration in&#xD;
      committed apheresis donors, and may also provide insight into calcium, magnesium, and&#xD;
      phosphorus metabolism.&#xD;
