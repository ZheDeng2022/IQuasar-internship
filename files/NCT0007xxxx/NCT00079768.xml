      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of alemtuzumab (CampathÂ® (Registered&#xD;
      Trademark)) for improving muscle strength in patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis&#xD;
      (s-IBM). The most common inflammatory muscle disease in people over the age of 50, s-IBM&#xD;
      progresses steadily, leading to severe weakness and wasting of the muscles in the arms and&#xD;
      legs. The cause of s-IBM is not known, but it may be an autoimmune disease, in which the&#xD;
      body's immune cells (white blood cells) attack and destroy parts of muscle. Alemtuzumab is a&#xD;
      laboratory-made antibody currently approved to treat certain leukemias. It has also been used&#xD;
      to treat patients with autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis,&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, and tissue rejection associated with transplantation. Alemtuzumab&#xD;
      destroys white blood cells that have a protein called CD52 on their surface and that might be&#xD;
      among the cells attacking muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with s-IBM are eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with physical and&#xD;
      neurological examinations, blood tests, and an electrocardiogram. Participants undergo the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Campath administration: Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 1 to 1-1/2&#xD;
           weeks for intravenous infusions of Campath, given every other day for a total of 4&#xD;
           infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits after infusions: Patients are monitored for up to 1 year with periodic&#xD;
           blood tests, physical and neurological examinations, medical history, muscle strength&#xD;
           measurements, and a review of symptoms, including the ability to perform daily living&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymphapheresis: Patients undergo this procedure for collecting large numbers of white&#xD;
           blood cells twice - once at the beginning of the study and again after 6 months. Blood&#xD;
           is removed through a needle in an arm vein and flows through a machine that separates it&#xD;
           into its components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells and plasma are removed&#xD;
           and the red cells and platelets are returned to the patients through the same needle or&#xD;
           through another needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle biopsy: Muscle biopsies are done in the operating room under local anesthetic. A&#xD;
           small incision is made in the thigh or upper arm and a small piece of muscle is removed.&#xD;
           Biopsies are done at the beginning of the study and again after 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sporadic Inclusion-Body Myositis (s-IBM) is the most common muscle disease in patients above&#xD;
      the age of 50 years. It is an inflammatory myopathy mediated by sensitized, cytotoxic CD8+ T&#xD;
      cells that clonally expand in situ and invade MHC-I-expressing muscle fibers. The antigen&#xD;
      recognized by the T cells is unknown. The disease is progressive, resists the currently&#xD;
      available immunotherapies and leads to wheelchair confinement. Applying therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies with agents that deplete T cells clones and investigating the antigenic&#xD;
      specificity of the endomysial T cells is expected to enhance our understanding of the cause&#xD;
      of s-IBM and lead to clinical improvement. The present study is designed to: a) test in a&#xD;
      pilot study the safety, T cell depletion of the endomysial T cells and clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      the monoclonal antibody Alemtuzumab in 20 patients with s-IBM followed for 12 months by&#xD;
      serial quantitative assessment of muscle strength; b) explore the spectrum of the antigens&#xD;
      recognized by the T cells extracted from the muscle biopsy specimens by searching for immune&#xD;
      dominant peptides using positional scanning synthetic combinational peptide libraries, before&#xD;
      and after therapy; and c) determine the reciprocal relationship between clinical response and&#xD;
      endomysial inflammatory mediators before and after treatment. It is anticipated that the&#xD;
      study may lead to identification of putative antigens that trigger the disease, clarify the&#xD;
      significance of the inflammation and amyloid deposits in muscle fiber injury and provide a&#xD;
      novel therapy for s-IBM patients.&#xD;
