      This study will evaluate and treat children or adults with inherited or developmental eye&#xD;
      conditions. It will allow specialists in pediatric ophthalmology, genetic ophthalmology, and&#xD;
      ocular motility at the National Eye Institute (NEI) to learn more about the course of various&#xD;
      pediatric, genetic, developmental, and eye movement diseases thorough long-term observation&#xD;
      and treatment. It will also serve as the first step in determining the eligibility of&#xD;
      patients who may wish to enroll in other NEI clinical research studies or undergo standard&#xD;
      eye treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with eye conditions, especially inherited or developmental conditions, and adults&#xD;
      with eye disorders that began in childhood or that likely have a genetic or developmental&#xD;
      component may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo some or all of the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, including family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and possibly routine blood tests, x-rays tests, standard eye&#xD;
           movement recordings, questionnaires, and specialized procedures when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete eye examination, including vision test, visual perception, eye pressure (if&#xD;
           possible), dilation of the pupils to examine the back of the eye (lens, vitreous, and&#xD;
           retina).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs of the eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oculography (eye movement recordings) in patients for whom testing will aid in&#xD;
           diagnosis. This test is done either with goggles placed over the eyes or with a contact&#xD;
           lens placed on each eye. When the goggles or lenses are in place, the subject looks at a&#xD;
           series of red targets on a computer screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinography (ERG) in patients with suspected retinal degeneration. This is a&#xD;
           test of the electrical function of the eyes. Before the test, patients sit in a dark&#xD;
           room for 30 minutes with their eyes patched. A small electrode (silver disk) is taped to&#xD;
           their forehead. The eye patches are then removed, the eyes are numbed with drops, and&#xD;
           contact lenses are placed in the eyes. The contact lenses sense small electrical signals&#xD;
           generated by the retina when lights flash. During the ERG recording, the patient looks&#xD;
           inside a large empty bowl. A light flashes, first in the dark and then with a light&#xD;
           turned on inside the bowl. The test takes 1 hour or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are followed up to 6 times a year for 3 years, depending on the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to allow the pediatric ophthalmology, genetic ophthalmology,&#xD;
      and ocular motility specialists at the National Eye Institute to gain additional knowledge of&#xD;
      the course of various pediatric, genetic, developmental and ocular motility diseases.&#xD;
      Heretofore, this spectrum of diseases will be referred to as pediatric ophthalmology&#xD;
      diseases. We wish to evaluate the effects of standard treatments for these diseases, use non-&#xD;
      or minimally-invasive technologies to understand the pathogenesis of these diseases, and to&#xD;
      collect blood or other easily obtained biologic sample (e.g., urine, saliva, hair, cheek&#xD;
      swab, or stool) for future laboratory studies on these diseases. The information gained from&#xD;
      this protocol will also allow for the maintenance of populations of patients with specific&#xD;
      pediatric eye diseases and strabismus that may be eligible for future protocols. In addition,&#xD;
      by allowing for the care of patients with a spectrum of these diseases, the protocol will be&#xD;
      valuable for the training of pediatric eye disease, ocular genetics, and ocular motility&#xD;
      fellows. The pediatric, genetic, and eye movement specialists at the National Eye Institute&#xD;
      will choose ophthalmology diseases based on the training and research needs of the NEI&#xD;
      program. While the primary focus of this protocol is to study eye disease in children, adults&#xD;
      who have a disease that began in childhood or who may have an inherited eye disease or are&#xD;
      unaffected first-degree relatives may also be evaluated under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments. Any evaluation of treatments under&#xD;
      this protocol will be based on the standard-of-care for each patient's disease. All&#xD;
      alternatives for evaluation and care will be reviewed with each patient and the patient's&#xD;
      family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for potential&#xD;
      eligibility in any new NEI clinical trials or epidemiological protocols as they are&#xD;
      developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in a new protocol. However, they&#xD;
      will not be required to enter any new protocol and their decision to participate will be&#xD;
      entirely voluntary.&#xD;
