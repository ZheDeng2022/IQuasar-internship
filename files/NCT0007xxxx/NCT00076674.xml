      This study will evaluate the effects of levetiracetam (Keppra (Trademark) on Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease symptoms and on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of&#xD;
      long-term treatment with levodopa. Levetiracetam blocks certain protein receptors on brain&#xD;
      cells and thus can change the spread of brain signals believed to be affected in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 30 and 80 years of age with relatively advanced Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
      dyskinesias due to levodopa therapy may be eligible for this 6-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and baseline evaluation - Participants are evaluated with a medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination and neurologic evaluation, blood tests, urinalysis, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (EKG), 24-hour holter monitor (heart monitoring), and cardiology consultation. A chest x-ray&#xD;
      and MRI or CT scan of the brain are done if needed. If possible, patients stop taking all&#xD;
      antiparkinsonian medications except levodopa (Sinemet) for one month (2 months if taking&#xD;
      Selegiline) before the study begins and throughout its duration. (If necessary, patients may&#xD;
      use short-acting agents, such as Mirapex, Requip or Amantadine.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-finding phase - Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2 to 3 days for a&#xD;
      levodopa &quot;dose-finding&quot; procedure. For this test, patients stop taking Sinemet and instead&#xD;
      have levodopa infused through a vein. During the infusions, the drug dose is increased slowly&#xD;
      until parkinsonian symptoms improve or unacceptable side effects occur or the maximum study&#xD;
      dose is reached. Symptoms are monitored frequently. (Patients who have had dosing infusions&#xD;
      in the last 3 months do not have to undergo this phase of the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active study phase - Patients are randomly assigned to take levetiracetam or placebo (&quot;sugar&#xD;
      pill&quot;) twice a day for 6 weeks. At the end of weeks 1, 2 4, and 5, patients come to the&#xD;
      clinic for blood tests, an EKG, and a review of adverse side effects. At the end of weeks 3&#xD;
      and 6, patients are hospitalized to study the response to treatment. They again stop taking&#xD;
      Sinemet and selegiline and their ability to perform motor tasks is evaluated. They are then&#xD;
      placed on an L-dopa infusion for 10 hours. Placebo may be infused at various times instead of&#xD;
      L-dopa. Motor symptoms are evaluated several times during the infusion. Blood is drawn once&#xD;
      during the infusion for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture - Patients undergo a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) at the end of weeks 1 and 4&#xD;
      to measure certain brain chemicals and drug levels. For this test, a local anesthetic is&#xD;
      given and a needle is inserted in the space between the vertebrae in the lower back. About 2&#xD;
      tablespoons of fluid is collected through the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - Patients with changing disease activity may undergo MRIs&#xD;
      at baseline, at the end of week 1 and at the end of the study to show changes in the brain.&#xD;
      The patient lies in a narrow cylinder (the scanner) that uses radio waves and a magnetic&#xD;
      field to produce images of the brain, which show structural and chemical changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up - 2 weeks after the study ends, patients are contacted by phone for a review of&#xD;
      side effects or they return to the clinic for an evaluation.&#xD;

      Introduction: Parkinson's disease is a progressive degenerative disease of unknown etiology.&#xD;
      Its treatment has been symptomatic and the most successful approach has been to replace the&#xD;
      missing dopamine through administration of its precursor levodopa. As the disease progresses&#xD;
      the usefulness of this approach gradually diminishes and motor complications become a source&#xD;
      of significant disability. Although a number of pharmacological strategies have attempted to&#xD;
      improve this situation, none has yet proven fully satisfactory. The mechanism by which&#xD;
      levetiracetam exerts this beneficial effect is unknown. Recently, in a PD monkey model&#xD;
      levetiracetam was found to moderate dyskinesias and other motor complications, possibly due&#xD;
      to its effects on striatal GABAergic transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the acute ability of levetiracetam to safely ameliorate&#xD;
      dopaminomimetic-treatment-associated dyskinesias and related motor complications in&#xD;
      parkinsonian patients without compromising the antiparkinsonian response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 22 moderately advanced parkinsonian patients will be enrolled into a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind proof-of-principle study. Levetiracetam efficacy&#xD;
      will be assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored&#xD;
      by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Risks and Benefits: The potential risks associated with this study amount to only&#xD;
      a minor increase over minimal risk and are primarily associated with adverse reactions to the&#xD;
      medications involved. Levetiracetam is a marketed drug with a wide margin of safety. Patients&#xD;
      receiving drug could benefit from improvement of their symptoms, those on placebo will also&#xD;
      have their medications adjusted, leading to an improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Estimate and Potential Meaning for the Field: This study should further the&#xD;
      understanding of mechanisms contributing to motor disability in patients with PD that may&#xD;
      lead to the development of improved therapeutic interventions for this disorder and for&#xD;
      associated motor response complications.&#xD;
