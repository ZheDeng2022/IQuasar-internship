  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients that have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This research study&#xD;
      aims to determine the safety and dosage of special cells that may make the patients own&#xD;
      immune system fight the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, we will put a special gene into cancer cells that have been taken from the&#xD;
      patients body. This will be done in the laboratory. This gene will make the cells produce&#xD;
      interleukin 2 (IL-2), which is a natural substance that may help the immune system kill&#xD;
      cancer cells. Additionally, we will stimulate the cancer cells with another natural protein&#xD;
      called CD40 ligand (CD40L), which experiments in animal and human cells in vitro demonstrated&#xD;
      can help IL-2 perform better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of these cells will then be put back into the patient's body. Studies of cancers in&#xD;
      animals and in cancer cells that are grown in laboratories suggest that combining substances&#xD;
      like IL-2 and CD40L helps the body kill cancer cells. An experimental treatment similar to&#xD;
      this has already been used in children and similar experimental treatments are being used in&#xD;
      adults with other cancers.&#xD;

      This is a phase I trial to assess the safety of a dose escalation of hCD40L-expressing&#xD;
      autologous tumor cells with a fixed dose of recombinant hIL-2 gene transduced autologous&#xD;
      leukemic blasts. All eligible patients will be treated with a minimum of three and up to six&#xD;
      injections. There will be no use of placebo or control subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Patients may be treated with a minimum of 3-6 injections of their IL-2-secreting and CD40L-expressing autologous B-CLL cells, separated by one to two weeks in an immunological treatment window. Any patient whose disease regresses after the administration of 6 injections may be offered further injections (i.e. more than 6 injections) of tumor vaccine at the dose level previously administered, if enough vaccines are available. Patients will receive a fixed dose of IL-2 secreting B-CLL cells throughout the entire treatment protocol while an escalating number of CD40L-expressing B-CLL cells will be given at each dose-level.</description>
