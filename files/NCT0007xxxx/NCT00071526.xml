  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have reported that diabetic subjects have lower plasma vitamin C&#xD;
      concentrations than non-diabetic subjects. Although urinary vitamin C loss in diabetic&#xD;
      subjects was reported to be increased in two studies, these are difficult to interpret due to&#xD;
      lack of controlled vitamin C intake, inadequate sampling, lack of control subjects, or&#xD;
      methodology uncertainties in vitamin C assay and sample processing. Consequently, it is&#xD;
      unclear whether diabetic subjects truly have both low plasma and high urine vitamin C&#xD;
      concentrations. We propose that low plasma vitamin C concentrations in diabetic subjects are&#xD;
      due in part to inappropriate renal loss of vitamin C in these subjects but not in healthy&#xD;
      controls. We will study vitamin C concentrations in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and in matched healthy research subjects. Vitamin C concentrations in plasma, neutrophils (as&#xD;
      a proxy for tissue concentrations) and in urine will be measured in outpatients. In those&#xD;
      willing to be admitted to the Clinical Center, we will measure 24-hour urinary excretion of&#xD;
      vitamin C while on a vitamin C free diet, and creatinine clearance, a measure of glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate. On day 2 of the inpatient study, subjects will receive a single 200mg dose&#xD;
      of oral vitamin C and we will measure vitamin C concentrations in frequent blood and urine&#xD;
      samples to determine the renal threshold and relative bioavailability for vitamin C. Single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will be determined in genomic DNA responsible for the two&#xD;
      proteins mediating sodium-dependent vitamin C transport, SVCT1 and SVCT2. If low plasma and&#xD;
      high urine vitamin C concentrations are found in diabetic subjects, further studies will be&#xD;
      needed to explore mechanisms and to determine recommended dietary allowances for this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We propose to study of five thousand male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and&#xD;
        65. This will include healthy subjects and subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. To be&#xD;
        included in the study, study subjects should&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  be in good general health&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have no significant illnesses that compromise clinical stability other than the&#xD;
             complications of diabetes mellitus alone or in the context of metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
             Subjects with ischemic heart disease and/or peripheral artery disease are eligible for&#xD;
             arm 1 of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have serum creatinine &lt; 2.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for healthy volunteers, be normotensive at the time of the study, with a blood&#xD;
             pressure less than or equal to 140/90&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for diabetic subjects, blood pressure less than or equal to 170/95 as long as&#xD;
             clinically stable and in usual state of health, for example, no chest pain, shortness&#xD;
             of breath, headache, syncope or fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
        The aim of this study is to determine whether diabetic subjects lose vitamin C in the urine&#xD;
        in their normal clinical condition (i.e. while on treatment) and not in the native&#xD;
        untreated state of uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Therefore the patients will not discontinue&#xD;
        medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (for arm 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  significant organ malfunction leading to clinical instability including liver disease,&#xD;
             pulmonary disease, stroke and anemia at investigator discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  serious or chronic illness or history of serious or chronic illness resulting in&#xD;
             clinical instability other than complications of diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  alcohol abuse, drug addiction or the use of illegal drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  positive HIV or hepatitis (B or C) screening tests (subjects will be notified of these&#xD;
             test results).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  presence of other concomitant conditions which in the judgment of the investigators&#xD;
             can influence vitamin C metabolism or vitamin C renal handling&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (for arms 2 and 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  significant organ malfunction leading to clinical instability including liver disease,&#xD;
             pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular&#xD;
             disease, and anemia at investigator discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  other serious or chronic illness; history of serious or chronic illness; coronary&#xD;
             artery disease, or peripheral vascular disease resulting in clinical instability&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  alcohol abuse, drug addiction or the use of illegal drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  positive HIV or hepatitis (B or C) screening tests (subjects will be notified of these&#xD;
             test results).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  presence of other concomitant conditions which in the judgment of the investigators&#xD;
             can influence vitamin C metabolism or vitamin C renal handling&#xD;
&#xD;
        For inpatient subjects, an additional exclusion criterion is consumption during the&#xD;
        hospitalization of any foods or beverages other than those in the vitamin C free diet.&#xD;
