  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety of Zenapax (daclizumab) in patients with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS). MS is thought to be caused by an over-reactive immune response. T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      (cells of the immune system), are thought to damage myelin, a substance that covers the nerve&#xD;
      and parts of the spinal cord and is damaged in patients with MS. Interleukin-2 is a natural&#xD;
      substance in the body that is necessary for the growth of T-lymphocytes. Zenapax is a&#xD;
      genetically engineered antibody that blocks the activity of interleukin-2 and thus interferes&#xD;
      with the growth of lymphocytes. Therefore, Zenapax may prevent some of the damage to myelin&#xD;
      that occurs in multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with relapsing remitting MS may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Patients with secondary-progressive or primary progressive MS may not participate.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a complete neurological and medical evaluation and review of&#xD;
      medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline evaluation: Participants have four magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans over&#xD;
           a 3-month period to assess disease activity. For the MRI scans, the patient lies on a&#xD;
           table that slides into the scanner - a narrow metal cylinder with a strong magnetic&#xD;
           field. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting between&#xD;
           45 and 90 minutes. Only patients with activity at or above a certain level are eligible&#xD;
           to continue with the treatment phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Zenapax treatment: Patients receive intravenous (through a vein) infusions of Zenapax.&#xD;
           The first two infusions are 2 weeks apart, followed by 13 monthly infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scans: Patients undergo MRI scanning before every infusion to evaluate disease&#xD;
           activity and identify new brain lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests: Blood and urine samples are collected at each clinic visit for&#xD;
           routine laboratory evaluations, immunologic study, and genetic testing to determine a&#xD;
           predisposition for responding to Zenapax treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This procedure will be done during the last month before&#xD;
           starting treatment and during the seventh month of treatment to examine immune changes&#xD;
           that occur in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which circulates through and surrounds the&#xD;
           brain and spinal cord. A local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space&#xD;
           between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. A&#xD;
           small amount of fluid is collected through the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin test: A needle is placed just under the skin is done to assess the patient's immune&#xD;
           status to common antigens such as tetanus, mumps and candida.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymphocytopheresis: Lymphocytes are collected three times - once during the last month&#xD;
           of baseline before starting treatment, once during the fifth month of treatment, and&#xD;
           once during the last month of treatment - for immunologic study. Blood is collected&#xD;
           through a needle in an arm vein in a similar way to donating blood. The blood flows from&#xD;
           the vein through a catheter (plastic tube) into a machine that separates it into its&#xD;
           components by centrifugation (spinning). The lymphocytes are removed and the rest of the&#xD;
           blood (red cells, plasma and platelets) is returned to the body, either through the same&#xD;
           needle or through another needle in the other arm.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease leading to central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss, and leads to substantial&#xD;
      disability in young adults. Existing approved treatments include interferon beta, glatiramer&#xD;
      acetate and mitoxantrone. These therapies are only moderately effective in reducing disease&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Neuroimmunology Branch (NIB) has during the last three years tested the tolerability and&#xD;
      safety of monthly intravenously administered daclizumab (Zenapax(Registered Trademark)), a&#xD;
      humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL-2 receptor alpha chain, in patients who receive&#xD;
      interferon-beta, but responded incompletely to therapy with interferon-beta. Daclizumab has&#xD;
      been well tolerated and inhibited inflammatory disease activity by almost 90%. Under an&#xD;
      amendment of this protocol, it was demonstrated that the efficacy of daclizumab is maintained&#xD;
      once interferon-beta therapy is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current trial, we will test the efficacy of daclizumab alone in relapsing-remitting MS&#xD;
      patients. This trial is a single-centre, open-label, baseline to treatment cross-over phase&#xD;
      II trial. Daclizumab will be administered intravenously at 1mg/kg bodyweight.&#xD;
      Contrast-enhancing MRI lesions will serve as the primary outcome measure in this phase II&#xD;
      trial, and a number of clinical, MRI, and immunological parameters will be measured as&#xD;
      secondary and tertiary outcomes. Daclizumab is a promising new immunomodulatory treatment for&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting MS.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PRE-TREATMENT SCREENING:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for entry into the study, patients must meet the following criteria at the&#xD;
        time of enrollment. Re-assessment of the inclusion criteria will occur on day zero of the&#xD;
        twelve-month treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Between the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with relapsing-remitting MS according to published criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EDSS score between 1.0 and 5.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients have either failed standard therapies (interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate) by&#xD;
        clinical measures, or are not eligible for standard therapies, or opted not to start or&#xD;
        continue with any of the standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are able to provide written, informed consent prior to any testing under this&#xD;
        protocol, including screening and baseline investigations that are not considered part of&#xD;
        routine patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age criteria for inclusion in this study follow those of published diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
        multiple sclerosis. Due to the uncommon occurrence of MS in individuals under the age of 18&#xD;
        and the requirement to study a large MS cohort to include these rarely occurring patients,&#xD;
        this is an appropriate lower age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient decision not to start, or not to continue with standard immunomodulatory therapy,&#xD;
        has to be made by the patient after discussing conventional treatment options to ensure the&#xD;
        patient has made an informed decision. Additionally, the consent document provided to the&#xD;
        patient will explicitly state the currently approved therapies and their potential&#xD;
        benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INITIATING THERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible to proceed to the treatment phase of the study, patients must have at least&#xD;
        two new gadolinium-enhancing lesions or greater in the four sequential baseline MRI scans&#xD;
        (average of greater than or equal to 0.5 gadolinium-enhancing lesions or more).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients can not have a relapse during 30 days before initiation of treatment. If a relapse&#xD;
        occurs during this period and eligibility criteria are otherwise fulfilled, treatment (day&#xD;
        one) will be delayed while corticosteroids are administered. If corticosteroids are&#xD;
        administered, the MRI during that period will not be considered. An additional MRI will be&#xD;
        added at 4 weeks following the completion of corticosteroids, to maintain a total of four&#xD;
        MRI's that are analyzed in the baseline period. In the event of relapse, the baseline&#xD;
        period will be prolonged, as necessary, to meet these criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PRE-TREATMENT SCREENING:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from the study if any of the exclusion criteria exist at the time&#xD;
        of enrollment. Re-assessment of the exclusion criteria will occur on day zero of the twelve&#xD;
        month treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MEDICAL HISTORY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of secondary-progressive or primary-progressive MS, as defined by published&#xD;
        diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
