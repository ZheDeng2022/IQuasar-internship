  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine age and sex differences in alcohol metabolism and the effects of&#xD;
      alcohol. Men and women differ in their ability to metabolize alcohol, possibly due to&#xD;
      differences between men and women in lean body mass, liver size, or the activity of enzymes&#xD;
      that act on alcohol in the liver. Also, older men and women are thought to be more sensitive&#xD;
      to alcohol, although the reasons for this are not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy men and women between 21 and 25 years of age and between 55 and 65 years of age who&#xD;
      are social drinkers may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with&#xD;
      questionnaires about their general and mental health, alcohol use, and family history of&#xD;
      alcohol use and problems. They will have a physical examination, electrocardiogram (EKG),&#xD;
      routine blood tests, urinalysis to test for drugs of abuse, and a blood test to study the&#xD;
      gene responsible for enzymes that metabolize alcohol. Younger women will have a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test and older women will have a test to confirm post-menopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have two study sessions at the NIH Clinical Center outpatient clinic. They&#xD;
      come to the clinic by taxi and, upon arrival, take a breathalyzer test for any measurable&#xD;
      alcohol levels. They are then given breakfast, after which two catheters (plastic tubes) are&#xD;
      placed, one in a vein in each arm. One tube is used to collect blood samples for measuring&#xD;
      hormone levels; the other is for infusing alcohol. The infusion is adjusted so that the&#xD;
      breath alcohol level is held constant for about 3 hours at a moderate level. Baseline&#xD;
      measurements are taken before the infusion begins. During and after the infusion, the&#xD;
      participants fill out questionnaires about their moods and feelings. Breath alcohol level and&#xD;
      heart rate measurements are monitored frequently. After the test, participants remain in the&#xD;
      clinic until their breath alcohol level drops below 0.02 g/L (generally 2 to 3 hours after&#xD;
      the infusion stops). They are given lunch and then sent home in a taxi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants also undergo a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to determine lean&#xD;
      body mass and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the abdomen to determine liver size.&#xD;
      For the DEXA scan, the subject lies still on a table for about 30 minutes while the whole&#xD;
      body is scanned using a small amount of radiation. For the MRI, the subject lies in a narrow&#xD;
      metal cylinder (the scanner) about 30 minutes for the scan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previous studies, including our studies using the alcohol clamp, have shown that alcohol&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics differ between women and men. Some of the factors that may contribute to&#xD;
      these sex differences in absorption, distribution and metabolism include variation in lean&#xD;
      body mass (and total body water), liver size and differences in activity or capacity of&#xD;
      alcohol metabolizing enzymes in the stomach and livers of women and men. A fundamental&#xD;
      difference between men and women is in the levels of the sex hormones estrogen and&#xD;
      testosterone, which can influence several of the above factors. Sex differences in alcohol&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and estrogen itself, have been postulated as determinants of the increased&#xD;
      susceptibility of women to alcohol-related liver disease. An additional area of interest is&#xD;
      sex- and age-related differences in sensitivity to the effects of alcohol. The elderly are&#xD;
      thought to be more sensitive to alcohol and show greater impairment than younger individuals.&#xD;
      However, it is not clear if these changes are due to pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this project are (I) to evaluate the influence of age and sex on alcohol&#xD;
      elimination rates in men and women, and (II) to determine the influence of age and sex on the&#xD;
      initial response and acute adaptation to alcohol on measures of subjective perceptions of&#xD;
      alcohol effects and heart rate. This study will be conducted in 24 young and 24 older&#xD;
      participants, with equal numbers of males and females in each group. Comparison of alcohol&#xD;
      elimination rates across these groups and correlation with liver volume and sex steroid&#xD;
      levels will provide a means to examine the influence of sex hormones, estrogen and&#xD;
      testosterone, in age-related and sex-related differences in alcohol metabolism and liver&#xD;
      volume. This study will examine age- and sex- related differences in response to alcohol on&#xD;
      subjective measures of intoxication and mood, as well as on heart-rate and&#xD;
      psychophysiological responses to emotional visual stimuli (pictures). This study will also&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of acute alcohol administration on gene expression in peripheral blood&#xD;
      cells. Findings from these studies will provide important new data regarding the role of sex&#xD;
      steroids (estrogen and testosterone) on the metabolism of alcohol, and a better understanding&#xD;
      of age- and sex-related differences in metabolic processes that may underlie medically&#xD;
      important differences in the responses of individuals to alcohol.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will be conducted in social drinkers with no current or past history of alcohol&#xD;
        dependence or alcohol abuse. Inclusion criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female participants between 21-25 years or 55-65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Good health as determined by medical history, physical exam, EKG and lab tests.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Family-history negative, i.e., no family history of alcoholism in the first-or&#xD;
             second-degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Young women will have normal menstrual cycles and will be tested during the follicular&#xD;
             phase of their cycle (within 7 days of offset of menses) and must have a negative&#xD;
             urine pregnancy (hCG) test at the start of each study session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Older women will be post-menopausal, with cessation of menses for at least 12 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment into the study, and a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
             level greater than 40 IU/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. All participants must report the absence of flushing either currently or in the past,&#xD;
             based on the Alcohol Flushing Questionnaire, assessed during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participants must have no ferromagnetic objects in their bodies which might be&#xD;
             adversely affected by MRI (e.g. surgical clips; metal fragments in any part of the&#xD;
             body; cardiac or neurological pacemaker; cochlear or eye implant) - any doubt about&#xD;
             presence of these objects will result in exclusion from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current or prior history of any disease, including cardiovascular, respiratory,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, endocrine, or reproductive disorders, or a positive&#xD;
             hepatitis or HIV test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current history of Axis-I psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current or prior history of any alcohol or drug dependence or abuse, as well as&#xD;
             non-drinkers (alcohol-naive individuals or current abstainers).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Alcohol use exceeding 14 drinks/week for males and 7 drinks/week for females, and use&#xD;
             of more than 4 drinks on any one occasion in the 6 months prior to the study.&#xD;

             replacement therapy in older female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Menstrual cycle irregularities in younger female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of prescription or OTC medications known to interact with alcohol within 2 weeks&#xD;
             of the study. These include, but may not be limited to: isosorbide, nitroglycerine,&#xD;
             benzodiazepines, warfarin, cough-and-cold preparations which contain anti-histamines,&#xD;
             codeine and/or acetaminophen, anti-depressants such as amitriptyline, clomipramine and&#xD;
