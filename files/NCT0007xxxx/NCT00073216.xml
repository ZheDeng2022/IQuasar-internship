  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prevent HIV infection, a vaccine that produces strong HIV-specific humoral (B-cell) and&#xD;
      cellular (T-cell) immune system responses is desirable. The purpose of this study is to test&#xD;
      the safety of and immune response to a novel combination HIV vaccine in HIV uninfected&#xD;
      adults. This study will also test the safety of and immune response to a protein vaccine&#xD;
      given alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The development of a vaccine eliciting HIV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses is&#xD;
      desirable for the prevention of HIV infection. This study will investigate a combination&#xD;
      vaccine regimen consisting of priming with DNA followed by boosting with a recombinant&#xD;
      envelope glycoprotein adjuvanted in MF59.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be followed for 15 months. Participants enrolled in Groups 1, 2, 3, and&#xD;
      4 will receive either the vaccine or placebo. Study visits will be completed at initial&#xD;
      entry; five visits every 14 days for the first 2.5 months; and visits at Months 4, 4.5, 6,&#xD;
      6.5, 9, 9.5, 12, and 15. All participants will undergo physical exams, urine collection, and&#xD;
      blood tests to assess safety, HIV infection, and immune responses to injections. Risk&#xD;
      reduction/pregnancy prevention counseling will be given at every study visit. Participants&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete questionnaires about outside testing and beliefs at certain&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two parts to this study. In Part A, participants will be sequentially assigned to&#xD;
      one of three groups. Each group will receive injections of different amounts of either DNA&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo at entry, Month 1, and Month 2. This is followed by identical injections&#xD;
      of glycoprotein/adjuvant or placebo at Months 6 and 9. Group 1 will receive 250 mcg each of&#xD;
      the gag and env DNA plasmid with microparticle vaccine; Group 2 will receive 500 mcg of each&#xD;
      vaccine; Group 3 will receive 1000 mcg of each vaccine. Participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      sequentially from low to high dose beginning with Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, Group 4 will begin the second part of the study simultaneously after safety review&#xD;
      of all participants in Part A. Group 4 participants will receive identical injections of&#xD;
      either DNA vaccine or placebo at entry and at Months 1, 2, 6, and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 5 will begin enrollment after enrollment is completed for Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4. Group&#xD;
      5 participants will receive identical injections of either glycoprotein/adjuvant or placebo&#xD;
      at study entry and at Months 3 and 9. There will be 11 study visits for Group 5 participants;&#xD;
      they will occur at screening, study entry, and Months 0.5, 2, 3, 3.5, 6, 9, 9.5, 12, and 15.&#xD;
      A physical exam and risk reduction/pregnancy prevention counseling will occur at all visits;&#xD;
      participants will be asked at every visit about any adverse events they may have experienced.&#xD;
      Blood and urine collection will occur at selected visits. Participants will be also asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires about outside testing and beliefs at certain visits.&#xD;
