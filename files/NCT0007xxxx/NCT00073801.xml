      This study will examine pelvic pain associated with endometriosis and explore better&#xD;
      approaches to treatment. In women with endometriosis, uterine tissue grows outside the&#xD;
      uterus. Standard treatments - altering hormone levels to prevent endometrial tissue growth or&#xD;
      surgically removing endometrial tissue - treat pelvic pain only temporarily. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the role of sex hormones, immune chemicals, stress hormones, and genes in pelvic&#xD;
      pain and determine how the nerve, muscle, and skeletal systems are involved in this pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women between 18 and 50 years of age who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. have endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. have chronic pelvic pain without endometriosis, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. have neither endometriosis nor chronic pelvic pain and are willing to have a tubal&#xD;
           ligation (Healthy Volunteer group),&#xD;
&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a questionnaire to obtain&#xD;
      information about their pain and previous treatments and related medical or social issues.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical history and physical examination, including pelvic exam, blood tests,&#xD;
           urinalysis, and diaphragm fitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questionnaires about pain, quality of life, sexuality, psychological attitudes,&#xD;
           spiritual experiences, and history of headache and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At-home monitoring for 4 to 6 weeks of pain symptoms, menstruation and spotting,&#xD;
           medicines taken, and urine collections to test for &quot;LH&quot; surge. LH is the hormone that&#xD;
           causes the ovary to release a mature egg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pre-laparoscopy evaluation to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Examination of menstrual blood collected in a diaphragm for 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood sampling to measure adrenal and pituitary hormones. For this test,&#xD;
                corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) is injected through an IV needle. Up to five&#xD;
                blood samples are drawn, starting before the injection until 45 minutes after it.&#xD;
                Blood is also collected at this time for genetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In-depth pain assessment to identify trigger points in muscles associated with&#xD;
                pelvic pain, regions of skin sensitivity, and bone pain. Some women will undergo&#xD;
                microdialysis, which uses an acupuncture-type needle to collect chemicals from two&#xD;
                different muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood sampling twice a week for 1 month to measure changes in blood substances&#xD;
                during the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood sampling after the LH surge to measure progesterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cervicovaginal lavage (washing of the cervix with saline and collecting the fluid)&#xD;
                to obtain secretions for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ultrasound of the ovaries and uterus. This examination uses a probe inserted into&#xD;
                the vagina that emits sound waves that are used to form pictures of the internal&#xD;
                structures. A small piece of uterine lining is also obtained for examination and&#xD;
                research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A visit with the members of the Pain and Palliative care service to evaluate the&#xD;
                pain in anticipation of offering other treatments for pain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPP + Endo or CPP only: Laparoscopy to look for and remove endometrial tissue. This procedure&#xD;
      is done under general anesthetic. A viewing instrument called a laparoscope is passed through&#xD;
      an incision in the belly button to look for endometriosis. If it is found, two or more&#xD;
      incisions are made in the abdomen for other instruments to remove the tissue. A small piece&#xD;
      of uterine lining is also obtained for examination and research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Volunteers: Laparoscopy to perform the tubal ligation. A tubal ligation, commonly&#xD;
      known as &quot;getting your tubes tied,&quot; is a surgical procedure for women to sterilize them. This&#xD;
      procedure closes the fallopian tubes, stopping the egg from traveling from the ovary to the&#xD;
      uterus and preventing sperm from reaching the fallopian tube to fertilize an egg. In a tubal&#xD;
      ligation, fallopian tubes are cut, burned, or blocked with rings, bands or clips. The surgery&#xD;
      is effective immediately. Tubal ligations are 99.5% effective as birth control. This&#xD;
      procedure is done under general anesthetic. A viewing instrument called a laparoscope is&#xD;
      passed through an incision in the belly button to perform a tubal ligation. Two or more&#xD;
      incisions are made in the abdomen for other instruments to perform the procedure. During the&#xD;
      laparoscopy, we will look for and remove endometrial tissue. A small piece of uterine lining&#xD;
      is also obtained for examination and research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Follow-up evaluations. Two weeks after surgery, patients return to NIH to discuss the&#xD;
      surgical findings and treatment options. Follow-up visits are then scheduled at 1, 3, and 6&#xD;
      months after surgery to complete questionnaires and determine if the treatment is working.&#xD;
      Blood samples are drawn at each visit.&#xD;

      Chronic pelvic pain associated with endometriosis is poorly understood. This study is an&#xD;
      effort to better understand pelvic pain and identify novel medical approaches for treating&#xD;
      it. Endometriosis is a very common disease of women in their reproductive years, in which&#xD;
      endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. In a recent epidemiologic study, we have shown&#xD;
      strong associations among endometriosis, fibromyalgia, and autoimmune disorders. Currently,&#xD;
      it is believed that endometriosis causes chronic pelvic pain. Yet, some women with&#xD;
      endometriosis do not have any pain and others have pain in areas unrelated to endometriosis&#xD;
      disease location. The standard approaches to treating endometriosis pain have been to&#xD;
      medically alter hormone levels to prevent endometriosis tissue growth or to surgically remove&#xD;
      endometriosis lesions. Pelvic pain is only temporarily treated by either approach, which&#xD;
      suggests that the current classification of pain, based on disease and treatment with&#xD;
      hormones or surgery is not adequate. The feeling of pain involves many complex processes.&#xD;
      Generally, women suffer more frequently from chronic, long-term, painful conditions than men.&#xD;
      This suggests that women process pain differently because of differences in sex hormone&#xD;
      levels and genes expressed in a sexually dimorphic fashion, as well as in central nervous and&#xD;
      immune system function differences. We will examine the relations among sex hormones, pain&#xD;
      processing, immune system substances and pain related genes. We will also examine changes in&#xD;
      levels of hormonal and immune substances in the blood, endometriosis lesions and normal&#xD;
      endometrial tissue. Myofascial pain has been noted in women with endometriosis and chronic&#xD;
      pelvic pain. We will study how the nerve, muscle and skeletal systems are involved in pelvic&#xD;
      pain by performing an in depth pain assessment. Finally, stress plays an important role&#xD;
      generating and perpetuating chronic pain. We will examine how the hormones related to the&#xD;
      stress response may be altered in pelvic pain.&#xD;

        We plan to study women of reproductive age with chronic pelvic pain, some of whom have&#xD;
        endometriosis and some who do not. Healthy women without chronic pelvic pain and not known&#xD;
        to have endometriosis will serve as controls. In the event that endometriosis is found at&#xD;
        laparoscopy in the control group, we will include these patients in the study as a separate&#xD;
        subset of controls. Controls may choose to complete the study, including laparoscopy with a&#xD;
        tubal ligation, complete the study without laparoscopy, or participate in an abbreviated&#xD;
        study that includes only screening and chronic stress testing. All women will be protected&#xD;
        from pregnancy by non-hormonal contraception such as barrier contraception, abstinence or&#xD;
        surgical sterilization for the duration of the study.&#xD;
