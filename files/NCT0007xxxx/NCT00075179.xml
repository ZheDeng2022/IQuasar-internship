  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the drug nesiritide (Natrecor) is&#xD;
      effective in lowering the pressure in your lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to establish that Nesiritide (Natrecor) is effective&#xD;
      in reducing pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) acutely as measured by a 20% reduction in the mean&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure. The secondary objectives will include: improvement in&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, frequency of&#xD;
      toxicity, and surgeon's willingness to proceed with operation.&#xD;

      Patients with high pressure in their lungs often have many symptoms such as, shortness of&#xD;
      breath, low energy, and fatigue. Decreasing the pressure in the lungs may help these patients&#xD;
      feel better. The drug nesiritide was designed to help treat heart failure, however, it may&#xD;
      also help to decrease the pressure in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment, you will be asked questions about your medical history and about any&#xD;
      medications you are currently taking. You will have a focused physical exam. You will have an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart). You will&#xD;
      have an ultrasound on your heart called an echocardiogram to measure the pressures in your&#xD;
      lungs and your ability to breathe will be evaluated. With the aid of the research nurse, you&#xD;
      will have a 6-minute walk test if you are able. You may stop or sit down at any time during&#xD;
      the test. This test is being done to evaluate your energy level. You will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire about your symptoms. This questionnaire will take no longer than 10&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to measure the pressure in your lungs, you will have a procedure called a &quot;right&#xD;
      heart catheterization&quot;. This is a procedure that may have been done as part of your standard&#xD;
      of care if you were not enrolled in this study. For this procedure, a small tube will be&#xD;
      placed in a vein in your neck. A longer tube will be inserted into the first tube and fed&#xD;
      through the vein and into your heart. This tube will be used to measure the pressure in your&#xD;
      heart and lungs. If the pressure in your lungs is above a certain level, you will receive&#xD;
      treatment with nesiritide during the right heart catheterization procedure. Nesiritide will&#xD;
      be given by vein over 30 minutes. After treatment, the pressure in your heart and lungs will&#xD;
      be measured again. You will be awake during this procedure and lying flat on your back. An&#xD;
      anesthetic will be used to numb the area of your neck where the tube is placed. The entire&#xD;
      procedure (including treatment) should take no longer than 2 hours. When complete, the tubes&#xD;
      will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 15 minutes of the end of the procedure, the 6-minute walk test (if you are able) and&#xD;
      the questionnaire about your symptoms will be repeated and your breathing will be reassessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also have around 2 teaspoons of blood collected for special lab tests. These tests&#xD;
      are being done to check for certain molecules in your blood. The blood that is leftover after&#xD;
      these tests may be stored in a freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 30 days after the procedure, you will have a follow-up visit scheduled or contacted by&#xD;
      phone. At this visit, you will have a complete physical exam done by the doctor, and possibly&#xD;
      have blood work done if required by the doctor as part of your routine care. There will be no&#xD;
      additional blood work done for study purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Nesiritide is FDA approved and is commercially available&#xD;
      only for the treatment of heart failure. However, the use of nesiritide in this study is&#xD;
      experimental. Around 20 patients will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
