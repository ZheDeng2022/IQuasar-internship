  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on the safety and the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      investigational vaccine for the prevention of smallpox disease. Smallpox was one of the major&#xD;
      causes of death and sickness through the first half of the 20th century, but a global program&#xD;
      of smallpox eradication resulted in the elimination of the natural disease. The last cases of&#xD;
      smallpox in the United States occurred in 1949 in Texas. Today, only laboratory workers who&#xD;
      work with smallpox-related viruses, military personnel, and health care workers are&#xD;
      vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, individuals in the US were vaccinated with a product such as Dryvax®, which&#xD;
      contains the virus vaccinia in the same family as smallpox. This virus could promote immunity&#xD;
      to smallpox, but not produce the disease itself. Although effective, these vaccines are not&#xD;
      safe to use in people with atopic dermatitis (eczema, allergic immune response to allergens),&#xD;
      children less than 1 year of age, and people with a compromised immune system, occurring in&#xD;
      certain diseases (HIV positive individuals and AIDS), and following treatment with certain&#xD;
      types of drugs. It is important to find a safe vaccine that can be used to protect people who&#xD;
      cannot receive routine vaccinia-based smallpox vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine in this study is known as Modified Vaccinia Ankara or MVA vaccine. It is the&#xD;
      objective of this study to find out if MVA vaccine is safe and effective in providing&#xD;
      immunity to smallpox. The effectiveness of this vaccine will be measured in two ways. The&#xD;
      first way is to find out if there are specific antibodies in your blood following MVA&#xD;
      vaccination. Antibodies are chemicals your body produces to fight smallpox virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second way is to see whether or not there is a typical skin reaction following&#xD;
      vaccination with a traditional smallpox vaccine, given about three months after vaccination&#xD;
      with the MVA vaccine. The typical reaction in an unvaccinated person to smallpox vaccine is&#xD;
      formation of a blister or &quot;pox&quot; which occurs at the site of vaccination. In a person with&#xD;
      immunity to smallpox the skin reaction is much less, and typically consists of a little&#xD;
      swelling at the site of vaccination.&#xD;
