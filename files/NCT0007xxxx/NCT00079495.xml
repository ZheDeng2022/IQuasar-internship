  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are studying this investigational drug treatment, comparing it with placebo, to evaluate&#xD;
      whether it is effective in reducing the number of MRI lesions with a minimum number of side&#xD;
      effects. The investigational drug will be administered in the clinic weekly for 5 injections&#xD;
      (induction phase) then monthly for 8 additional injections (maintenance phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 150 male and female patients (100 active and 50 placebo), aged 18 to 55 years,&#xD;
      with relapsing MS and at least one but no more than 10 total Gd-enhancing lesions on cranial&#xD;
      MRI scans during the run-in phase will be randomized into this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which qualifying&#xD;
      patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive active drug or placebo. Eligible patients must&#xD;
      have MS with relapse, have had one or more relapses during the prior 2 years, 1-10 gadolinium&#xD;
      (Gd)-enhancing lesions on the Run-in MRI, and an EDSS of 6.5 or less. There are exclusions&#xD;
      for certain prior MS treatments and medical / psychiatric conditions. Following a 4-week&#xD;
      run-in phase in which patients will have a baseline MRI, patients will enter a 4 week&#xD;
      induction phase, during which they will be receive injections weekly (5 doses), then a&#xD;
      32-week maintenance phase during which injections are monthly (8 doses). A final follow-up&#xD;
      visit will be conducted 4 weeks after the last injection. The primary efficacy parameter is a&#xD;
      summary change score of the mean number of total Gd-enhancing lesions at weeks 36 and 40&#xD;
      minus the mean number for the two baseline scans. Safety monitoring will include AE/SAE&#xD;
      reporting, physical exams, vital signs, ECG. CXR, laboratory tests, neurologic evaluations,&#xD;
      and systemic hypersensitivity and injection site assessments. All study medications will be&#xD;
      administered by study personnel and patients will remain under observation for a minimum of 2&#xD;
      hours post-injection. An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board will oversee the safety&#xD;
      of the trial.&#xD;
