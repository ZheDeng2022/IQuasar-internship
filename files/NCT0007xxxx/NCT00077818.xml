      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin compared to&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin (UFH) for patients diagnosed with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED). Efficacy is assessed by using a composite score consisting of&#xD;
      30-day all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and recurrent angina&#xD;
      requiring revascularization.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rest angina lasting at least 10 minutes that is highly suggestive of myocardial&#xD;
             ischemia and is not explained by trauma or obvious abnormalities on chest x-ray,&#xD;
             occurring within 24 hours of randomization;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TIMI risk score greater than or equal to 4 (a qualitative test for CK-MB or Troponin&#xD;
             may be utilized for screening purposes; however, a quantitative test must still be&#xD;
             performed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Increased bleeding risk as defined by any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ischemic stroke within the last year&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any previous hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial tumor, or intracranial aneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recent (&lt;1 month) trauma or major surgery (including bypass surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active bleeding (other than minor skin abrasions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired hemostasis including any one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt;1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Past or present bleeding disorder (including congenital bleeding disorders such&#xD;
                  as von Willebrand's disease or hemophilia, acquired bleeding disorders, and&#xD;
                  unexplained clinically significant bleeding disorders)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known or history of thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100,000/mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of thrombocytopenia with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy,&#xD;
                  heparin, or enoxaparin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Angina from a secondary cause such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  severe, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mm Hg despite&#xD;
                  treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  valvular disease&#xD;

               -  restrictive or constrictive cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  thyrotoxicosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bundle branch block not known to be old in the context of angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within the past 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A known allergy to heparin, low molecular weight heparin, pork or pork products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindications to treatment with UFH or LMWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A recent (&lt;48 hours) or planned spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thrombolytic therapy within the preceding 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other clinically relevant serious diseases, including severe liver disease or&#xD;
             renal failure [creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min], rendering implementation of the&#xD;
             protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with other investigational agents or devices within the previous 30 days,&#xD;
             planned use of investigational drugs or devices, or has previously enrolled in this&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with the protocol (e.g., has uncooperative attitude, inability to&#xD;
             return for follow-up visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study or&#xD;
             is otherwise unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A prosthetic heart valve&#xD;
