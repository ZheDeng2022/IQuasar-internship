      HIV is associated with painful peripheral neuropathy. Disability is often significant.&#xD;
      Alpha-Lipoic Acid's antioxidant properties may have benefit in this condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV is associated with painful distal peripheral polyneuropathy in up to 35-50% of those&#xD;
      without AIDS and in more than 70% of those with advanced disease. The condition is&#xD;
      progressive but may be halted with disease remission. Disability is often significant.&#xD;
      Peripheral nerve axons and sensory neuron cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia are the&#xD;
      principal targets of the process leading to symptoms. Alpha-lipoic acid occurs naturally in&#xD;
      every cell of the body. In high concentrations it acts as an anti-oxidant which regenerates&#xD;
      other anti-oxidants and promotes glutathione synthesis. Clinical studies for diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy have shown significant benefit at daily oral doses that are well-tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the effects of daily oral alpha-lipoic&#xD;
      acid supplements (600mg, three times per/day) plus standard medical care in the treatment of&#xD;
      painful HIV-associated neuropathy over a 24-week period in adult subjects. Possible benefits&#xD;
      of the study include reduction in pain and disability, reduced use of medications, and&#xD;
      enhanced cellular metabolism.&#xD;
