      Main Research Question(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the effect of continuing aspirin until the time of coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      surgery and of adding clopidogrel to aspirin after coronary artery bypass graft surgery for&#xD;
      preventing blockage of coronary grafts, heart attack, stroke, and death? To reliably answer&#xD;
      this question requires a large randomised trial. Before applying for a major grant from the&#xD;
      Canadian Institute for Health Research to do the large study we would like to perform a small&#xD;
      pilot study of 150 patients to demonstrate that it is feasible to recruit patients and to use&#xD;
      a new test called &quot;CT angiography&quot; to determine whether the bypass grafts are still working&#xD;
      or have become blocked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Why is this research important? Coronary artery bypass surgery has made a very important&#xD;
      contribution to improving the health and survival of patients with advanced coronary artery&#xD;
      disease but still has many problems. One in 10 patients experiences a heart attack at the&#xD;
      time of surgery, 1 in 20 experiences a heart attack, stroke, or death during hospitalization,&#xD;
      and 1 in 4 patients has at least 1 blocked graft within 1 year of surgery. Antiplatelet drugs&#xD;
      such as aspirin and clopidogrel are effective for preventing heart attacks, strokes and&#xD;
      deaths but aspirin is usually stopped before coronary artery bypass graft surgery because of&#xD;
      concerns about increasing the risk of bleeding. The effectiveness of the combination of&#xD;
      clopidogrel and aspirin after surgery has not been evaluated. Our pilot study will provide&#xD;
      key information about feasibility that will help us to design and perform a large definitive&#xD;
      study in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) What is being studied? We will be looking at blood flow in bypass grafts as well as the&#xD;
      occurrence of heart attack, stroke, and death. For safety we will be looking at bleeding,&#xD;
      transfusion, and need for further surgery because of bleeding. We will also perform&#xD;
      laboratory tests of platelet function to measure and compare the effect of the study&#xD;
      treatments to prevent blood clots from forming.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Platelets play a central role in the pathogenesis of ischemic complications&#xD;
      (coronary artery bypass graft occlusion, myocardial infarction, stroke) following CABG&#xD;
      surgery. Aspirin and clopidogrel used alone or in combination are effective for preventing&#xD;
      ischemic complications in a broad range of high risk patients. However aspirin is usually&#xD;
      discontinued before CABG surgery because of concerns about bleeding while the combination of&#xD;
      aspirin and clopidogrel has not been evaluated for preventing ischemic complications after&#xD;
      CABG surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The overall objectives of our research are to compare the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of aspirin vs placebo before bypass surgery, and clopidogrel plus aspirin vs aspirin&#xD;
      alone after surgery, on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. blockage of coronary artery bypass grafts, MI, stroke, or death at 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. bleeding and need for transfusion after surgery The specific objective of the present&#xD;
           pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting patients undergoing CABG&#xD;
           surgery into this study and of performing CT angiography at 30 days to determine graft&#xD;
           patency. We will also measure the effect of different antiplatelet treatments on&#xD;
           platelet function and blood markers of systemic inflammation during the first 48 hours&#xD;
           after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: This is a 2x2 factorial study of 150 elective CABG patients who will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive low dose aspirin (81mg/d) or placebo for 5 days prior to surgery and aspirin 325mg&#xD;
      loading dose followed by 81 mg/d plus clopidogrel 75 mg/d versus aspirin 81 mg/d and placebo&#xD;
      post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME: graft patency measured by CT angiography, MI, stroke, death, bleeding, transfusion&#xD;
      requirement, need for re-exploration surgery, and laboratory measures of platelet function&#xD;
      and aspirin resistance (including 11-dehydro thromboxane B2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE: This is a pilot study designed primarily to demonstrate feasibility. We propose&#xD;
      to recruit a total of 150 patients over a 12 month period (2-4 per week).&#xD;
