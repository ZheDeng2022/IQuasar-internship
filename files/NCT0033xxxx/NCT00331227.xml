  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flavonoids are one of the many classes of natural chemicals found in a variety of foods.&#xD;
      People with the highest flavonoid blood levels have the lowest rates of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. This is considered one of the reasons why high fruit and vegetable consumption is&#xD;
      associated with lower rates of heart disease, although it is not known if taking a flavonoid&#xD;
      supplement provides the same protection as eating fruits and vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a particular flavonoid supplement, called&#xD;
      Isotonix OPC-3, taken on a daily basis, will improve the function of arterial vessels.&#xD;
      Arteries normally constrict after eating a high-fat meal. This study will examine the&#xD;
      potential of the OPC-3 to lessen this constriction response. Approximately 25 people will be&#xD;
      involved in this research project and participation will last for 10 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to use a supplement made by NutraMetrix (called OPC-3), consisting of oligomeric&#xD;
      proanthocyanidins derived from grape seed, pine bark, bilberry, citrus and red wine extracts,&#xD;
      to determine effects on endothelial function, lipoproteins and inflammation. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will be endothelial function as assessed by digital response to hyperemia&#xD;
      using peripheral arterial tonometry, measured both in the fasting state and after a single&#xD;
      standardized high-fat meal, when transient dysfunction is expected to occur. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures will be the lipid profile, hs-CRP, and Lp-PLA2. The recruitment population&#xD;
      will be healthy volunteers. The design will be a randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, cross-over trial lasting 10 weeks.&#xD;
