      HYPOTHESIS: For women with pregnancies at &lt;49, 50-56, and 57-63 days gestation who receive&#xD;
      mifepristone 200 mg orally and misoprostol 800 mcg buccally at the same time, the complete&#xD;
      abortion rate 24 hours after misoprostol administration will be 90% (95% CI 78%, 97%) within&#xD;
      each gestational age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective clinical trial. Women will be enrolled such that 40 women are in each&#xD;
      of three gestational age ranges: ≤49, 50-56, and 57-63 days gestation on the day treatment is&#xD;
      initiated. Once a gestational age range includes 40 subjects, enrollment in that group will&#xD;
      be closed. Subjects will swallow mifepristone 200 mg and then place four 200 µg misoprostol&#xD;
      tablets between the check and gum (2 tablets on each side). The women will be instructed to&#xD;
      keep the tablets in place for 30 minutes; any remaining portions of the tablets will be&#xD;
      swallowed after this time. Participants will follow-up 24 hours after receiving the&#xD;
      misoprostol. Vaginal ultrasonography will be performed to assess for expulsion of the&#xD;
      gestational sac. Women who have not aborted by the first follow-up visit will be given a dose&#xD;
      of vaginal misoprostol and will return for a follow-up visit in one week. Subjects who have&#xD;
      not aborted by the two-week follow-up will be offered a surgical abortion. At each visit,&#xD;
      data will be collected on bleeding, cramping, other side effects, and medication use.&#xD;

      1. TELEPHONE SCREEN:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Initial contact will be by a phone call (or, rarely, a drop-in visit) initiated by a&#xD;
           potential study participant. A member of the research staff will advise the potential&#xD;
           participant of the study rationale, protocol, risks, benefits, and visit schedule. We&#xD;
           request a waiver of the requirement to obtain signed informed consent for the screening&#xD;
           process, which will usually take place over the phone. We believe we meet the criteria&#xD;
           for the use of this waiver because the screening procedure presents no more than minimal&#xD;
           risk of harm to the subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is&#xD;
           normally required outside of the research context. The information obtained during the&#xD;
           screening phone call is the same type of information that would be collected on patients&#xD;
           setting up an appointment for an abortion. The telephone script and screen are included&#xD;
           in Attachment 2. If the subject does not meet inclusion criteria, the information&#xD;
           collected during the screening process will be destroyed. Potential subjects interested&#xD;
           in participation will be scheduled for a screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each subject will undergo a minimum of 3 visits all of which will be performed in the&#xD;
           Family Planning Research Office at Magee-Womens Hospital. She will also receive a&#xD;
           minimum of 3 follow-up telephone calls. Those subjects who do not pass the pregnancy by&#xD;
           the first follow-up visit will be scheduled for return visits as indicated on the Study&#xD;
           Flow Sheet (see attachment) and described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SCREENING AND ENROLLMENT: Visit length 1 ½ hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. After obtaining consent for a screening ultrasound evaluation, a transvaginal and a&#xD;
                transabdominal ultrasound examination will be performed to ascertain gestational&#xD;
                age. The transvaginal ultrasound results will be used to confirm gestational age&#xD;
                and document an intrauterine gestation for the study protocol. Vaginal ultrasound&#xD;
                to confirm estimated gestational age (EGA) will use the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  EGA (days) = mean sac diameter + 3025&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  EGA (days) = embryonic pole + 4226&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Mean sac diameter ([length + width + depth]/3) should be used only when no&#xD;
                     embryonic pole is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If the ultrasound EGA is different from LMP EGA by 4 days or more, then the&#xD;
                     ultrasound EGA should be used as the study EGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Written informed consent will be obtained at the screening visit prior to any&#xD;
                research activities. The investigator or one of the co-investigators, who are&#xD;
                physicians, will sign the informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. After obtaining informed consent, a medical history and initial laboratory tests&#xD;
                (hemoglobin and blood type) will be obtained. If the pelvic examination is normal,&#xD;
                the endovaginal ultrasound confirms that the gestational age will be less than 63&#xD;
                days on the day of the mifepristone administration, and the laboratory tests&#xD;
                satisfy the entry criteria, the subject will be asked to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. A HIPAA compliant &quot;Release of Medical Records&quot; form will be signed to allow future&#xD;
                access to medical records related to any care provided during the study by another&#xD;
                health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. VISIT 1: The subject will return prior to reaching 64 days gestation. This day will be&#xD;
           considered Study Day 1. Visit length 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The research staff will administer a pre-study questionnaire. The subject will&#xD;
                complete a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Eligibility criteria will be reviewed and, if indicated by a history of bleeding&#xD;
                since screening, a vaginal ultrasound will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. A licensed clinician will distribute the medications after completion of the&#xD;
                questionnaire. The medications will be kept in a locked file in the research office&#xD;
                and a log will be generated to track medication usage, lot numbers, and expiration&#xD;
                dates. All subjects will take the mifepristone and misoprostol in front of the&#xD;
                research clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  She will receive mifepristone 200 mg orally and swallow the tablet in front of&#xD;
                     one of the researchers. THE SUBJECT CANNOT RECEIVE THE MIFEPRISTONE UNTIL A&#xD;
                     MINIMUM OF 24 HOURS AFTER COMPLETION OF THE INFORMED CONSENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Within 5 minutes of mifepristone administration, the subject will be given&#xD;
                     four 200 µg tablets of misoprostol to place between the cheek and gum (2 on&#xD;
                     each side) and to allow them to remain in that location for 30 minutes. After&#xD;
                     this time lapse, any remaining tablets will be swallowed. The subject will not&#xD;
                     need to wait in the office during the 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The subject will receive a prescription for codeine (30 mg) or hydrocodone (5 mg),&#xD;
                #20 and an instruction sheet with the phone numbers to call if she has any&#xD;
                questions or problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Rh-immune globulin will be administered if she is Rh-negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. The subject will be scheduled for follow-up 24 ± 1 hours after administration of&#xD;
                the misoprostol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. VISIT 2: 24 ± 1 hours after misoprostol administration. Visit length 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Endovaginal and abdominal ultrasound examinations will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If the vaginal ultrasound examination demonstrates a gestational sac, the&#xD;
                     subject will receive a &quot;rescue&quot; dose of vaginal misoprostol (four 200 µg&#xD;
                     tablets of misoprostol), which will be placed by the clinician. A follow-up&#xD;
                     appointment will be scheduled for study Day 15 (range Day 13-17)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If the vaginal ultrasound does not demonstrate a sac the abortion will be&#xD;
                     considered complete and telephone follow-up contacts will be the only&#xD;
                     scheduled evaluations from this point forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. All subjects will complete a post-study VAS, which will take about 5 minutes to&#xD;
                complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. TELEPHONE FOLLOW-UP #1: Study Day 8 (range Day 6-10). Call length 10 minutes. Subjects&#xD;
           will be contacted to assess their clinical status including bleeding, cramping, and&#xD;
           medication requirements. If necessary, based on the subject's responses, appointments&#xD;
           for evaluation by a clinician will be made at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. VISIT 3/TELEPHONE FOLLOW-UP #2: Study Day 15 (range Day 13-17). Visit length (if&#xD;
           required) 1 hour, call length 10 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Subjects who had expelled the gestational sac as based on prior ultrasound&#xD;
                examination will receive telephone follow-up to assess their clinical status.&#xD;
                Appointments for evaluation by a clinician will be made as necessary. A post-study&#xD;
                acceptability questionnaire will be performed with these subjects over the&#xD;
                telephone, which will take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects who had not expelled the gestational sac on prior examination will return&#xD;
                to the office for this visit. Endovaginal and abdominal ultrasounds will be&#xD;
                performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If the vaginal ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestation with embryonic&#xD;
                     cardiac activity, the subject will be offered and advised to have a surgical&#xD;
                     abortion to be done as soon as possible. After the D&amp;C, the subject will&#xD;
                     complete a 5-minute post-study acceptability questionnaire. She will also have&#xD;
                     a telephone follow-up on Study Day 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If the vaginal ultrasound shows the gestational sac to be present without&#xD;
                     embryonic cardiac activity, the subject may have a D&amp;C and complete the&#xD;
                     acceptability questionnaire or can pursue expectant management and return on&#xD;
                     Study Day 36 (range Day 32-40).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If the vaginal ultrasound demonstrates absence of the gestational sac, she&#xD;
                     will complete a post-study acceptability questionnaire at the end of her visit&#xD;
                     which will take about 5 minutes to complete and all further follow up will be&#xD;
                     performed by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. VISIT 4/TELEPHONE FOLLOW_UP #3: Study Day 36 (range Day 32-40). Visit length (if&#xD;
           required) 30 minutes-1 hour, call length 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Subjects who had expelled the gestational sac as based on prior ultrasound&#xD;
                examination or who had a D&amp;C will receive telephone follow-up to assess their&#xD;
                clinical status. Appointments to be evaluated by a clinical will be made as&#xD;
                necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If the subject must return for this visit, endovaginal and abdominal ultrasound&#xD;
                examinations will be performed. If the vaginal ultrasound shows the gestational sac&#xD;
                to still be present, the patient will be offered a surgical abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. At the completion of the surgical abortion or if the ultrasound demonstrates&#xD;
                absence of a sac, a 5-minute post-study acceptability questionnaire will be&#xD;
                performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. OTHER&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The subject will be questioned at each visit regarding side effects experienced&#xD;
                from the medications, bleeding and cramping, pain medication required, and other&#xD;
                medications used since the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If the subject does not return for a scheduled visit, she should be telephoned to&#xD;
                reschedule the visit. If the patient is unable to return for her follow-up, the&#xD;
                required information regarding bleeding history, medications, medication side&#xD;
                effects, and questionnaire answers can be obtained over the phone. If the subject&#xD;
                is unable to be reached by phone within two weeks of her scheduled visit, a&#xD;
                certified letter must be sent indicating her need to return. Subjects will be&#xD;
                considered lost to follow-up only if the final visit is not completed by the time&#xD;
                the study is closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. If the subject fails to return for her Visit 2, but returns at some later time&#xD;
                during her study participation period and is found to have a retained gestational&#xD;
                sac or continuing pregnancy on ultrasound, she may receive an additional vaginal&#xD;
                dose of misoprostol (4 tablets; up to Study Day 12) or be offered a D&amp;C (at any&#xD;
                time).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The subject will be counseled not have intercourse or drink alcohol until the&#xD;
                completion of the abortion is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Contraceptive counseling will be performed throughout the study. A method of&#xD;
                contraception should be instituted after the abortion has occurred and before the&#xD;
                subject resumes sexual activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Endovaginal ultrasound may be performed at any time other than what is required by&#xD;
                the protocol if felt to be necessary by the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Standard suction curettage will be performed for continuing pregnancy at visit 3 or&#xD;
                persistent sac at visit 4, uterine hemorrhage, or incomplete abortion.&#xD;
