    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to compare the expression of key GSK drug targets across&#xD;
      the 4 asthma phenotypes and healthy subjects and secondarily to evaluate changes in target&#xD;
      expression in response to a 2-week course of corticosteroids across the 4 asthma phenotypes.&#xD;
      Each asthmatic subject in this study will undergo two bronchoscopies. Each healthy subject&#xD;
      will undergo one bronchoscopy.&#xD;
