  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gabapentin and pregabalin are treatments for some types of neuropathic pain, including&#xD;
      postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). However, these treatments usually need to be taken 3 times a&#xD;
      day for effective pain control. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new&#xD;
      gabapentin tablet, which only needs to be taken once or twice a day, is safe and effective&#xD;
      for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to assess the relative efficacy of G-ER dosed once daily (1800&#xD;
      mg following the evening meal) or twice daily (600 mg AM/1200 mg PM), versus placebo in&#xD;
      reducing the mean daily pain score from the baseline week to the end of the efficacy&#xD;
      treatment period (Treatment Week 10) in patients with PHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy measures will include changes from baseline in mean weekly sleep&#xD;
      interference scores, Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), the Neuropathic Pain&#xD;
      Scale (NPS), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and&#xD;
      Investigator-Rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC).&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men or women 18 years or older who have experienced pain for at least 3 months after&#xD;
             the healing of a herpes zoster skin rash (typically about 4 months after the rash&#xD;
             first appears).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has pain intensity score of at least 4 on the 11-point Likert numerical rating&#xD;
             scale at screening. Potential patients should not be informed of the pain intensity&#xD;
             eligibility criterion prior to screening or randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening/randomization, and must use medically acceptable methods of birth control.&#xD;
             Acceptable methods of birth control include oral or transdermal contraceptives,&#xD;
             condom, spermicidal foam, intrauterine device (IUD), progestin implant or injection,&#xD;
             abstinence, vaginal ring, or sterilization of partner. The reason for non-childbearing&#xD;
             potential, such as bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or&#xD;
             postmenopausal for ≥ 1 year, must be specified in the patient's case report form&#xD;
             (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has a mean baseline week pain intensity score of at least 4 on the 11-point&#xD;
             Likert scale at the end of a 1-week pre-treatment period and has completed at least 4&#xD;
             days of daily pain diary entries during the baseline week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must have a minimum washout period of greater than 5 times the half-life of&#xD;
             the drug of any of the following medications: benzodiazepines, skeletal muscle&#xD;
             relaxants, orally administered steroids, capsaicin, mexiletene, centrally acting&#xD;
             analgesics (dextromethorphan, tramadol), opiates, topical lidocaine, anticonvulsants&#xD;
             and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Anticonvulsants, SNRIs,&#xD;
             opiates and benzodiazepines should be tapered appropriately, using product label&#xD;
             instructions as a guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients currently treated with gabapentin or pregabalin at screening may be eligible&#xD;
             for the study, but must have a tapering period wherein the dose of gabapentin or&#xD;
             pregabalin is reduced gradually over a period of at least 7 days plus a 2-day or 3-day&#xD;
             washout of gabapentin or pregabalin, respectively, prior to start of the baseline&#xD;
             week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have previously not responded to treatment for PHN with gabapentin at&#xD;
             doses of ≥ 1200 mg/day or pregabalin at doses ≥ 300 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who previously experienced dose-limiting adverse effects that prevented&#xD;
             titration of gabapentin to an effective dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is a nursing mother.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Patient has had neurolytic or neurosurgical treatment for PHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has severe pain from causes other than PHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has used injected anesthetics or steroids within 30 days of baseline.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Patient has an estimated creatinine clearance of &lt; 60 ml/min calculated using the&#xD;
             Cockroft Gault method. If the patient fails this criterion, the Investigator may&#xD;
             decide to conduct a 24-hour creatinine clearance test. The patient would be allowed to&#xD;
             enroll in the study if the 24-hour test result is &lt; 60 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient has had a malignancy within the past 2 years other than basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has had gastric reduction surgery.&#xD;

         13. Patient has severe chronic diarrhea, chronic constipation [unless attributed to drugs&#xD;
             that will be washed out], uncontrolled irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or unexplained&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Patient has any abnormal chemistry or hematology results that are deemed by the&#xD;
             Investigator to be clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient has a history of substance abuse within the past year.&#xD;
