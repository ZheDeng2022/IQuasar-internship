  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted in Mali, West Africa, will determine whether a new treatment regimen&#xD;
      for lymphatic filariasis can eliminate the disease more quickly than the standard regimen.&#xD;
      Lymphatic filariasis is caused by infection with very small filarial worms called Wuchereria&#xD;
      bancrofti that are spread by mosquitoes. The disease can cause swelling of the arms, legs,&#xD;
      breast and genitalia and can progress to permanent swelling of the legs or arms called&#xD;
      elephantiasis. Currently, patients in Mali are treated with a single dose of 400 mg of&#xD;
      albendazole plus two doses of 200 mcg/kg of ivermectin each year. This study will use a&#xD;
      regimen of 800 mg of albendazole twice a year plus 200 mcg/kg of ivermectin twice a year for&#xD;
      2 years. The study will see if the new regimen is more effective in lowering the numbers of&#xD;
      Wuchereria bancrofti in the blood and will examine the effects of the two treatments on the&#xD;
      adult worms living in the lymph system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people between 14 and 65 years of age who live in the Mali village of N'Tessoni and&#xD;
      are infected with Wuchereria bancrofti may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, a brief physical examination and blood tests to check for&#xD;
      infection with Wuchereria bancrofti and to measure white blood cell counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -First visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound examination to look for filarial worms in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignment to receive either standard treatment or the experimental regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receive first treatment dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -6-month visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short history, physical examination and blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second treatment dose for subjects in experimental treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -1-year visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short history, physical examination and blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second or third treatment dose, depending on treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat ultrasound in subjects whose first ultrasound detected adult worms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -18-month visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short history, physical examination and blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth treatment dose for subjects in experimental treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -24-month visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short history, physical examination and blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat ultrasound in subjects whose first ultrasound detected adult worms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Albendazole and ivermectin are currently used in combination for annual mass treatment of&#xD;
      lymphatic filariasis in Africa. Although the drugs have been donated, the cost of such&#xD;
      programs is very high and has proven to be a major impediment to the success of programs in&#xD;
      many countries with limited financial resources. Data from albendazole treatment of other&#xD;
      filarial infections and one study comparing single to multi-dose DEC/albendazole in lymphatic&#xD;
      filariasis suggest that increased dose and/or frequency of albendazole dosing may be more&#xD;
      effective in clearing microfilariae. Furthermore, the optimal dose of ivermectin for the&#xD;
      treatment of lymphatic filariasis is greater than that being used in the current mass&#xD;
      treatment program. In this study, 50 volunteers with microfilaremic Wuchereria bancrofti&#xD;
      infection will be randomized to receive standard annual therapy (albendazole 400 mg +&#xD;
      ivermectin 150 mcg/kg) or semiannual therapy with an increased albendazole dose (albendazole&#xD;
      800 mg + ivermectin 400 mcg/kg). If adequate numbers of microfilaremic subjects are&#xD;
      recruited, an additional 25 volunteers will receive annual therapy with the increased dose&#xD;
      combination. Microfilarial levels, as well as measures of adult worm burden (circulating&#xD;
      antigen, ultrasound identification of adult worm nests) will be followed every six months for&#xD;
      three years to assess the effects of the treatments.&#xD;
