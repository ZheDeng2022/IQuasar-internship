  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The currently available stock of smallpox vaccine would be insufficient in the face of an&#xD;
      incident of smallpox attack. Thus, new manufacturing methods for smallpox vaccine is urgently&#xD;
      needed because previous manufacturing methods using calf lymph are no longer acceptable in&#xD;
      the view of current standards. Recently, CJ corporation in Republic of Korea has developed&#xD;
      cell-culture derived smallpox vaccine (CJ-50300) which was manufactured by infecting MRC-5&#xD;
      cells. The aim of this phase 1 clinical trial were to assess safety, reactogenicity, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of CJ-50300.&#xD;
