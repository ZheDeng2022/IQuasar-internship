  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective treatment of neuropathic foot pain in diabetic patients is very important to&#xD;
      improve their quality of life. There are many medications used to reduce the diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathic pain, including anticonvulsants, anti-depressants or analgesics, but none is&#xD;
      universally satisfied. A few previous studies employing BOTOX® i.d. injection for control of&#xD;
      trigeminal neuralgia, post-herpes neuralgia indicate that BOTOX® was effective in controlling&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. Intradermal injection of BOTOX® to the dorsum of the foot in diabetics&#xD;
      should be effective in controlling diabetes-associated polyneuropathic pain of the foot.&#xD;

      Design: The present study is a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, cross-over study of&#xD;
      BOTOX® in diabetic neuropathic foot pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Assessment: Subjective intensity of neuropathic pain was rated by a 100 mm visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS, 0 = no pain, 100 = unbearable pain). To assess the somatosensory effect&#xD;
      of botulinum toxin, we also performed aserial somatosensory evaluations upon bilateral medial&#xD;
      (L5 dermatome) and lateral (S1 dermatome) dorsum of the feet, and bilateral medial calves (L4&#xD;
      dermatome). Tactile threshold (TT) values of were assessed by von Frey filament, applied in&#xD;
      an ascending and descending order of magnitude. The force required to bend the filaments was&#xD;
      converted to log units for further comparison. Pain threshold (PT) to static mechanical&#xD;
      stimuli was also determined by von Frey filament upon the above test sites to evaluate the&#xD;
      severity of cutaneous allodynia. All subjects underwent the subjective pain rating and&#xD;
      somatosensory evaluations (TT and PT) at baseline and each follow-up stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Treatments will consist of intradermal (i.d). injections of BOTOX® after topical&#xD;
      anesthesia over randomly selected 15 patients and saline placebo over the other 15 patients.&#xD;
      Dose will be 0.5-1U/cm2 BOTOX®, at total dose of 50 U/foot. A follow-up visit and assessment&#xD;
      will be performed at 1, 4 8, 12 weeks following treatment during which the previous tests&#xD;
      will be repeated. A cross-over of injection in the Botox group and saline group will be taken&#xD;
      at the 12th week and then repeat the assessments at 1, 4, 8, 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Comparison between treated feet and non-treated feet based on QVAS and pain&#xD;
      sensitivity test and life quality questionnaire by chi-square analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The summary of proposal is as below. Botox: 1. intradermal injection after Topical&#xD;
      anesthesia, EMLA 2. 1 cc syringe with 30-gauge needle 3. 50 U/foot 4. 12 points/foot (3×4) A&#xD;
      total of 30 cases (15 Botox group, 15 saline group and cross-over 12 weeks later)&#xD;
