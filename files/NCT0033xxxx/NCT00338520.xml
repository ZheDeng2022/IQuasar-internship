      The purpose of this study is to see if children, who develop coma from malaria, are not&#xD;
      making enough of a vitamin-like chemical, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is required for&#xD;
      the brain to function normally. This information may help to identify new ways to treat&#xD;
      malaria in the future. Study participants will include 512 children, ages 6 months to 6&#xD;
      years. Participants will be placed into one of 4 groups: well children; children with mild&#xD;
      malaria; children without malaria, but with a medical problem involving the brain that&#xD;
      requires a lumbar puncture for diagnosis (a procedure in which a needle is placed into an&#xD;
      area surrounding the spinal cord and a sample of cerebral spinal fluid is removed); and&#xD;
      children with a severe form of malaria affecting the brain called cerebral malaria. Study&#xD;
      procedures will include blood samples, urine samples and lumbar puncture, only if necessary&#xD;
      for diagnosis as part of standard practice procedures. Participants will be involved in study&#xD;
      related procedures for up to 3 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mortality in severe malaria remains between 12-30% despite antimalarial therapy. The&#xD;
      overwhelming majority of deaths from malaria occur in children in impoverished countries of&#xD;
      the world with cerebral malaria (CM) and metabolic acidosis as the most important negative&#xD;
      prognostic indicators. CM is a serious complication of falciparum malaria. It is&#xD;
      characterized by fever, coma (not attributable to hypoglycemia), seizures (not attributable&#xD;
      to febrile seizures) and abnormalities of muscle tone (rigidity, hypotonia) and body posture&#xD;
      (decerebrate, decorticate, opisthotonic posturing). This observational prospective cohort&#xD;
      study will enroll 512 Tanzanian children, 6 months to 6 years old, admitted to the hospital&#xD;
      with CM (Group 1) as defined by World Health Organization criteria and uncomplicated malaria&#xD;
      (UM-Group 2). Healthy children who are not acutely ill (healthy control, HC-Group 4) and&#xD;
      children with coma and/or central nervous system (CNS) illness not attributed to malaria&#xD;
      (NMC-Group 3) will serve as controls. Children will be recruited from 2 hospitals in Dar es&#xD;
      Salaam, Amana Hospital in the Ilala District (AHID) and Mwananyamala Hospital (MDH)in the&#xD;
      Kinondoni District. Children presenting to AHID or MDH, who are diagnosed with CM or a&#xD;
      non-malarial CNS condition will be transferred by ambulance to the Clinical Research Unit&#xD;
      (CRU) at Hubert Kairuki Memorial University (HKMU). Before transfer the child will be&#xD;
      stabilized and treatment will be initiated. A lumbar puncture will be performed. Transfer to&#xD;
      the HKMU-CRU will take place only with the parent(s)/guardian(s) permission and the parent(s)&#xD;
      and/or guardian(s) will be transferred to HKMU with the child. Comatose children admitted to&#xD;
      the hospitals will be evaluated by the house physician and/or member of the study team.&#xD;
      Febrile children admitted to the hospital with high level Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia,&#xD;
      no other cause of fever identified, nor evidence of severe malaria and no co-infection with&#xD;
      other malaria species will be enrolled in the UM group. Health control children will be&#xD;
      enrolled from outpatient well-baby clinics at AHID and MDH. All ill (groups II, III,&#xD;
      IV)children will have complete blood picture, urinalysis, blood culture, and a blood smear&#xD;
      for malaria. Lumbar puncture will be performed for diagnosis of meningitis or hemorrhage (in&#xD;
      groups I and III) if there are no contraindications (e.g. papilledema or focal neurological&#xD;
      signs suggesting a CNS mass lesion). Children will be treated according to Tanzanian&#xD;
      standards based on the initial evaluation. Those subjects agreeing to enter the study will&#xD;
      have portions of the blood, urine and CSF preserved for study purposes. Study subjects will&#xD;
      be followed from the time of hospital admission until death or 1-2 weeks post hospital&#xD;
      discharge. Primary study objectives are to: determine whether African children with cerebral&#xD;
      malaria (CM) have sufficient levels of systemic tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) by analyzing their&#xD;
      urine for metabolites of BH4; determine whether these children have sufficient levels of BH4&#xD;
      in their CNS by analyzing their cerebrospinal fluid for BH4 metabolites; and determine&#xD;
      whether these children have sufficient levels of BH4-dependent biogenic amine&#xD;
      neurotransmitters in their CNS by analyzing their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for metabolites&#xD;
      of the neurotransmitters. Secondary objectives are to: determine natural history of&#xD;
      hyperphenylalaninemia in CM and correlate with outcome (i.e., death or recovery); and&#xD;
      determine whether BH4 deficiency is due to low expression of genes encoding de novo BH4&#xD;
      synthesis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children with CM.&#xD;
