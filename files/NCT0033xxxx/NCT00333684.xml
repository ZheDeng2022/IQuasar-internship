  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate and record any changes in the Quality of Life and psychological state of the&#xD;
      affected study group following treatment with Bio-Alcamid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bio-Alcamid for restoring the natural fullness and&#xD;
      contours of the face affected by HIV drug-induced lipoatrophy. Pre-treatment classification&#xD;
      and post treatment recording of changes will be performed by, both, the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator and the Treatment Specialist and independently by a 'Blinded' Co-Investigator at&#xD;
      post treatment Week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data for Bio-Alcamid will be collected throughout the duration of the study. Safety&#xD;
      will be determined by the rates of procedure-related events and adverse experiences&#xD;
      associated with the use of Bio-Alcamid.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty (30) participants in the randomized portion of the study will be selected who have&#xD;
      been classified as having moderate to severe facial lipoatrophy based on the three&#xD;
      investigators evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will be divided into two groups -&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment Group - 15: At Day -1, the Treatment group will be established by the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent forms will be signed. At Day 0 they will complete&#xD;
      QOL Surveys and will receive treatment with Bio-Alcamid in the affected facial area(s). At&#xD;
      Day 7, they will return to complete the QOL Surveys and allow the CITS to determine if a&#xD;
      touch-up is necessary. If so, one touch-up session is permitted at week 6. The participants&#xD;
      will again complete QOL Surveys and have efficacy assessments at week 12. The Treatment Group&#xD;
      will continue with follow-up sessions at week 24, 48, 60 and at 96 weeks. Professional&#xD;
      clinical photographs will be taken at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Group - 15: At Day -1, the Control group will be established by the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent forms will be signed. At Day 0, they will complete&#xD;
      QOL Surveys. They will return for visits at baseline and week 6 as well to complete QOL&#xD;
      Surveys. At Week 12, they will complete the QOL Surveys and will receive a BA treatment. At&#xD;
      Week 13, they will return to complete the QOL Surveys and allow the CITS to determine if a&#xD;
      touch-up is necessary. If so, one touch-up session is permitted at week 18. If not, these&#xD;
      participants will again complete QOL Surveys and have efficacy assessments at week 24. The&#xD;
      Control Group will continue with follow-up sessions at week 48, 60, 96 and at 104 weeks.&#xD;
      Professional clinical photographs will be taken at each visit.&#xD;
