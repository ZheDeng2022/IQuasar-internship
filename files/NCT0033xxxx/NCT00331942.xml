      General Information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibodies are a specific response to any &quot;foreign&quot; antigen, and they are usually detectable&#xD;
      in the serum within 5-7 days after the initial exposure to it. However, there are some cases&#xD;
      where there is a suppression of the specific immune response, such as in the case of a tumor.&#xD;
      To date, there are no reports on serum antibodies that are associated to cancer. Some tumors,&#xD;
      when surgically removed and studied have been found to have both infiltrates of T lymphocytes&#xD;
      and antibodies bound to the tumor cells. These antibodies (and other specific immune&#xD;
      responses) are assumed to be formed at later stages of the tumor growth, however, even in&#xD;
      those cases, serum antibodies have not been reported (probably due to them being mostly&#xD;
      &quot;absorbed&quot; by the tumor mass).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the mutations of a normal cell that lead to a malignant cell mass involves changes in&#xD;
      the structure and function of the cells, it could be assumed that the immune system has&#xD;
      recognized some of these changes as antigenic determinates that should be responded against;&#xD;
      if so, than the suppression caused by the tumor would be the reason for the lack of&#xD;
      antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this immune suppression could be overcome, in vitro, it could lead to the formation of&#xD;
      antibodies that are not detectable in the serum (We call this process Cimmunology).&#xD;
      Identifying the structures that the antibodies bind to, and looking for a correlation between&#xD;
      the tumor pathology and the antibodies' specificity - could provide additional information&#xD;
      about the tumor - via a blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Future CAAb Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cimmunology based test is comprised of an in-vitro stimulation step and an antibody&#xD;
      detection step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assay will be used to find cancer associated antibodies in Breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of Breast cancer associated antibodies could provide the clinician with&#xD;
      additional immunological and antigenic information regarding the patient's condition or&#xD;
      medical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cimmunology process is comprised of a blood collection and processing step and an&#xD;
      incubation (in a special stimulation &quot;tube&quot; called CimTube) period in a humid, 37oC incubator&#xD;
      with 5% CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test for the detection of specific antibodies is ELISA based, and includes different&#xD;
      potentially interesting antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevant medical and pathological information, to be collected form the patient's file,&#xD;
      will enable a more detailed analysis of the test results.&#xD;

      3.0 STUDY POPULATIONS AND PATIENT SELECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.1 Breast cancer patients The study population will include subjects that have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with suspected breast cancer, i.e. positive biopsy, prior to any surgical procedure&#xD;
      (or any other anti-cancer treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.2 Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will include patients, at breast cancer centers or any other appropriate&#xD;
      care unit, with negative Mammography in the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Participating Centers&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.1 General - The study will be based on multi-centers participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.2 Locations - All sites will be within Hospitals, either in the Breast Cancer centers or&#xD;
      in the relevant specific unit which is responsible for providing care for the BC patients.&#xD;
      The minimum number of sites for the study is 2 and the max is 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Overall Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a comparative observational two-arm study, involving all consecutive&#xD;
      Breast cancer patients during the study duration, and age matched control subjects. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the CAAb test in detecting Breast&#xD;
      cancer associated antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for potential participation in the study, according to the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients recruited will be asked to sign an informed&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data on the patients will include parameters of the clinical and pathological state of&#xD;
      the patients, results of CimTube culture step and the experimental kits. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      the CAAb test will be assessed by evaluating the statistical significance of the CAAb test&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will utilize a three step group-sequential design with two interim and one final&#xD;
      analysis using the O'Brian-Fleming' boundaries. The data collection may be stopped after the&#xD;
      first or second interim analysis if the bounds are reached. This could substantially decrease&#xD;
      the number of patients and the time of the study, while just slightly increasing the maximum&#xD;
      number of patients. (See Sample size considerations below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use 1:2 ratio between cancer and control patients to decrease the necessary number of&#xD;
      cancer patients which is the main limiting factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will conduct interim analysis, following the first third and second third of&#xD;
      Breast cancer cases and the sample size will be recalculated accordingly to the obtained&#xD;
      estimates of the mean and variance of the test in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, at least 100 patients will be enrolled in the study. The control group will be of&#xD;
      200 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Study Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the hospital,&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, an identified study patient has to sign an informed consent form, and her Eligibility&#xD;
      Form filled (see appendix B), both should be bar-coded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographic and clinical information acquired from the patient's medical file,&#xD;
      including age, country of origin, medical history and results of tests done leading to the&#xD;
      diagnostic evaluation of Breast cancer (not relevant in the control group) will be recorded&#xD;
      on the appropriate, bar-coded, pre-study case report forms (see appendix C, CRF-BC and&#xD;
      CRF-BC-Control). The reports will be either electronic (a dedicated and secured internet&#xD;
      site) or via a hard copy. A hard copy of the records will be kept in the department. The&#xD;
      study is anonymous and the Department will keep the name of the patient without reveling it&#xD;
      to investigators and to the study sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Sponsor will provide the tubes and the barcode labels for monitoring. The doctor/&#xD;
      nurse/ phlebotomist will collect three heparin vacuum tubes (20-24 ml), label (bar-code)&#xD;
      them, and fill up the initial step in the &quot;Sample follow-up form&quot; (SFF) (see appendix D). The&#xD;
      tubes with the blood will be packaged in double sealed containers (will be provided by the&#xD;
      sponsor). The department will notify the designated shipper to collect the blood up to 1 hour&#xD;
      from the time that it has been sampled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each BC sample two age matched controls (+/- 3 years) will be recruited too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transportation from the Hospital to the Handling Lab&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood will be transported at room temperature (18-250C), according to the relevant&#xD;
      regulations, to the laboratory. Transportation time will be not more than 6 hours. Times to&#xD;
      be recorded in SFF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the blood handling laboratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood handling laboratory (to be located no further than 200km from the collection site)&#xD;
      will isolate PBMC (Peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and put them into Cimmunology culture&#xD;
      within 20 hours form the sampling time (fill up time in SFF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed protocol and the Cimmunology media will be provided by Lab Discoveries to the&#xD;
      participating laboratories (where applicable). All hospitals in Israel will send the blood&#xD;
      samples to the laboratory at Lab Discoveries. After the culture step, the culture fluid will&#xD;
      be collected and frozen at -80, in properly labeled aliquots. The frozen samples will be sent&#xD;
      to the diagnostic laboratory for antibody tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the diagnostic laboratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody tests, such as ELISA, will be prepared using different antigens. The samples will be&#xD;
      tested for response to the two antigens that have been identified in the past, and for&#xD;
      additional new ones. All the data will be permanently recorded directly into a dedicated&#xD;
      computer. For each sample all antibody results will be put into the coded patient file. The&#xD;
      results will be analyzed by a statistician with expertise in cancer population studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Hospital, post surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-3 weeks after the surgery, the CRO will collect from the patient's file the results from&#xD;
      the pathology lab and any other relevant information as to the nature and state of the tumor&#xD;
      that was removed during surgery. These results will be recorded on the dedicated and secured&#xD;
      internet site and a printed bar-coded CRFs will be kept in the Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a comparative observational two-arm study, involving all consecutive&#xD;
      Breast cancer patients during the study duration, and age matched control subjects. The main&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the CAAb tests. This effectiveness&#xD;
      will be measured by the Fisher' distance (often called &quot;effect size&quot;) d defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where m1 is the mean value of the test in the controls, m2 is the mean value in the Breast&#xD;
      cancer patients, |m1-m2| denotes the absolute value of the difference (m1-m2), and s is the&#xD;
      common estimate of the standard deviation of the distribution of the test in one group&#xD;
      (control or Breast cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.1 Statistical Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between the presence or absence of BC and the CAAb&#xD;
      i.e. d=0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis: The expectation of the CAAb in the cancer population differ from that&#xD;
      of the control population…. i.e. m1 not equal to m2 Since the sign of the difference is not&#xD;
      important the test will be two-sided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 General Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our previous results, we assume that&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The distributions of the test results in each group are close to Normal or may be&#xD;
           transformed to the Normal by log-transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The variance of the distributions in the two groups are approximately equal&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Having in mind that this is a pilot study we will consider the results as significant if&#xD;
           the two-sided p-value is 0.1 or less. The bound 0.1 instead of 0.05 was chosen to&#xD;
           decrease the chances of random exclusion of some potentially informative tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When deciding the continuation of the study no correction for multiple comparisons is&#xD;
      assumed. However, the results will be presented without and with the correction using the FDR&#xD;
      of Benjamini&amp;Hochberg approach (Benjamini, Hochberg 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where confidence limits are appropriate, the confidence level will be 95% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3 Sample Size The sample size was calculated using relevant information from our previous&#xD;
      study on Peptides P3 and P1 and Breast cancer. There is no information in the literature&#xD;
      regarding cancer associated antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is calculated for a three step sequential group design with two sided&#xD;
      significance 0.1 and 0.05, power 0.8, for cancer : control ratio 1:2, for D of 0.5. The&#xD;
      calculations used the standard formulas for sample size necessary for comparison mean values&#xD;
      in two independent groups by t-test. The correction for a group-sequential procedure with&#xD;
      O'Bien and Fleming's test increases the numbers by 1.017 and 1.027 for significance values&#xD;
      0.05 and 0.1, that is negligible for our sample sizes. (see C. Jennison, B.W.Turnbill Group&#xD;
      Sequential Methods with Applications to Clinical Trials Chapmann&amp;Hall(2000) Boca Raton FL US&#xD;
      pp30 table 2.4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculations were done using NCSS-PASS software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4 Endpoints Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4.1 Effectiveness Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A calculated D between 0.3 and 0.5 will mark a test as non effective to be used alone.&#xD;
      However, it may be important in combination with other tests as a part of the multivariate&#xD;
      test procedure. Tests with d&lt;0.3 will be considered as non-effective. A test, or a&#xD;
      combination of tests, with d&gt;0.5 will mark the CAAb test as effective.&#xD;
