  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy (effectiveness of drug) and safety of&#xD;
      the antipsychotic paliperidone ER compared to another antipsychotic, quetiapine, and to&#xD;
      placebo in patients who are acutely ill with symptoms of schizophrenia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance), double&#xD;
      blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or&#xD;
      at what dosage), placebo controlled, parallel group study to compare the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of paliperidone ER with quetiapine in the treatment of patients who have schizophrenia and&#xD;
      are acutely ill. The duration of the study is 42 days. During the first phase (Day 0 - Day&#xD;
      14) patients receive increasing doses of the treatment to which they are assigned (starting&#xD;
      with 3mg and increasing to 9 mg or 12 mg of paliperidone ER; starting with 50 mg and&#xD;
      increasing to 600 mg or 800 mg of quetiapine; or the same number of capsules of placebo).&#xD;
      During the second phase (Day 15 - Day 42), patients continue to take the dose of medication&#xD;
      they received on day 14, but may also receive other medications if the investigator&#xD;
      determines they are needed to treat ongoing symptoms. The hypothesis of the study is that&#xD;
      paliperidone ER is better than quetiapine in the short term for treating acutely ill patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia. Primary outcome is change on the total score of the PANSS (Positive and&#xD;
      Negative Syndrome scale for Schizophrenia) in the first phase of the study (Day 0 - Day 14).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include time to response, time to readiness for discharge, and additional&#xD;
      medication use in the second phase of the study (Day 15- Day 42) for patients receiving&#xD;
      paliperidone ER compared to quetiapine. Safety of paliperidone ER compared with quetiapine&#xD;
      throughout the study (Day 0 - Day 42) will be based on reported adverse events, results of&#xD;
      laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs (blood pressure,&#xD;
      pulse, and weight), electrocardiogram, and movement disorder scales (Abnormal Involuntary&#xD;
      Movement Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, and Simpson-Angus Rating Scale). Patients may&#xD;
      participate in a pharmacogenomic (DNA) analysis, if they choose to do so. Patients receive&#xD;
      study drug by mouth for a total of 42 days. Study medications will be increased to maximum&#xD;
      tolerated doses of Paliperidone ER 9mg or 12mg/day and Quetiapine 600mg or 800mg at day 8.&#xD;
      From day 15 through day 42 (end of study) all patients will be eligible for additional&#xD;
      psychotropic medications at investigators' discretion.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             (paranoid, disorganized or undifferentiated type)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  score of &gt;=4 on at least two of a subset of selected PANSS items and a total score on&#xD;
             these five items of &gt;=17&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  score of &gt;=5 on the CGI-S (clinical global impression - severity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  body weight of at least 60kg and willing to be hospitalized for 9 days initially&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A primary active mental illness diagnosis other than schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects whose psychotic symptoms can be explained by substance intake or medical&#xD;
             illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnancy, breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a history of treatment resistance (defined by failure to respond to 2 adequate trials&#xD;

             sufficient time)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  unstable or significant medical illness that would increase risk of taking study&#xD;
