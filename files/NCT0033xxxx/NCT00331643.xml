  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well ixabepilone works in treating young patients with&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate to ixabepilone in various strata of recurrent solid malignant&#xD;
      tumors of childhood and young adulthood, including all of the following: Embryonal or&#xD;
      alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor,&#xD;
      synovial sarcoma or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, Wilms' tumor, and neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the time to progression for each tumor stratum. III. Prospectively evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and utility of automated volumetric tumor measurement in patients with measurable&#xD;
      pulmonary metastases, and descriptively compare volumetric measurements to 1-dimensional&#xD;
      (RECIST criteria) and 2-dimensional (WHO criteria) measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Define and describe the toxicities of ixabepilone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (Ewing's&#xD;
      sarcoma/ peripheral neuroectodermal tumor vs osteosarcoma vs alveolar or embryonal&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma vs Wilms' tumor vs neuroblastoma vs synovial sarcoma/malignant peripheral&#xD;
      nerve sheath tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every year for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
