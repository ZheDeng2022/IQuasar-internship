      This study will determine the optimal length of continuation treatment with fluoxetine for&#xD;
      children and adolescents with major depressive disorder, as well as the factors that may&#xD;
      contribute to positive response during acute and continuation treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious medical illness that affects all ages and populations. However, it&#xD;
      has only been within the last 10 years that sufficient attention has been devoted to&#xD;
      researching treatments for depression in children and adolescents. Symptoms of depression in&#xD;
      this age group vary, but some common signs include pretending to be sick, refusing to go to&#xD;
      school, clinging to a parent, or worrying that a parent may die. Older children may sulk, get&#xD;
      into trouble at school, act in a negative or grouchy way, or feel misunderstood. Recent&#xD;
      studies on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), one class of antidepressant&#xD;
      medications, have shown that SSRIs are effective in reducing depression symptoms. The optimal&#xD;
      duration of treatment, however, has yet to be established. This study will determine the&#xD;
      optimal length of continuation treatment with fluoxetine for children and adolescents with&#xD;
      major depressive disorder, as well as the factors that may contribute to positive response&#xD;
      during acute and continuation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will first attend three study visits over a 2-week period to&#xD;
      determine eligibility. All eligible individuals will be treated with fluoxetine for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Dosages will be determined by the study physician and will be based on clinical response to&#xD;
      treatment. Study visits will occur weekly for the first 4 weeks and biweekly for the&#xD;
      remaining 2 months. Depression symptoms, general changes, and adverse reactions will be&#xD;
      assessed. Participants whose symptoms have improved will be eligible to enter the&#xD;
      discontinuation phase of the study, which will entail random assignment to either fluoxetine&#xD;
      or placebo for an additional 24 weeks. Study visits will occur biweekly for 3 months and&#xD;
      monthly for the remaining 3 months. Depression symptoms and medication side effects will be&#xD;
      assessed at these visits.&#xD;
