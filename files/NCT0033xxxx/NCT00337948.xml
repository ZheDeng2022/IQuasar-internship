  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of epoetin alfa at a&#xD;
      starting dose of 60,000 Units (U) once every week (QW) to a target hemoglobin (Hb) of 12 g/dL&#xD;
      (Initiation Phase), followed by a dose of 60,000 U once every other week (Q2W) to maintain a&#xD;
      Hb range of 11.5 to 12.5 g/dL (Maintenance Phase) in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epoetin alfa administered three times weekly (150 U/kg) or once weekly (40,000 U) results in&#xD;
      a response rate (defined as &gt;= 2 g/dL hemoglobin (Hb) increase or Hb &gt;= 12 g/dL) of&#xD;
      approximately 65% of anemic chemotherapy patients and produces a mean hemoglobin rise of 1.8&#xD;
      g/dL. Higher weekly dosing may result in a higher response rate and a more timely mean&#xD;
      hemoglobin rise while remaining safe. Additionally, limited data are available to show&#xD;
      whether epoetin alfa maintenance therapy can be administered less frequently than weekly and&#xD;
      still maintain hemoglobin levels. This is an open label, multicenter, non-randomized study to&#xD;
      determine the safety and effectiveness of epoetin alfa given to cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy every week or every four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive up to 12 injections of epoetin alfa 60,000 U once every week (QW)&#xD;
      subcutaneously (under the skin) for up to 12 weeks. Once a patient's hemoglobin level (Hg)&#xD;
      has reached a target level of 12 g/dL, they will begin the Maintenance Phase. Patients who&#xD;
      qualify for Maintenance Phase will receive up to 6 injections of 60,000 U every other week&#xD;
      (Q2W) epoetin alfa under the skin for up to an additional 12 weeks to maintain hemoglobin&#xD;
      11.5 g/dL during chemotherapy administration. Doses will be held and adjusted downward if&#xD;
      hemoglobin level rises to &gt;13 g/dL or if a very rapid hemoglobin response occurs (e.g., an&#xD;
      increase of more than 1.3 g/dL in a 2-week period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations include clinical laboratory tests (hemoglobin and hematocrit), vital sign&#xD;
      measurements (blood pressure), and incidence and severity of adverse events. In addition, the&#xD;
      incidence of anti-erythropoietin antibodies at baseline and study completion/early withdrawal&#xD;
      will be evaluated in patients who receive multiple doses of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa). Patients&#xD;
      will receive up to 12 injections of 60,000 U once every week (QW) epoetin alfa subcutaneously&#xD;
      (under the skin) for up to 12 weeks. Once a patient's hemoglobin level (Hg) has reached a&#xD;
      target level of 12 g/dL, they will begin the Maintenance Phase. Patients who qualify for&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase will receive up to 6 injections of 60,000 U every other week (Q2W) epoetin&#xD;
      alfa under the skin for up to an additional 12 weeks to maintain hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL during&#xD;
      chemotherapy administration.&#xD;
