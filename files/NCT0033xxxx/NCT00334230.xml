      This study, conducted in collaboration with the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) in&#xD;
      Washington, D.C., will look at changes in brain activation and brain responses that occur&#xD;
      with gait (walking) training. Brain images and responses of healthy subjects are compared&#xD;
      with those of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people who have had a stroke within 3 months of starting the&#xD;
      study may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be between 18 and 80 years of age, and&#xD;
      patients must participate in NRH's walking study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke patients participate in all three study sessions described below. The first session&#xD;
      takes place before patients start the NRH walking training study, the second session takes&#xD;
      place at completion of the NRH walking study, and the third session takes place 3 months&#xD;
      after completing the NRH study. Healthy control subjects complete only the procedures in&#xD;
      session 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: Neurological examination and questionnaire to evaluate memory and attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2: Motor testing with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For this test, a wire coil&#xD;
      is held on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the coil, creating&#xD;
      a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the subject may be asked&#xD;
      to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions to help position the coil&#xD;
      properly. The stimulation may cause a twitch in the leg muscles, and the subject may hear a&#xD;
      click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: Functional MRI (fMRI). MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of&#xD;
      body tissues and organs. The subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner&#xD;
      (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur&#xD;
      during the scanning process. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans&#xD;
      lasting 45 and 90 minutes. Subjects may be asked to lie still for up to a few minutes at a&#xD;
      time and to perform movements of their foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2: motor testing with TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: fMRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2: motor testing with TMS&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to study the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      locomotor training in hemiplegic patients. The locomotor training will be performed under an&#xD;
      approved protocol already started at the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH). The overall&#xD;
      goal of the NRH protocol is to determine whether goal-directed, robotic-assisted gait&#xD;
      training is more effective than conventional gait training for facilitating the recovery of&#xD;
      stable walking patterns in hemiparetic stroke patients. We will use functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to identify changes in&#xD;
      neural networks involved in performance improvements associated with the locomoter training.&#xD;
      The relative contribution of somatosensory cortices (SI, SII) to these performance&#xD;
      improvements has not been studied. SI and SII have key roles in both storing and processing&#xD;
      sensory information. Activity in the somatosensory cortex is significantly involved in&#xD;
      controlling sensory input relevant to motor learning in health and disease. For example,&#xD;
      stroke patients with decreased sensation exhibit less recovery than those with intact&#xD;
      sensation. Sensory input is thought to play a crucial role in performance improvements&#xD;
      associated with locomotor learning. Therefore, it is likely that SI and SII activity plays a&#xD;
      major contributory role in training-dependent locomotor improvement after stroke.&#xD;
      Electrophysiological measurements can provide important insights into sensorimotor&#xD;
      integration processes in humans. Indeed, cortical facilitation induced by peripheral nerve&#xD;
      afferent input is useful to probe sensorimotor interaction in health and disease. The&#xD;
      specific hypotheses are that performance improvements with locomotor training will be&#xD;
      associated with: (a) increased sensorimotor integration as expressed by facilitation in MEP&#xD;
      size induced by peripheral nerve stimulation, and (b) greater processing in somatosensory&#xD;
      regions, expressed as increased fMRI activation in ipsilesional SI and SII.&#xD;
