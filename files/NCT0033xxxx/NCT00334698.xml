      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy on nasal congestion and other allergic&#xD;
      symptoms and the onset of action of an oral combination of cetirizine and pseudoephedrine in&#xD;
      comparison to the single substances under controlled pollen exposure in an Environmental&#xD;
      Challenge Chamber (ECC).&#xD;
