      Xyrem (sodium oxybate) is an agent with the propensity to improve slow wave sleep and sleep&#xD;
      efficiency. It is FDA approved to treat cataplexy (drop attacks) associated with narcolepsy&#xD;
      (sleep attacks). It has been shown to be a safe and effective agent here where deep,&#xD;
      restorative slow wave sleep improves and next day cataplexy attacks tend not to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric illness where a patient has witnessed&#xD;
      or been involved in a traumatic event. After the event is over, nightmares, flashbacks,&#xD;
      avoidance of people and places associated with trauma and hyperarousal occur which is&#xD;
      incapacitating to the patient. One major part of PTSD hyperarousal is marked insomnia with&#xD;
      multiple awakenings at night. This resultant poor sleep is compounded by use of SSRI&#xD;
      serotonergic antianxiety agents (ie Zoloft(sertraline)) as first line therapy which tend to&#xD;
      degrade slow wave, restorative sleep. Patients may respond to SSRI treatment but may fail to&#xD;
      remit as they continue to have sleep problems. PTSD patients will often fail to respond to&#xD;
      antihistamine (Desyrel (trazodone)) and benzodiazepine GABA hypnotic agents&#xD;
      (Restoril(temazepam)) and continue with poor, interrupted sleep. It is possible that Xyrem's&#xD;
      ability to remarkably improve slow wave sleep may greatly help treatment refractory insomnia&#xD;
      due to PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The author proposes an open-label study (no placebo) where 10 PTSD patients, who have failed&#xD;
      usual PTSD treatments and have failed usual insomnia treatments in particular will be given&#xD;
      Xyrem in addition to their current PTSD medication. The authors wish to determine if Xyrem is&#xD;
      a safe treatment optionin this difficult-to-treat patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (no placebo) study to see if the addition of Xyrem to a subject's PTSD&#xD;
      medication regimen will be tolerated and possibly improve insomnia. Subjects will currently&#xD;
      be taking at least a single psychotropic agent for the treatment of PTSD, (an SSRI). Dosing&#xD;
      will be stable for at least 4 weeks and subjects will need to report continued insomnia&#xD;
      despite treatment. They must also have failed at least two insomnia augmentations from&#xD;
      separate drugs classes (benzodiazepine (temezapam, zolpidem, ect.), antihistime (quetiapine,&#xD;
      mirtazapine, trazadone, etc.), dopamine antagonist (olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole,&#xD;
      etc.) to qualify for refractory insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete consenting process and attend a screening visit where they will be&#xD;
      given a MINI psychiatric diagnostic evaluation to confirm PTSD, be given a Hamilton Anxiety,&#xD;
      a Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale, PCL-C, Fatigue Severity Scale, Epworth Sleepiness&#xD;
      Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory, SF-12, and sleep diary evaluation to delineate&#xD;
      current anxiety levels (secondary measure). Subjects will have to offer consent for the study&#xD;
      team to contact their primary providers and retrieve all past and present records to show&#xD;
      refractory history and lack of substance abuse. Subjects will undergo a brief physical exam&#xD;
      and bloodwork and a sleep EEG will be ordered. Furthermore, a urine drug screen will be used&#xD;
      to screen for current misuse. If subjects are taking sleeping agents, they will be&#xD;
      appropriately washed out (tapered per cusual clinical practice and then drug free 5 times the&#xD;
      drug's half life) prior to sleep EEG and prior to Xyrem start. In clinical practice, Xyrem&#xD;
      use does not warrant blood monitoring, EEGs or EKGs per the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming subject meets eligibility, they will start Xyrem per cataplexy dosing guidelines.&#xD;
      Prior to titration, a 1-2 week washout of any sleeping agent will occur. Titration will then&#xD;
      start with 2.25g at bedtime and then again 4 hours later. This drug may be flexibly increased&#xD;
      to 4.5g (x2 doses) based upon tolerability and effectiveness. We will escalate dose if drug&#xD;
      is toleratedbut without efficacy. Dosing will be increased if subjective sleep&#xD;
      quantity/quality is still reported to be unchanged or if our rating scales indicate minimal&#xD;
      to no change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening visit 1 (eligibility, medical safety determination, washout, sleep EEG)&#xD;
      subjects will return for baseline Visit 2 and start Xyrem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be seen for Visit 3 after 7 days of treatment for rating scales and possible dose&#xD;
      escalation to 6g/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be seen for Visit 4 after 14 days of treatment for rating scales and possible dose&#xD;
      escalation to 7.5g/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be seen for Visit 5 after 21 days of treatment for rating scales and possible dose&#xD;
      escalation to 9g/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be seen for Visit 6/termination after 28 days of treatment for rating scales,&#xD;
      physical exam, lab work, sleep EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be called for final safety follow up one week later and 12 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Again, liaison with the subject's provider will occur to discuss continuance of Xyrem. If&#xD;
      provider agrees, then long term monitoring will be in the jurisdiction of this provider. If&#xD;
      agreement is to NOT continue Xyrem, patient will be tapered or offered help in finding a&#xD;
      clinician comfortable with the drug. There is no major issue in stopping this drug from a&#xD;
      withdrawal point of view as it does not build up in the system over time in regards to&#xD;
      dependence when used at bed time only. Insomnia will likely return and patient would go back&#xD;
      to their usual treatment if desired and most likely their original level of insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Measures The overall safety and tolerability of Xyrem will be assessed throughout the&#xD;
      study by adverse event recording, clinical laboratory test results and physical exams. A&#xD;
      Safety monitoring board will consist of the PI and two psychiatry attendings from University&#xD;
      Hospital&#xD;

             symptomatic for insomnia&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient has failed to respond to at least two of the following sleeping agents&#xD;
             (there must be at least two drug classes failed): true benzodiazepines hypnotics&#xD;
             (temazepam), non-benzodiazepine GABA modulating hypnotics (zaleplon dosed x2 or&#xD;
             zolpidem, an antihistamine (trazadone or mirtazapine), or an atypical antipsychotic&#xD;
             (olanzapine or quetiapine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient is in good health as determined by a medical and psychiatric history,&#xD;
             medical examination, lab tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women must be of nonchildbearing potential [i.e., postmenopausal, be surgically&#xD;
             sterile (hysterectomy or tubal ligation)] or must meet all of the following&#xD;
             conditions: using a reliable, medically accepted form of contraception for at least 60&#xD;
             days before the baseline visit, and agree to continue such use throughout the duration&#xD;
             of the study and for 30 days after the final dose of study drug. Reliable forms of&#xD;
             contraception include oral, implanted, or injected contraceptives; intrauterine&#xD;
             devices in place for at least 3 months; and adequate barrier methods in conjunction&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. The patient is a pregnant or lactating woman (women becoming pregnant during the study&#xD;
             will be withdrawn from the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has used an investigational drug within 1 month before the screening visit&#xD;
             or is participating in a concurrent clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism, or excretion (including gastrointestinal surgery) or have an explanable&#xD;
             medical condition causing insomnia&#xD;
&#xD;
        (k) The patient is unlikely to comply with the study protocol, be unreliable in providing&#xD;
        ratings, or is unsuitable for any reason, as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (l) The patient has a clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical&#xD;
        examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (m) The patient has a responsibility that would require them to wake up and perform within&#xD;
        4 hours of a Xyrem dose (n) The patient refuses to cease use of sleeping pills (o) The&#xD;
        patient has been diagnosed with sleep apnea (we will clinically prescreen for this and&#xD;
        check on initial EEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        (p) If the patient lives alone, they will need to agree to being called by a member of the&#xD;
        study team to assess the subject's well being on the morning after the first ingestion of&#xD;
        study drug and on the morning after any dose increase to monitor for excess sedation,&#xD;
        sleepwalking, etc. (q) If the patient lives with children less than 6 years of age, they&#xD;
        will not be allowed in the study.&#xD;
