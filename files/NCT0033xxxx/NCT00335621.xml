  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) take nebulised treatments to&#xD;
      ease the symptom of breathlessness, including the drug ipratropium. Nebulised bronchodilator&#xD;
      drugs are taken up to 4 times through the day, and this can take up to 15 minutes each time.&#xD;
      Although the treatment isbe effective, patients report that the time taken to set-up and use&#xD;
      the nebuliser can be a disincentive to regular use. By contrast, an inhaler device is easy to&#xD;
      use following appropriate instruction, and takes only a few seconds to administer. Inhaled&#xD;
      tiotropium is a once daily treatment taken by inhaler which has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      COPD. We wish to assess whether inhaled Tiotropium as effective as nebulised ipratropium in&#xD;
      patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tiotropium and ipratropium bromide are both antimuscarinic bronchodilators, licensed for the&#xD;
      treatment of COPD with a similar side-effect profile. Tiotropium administered by an inhaler&#xD;
      device (HandihalerÂ®) has been shown to be superior to placebo and inhaled ipratropium bromide&#xD;
      in patients with COPD, in both short term and longer term studies. The superiority of inhaled&#xD;
      tiotropium over inhaled ipratropium bromide has been demonstrated for lung function tests and&#xD;
      also for measures of health status. It is not known however if inhaled tiotropium is superior&#xD;
      to ipratropium bromide administered via a nebuliser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to examine whether inhaled tiotropium is as effective and safe as nebulised&#xD;
      ipratropium bromide in patients with chronic stable COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The study will be a randomised, crossover study. The patients will not be blinded to&#xD;
      the therapy but the technician performing the pulmonary function tests will be blinded to the&#xD;
      patients' therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration The length of the study for each patient will be 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient group Patients would be recruited from the population of patients supplied with a&#xD;
      nebuliser from the respiratory department at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Patients will be&#xD;
      identified from those regularly attending the out-patients department and who have stable&#xD;
      disease. Patients who frequently admitted to the respiratory ward with exacerbations of their&#xD;
      disease will be excluded. Patients will be recruited at the rate of 2 per week. The study&#xD;
      will be a single site study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent the patients would be asked to complete the St George's respiratory&#xD;
      questionnaire, undergo brief spirometry and a general heath/satisfaction questionnaire,&#xD;
      including the baseline and transitional dyspnoea index. Patient demographics will be&#xD;
      collected including; age, sex, duration of COPD, smoking history, height, weight, concurrent&#xD;
      therapy inhaled and oral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients would then be randomised to either remain on their nebulised ipratropium for a&#xD;
      further 6 weeks or to be commenced on inhaled tiotropium via the HandiHaler. Patients&#xD;
      commenced on tiotropium would be given instruction on how to use the new inhaler and be told&#xD;
      not to use their nebulised ipratropium. All other medication would remain the same. The&#xD;
      patients randomised to ipratropium would be instructed on continue to take their nebulised&#xD;
      ipratropium as before. All patients would be issued with a diary card on which they would&#xD;
      record their pattern of nebuliser use, symptoms, adverse events and any additional medication&#xD;
      required eg antibiotics. Patients will also be asked to record any health resource use, eg&#xD;
      visits to their GP or admission to hospital on the diary card. A compliance check in the form&#xD;
      of a capsule count will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the six weeks the patients would again undergo brief spirometry, and complete&#xD;
      the St George's respiratory questionnaire and a general health/satisfaction questionnaire. At&#xD;
      this point the patient's therapy will be crossed over, such that those who were taking the&#xD;
      inhaler would now take the nebuliser and vice versa. There will be no wash out period between&#xD;
      arms of the study, since comparisons will be made between baseline and the end of each period&#xD;
      of treatment for lung function and questionnaires, and diary cards will be analysed only for&#xD;
      the final 4 weeks of each treatment period. Those patients to commence on tiotropium would be&#xD;
      given instruction on how to use their inhaler and those restarting ipratropium would be asked&#xD;
      to take their nebulised therapy as before. All patients would be issued with a diary card on&#xD;
      which they would record their pattern of nebuliser use, symptoms, adverse events and any&#xD;
      additional medication required eg antibiotics. Patients will also be asked to record any&#xD;
      health resource use, eg visits to their GP or admission to hospital on the diary card.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the second 6-week period the patients would again complete the St George's&#xD;
      respiratory questionnaire, undergo brief spirometry and a general heath/satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire as before. A compliance check in the form of a capsule count will be&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study patients will be asked which therapy was preferred and a&#xD;
      recommendation will be made to their GP depending on their preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the patient's last dose of inhaled therapy will be recorded at the time of&#xD;
      spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient numbers The number of patients to be included in the study is 45. The patient numbers&#xD;
      are based on a 90% statistical power to detect a mean change of 0.2L in FEV1 between visits 2&#xD;
      and 3 as a result of treatment, using a 5% significance level paired test. This justification&#xD;
      is based on previous studies which conservatively indicate the standard deviation of FEV1&#xD;
      values to be 0.4L. Statistical analysis will be undertaken for differences in the mean FEV1&#xD;
      values between visits 2 and 3 using a paired design and parametric testing. Results will be&#xD;
      presented using the differences in means between treatments and the associated 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval. Other response variables will be similarly analysed for evidence of any difference&#xD;
      in treatment effect, with analysis of diary cards only for the final 4 weeks of each&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
