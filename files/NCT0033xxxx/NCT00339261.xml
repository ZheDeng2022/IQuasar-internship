      This study is a continuing follow-up of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and&#xD;
      control subjects enrolled in the Carolina Lupus Study and the University of North Carolina&#xD;
      (UNC) Lupus Nephritis Study. SLE is a severe, chronic, disabling autoimmune disease that&#xD;
      significantly affects health and quality of life. The disease most often affects young to&#xD;
      middle-aged adults, and therefore can also affect work and disability. There is currently&#xD;
      little information on work-related disability related to SLE. The goals of the current study&#xD;
      are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine health and work status of patients and controls in the Carolina Lupus Study&#xD;
           and the UNC Lupus Nephritis Study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and test methods for obtaining disease data from university- and community-based&#xD;
           physicians in the study area;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the associations between sociodemographic, work-related factors, disease damage,&#xD;
           and work disability among SLE patients and controls; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the role of demographic and socioeconomic factors, psychosocial attributes, and&#xD;
           potentially modifiable behavior or environmental factors (e.g., smoking, occupational&#xD;
           exposures, medication compliance) in disease damage measures, and in the increased&#xD;
           severity of disease among African-American patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and control subjects enrolled in the Carolina Lupus Study and the University of&#xD;
      North Carolina Lupus Nephritis Study are eligible for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in a 30-minute telephone interview that includes questions related&#xD;
      to their current health status, medical care utilization, work and disability issues,&#xD;
      psychosocial attributes (e.g., helplessness, social support), and changes in environmental&#xD;
      exposures since the previous follow-up interview in 2001. With the patients' permission,&#xD;
      disease damaged will be assessed using a standardized form to be completed by the patients'&#xD;
      physician or using information obtained from the patient's medical record.&#xD;

      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe, chronic, disabling autoimmune disease that&#xD;
      significantly affects health status and quality of life. Since the disease occurs most often&#xD;
      in young to middle-aged adults, SLE can also affect work and disability. However, there is&#xD;
      currently little information on work-related disability from longitudinal, population-based&#xD;
      studies of SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Carolina Lupus Study is a large (265 cases, 355 controls) case-control study of SLE in&#xD;
      eastern North Carolina and South Carolina. Patients were recently diagnosed (median time from&#xD;
      diagnosis to enrollment was 13 months) and were referred from university and community&#xD;
      rheumatologists (approximately 50% from each source). Controls were selected using a&#xD;
      population-based sampling method (state driver's license registries). A standardized&#xD;
      in-person interview was conducted that included demographic, reproductive, and occupational&#xD;
      histories, and a blood sample was collected from 92% of cases and 85% of controls.&#xD;
      Approximately 60% of the study patients (n=150) are African-Americans. The Carolina Lupus&#xD;
      Study cohort provides an opportunity to examine disability and disease severity measures in a&#xD;
      population-based sample of SLE patients diagnosed within a relatively short period&#xD;
      (1995-1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were enrolled into the Carolina Lupus Study between February, 1997 and July,&#xD;
      1999. We conducted two telephone contacts with patients and one telephone contact with&#xD;
      controls in a follow-up study completed in 2001. Funding for the proposed follow-up is&#xD;
      provided by The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (NIAMS), NIH&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center for Rheumatologic Diseases in African Americans&#xD;
      (Project C - Genetic and environmental influences on the development and progression of lupus&#xD;
      nephritis). Patient contact will follow an introductory letter that describes the proposed&#xD;
      follow-up study interviews which are planned to begin in late 2003. This letter provides&#xD;
      participants the opportunity (via a toll-free phone number) to decline further contact about&#xD;
      this study. The 30-minute telephone interview will cover hospitalizations, current health&#xD;
      status, work and disability issues, and changes in exposures since the 2001 follow-up&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls will not be contacted for this year's follow-up but may be contacted during&#xD;
      subsequent years. A total of 101 cases from the UNC Lupus Nephritis Study will also be&#xD;
      included in this follow-up. Disease damage will be assessed using the Systemic Lupus&#xD;
      International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage&#xD;
      Index, a standardized and validated instrument that is completed by the patient's physician.&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained before any information is obtained from the patient's&#xD;
      physician or medical record. We will seek death certificates for patients and controls who&#xD;
      have died in order to obtain cause of death information.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants to be contacted for this follow-up study are enrolled as part of the Disease&#xD;
        Progression and Activity in the Carolina Lupus Study (Protocol Number OH97-E-N002) and the&#xD;
        UNC Nephritis Study (Lupus Nephritis: Role of Environmental and Occupational Exposures,&#xD;
        Protocol Number 01-E-N154). There will be no new subject enrollment. Participants were&#xD;
        initially recruited from collaborating hospitals and physicians in North and South&#xD;
        Carolina. Recruitment ended in July, 1999.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lupus most often affects young women and this is shown by the makeup of study participants.&#xD;
        The demographics of the study participants is described in Table 2. Most CLU participants&#xD;
        were born in North or South Carolina. More than half of CLU patients are African Americans.&#xD;
        There is no involvement of special classes of subjects.&#xD;
