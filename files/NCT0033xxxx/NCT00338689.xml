      Primary hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early protein intake predicts infant growth and later risk of childhood obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Childhood obesity is a major public health problem and is an identified priority concern&#xD;
           for the health care. Infants fed formula are more likely to become obese than breastfed&#xD;
           infants. The higher protein content of infant formulae, compared with breast milk, could&#xD;
           be a causal factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will in a multicentre intervention trial on newborn infants investigate&#xD;
           whether feeding infant formulae, which differ in their level of milk proteins, can&#xD;
           influence the risk of later childhood obesity. The trial will take place in five&#xD;
           countries with different habitual total protein intakes to increase the range of protein&#xD;
           intakes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will study body composition, hormonal status, protein metabolism and&#xD;
           anthropometric markers of childhood obesity. The whole cohort will be followed up until&#xD;
           age 11 years, to assess the long term impact on the prevalence of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will explore the impact of consumer (parental) attitudes to, and&#xD;
           perceptions of, different practices of infant feeding in relation to infant behaviour&#xD;
           (satisfaction, crying, sleep duration). This consumer science information will help&#xD;
           improve the understanding of consumer (infants and parents) acceptance of and preference&#xD;
           for foods that contribute to healthy diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a relationship between early dietary protein intake and later childhood obesity risk&#xD;
           is confirmed, it offers possibilities for the prevention of obesity, for improving&#xD;
           advice given to parents and for developing nutritionally improved dietary products for&#xD;
           infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become a global epidemic and is a major health challenge for children and&#xD;
      ado-lescents in industrialised countries, with a high and steadily increasing prevalence.&#xD;
      Individual obesity risk is strongly influenced by genetic disposition and lifestyle factors.&#xD;
      But in addition, there are clear indications that metabolic events during pre- and postnatal&#xD;
      development mark-edly modulate obesity risk in later life, known as metabolic programming.&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies and animal experiments suggest a causal relationship between&#xD;
      nutrition early in life and the risk of later obesity, e.g. breast feeding seems to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One factor clearly different between breast and formula fed infants is the protein intake,&#xD;
      and thus in CHOPIN the influence of this factor will be tested by feeding in double blind&#xD;
      random-ised clinical trial two formulas with different protein content (7.3 % vs. 12 % of&#xD;
      energy) to infants from five European countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain).&#xD;
      Protein supply via formula is defined for the first year of life, while additional food is&#xD;
      only recorded. Until the age of 2 years the growth and development of the infants is followed&#xD;
      by frequent stand-ardised measurements and data on socio-economic status, parental attitudes&#xD;
      and medical his-tory are collected. The available data will be evaluated in respect to the&#xD;
      influence of protein intake and all the other factors on anthropometric markers for later&#xD;
      obesity. This seems justi-fied as the weight and length growth until the age of 2 years have&#xD;
      been shown to predict the body mass index with 14 years, suggesting that this is a suitable&#xD;
      and very early indicator for overweight later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, differences between the participating countries will be studied with the aim to&#xD;
      identify further environmental factors influencing obesity risk. On a long term base it is&#xD;
      planned to follow the study participants via mailed questionnaires until the age of eight&#xD;
      years to validate the risk estimators in a huge well defined population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the influence of the protein content of the infant formula fed during the first&#xD;
           year of life on growth until the age of two years (main outcome measures: length and&#xD;
           weight velocity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First year protein intake predicts later risk of childhood obesity ('Early protein&#xD;
           hypothe-sis'). Primary outcome measure: BMI at the age of 8 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the effects of different habitual protein intakes with traditional&#xD;
           complemen-tary feeding regimes in infants in 5 European countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination of the relationship between different types of infant feeding regimes with&#xD;
           respect to Beikost on an early anthropometric markers of later obesity development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigation of effects of these infant feeding regimes on body composition, energy&#xD;
           ex-penditure, protein metabolism, renal function and size, leptin and its binding&#xD;
           protein and on IGF-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploration of consumer attitudes and infant feeding practices in relation to parental&#xD;
           obe-sity status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigation of the mediation of the relationship between diet and later growth via&#xD;
           bio-chemical parameters, which might become detectable by the plasma concentrations of&#xD;
           the corresponding compounds at the age of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigation of the effects of infant behaviour (esp. crying, sleeping and feeding&#xD;
           behav-iour) on development of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of the weight and length development to a non randomised cohort of breast-fed&#xD;
           infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of the effects of dietary regimes on body composition measured by stable&#xD;
           dilution techniques (subgroup only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of the effects of dietary regimes on total energy expenditure and&#xD;
           exploration of relationships between TEE, body composition and obesity risk (subgroup&#xD;
           only).&#xD;
