  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feeding intolerance is a common problem in the NICU. Feeding intolerance complicates the&#xD;
      hospitalization, lengthens the hospital stay, and adds substantially to the cost of care. We&#xD;
      developed a method aimed at treating intestinal villous atrophy. We accomplished preclinical&#xD;
      testing of the product, and four Phase I clinical trials, including two at McKay-Dee Hospital&#xD;
      in 2004. Our preparation is a sterile, isotonic, solution that simulates human amniotic fluid&#xD;
      in electrolyte composition, albumin concentration, and two enterocyte growth factors that are&#xD;
      present in human amniotic fluid; erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. We&#xD;
      termed the product SAFEstart, using the acronym Simulated Amniotic Fluid for Enteral&#xD;
      administration. This trial on the efficacy and safety of SAFEstart administration as a&#xD;
      treatment for neonates who have feeding intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis is that infants with feeding intolerance, randomized to the SAFEstart will have a&#xD;
      greater enteral calories per kilogram per day for the seven days following conclusion of the&#xD;
      SAFEstart administration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Feeding intolerance is relatively common in the NICU. It can manifest as emesis, diarrhea,&#xD;
      increased abdominal girth (bloating), or in the most severe cases as necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis. Feeding intolerance complicates the hospitalization, lengthens the hospital&#xD;
      stay, and adds substantially to the cost of care. Feeding intolerance likely has many causes.&#xD;
      One cause that may be particularly common in the NICU is atrophy of the intestinal mucosa,&#xD;
      which occurs during enteral fasting (when a patient is NPO). Significant intestinal villous&#xD;
      atrophy occurs after being NPO for even 1-2 days; even if parenteral nutrition is adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We developed a method aimed at preventing intestinal villous atrophy of neonates who are NPO.&#xD;
      We accomplished preclinical testing of the product, and we completed two Phase I clinical&#xD;
      trials involving 60 neonates. Our preparation is a sterile, isotonic, solution that simulates&#xD;
      human amniotic fluid in electrolyte composition, albumin concentration, and two enterocyte&#xD;
      growth factors that are present in human amniotic fluid; erythropoietin and granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor. We termed the product SAFEstart, using the acronym Simulated&#xD;
      Amniotic Fluid for Enteral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFEstart has been tested in neonates who have never been fed, as a means of preventing&#xD;
      villous mucosal atrophy. However, it has not yet been tested in neonates who develop feeding&#xD;
      intolerance after several days or weeks of life. When feeding intolerance develops in such&#xD;
      patients, the current treatments include changing formulas, continuous feeding, but does not&#xD;
      include using SAFEstart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that SAFEstart administration, 2.5 mL/kg enterally every three hours as we&#xD;
      have previously done with preterm neonates beginning on the first day of life, would provide&#xD;
      benefit to these older neonates with acquired feeding intolerance. If such infants have&#xD;
      mucosal atrophy as part of their feeding problem, the growth factors in SAFEstart might&#xD;
      indeed result in improved feeding tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a Phase II exploratory trial among 20 neonates in the McKay-Dee NICU who develop&#xD;
      the problem of feeding intolerance. Specifically, we propose that when feeding intolerance is&#xD;
      diagnosed, 20 mL/kg/day of SAFEstart will be administered (every three hour gavage or nipple&#xD;
      feedings) and that this will be continued for a period of up to one week, in an attempt to&#xD;
      resolve the feeding intolerance.&#xD;
