  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mastocytosis is a disorder characterized by presence of excessive numbers of mast cells in&#xD;
      skin, bone marrow and internal organs. It can affect both children and adults, males and&#xD;
      females and individuals from all ethnic backgrounds, although precise demographic information&#xD;
      about the affected populations is not available as it is a rare disorder. Mastocytosis in&#xD;
      children is generally limited to the skin and follows a self limited course, while it is a&#xD;
      disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell associated with somatic mutations of the c-kit gene&#xD;
      in most patients with adult-onset of disease. There is no known curative therapy for most&#xD;
      patients with systemic mastocytosis. Recent research studies identified several subtypes of&#xD;
      disease with distinct clinical and pathologic features, however, a precise understanding of&#xD;
      the incidence as well as molecular pathology of different disease subtypes is lacking. This&#xD;
      study aims to examine molecular and cellular pathological aspects of disease in patients with&#xD;
      mastocytosis and correlate findings with clinical presentation and prognosis. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo a routine history and physical examination, and diagnostic tests will be ordered as&#xD;
      dictated by each patient's clinical presentation. Blood and bone marrow will be obtained for&#xD;
      diagnostic and research purposes. Genetic analysis of the c-kit gene regulating mast cell&#xD;
      growth and differentiation will be performed. It is hoped that findings obtained from this&#xD;
      study will help to design novel therapies for mastocytosis and other disorders in which mast&#xD;
      cells play a critical role.&#xD;
