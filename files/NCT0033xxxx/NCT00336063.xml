      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given together&#xD;
      with azacitidine in treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer or nasal natural killer&#xD;
      T-cell lymphoma that has recurred (come back) at or near the same place as the original&#xD;
      (primary) tumor, usually after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected&#xD;
      or has spread to other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vorinostat and&#xD;
      azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Vorinostat and&#xD;
      azacitidine also may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Giving vorinostat together with azacitidine may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Define toxicity profile of escalating doses of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)&#xD;
      given in conjunction with a fixed dose of 5 Azacytidine (5AC) (azacitidine) in patients with&#xD;
      locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and natural killer (NK)-T cell&#xD;
      nasal lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Define the biologically optimal dose of SAHA given in conjunction with a fixed dose of&#xD;
      5AC in patients with locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NKT cell&#xD;
      nasal lymphoma based on evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic induction in tumor&#xD;
      biopsies and plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study the effect of 5AC on the pharmacokinetic of SAHA in patients with locally&#xD;
      recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the effect of SAHA on histone acetylation as measured in tumor and peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells of patients with locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma V. Assess the effect of 5AC on EBV promoter&#xD;
      demethylation as measured in tumor patients with locally recurrent and metastatic&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat (SAHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-10 and vorinostat orally (PO)&#xD;
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with responding disease may continue treatment at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
      investigator. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.&#xD;

    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat and azacitidine, defined as the dose at which less than one-third of patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (i.e., fewer than 2 of 6 patients)</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Precision of the estimated dose-response curve based on induction of lytically replicated viral particles in the plasma following treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A non-parametric and a parametric approach will be used. The non-parametric approach will entail averaging the biologic effects from the patients at each time point, plotting them versus dose, and connecting the points to get the dose-response curve. The parametric approach will use a polynomial regression model with two degrees of freedom for modeling dose. A spline model may also be used.</description>

    <description>Performed using a validated high performance liquid chromatography method. Maximum concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax will be read off the curve, terminal T1/2 will be derived using the slope of the terminal portion of the semilogarithmic concentration-time plot, incorporating at least 3 time points in the extrapolation of the curve. Area-under-the curve (AUC) (infinity) of the semilog plot will be estimated using the trapezoidal method, and oral clearance (CL/F) will be derived using Dose/AUC, volume of distribution will be calculated.</description>
