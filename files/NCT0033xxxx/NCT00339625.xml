      polyps of the large bowel. Secondary objectives of the PPT include 1) evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention program with respect to participant achievement of dietary&#xD;
      goals; 2) examining the relation of dietary change and biochemical markers in blood; and 3)&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT) is to determine whether a low fat,&#xD;
      high fiber, high vegetable and fruit eating plan will decrease the recurrence of adenomatous&#xD;
      polyps of the large bowel. Secondary objectives of the PPT include 1) evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention program with respect to participant achievement of dietary&#xD;
      goals; 2) examining the relation of dietary change and biochemical markers in blood; and 3)&#xD;
      assessing the impact of the intervention on quality of life indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nearly 60,000 men and women will die from large bowel cancer in the United States this year,&#xD;
      making it the second leading cause of death from malignant disease in this country. The&#xD;
      evidence that diet plays a key role in large bowel carcinogenesis is strong and growing. The&#xD;
      PPT was undertaken because it is unlikely, with respect to diet and large bowel cancer, that&#xD;
      any combination of further animal research, clinical investigations employing non-neoplastic&#xD;
      endpoints, or observational epidemiologic studies would be sufficiently persuasive to&#xD;
      influence public health policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large body of ecologic, analytic epidemiologic, human metabolic, and animal experimental&#xD;
      data suggests that three dietary factors increase the risk of large bowel cancer: high&#xD;
      dietary fat, low dietary fiber, and low vegetable and fruit intake. Previous dietary&#xD;
      intervention studies have generally focused on a single nutrient. The PPT is unique in that&#xD;
      three dietary factors are being investigated simultaneously through intervention with a&#xD;
      realistic, comprehensive dietary pattern change. NCI investigators adopted this multiple-goal&#xD;
      dietary intervention strategy in the PPT for several reasons: people eat foods, not isolated&#xD;
      nutrients; there may be unknown protective food constituents not encompassed in a&#xD;
      single-nutrient intervention; and there may well be important synergistic effects of various&#xD;
      food components best captured in a comprehensive, multifactor dietary pattern. Moreover, by&#xD;
      embracing three promising dietary hypotheses simultaneously, the PPT intervention is intended&#xD;
      to maximize the possibility of reducing polyp recurrence. The direct demonstration of any&#xD;
      effect of diet on the large bowel neoplastic process would be a major advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large bowel adenomas (polyps) present a unique opportunity to conduct an intervention trial&#xD;
      because of the high prevalence of these lesions in the general population (over 30% in adults&#xD;
      over 50 years of age), the high polyp recurrence rate (at least 10% annually) in those who&#xD;
      have undergone adenoma removal, and the strong link between adenomas and cancer (the&#xD;
      so-called adenoma-carcinoma sequence). It is generally accepted that large bowel adenomas are&#xD;
      an obligate precursor lesion for most large bowel cancers. An intervention reducing the&#xD;
      recurrence of large bowel polyps would thus have a strong likelihood of reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of large bowel cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PPT is a randomized, controlled trial being carried out at eight Clinical Centers in the&#xD;
      United States. The Data and Nutrition Coordinating Center (DNCC) is Westat, Inc., Rockville,&#xD;
      Maryland. The target sample size of 2000 permits the detection with 90% power of a reduction&#xD;
      of 24% in the polyp recurrence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary goals for the intervention arm are 20% of calories from fat, 18g fiber/1000 kcal,&#xD;
      and 5-8 servings of fruits and vegetables (the exact number based on caloric intake). The&#xD;
      usual (control) diet, based on data from national surveys, is expected to comprise&#xD;
      approximately 35% of calories from fat, 10-15 g per day of dietary fiber, and 3.5 servings of&#xD;
      vegetables and fruits daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall strategy for the intervention program is to reduce calories from fat and to&#xD;
      replace them with calories from fruits vegetables and grains thus increasing dietary fiber&#xD;
      intake. The intervention program, patterned after the approach used in the feasibility phase&#xD;
      of the Women's Health Trial, integrates nutrition education and behavior modification&#xD;
      techniques. Although initial counseling sessions are carried out one-on-one by the PPT&#xD;
      nutritionists, most intervention group members participate in group counseling after the&#xD;
      first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group is not offered a nutrition intervention program since the general strategy&#xD;
      adopted for this group will be minimum interference with customary diets while collecting&#xD;
      nutritional data considered necessary for appropriate comparison with the nutrition&#xD;
      intervention group. Subjects in the control group are expected to maintain their usual diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different dietary assessment instruments are used in the PPT: a modified Block/NCI Food&#xD;
      Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), Four Day Food Records (4DFR), and 24 Hour Recalls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo colonoscopy again at one (T1) and four (T4) years into the study. Over&#xD;
      280 endoscopists participating in the PPT carry out the T1 and T4 colonoscopies. Although the&#xD;
      recurrence of one or more adenomas is the primary endpoint of the study, it will also be&#xD;
      possible to relate the dietary intervention to number, size, and histotype of polyps. Because&#xD;
      some polyps (10-15%) tend to be missed at baseline, the primary analytic interval (on which&#xD;
      sample size calculations were based) is T1 through T4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of one or more adenomas at the qualifying colonoscopy--a key eligibility factor&#xD;
      for PPT--was determined by Clinical Center trial pathologists who had been previously&#xD;
      oriented by the central pathologists to PPT pathologic criteria. The number, size, and&#xD;
      location of adenomas at baseline was determined by the participating endoscopists. To&#xD;
      standardize the histologic diagnoses used in endpoint ascertainment, the PPT requires that&#xD;
      histologic type and extent of atypia be determined by the central pathologists for all&#xD;
      lesions removed at baseline, T1, and T4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood specimens are collected on all participants annually; these are analyzed on a 20%&#xD;
      participant sample (the same individuals for whom the diet records are analyzed) for lipids,&#xD;
      carotenoids, and vitamins A and E. Blood specimens are also available for other analyses&#xD;
      including hormone and molecular genetic analysis.&#xD;
