    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heart rhythm that occurs in 30% to 40% of patients&#xD;
      following heart surgery. This irregular heart rhythm, although often self-limiting, can be&#xD;
      cause for concern. AF is associated with a two-fold increase in patient complications and&#xD;
      mortality after heart surgery. During AF, the heart muscle does not contract properly causing&#xD;
      the blood flow through the heart to slow down potentially forming clots. A clot may then&#xD;
      enter the blood stream and be carried to the brain, possibly causing a stroke. Patients in&#xD;
      persistent AF require blood thinners to prevent strokes, and this carries its own bleeding&#xD;
      risks especially in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in AF after heart surgery spend twice as many days in the intensive care unit and 3&#xD;
      to 4 more days in the hospital, hence the impact on hospital resources is quite significant.&#xD;
      Various medications are used to prevent AF after heart surgery but they are unable to&#xD;
      completely prevent this complication and the medications have associated side effects. In an&#xD;
      effort to optimize the care of heart surgery patients, strategies set on eliminating the&#xD;
      onset of AF after surgery, as opposed to trying to control AF with less than effective&#xD;
      medications, is a necessity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are proposing a study to determine if isolating the misfiring areas that cause AF at the&#xD;
      time of bypass surgery in high-risk patients will decrease the occurrence of AF following&#xD;
      heart surgery. Consenting patients will be randomized to one of two groups. Group 1 will&#xD;
      undergo bypass surgery plus the additional procedure of pulmonary vein isolation and Group 2&#xD;
      will undergo bypass surgery only, without the additional procedure. Four staff cardiac&#xD;
      surgeons at the London Health Sciences Centre will perform all surgeries. Patients will be&#xD;
      seen postoperatively every six months and will be followed for a two-year period. The&#xD;
      occurrence of AF will be recorded as well as other complications and lengths of hospital&#xD;
      stay. We predict that the group with the additional pulmonary vein isolation procedure to&#xD;
      prevent AF will have a much lower occurrence of this complication. If this is found to be&#xD;
      beneficial, this will significantly decrease the complications and mortality associated with&#xD;
      heart surgery. This will have a profound effect in the delivery of care to patients with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and other forms of heart disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a well recognized postoperative complication associated with&#xD;
      cardiac surgery occurring in approximately 30% to 40% of patients. AF occurs most frequently&#xD;
      within 24 to 72 hours after surgery. Even though postoperative AF is often a short-lived,&#xD;
      self-limiting complication, it is associated with a two-fold increase in cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. Patients are often symptomatic due to irregular and/or rapid&#xD;
      ventricular rates and complain of palpitations, anxiety, and diminished physical capacity.&#xD;
      Postoperative AF is associated with increased incidence of other complications and increased&#xD;
      hospital length of stay and overall costs. Patients may also develop congestive heart failure&#xD;
      and hemodynamic instability as a result of this complication. As a result of stasis in the&#xD;
      left atrium, the risk of thromboembolic complications is increased and the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative stroke is increased. Patients with persistent AF have a 13-fold higher hospital&#xD;
      stroke rate than patients without persistent AF. Further morbidity is added in patients&#xD;
      requiring anticoagulation if AF lasts greater than 48 hours. Elderly patients requiring&#xD;
      anticoagulation have a significantly increased risk of hemorrhagic complications. The&#xD;
      incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is also increased in patients in whom AF develops after&#xD;
      cardiac operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative AF has an immense impact on both the cardiac surgery patient and hospital&#xD;
      resources. One study determined that patients developing AF after cardiac surgery spend about&#xD;
      twice as many days in the Intensive Care Unit as patients without AF, and their hospital stay&#xD;
      is extended by 3-4 days.Strategies aimed at preventing postoperative AF are necessary to&#xD;
      optimize the postoperative care of patients undergoing open heart operations. A large number&#xD;
      of clinical trials have evaluated the effectiveness of various pharmacologic modalities in&#xD;
      decreasing rates of AF following cardiac surgery. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that&#xD;
      beta blockers, sotalol and amiodarone all reduce the risk of postoperative AF with no marked&#xD;
      difference between them. However, neither agent completely eliminated the occurrence of&#xD;
      postoperative AF. In the largest available beta blocker prevention trial, metoprolol&#xD;
      decreased the prevalence of postoperative AF from 39% to 31%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of AF following cardiac surgery is not well understood, but possible etiologies&#xD;
      include rapid firing from an ectopic focus and multiple reentrant circuits within the atria&#xD;
      to propagate this rhythm. It has been discovered that in chronic and paroxysmal AF, the&#xD;
      pulmonary veins and the surrounding ostial areas frequently contain focal triggers or&#xD;
      re-entrant circuits critical to the initiation of AF. In a study of 45 patients with frequent&#xD;
      episodes of AF refractory to drug therapy, 94% of ectopic beats responsible for instigating&#xD;
      AF were located in the pulmonary veins. Studies have shown that these foci are responsive to&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation. Although it has never been used in the prevention of postoperative&#xD;
      AF, circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA) is a technique that has shown much success&#xD;
      in the treatment of AF. In CPVA, radiofrequency lesions are created around the ostia of each&#xD;
      pulmonary vein, with the aim to electrically isolate these veins from the left atrium. In one&#xD;
      study, 26 patients with resistant AF were treated with CPVA and 64% had sinus rhythm&#xD;
      restoration during ablation. In addition, 85% of patients were free of AF at 9 months, with&#xD;
      62% no longer requiring antiarrhythmic drugs and 23% taking drugs that had been ineffective&#xD;
      before ablation. Radiofrequency pulmonary vein isolation with electro-anatomic guidance is a&#xD;
      safe and effective treatment of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Medtronic has developed the Cardioblate® BP and BP 2 Surgical Ablation System&#xD;
      devices (Minneapolis, MN) to perform pulmonary vein isolation to treat AF. Vichol et al have&#xD;
      demonstrated a mean ablation time of 15.2 seconds per lesion with the use of this device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clearly evident that postoperative AF increases morbidity, length of hospital stay, and&#xD;
      costs associated with surgical coronary artery revascularization. The current prophylactic&#xD;
      agents are not completely effective at eliminating the occurrence of postoperative AF. It has&#xD;
      been shown that pulmonary vein isolation is an effective method of treating patients with&#xD;
      chronic AF. We propose a study to determine if performing pulmonary vein isolation with the&#xD;
      Cardioblate® BP 2 as an adjunct in those patients undergoing routine coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      surgery, who are at increased risk of developing postoperative AF, will significantly reduce&#xD;
      the occurrence of this complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If pulmonary vein isolation is found to considerably decrease the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      AF, the associated morbidity will also be decreased. This will have a very profound effect in&#xD;
      the delivery of care to patients with ischemic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Question/Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients at an increased risk of developing postoperative atrial fibrillation following&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting, does pulmonary vein isolation with Cardioblate® BP 2 result&#xD;
      in a decreased incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation when compared to those patients&#xD;
      that do not have this adjunct procedure?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary vein isolation with Cardioblate® BP 2 will reduce the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who are at an&#xD;
      increased risk of developing postoperative atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size A sample size of 79 patients per group was calculated to detect a reduction in&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation from 40% to 20% using a two-sided α = 0.05 and&#xD;
      a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding-The patients, outcome assessors, and data analysts will be blinded to which group&#xD;
      the patients belong. Allocation concealment will be practiced and the randomization scheme&#xD;
      will not be revealed. Due to the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to blind the&#xD;
      surgeon performing the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization is complete, the baseline demographic characteristics of all patients&#xD;
      will be recorded. Those patients randomized to the control group will undergo coronary bypass&#xD;
      grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. Those patients randomized to the experimental group&#xD;
      will undergo coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass (CABG) and pulmonary&#xD;
      vein isolation (PVI). Medtronic's Cardioblate® BP 2 will be used for the pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation. The following will take place for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will be transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit following surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiac rhythm will be monitored with telemetry in the CSRU and on the floor until&#xD;
           discharge home&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All arrhythmias will be documented with regards to onset, duration, and immediate&#xD;
           management - will be recorded by research assistant&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All patients will be started on a beta blocker on POD #1 and will continue for minimum 2&#xD;
           years if tolerable - will be discontinued if any adverse effect (i.e., heart block,&#xD;
           decreased cardiac output, allergic reaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All medications will be documented&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After discharge home, all complications and readmissions will be documented (i.e.,&#xD;
           development of atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Documentation of those patients requiring anticoagulation for persistent atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation and duration and complications related to anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow-up of patients by surgeons, cardiologist and research assistant with ECG every 6&#xD;
           months for 2 years - patients will be asked to fill out questionnaire at each visit that&#xD;
           may elicit any symptoms related to arrhythmias Outcomes Statistical Analysis All&#xD;
           outcomes will be analyzed by a biostatistician blinded to allocation groups using the&#xD;
           intention to treat principle. The primary purpose of the data analyses is to determine&#xD;
           whether pulmonary vein isolation reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who are at high risk&#xD;
           of developing postoperative atrial fibrillation. The primary outcome will be compared&#xD;
           between both groups with the Chi-square test. All patients will be accounted for and we&#xD;
           will aim for 100% follow-up for all patients.&#xD;
