  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, not amenable for curative local&#xD;
      treatment (surgery or chemoradiotherapy), has a modest life-prolonging effect and can improve&#xD;
      quality of life. There is however no potential for long-term cure for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy also produces variable and often significant toxicity. Current retrospective&#xD;
      evidence suggests that significant clinical responses can be obtained when patients whose&#xD;
      cancer cells have an EGFR TKD mutation are treated with an EGFR TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ease of administration and toxicity profile of TKI compare favourably with that of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, even single agents such as for example gemcitabine The present study will&#xD;
      establish the clinical benefit rate of TKI as a first line treatment in patients with EGFR&#xD;
      mutations and thus estimate the proportion of patients who might benefit for a prolonged&#xD;
      period from a treatment with a modest toxicity profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stage IV NSCLC and some patients with advanced locoregional disease (stage III)&#xD;
      are in general incurable and have a low probability for long-term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current systemic treatment in good PS patients (PS 0-1) consists of a cisplatin doublet (e.g.&#xD;
      cisplatin plus a second drug: vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel). The median&#xD;
      and one year survival obtained with this treatment ranges between 8-10 months and 25 - 35 %&#xD;
      respectively (1,2). Progression-free survival is a median of 5 month or less in randomized&#xD;
      studies (3). Response rates obtained are less than 25% in metastatic disease and up to 75% in&#xD;
      advanced locoregional disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKI's) are active drugs in patients with NSCLC&#xD;
      pre-treated with cisplatin and/or docetaxel containing chemotherapy (2,4). Recently it has&#xD;
      been shown that the EGFR1 kinase inhibitor erlotinib added to best supportive care (BSC)&#xD;
      prolonged survival compared to BSC alone in patients with advanced NSCLC failing 1st or 2nd&#xD;
      line chemotherapy (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small number of preliminary reports have indicated that the objective response rate with&#xD;
      these RTKI's as first line treatment in some patient populations with advanced NSCLC could be&#xD;
      around 20 % (6), The objective (mainly partial) response in the phase II studies with&#xD;
      pre-treated patients ranges from 10 - 15 % according to the level of pre-treatment but the&#xD;
      control of the disease (stable disease) and improvement of symptoms without demonstrated&#xD;
      objective response has been reported to be as high as 40 to 50 % (2,4). The addition of&#xD;
      RTKI's or placebo to the current standard doublets (e.g. cisplatin, gemcitabine or&#xD;
      taxol/carboplatin) has not been shown to impact on response rate, time to treatment failure&#xD;
      or survival in large phase III randomised trials in advanced NSCLC patients not selected for&#xD;
      EGFR expression (7,8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, mutations in the intracellular EGFR kinase domain that increase sensitivity of the&#xD;
      receptor to RTKI's have been discovered (9,10). These studies suggest that the&#xD;
      response/resistance to treatment could be strongly correlated to the presence/absence of such&#xD;
      mutations. It is presently unclear whether patients who achieve stable disease under RTKI&#xD;
      treatment do have receptor mutations, of which nature such mutations could be or what other&#xD;
      biological pathways modulate the responsiveness/resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutations have been observed in about 10 % or less of the tumours examined. Most mutations in&#xD;
      the EGFR kinase domain have been found in adenocarcinoma of non-smokers or minimal smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data have established that an EGFR mutation can be found in 30% of adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
      the lung if the smoking history is maximally 15 years. The probability of finding a mutation&#xD;
      is approximately 50% in never-smokers with adenocarcinoma (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to the rather low objective response rate, the clinical benefit rate of treatment&#xD;
      with RTKI is around 40 % in a general population of non-small lung cancer (9,10), more than&#xD;
      can be accounted for by mutational analysis. EGFR gene amplification might be another&#xD;
      determinant for sensitivity, but the biological factors leading to disease stabilisation in&#xD;
      some patients with non-activated EGFR are presently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several humanized monoclonal antibodies (huMoAb) that can inhibit the EGFR-1 receptor have&#xD;
      been developed as well. Of these, cetuximab (ErbituxÒ) has been developed most extensively,&#xD;
      especially in head and neck (12) and colorectal cancer (13,14), but other, fully humanized&#xD;
      antibodies (huMoAb) (ABX-EGF, EMD 72000) are under development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab has been assessed in NSCLC, especially in combination with first-line and&#xD;
      second-line chemotherapy (15), but no data are currently available with respect to single&#xD;
      agent activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two types of currently available drugs targeting the EGFR-1, the RTKI's such as gefitinib&#xD;
      and erlotinib and huMoAb such as cetuximab and ABX-EGF, are generally well tolerated and&#xD;
      devoid of significant grade 3-4 toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there are strong indications that the major responses obtained with RTKI's could&#xD;
      strongly correlate with the presence of tyrosine kinase domain mutations in addition to the&#xD;
      known mechanism of action of these drugs (16,17), this is at present yet not so clear for the&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of the receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some recent data suggest that EGFR gene amplification might also correlate with response to&#xD;
      TKI (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Stage IV and some advanced stage III NSCLC are at present incurable and&#xD;
      first-line chemotherapy has had only a palliative and a life prolonging effect at a cost of&#xD;
      variable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand the response rate to TKI in patients with a NSCLC carrying a mutant&#xD;
      receptor is probably high as can be inferred from the comparison of the prevalence of such&#xD;
      mutations and the response rate to these agents in an unselected population (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems therefore reasonable to explore in a first-line setting the potential of EGFR-1&#xD;
      targeted therapy, as these drugs have a very favourable toxicity profile and might induce&#xD;
      prolonged palliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no data that would suggest that delaying chemotherapy in this patient&#xD;
      population in well controlled conditions and for a limited time period (sufficient to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of more novel first-line treatments) might affect the efficacy of&#xD;
      subsequent chemotherapy. There are also no data that suggest that prior administration of&#xD;
      drugs targeted at the EGFR-1 will induce resistance to subsequent chemotherapy. The distinct&#xD;
      respective mechanisms of action of these drugs and chemotherapy also do not suggest this to&#xD;
      be likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other diseases such as prostate cancer and oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, the&#xD;
      availability of hormonal treatments permits prolonged and at times long-term disease control&#xD;
      with limited discomfort. It is possible that a similar scenario could be obtained with an&#xD;
      anti-EGFR treatment in NSCLC carrying a mutant EGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it seems justified to expand previous second-line phase II experience with&#xD;
      anti-EGFR strategies to patients with incurable stage III-IV NSCLC without prior therapy and&#xD;
      a mutant EGFR. The informed consent towards these patients before entry in the study will&#xD;
      clearly state that until now the first-line standard of care has been chemotherapy, which&#xD;
      leads to a small overall survival benefit compared to the supportive treatment only and that&#xD;
      participation in the current study will delay this treatment within a tightly controlled&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current trial the RTKI erlotinib will be used. Prior experience with this drug has&#xD;
      been obtained in phase II and III studies. In the phase II setting, in an unselected&#xD;
      pretreated population, a response rate of 12.3% and a median survival of 8.4 months could be&#xD;
      obtained (19). In phase III, placebo-controlled studies, combination of erlotinib with&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy does not provide a survival advantage (gemcitabine and cisplatin in&#xD;
      TALENT (20) and paclitaxel and carboplatin in TRIBUTE (21). Several hypotheses can explain&#xD;
      these results: lack of selection of patients; antagonism between cytostatic and cytotoxic&#xD;
      agents (negative interaction with chemotherapy when given concurrently); chemotherapy and&#xD;
      EGFR inhibitors target the same cell population since chemotherapy directly or indirectly&#xD;
      affects EGFR function/expression and thereby reducing the effects of EGFR inhibitors. These&#xD;
      results are in contrast to the significant survival benefit seen in the phase III randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study in NSCLC following failure of 1st or 2nd line chemotherapy (BR21).&#xD;
      The response rate was 9% in the erlotinib treated patients, with significant increase in&#xD;
      progression free survival (from 8 to 9,7 wks) and increased survival (from 4.7 mth to 6.7&#xD;
      mth, p&lt; 0.001). In that study the biological parameters that correlate with response&#xD;
      (mutation status, EGFR gene amplification and EGFR immunohistochemistry) are still under&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival benefit correlated best with the presence of EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      and EGFR gene polysomy (22).&#xD;
