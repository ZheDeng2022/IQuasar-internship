    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of taking choline supplements during&#xD;
      pregnancy, and whether choline supplementation has an effect on infant development.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Choline is an essential nutrient that can be found in foods, such as egg yolks, liver, and&#xD;
      other meats. It is important for the composition and repair of normal cellular membranes,&#xD;
      normal brain function, and normal cardiovascular function. Research has suggested that the&#xD;
      presence of adequate amounts of choline during pregnancy and breastfeeding can help ensure&#xD;
      healthy fetal brain development. Additionally, adequate prenatal choline levels may have&#xD;
      long-lasting positive effects on cognitive function, including memory. However, sufficient&#xD;
      research has not been done on the effects of choline on pregnant women and their unborn&#xD;
      babies. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of taking choline supplements&#xD;
      during pregnancy, and whether taking choline during pregnancy will have an effect on infant&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo&#xD;
      or 900 mg of choline daily throughout pregnancy, until delivery. Babies will then begin&#xD;
      receiving either placebo or choline daily from the time of birth until they are 3 months old.&#xD;
      Participants will attend a baseline study visit that will include eligibility assessment,&#xD;
      urine collection, measurement of vital signs, dispensing of study medication, and an&#xD;
      ultrasound. Subsequent study visits will occur every 4 weeks throughout pregnancy and 6&#xD;
      months postpartum. Vital signs will be taken, urine samples will be collected, and study&#xD;
      medication will be given at each visit. Two blood samples will be taken between Weeks 32 and&#xD;
      36 of gestation. Heel sticks will be performed on babies when they are 4 and 12 weeks old.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be held every 6 months until the baby is 18 months old.&#xD;
