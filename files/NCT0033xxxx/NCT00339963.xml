  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use genomics-based technology, such as DNA microarrays, to more precisely&#xD;
      diagnose subsets of lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma patients. There have been many&#xD;
      attempts to classify lymphoid cancers in ways that will be useful for clinical diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment. Although broad diagnostic categories have been reliably defined, patients within&#xD;
      each category have distinct clinical courses, suggesting that these classifications could be&#xD;
      further divided into molecular (genetic) subtypes. For example, 40 percent of patients with&#xD;
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma achieve long-term disease remissions following combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy and are apparently cured, whereas the remaining 60 percent die from the disease.&#xD;
      Similarly, some patients with follicular lymphoma develop aggressive disease within a few&#xD;
      years of diagnosis, while others have stable disease over 10 to 20 years. Although the&#xD;
      distinctions in clinical course of these diseases are recognized, there are no studies to&#xD;
      determine the molecular (genetic) basis for this variability. This study will try to define&#xD;
      new molecular diagnostic categories in these diseases and correlate them with clinical&#xD;
      features, including treatment response, disease remission and overall survival following&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective study will use clinical data and tissue samples from participating centers&#xD;
      in the Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project LLMPP). New patients will not be&#xD;
      recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy materials, including fresh frozen or OTC-embedded lymphoma biopsy material, viably&#xD;
      frozen samples of peripheral blood cells from leukemia patients, and viably frozen samples of&#xD;
      bone marrow aspirates from multiple myeloma patients will be collected from pathologists&#xD;
      participating in the LLMPP. RNA and genomic DNA will be extracted from the tumor samples. A&#xD;
      variety of technologies will be used to characterize the genome of the cancer cells,&#xD;
      including lymphochip microarrays for array-based comparative genomic hybridization; Southern&#xD;
      blotting and PCR for translocation of genes previously implicated in these malignancies; and&#xD;
      PCR and DNA sequencing methods for analyzing base changes in the genome of the cancer cells.&#xD;
      Clinical information from the initial diagnosis to disease relapse will be taken from&#xD;
      existing databases and/or patient charts. Gene expression will be correlated with the&#xD;
      clinical data. If a small number of genes is found to strongly predict clinical outcome,&#xD;
      quantitative RT-PCR assays using the Taqman technology may be developed as an alternative to&#xD;
      DNA microarray analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current diagnosis of the lymphoid malignancies relies upon the morphological appearance of&#xD;
      the cancer cells supplemented by a few molecular markers. Within a diagnostic category, the&#xD;
      clinical courses and responses of patients to therapy are variable, suggesting that the&#xD;
      existing diagnostic categories may harbor more than one disease entity. Recent genomic&#xD;
      technologies allow a comprehensive molecular analysis of the expression of the genome in&#xD;
      cancer cells. DNA microarray analysis of gene expression in lymphomas revealed distinct&#xD;
      molecular subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and these new molecularly-defined&#xD;
      lymphoma subtypes had divergent clinical outcomes. To extend our genomic analysis to all&#xD;
      lymphoid malignancies, we have formed a consortium of cooperating institutions termed the&#xD;
      Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project (LLMPP). The clinical centers participating in&#xD;
      the LLMPP will send de-identified lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma samples to the NCI&#xD;
      for gene expression profiling, array-based comparative genomic hybridization and cancer gene&#xD;
      resequencing. An additional site, The National Cancer Center Singapore, will send&#xD;
      de-identified samples of tumor tissue from patients with lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess gene expression on a genomic scale in lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma samples&#xD;
      and its relationship to somatic genetic alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of lymphoid malignancy at one of the LLMPP participating institutions, including&#xD;
      specimens originating at other clinical sites and submitted to LLMPP participating sites or&#xD;
      The National Cancer Center Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an entirely retrospective study. All tumor biopsies containing malignant cells to be&#xD;
      analyzed were obtained previously from patients diagnosed and/or treated at one of the&#xD;
      institutions participating in the LLMPP or at The National Cancer Center Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will also be sent for the patients in this study for the purpose of correlating&#xD;
      gene expression measurements with clinical outcome. The goals of this effort are to define&#xD;
      new molecular diagnostic categories in these diseases that are clinically relevant and to&#xD;
      gain new insight into the molecular pathways that are active in these malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The home institutions providing clinical data and tissue samples have obtained local approval&#xD;
      by their clinical research committees for this study.&#xD;
