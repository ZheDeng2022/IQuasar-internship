      This study will test whether primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
      sclerosis (ALS) affect parts of the brain responsible for thinking, planning, memory and&#xD;
      emotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older and patients with PLS and ALS may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rating motor function: Subjects are asked to contract certain muscles in the face, arms&#xD;
           and legs, to tap their finger on a keyboard rapidly, to walk 20 feet, and to read a&#xD;
           paragraph out loud.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroencephalography (EEG): The electrical activity of the brain (brain waves) is&#xD;
           recorded while subjects tap their finger very slowly. For this test, electrodes are&#xD;
           placed on the scalp using a cap or an adhesive substance. A conductive gel is used to&#xD;
           fill the space between the electrodes and the scalp to ensure good contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surface electromyography (EMG): The electrical activity of the muscles is measured.&#xD;
           Electrodes filled with a conductive gel are taped to the skin over the muscle tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing: Testing may include questionnaires, pen-and-paper or&#xD;
           computerized tests, and motor tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to&#xD;
           produce images of the brain. The subject lies on a table that slides into the scanner.&#xD;
           Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting 45-90 minutes.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to see whether patterns of cerebral cortex dysfunction differ in&#xD;
      Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The function of&#xD;
      several regions of the cerebral cortex will be assessed by clinical, physiological, and&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests. Magnetic resonance imaging will be carried out in a subset of&#xD;
      patients to explore the correlation between functional and anatomical measures of these&#xD;
      cortical areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients with Primary lateral sclerosis who meet the diagnostic criteria for PLS proposed&#xD;
      by Pringle and 30 patients with ALS who fulfill the revised El Escorial criteria for probable&#xD;
      or definite ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 healthy volunteers will be studied to provide training and practice in using the rating&#xD;
      scales and to provide age-matched controls for EEG and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A screening examination will be carried out under protocol 01-N-0145 to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. Patients and caregivers will return for two or three visits for sessions of&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing, a structured clinical neuropsychiatric evaluation, ratings of&#xD;
      motor and clinical function, and measurement of movement-related cortical potentials with&#xD;
      EEG. A subset of patients will undergo MRI scans for quantitative anatomical measures of&#xD;
      cortical regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the classification of patients as normal or abnormal on&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing of frontal cortex function. Correlations of the primary outcome&#xD;
      with other variables - clinical measures of motor function, neuropsychiatric assessment will&#xD;
      be examined. EEG measures of movement related cortical potentials and MR imaging findings&#xD;
      will be analyzed in an exploratory fashion to determine whether these measures differ between&#xD;
      PLS and ALS patients.&#xD;

        -  PRIMARY LATERAL SCLEROSIS INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with PLS, aged 18 and older, must meet the diagnostic criteria proposed by Pringle&#xD;
        (1992), incorporating Santa Clara (2004) consensus for pure PLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insidious onset in adulthood, progressive course&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No family history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease duration greater than 3 years without lower motor neuron clinical signs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical signs restricted to corticospinal/corticobulbar tract dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        Imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain MRI normal (except cortical atrophy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal cervical spine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative chest X-ray, negative mammograms in women&#xD;
&#xD;
        EMG after 3 years, but within last 3 years, showing no active denervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal serological studies for serum chemistry, Vitamin B12, Vitamin E levels, very&#xD;
        long-chain fatty acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Negative serology for syphilis, Lyme disease, HTLV 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with ALS, aged 18 and older, must fulfill the revised El Escorial criteria for&#xD;
        probable or definite ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Probable ALS: Upper and Lower motor neuron signs are present in more than two regions,&#xD;
             but some UMN signs must be rostral to LMN signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Definite ALS: Upper and Lower motor neuron signs are present in more than three&#xD;
             regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy adults, aged 18 and older, willing to participate, and able to give informed&#xD;
        consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cognitive impairment of such severity that patients cannot provide assent to participate in&#xD;
        the protocol. During the screening examination, we will question the patients to see if&#xD;
        they understand that they are being evaluated, the types of tests we are using, and the&#xD;
        response required. If they are unable to answer these questions, they will be excluded from&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History or evidence of co-existence of a second neurological disorder, such as stroke,&#xD;
        epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, polio, ataxia or neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of traumatic brain injury, skull defects or neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria for ALS and PLS but have the following&#xD;
        conditions will be allowed to participate in cognitive studies and EEG studies, but will be&#xD;
        excluded from MRI testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, dental implants,&#xD;
             aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses&#xD;
             (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and cochlear implants), permanent&#xD;
             eyeliner, implanted delivery pumps, or shrapnel fragments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Occupational exposure to metal fragments, as in welders and metal workers, which may&#xD;
             lead to small fragments in the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential will undergo urine pregnancy testing before&#xD;
             MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fear of confined spaces.&#xD;
