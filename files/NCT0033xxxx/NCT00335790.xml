      Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder currently affecting as many as 1 out of 166 children&#xD;
      in the United States. Autism is considered by many to be a permanent condition with little&#xD;
      hope for improvement. Treatment for autism is centered on special schooling and behavioral&#xD;
      therapy; medical science currently has little to offer. Recent research has discovered that&#xD;
      some autistic individuals have decreased blood flow to the brain, evidence of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and brain inflammation, increased markers of oxidative stress, and a&#xD;
      relative mitochondrial dysfunction. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can compensate for&#xD;
      decreased blood flow by increasing the oxygen content of plasma and body tissues and can even&#xD;
      normalize oxygen levels in ischemic tissue. In addition, animal studies have shown that HBOT&#xD;
      has potent anti-inflammatory effects and reduces oxidative stress. Furthermore, recent&#xD;
      evidence demonstrates that HBOT increases the production of mitochondria and mobilizes stem&#xD;
      cells from human bone marrow, which may aid recovery in neurodegenerative diseases. Based&#xD;
      upon these findings, it is hypothesized that HBOT will improve symptoms in autistic&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our recent retrospective case series demonstrated that HBOT may improve symptoms in autistic&#xD;
      children. We recently completed a prospective pilot trial using HBOT in 18 children which&#xD;
      demonstrated significant clinical improvements in autistic children on several standardized&#xD;
      scales. Most of the scales were parent-rated, although some were rated by teachers. However,&#xD;
      parents were not blinded to the fact that their children received HBOT and evaluation of the&#xD;
      children was through parent-rated scales, either of which could lead to bias. There was no&#xD;
      placebo or control group. Therefore, the improvements found in this prospective study could&#xD;
      have been due merely to chance or the natural development of the children. To determine if&#xD;
      HBOT improves symptoms in autistic children, a double-blind controlled study is needed.&#xD;

      Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder currently affecting as many as 1 out of 166 children&#xD;
      in the United States. Autism is considered by many to be a permanent, static condition with&#xD;
      little hope for improvement. Treatment for autism is centered on special schooling and&#xD;
      behavioral therapy; medical science currently has little to offer. Recent research has&#xD;
      discovered that some autistic individuals have decreased cerebral perfusion, evidence of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and neuro-inflammation, increased markers of oxidative stress, and a&#xD;
      relative mitochondrial dysfunction. Multiple independent single photon emission computed&#xD;
      tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) research studies have revealed&#xD;
      hypoperfusion to several areas of the autistic brain, most notably the temporal regions and&#xD;
      areas specifically related to language comprehension and auditory processing. Several studies&#xD;
      show that diminished blood flow to these areas correlates with many of the clinical features&#xD;
      associated with autism including repetitive, self-stimulatory and stereotypical behaviors,&#xD;
      and impairments in communication, sensory perception, and social interaction. Hyperbaric&#xD;
      oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been used with clinical success in several cerebral hypoperfusion&#xD;
      syndromes including cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome, closed head injury, and stroke.&#xD;
      HBOT can compensate for decreased blood flow by increasing the oxygen content of plasma and&#xD;
      body tissues and can even normalize oxygen levels in ischemic tissue. In addition, animal&#xD;
      studies have shown that HBOT has potent anti-inflammatory effects and reduces oxidative&#xD;
      stress. Furthermore, recent evidence demonstrates that HBOT increases the production of&#xD;
      mitochondria and mobilizes stem cells from human bone marrow, which may aid recovery in&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. Based upon these findings, it is hypothesized that HBOT will&#xD;
      improve symptoms in autistic individuals.&#xD;

      Our recent retrospective case series demonstrated that HBOT may improve symptoms in autistic&#xD;
