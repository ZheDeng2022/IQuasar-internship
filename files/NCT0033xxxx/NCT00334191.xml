    <textblock>
      Many patients develop kidney failure after cardiac surgery. Although this kidney failure can&#xD;
      usually be treated effectively, a longer stay in intensive care is often required. While many&#xD;
      patients suffer no long term ill effects after developing post-operative kidney failure, some&#xD;
      require long term kidney dialysis. We also know that patients who develop post-operative&#xD;
      kidney failure are much more likely to die before they leave hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why some people develop kidney failure after cardiac surgery is not known. However, doctors&#xD;
      suspect that the process of cardiopulmonary bypass (where the functions of the heart and&#xD;
      lungs are taken over by a machine during the operation, to allow the surgeon to operate)&#xD;
      overactivates some of the same mechanisms the body uses to defend itself against severe&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the cell changes by which severe infection causes kidney failure also occur after&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass. One of the main overactive defence mechanisms is the release of&#xD;
      highly toxic compounds derived from oxygen - a process called 'oxidative stress'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that sodium bicarbonate might reduce the oxidative stress, which&#xD;
      occurs during cardiac surgery, and so prevent or decrease the kidney failure, which occurs in&#xD;
      many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to give sodium bicarbonate (in similar doses to those used safely for&#xD;
      treatment of acidosis) to patients during, and for 24 hours after cardiac surgery, and to&#xD;
      compare the effects with patients who have not had sodium bicarbonate. The drug, or a&#xD;
      placebo, will be given through the drip, which is present in all cardiac surgery patients.&#xD;
      Whether a particular patient receives the drug or placebo will be decided at random, and&#xD;
      neither the patient nor the investigators will know which has been given. We will measure&#xD;
      kidney function before and after the operation using the standard blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also take four 20ml samples of blood, spaced before, during, and after&#xD;
      the operation, from the arterial catheter routinely inserted in every patient. This blood&#xD;
      would be used to measure oxidative stress, and also some of the proteins inside the blood&#xD;
      cells, which are responsible for creating the toxic oxygen compounds. In this way we will&#xD;
      discover not only the effect of sodium bicarbonate, but also the mechanism of that effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium bicarbonate is commonly used to treat metabolic acidosis in severe renal disease,&#xD;
      circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration and has been shown to be an&#xD;
      effective drug in preventing contrast-induced nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium bicarbonate is considered to be safe in the setting of intensive care treatment and is&#xD;
      often used in the treatment of patients with metabolic acidosis without any discernible&#xD;
      adverse clinical effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study. If the drug proves effective in this context, further studies on a&#xD;
      larger scale would be required to justify its general use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no extra risk to a patient who participates in the study, and no discomfort&#xD;
      other than that normally associated with cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from the patient prior to the operation by one of the&#xD;
      investigators or the ICU research nurse. The clinical care of a patient who does not consent&#xD;
      for any reason will not be affected.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Renal impairment following cardiopulmonary bypass is common. 11.4% to 42% of patients with&#xD;
      previously normal renal function show a postoperative rise in serum creatinine. While most of&#xD;
      these patients do not require either short or long term renal replacement, the mortality of&#xD;
      patients with acute renal failure is substantially greater than those who do not develop&#xD;
      renal dysfunction1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary bypass activates components of the non-specific immune system, which leads to&#xD;
      the generation of compounds containing oxygen free radicals. A study of 14 patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery found increased levels of serum lipid peroxidation products&#xD;
      (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) within 15 minutes of the commencement of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass, which returned to preoperative levels by the following morning. The&#xD;
      total serum antioxidative capacity was correspondingly decreased intraoperatively, and&#xD;
      remained decreased at 24 hours postoperatively. A similar study of total plasma antioxidant&#xD;
      status showed decreased levels up to 72 hours postoperatively. It is clear that&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass causes oxidative stress and depletion of antioxidant capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-Nitrosation of oxygenated nitric oxide (NO.) solutions was previously shown to be&#xD;
      significantly inhibited by the strong scavenging ability of NaBic presumably by anion&#xD;
      scavenging of nitrosating agents. At physiologic concentrations, NaBic scavenges&#xD;
      peroxynitrite and reactive oxygen species generated from nitric oxide. This may contribute to&#xD;
      a reduction in the deleterious effects of NO generating agents. NaBic is therefore a&#xD;
      potential regulator of NO-induced toxicity. NaBic is considered to be safe in the setting of&#xD;
      intensive care treatment and is often used in the treatment of patients with metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis without any discernible adverse clinical effects. NaBic increases the pH-level by&#xD;
      buffering of hydrogen ions, which can cause electrolyte balance shifts, e.g. Potassium will&#xD;
      be shifted increasingly intracellular. Frequent control of pH and potassium levels is&#xD;
      required to prevent alkalosis and hypokalemia. These adverse effects are uncommon or&#xD;
      typically only biochemical in nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress can be produced experimentally using hypertonic glycerol. Intramuscular&#xD;
      injection of hypertonic glycerol in rats precipitates acute renal failure associated with a&#xD;
      marked decrease in renal reduced levels of antioxidative agents. Pre-treatment with NaBic is&#xD;
      more protective than sodium chloride in animal models of acute renal failure secondary to&#xD;
      ischaemia or doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radio-contrast dye commonly causes renal dysfunction, in part through oxidative stress in the&#xD;
      kidney. While not an approved indication, intravenous sodium bicarbonate has been used&#xD;
      successfully to attenuate radiocontrast-induced nephropathy, and was more effective than&#xD;
      standard intravenous fluid prophylaxis. Hydration with NaBic before contrast exposure is more&#xD;
      effective than hydration with sodium chloride for prophylaxis of contrast-induced renal&#xD;
      failure. By increasing medullary pH in the kidneys, NaBic might protect from oxygen injury by&#xD;
      slowing pH-dependent radical production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While never investigated for its effects on renal function after cardiac surgery, the effect&#xD;
      of perioperative sodium bicarbonate on other systems has been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a clinical trial with 15 infants who were mechanically ventilated during the immediate&#xD;
      postoperative period after corrective cardiac surgery sodium bicarbonate increased the&#xD;
      arterial pH, lowered the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and increased the cardiac index&#xD;
      resulting in a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance. Infusion of sodium bicarbonate&#xD;
      resulted in a significant improvement in skin microcirculatory perfusion in an observation&#xD;
      study with 15 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The negative effects of peroxynitrite causing oxidative stress after tyrosine nitration in&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disorders were strongly reduced in the presence of sodium bicarbonate in&#xD;
      in-vitro experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is thus evidence that sodium bicarbonate affects the cardiovascular, respiratory and&#xD;
      immune systems and may be of benefit to patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Sodium bicarbonate administered from the time of induction of anaesthesia prior to&#xD;
      cardiac surgery and for 24 hours postoperatively results in a decreased change in renal&#xD;
      function measured as serum creatinine change greater than 25% from baseline to peak level&#xD;
      within first five postoperative days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes which will be measured include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  change in serum creatinine greater than 50% from baseline to peak level&#xD;
&#xD;
           . creatinine clearance over the first postoperative day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  length of ventilation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ICU stay;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hospital stay;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serum creatinine levels on day 2 post-op;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  plasma antioxidant activity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NF-kB activation in the cellular components of blood;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pro-inflammatory cytokine response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activation of the nitric oxide synthase pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design - overview and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to receive sodium bicarbonate in 5% dextrose from the induction&#xD;
      of anaesthesia until 24 hours postoperatively, or a placebo (vehicle) (154mEq/L saline in 5%&#xD;
      dextrose solution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum creatinine is the most commonly used clinical indicator of renal function along with&#xD;
      urine output. Both will be measured for 48 hours postoperatively - the time period during&#xD;
      which renal impairment is most likely to develop. A more sensitive indicator of renal&#xD;
      dysfunction is creatinine clearance. This will be measured over the first 24 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in preventing oxidative stress will be assessed using a&#xD;
      measure of total plasma antioxidant activity (the bathocuproine assay) and by quantification&#xD;
      of the 8-isoprostane levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any renal effect of sodium bicarbonate will be correlated with levels of plasma&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha), which are known to be associated with&#xD;
      oxidative-stress induced renal failure. Activation of inducible nitric oxide production is&#xD;
      also associated with renal failure, and the effect of sodium bicarbonate on nitric oxide&#xD;
      synthase mRNA expression in the cellular components of blood will be assayed by real-time&#xD;
      PCR. Nitric oxide production will be assessed by measurement of plasma nitrotyrosine&#xD;
      concentration. Assay of nitrotyrosine is superior to the traditional Greiss reaction (which&#xD;
      measures nitrate and nitrite derivatives of nitric oxide), as nitrate and nitrite undergo&#xD;
      renal excretion, and many of these patients will have altered renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a molecular level, many of the genes responsible for stimulating oxidative stress are&#xD;
      regulated by the promoter NF-kB. The cellular components of blood will be assayed for NF-kB&#xD;
      using an established ELISA technique. NF-kB in the cellular components of blood will also be&#xD;
      assayed using real-time PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomisation will be based on random numbers generated by computer. Once consent is&#xD;
      obtained, the allocation of either treatment with Sodium Bicarbonate or placebo will be&#xD;
      organised by an independent person (clinical trials pharmacist) who will dispense the coded&#xD;
      infusion bags. This will be delivered to the anaesthetic staff looking after the patient in&#xD;
      theatre, and the ICU nurse caring for the patient postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following the induction of anaesthesia, prior to the first surgical incision,&#xD;
      Sodium Bicarbonate will be administered in a dose of 154mEq/L in 5% dextrose over 60 mins&#xD;
      (3mL/kg/h) followed by continuous IV infusion of 154mEq/L in 5% dextrose over 23 hours&#xD;
      (1mL/kg/h) or placebo (154mEq/L saline in 5% dextrose). Patients randomised to receive&#xD;
      placebo will receive an equivalent volume of dextrose. The appearance of the dextrose&#xD;
      solution and sodium bicarbonate solutions is similar, and there will be no marking on the&#xD;
      infusion bag other than an identifying study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 24 hour urine collection will begin immediately on arrival in ICU, to allow determination&#xD;
      of creatinine clearance. This will be measured in the hospital clinical pathology laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be recorded as detailed below by the investigators or the ICU research&#xD;
      nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 ml samples of heparinized blood will be taken from the arterial line for cytokine and&#xD;
      molecular analysis. Samples will be taken immediately after the induction of anaesthesia, on&#xD;
      arrival in the intensive care unit, and 6, 12 and 24 and 72 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
      Immediately following collection, the blood will be centrifuged at low speed to separate the&#xD;
      plasma from the cellular components, both of which will be stored in aliquots at -70 degrees&#xD;
      prior to batch analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of plasma total antioxidant activity and 8-isoprostane, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha and&#xD;
      nitrotyrosine concentrations will be performed using commercially available ELISA reagent&#xD;
      kits (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxis Research, BioCore). The cellular components of blood&#xD;
      will be assayed for NF-kB concentration using a commercially available ELISA kit (Oxford&#xD;
      Biomedical Research), also for iNOS and NF-kB mRNAs using a real-time PCR machine and Applied&#xD;
      Biosystems pre-developed assay reagents with 18S as the endogenous control. The principal&#xD;
      investigator has experience of these or similar techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and power calculation Using data available from our cardiac surgery database of&#xD;
      over 2500 patients in the last 5 years, we expect 50% of patients developing an increase in&#xD;
      serum creatinine greater than 25% from baseline to peak in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given a minimal clinically important reduction of this proportion to 30% in the Sodium&#xD;
      Bicarbonate group, 100 patients are needed to have a 90% power of detecting a difference&#xD;
      between the control and the intervention group at an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data collection will be performed by the principal investigator, ICU research&#xD;
      nurse and ICU nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Code for patient, gender and age. Date of admission to ICU Operative procedure and time on&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass Preoperative assessment of left ventricular function Serum creatinine&#xD;
      and urea preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, 12 and every 24 hours thereafter (as&#xD;
      measured for clinical purposes). Doses of frusemide administered (or rate of frusemide&#xD;
      infusion) Use of inotropes Cardiac output whenever measured for clinical purposes in the&#xD;
      first 24 hours postoperatively Urine output in each 6 hour period for the 24 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively Date of discharge from ICU and hospital or death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resources required The principle of the study has been discussed with the involved cardiac&#xD;
      anaesthetists, cardiac surgeons, intensivists and intensive care nurses, who have offered&#xD;
      their co-operation. ICU research nurse to allocate patients and collect clinical data.&#xD;
      Pharmacy will be required to prepare drug and placebo infusion bags. Clinical pathology will&#xD;
      be required to perform 24 hour creatinine clearance estimation (in addition to those tests&#xD;
      clinically indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol violations All protocol violations will be recorded. It will then be decided whether&#xD;
      the nature of such violation had been such that the patient should be excluded from primary&#xD;
      data analysis. Such evaluation will be blinded to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal The treating clinician will have the right to withdraw the patient from the study&#xD;
      if he or she believes that continued participation is jeopardising the patient's well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Issues Sodium bicarbonate used in this study is considered to be very safe as has&#xD;
      been demonstrated by its widespread clinical use in the management of critically ill patients&#xD;
      with metabolic acidosis. We consider the potential benefit of this treatment theoretically&#xD;
      significant. Given the balance of benefits and risks, the investigators consider it ethical&#xD;
      to proceed and seek informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indemnity This is an investigator-initiated study and, accordingly, no commercial sponsor's&#xD;
      indemnity has been provided.&#xD;
