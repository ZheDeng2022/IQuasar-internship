      This study, sponsored jointly by the National Cancer Institute and the Tehran University of&#xD;
      Medical Sciences, will explore the causes of cancers of the stomach and esophagus (the tube&#xD;
      that runs between the mouth and the stomach) in Northern Iran. This is a unique area of study&#xD;
      for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some of the highest rates of esophageal cancer in the world have been reported in&#xD;
           northeastern Iran 109 cases per 100,000 men and 175 cases per 100,000 women each year&#xD;
           about 40 times higher than the rates of this cancer in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this area of Iran, unlike most areas of the world, the disease affects more women&#xD;
           than men.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 300 miles along the southern border of the Caspian Sea, the rates fall to 10&#xD;
           cases per 100,000 people per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high rates of disease in this area, the unique geographic distribution of cases, and the&#xD;
      exceptionally high rate in women make Northern Iran a promising site for studying esophageal&#xD;
      and stomach cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 30 years of age and older who are referred to the upper gastrointestinal disease&#xD;
      Atrak Clinic in Gonbad, Golestan Province, Iran, with suspected esophageal cancer may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. In addition, control subjects 30 years of age and older with certain&#xD;
      specified diseases will be recruited from patients referred to four hospitals in Gonbad and&#xD;
      to the Taleghani Clinic. After giving informed consent, all participants will undergo the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews, including questions about age, ethnicity, education, and other demographic&#xD;
           data; habits, such as tobacco, opium, and alcohol consumption; personal and family&#xD;
           medical history; diet, with special attention to food preservation, cooking methods, and&#xD;
           drinking water; physical activity; occupational and residential history; body&#xD;
           measurements; signs and symptoms of upper gastrointestinal disease; oral hygiene; animal&#xD;
           contact; transfusion history; and family socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw (15 milliliters, or 1 tablespoon) for genetic and chemical testing for&#xD;
           markers that may predict who gets the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hair and nail sampling to identify minerals or compounds whose exposure may be related&#xD;
           to esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopy to evaluate the health of the esophagus and stomach. This test will be&#xD;
           performed on all case patients and on control participants who give their permission.&#xD;
           Before the examination, the subject will swallow a liquid that numbs the throat and may&#xD;
           be given a medicine through a vein to promote drowsiness. The subject will then swallow&#xD;
           a tube (endoscope) through which the doctor can look at the esophagus and stomach and&#xD;
           take samples of tissue to look for disease. The tissue samples will be examined&#xD;
           microscopically and will then be stored for possible future genetic or other testing&#xD;
           related to diagnosing or determining the risk of esophageal cancer.&#xD;

      This case-control study (the first phase of the GEMINI project) is primarily focused on&#xD;
      exploring the etiology (etiologies) of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus in northern&#xD;
      Iran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal and gastric cancers, together, are responsible for more than 1,000,000 annual&#xD;
      deaths in the world. In 1996, cancers of the stomach and esophagus ranked first and second&#xD;
      respectively, among the most frequent cancers in Iran, excluding skin cancers. Some of the&#xD;
      highest incidence rates for esophageal cancer in the world have been reported in Northeastern&#xD;
      Iran, in Northern Gonbad, with Age Standardized Rates (ASR) of 109/100,000 in men and&#xD;
      175/100,000 in women (1). These rates are approximately 40 times higher than those seen in&#xD;
      the US. In this area, unlike most areas of the world, the incidence is higher in women than&#xD;
      in men. Additionally, within 300 miles along the southern border of Caspian Sea, the rates&#xD;
      fall to 10/100,000. The highest rates of EC in the world, a unique geographical distribution&#xD;
      of cases, and an exceptionally high rate among women all make Northern Iran a very intriguing&#xD;
      site for studying this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An upper-GI referral clinic (Atrak Clinic) has already been established in Gonbad, Golestan&#xD;
      Province, and DDRC researchers have conducted feasibility studies in this clinic. For the&#xD;
      case-control study, local internists and other health system workers will refer suspected&#xD;
      cases of esophageal cancer to the Clinic. All such patients will undergo endoscopy and biopsy&#xD;
      for ascertainment of diagnosis. Patients who have histologically confirmed esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and consent to join the study will be enrolled as&#xD;
      cases. There will be two control groups in this study, one selected from the neighborhood of&#xD;
      case subjects and one from the patients referred to Atrak Clinic who do not have cancer. The&#xD;
      neighborhood control group will serve as the primary control group. Both the cases and the&#xD;
      controls will be interviewed and undergo collection of biological specimens including blood,&#xD;
      hair and nails. Free (and optional) endoscopy will also be offered to the neighborhood&#xD;
      controls. A four-year accrual of 300 cases, 600 neighborhood controls and 300 clinic controls&#xD;
      is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental risk factors (including life-style, habits, and nutritional status) will be&#xD;
      assessed through questionnaires and objective measurements in biological specimens. The role&#xD;
      of genetic polymorphisms will be studies using genomic DNA from cases and controls. A subset&#xD;
      of samples collected from cases and controls will be used to evaluate gene expression&#xD;
      patterns, using microarray analysis, differences in serum protein patterns, using SELDI&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
