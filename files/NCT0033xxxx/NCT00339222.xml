  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the course of a case-control study of melanoma conducted at the Bufalini Hospital,&#xD;
      Cesena, Italy in the years 1994-1996, 20 families with 2 or 3 melanoma cases were identified&#xD;
      and studied. The area where the study was conducted showed the steepest increase in melanoma&#xD;
      incidence in Mediterranean populations between the years 1987 and 1997.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical characteristics of melanoma in the families studied were similar to those typically&#xD;
      described in fair-skinned populations, but no relevant mutations in the coding regions of&#xD;
      known candidate genes from melanoma have been found. Lack of findings could be due to the&#xD;
      modest number of families and the small number of affected CMM cases examined. We cannot&#xD;
      exclude the possibility of alterations in introns, splicing sites or promoter regions. Also&#xD;
      epigenetic factors could affect the expression of the gene products we studied.&#xD;
      Alternatively, germline alterations of a gene(s) other than the candidate genes we analyzed&#xD;
      may play an important role in melanoma predisposition in this population. A large number of&#xD;
      families is needed to test these hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These additional families could provide an important contribution to the understanding o&#xD;
      melanoma development. In fact, this population does not generally have the host&#xD;
      characteristics that are usually associated with higher risk for melanoma (e.g., light skin&#xD;
      color, red hair, blue eyes, multiple freckles, tendency to sunburn, etc.) but do have a&#xD;
      relative high frequency of dysplastic nevi and melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to recruit more families at the Bufalini Hospital,&#xD;
      Cesena, Italy in order to reach a larger sample size. Recently, 16 potential melanoma-prone&#xD;
      families have been identified through patient's or physicians' referrals by the&#xD;
      Dermatologists at the Bufalini Hospital. The dermatologists have maintained close&#xD;
      relationships with members of these families and are confident that these subjects would be&#xD;
      willing to participate in a study if contacted. The first goal of our study is to contact&#xD;
      this family group and verify their willingness to participate in the study. In addition, new&#xD;
      families could be identified and recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a pilot project. We estimate recruitment of approximately 25 families&#xD;
      with 2 or more melanoma cases in first -degree relatives over a one-year period, including&#xD;
      the 16 families already identified and approximately 10 new kindreds. At the end of the pilot&#xD;
      phase we will determine the feasibility of continuing recruitment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date 557 subjects, including cases of melanoma and unaffected relatives, have been&#xD;
      recruited in the family study of melanoma at the Bufalini Hospital, Cesena, Italy, University&#xD;
      ofl'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy, and the Istituto Valenciano de Oncologia, Valencia, Spain.&#xD;
      Clinical characteristics of melanoma in the families studied were similar to those typically&#xD;
      described in fair-skinned populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the original study from the Bufalini Hospital, only 7% of the families analyzed have been&#xD;
      shown to carry mutation in the CDKN2A gene, known candidate gene for melanoma, and no other&#xD;
      mutation in additional susceptibility genes have been identified. The possibility of&#xD;
      alterations in introns, splicing sites, or promoter regions cannot be excluded. Also,&#xD;
      epigenetic factors could affect the expression of the gene products we studied.&#xD;
      Alternatively, germline alterations of a gene(s) other than the candidate genes may play an&#xD;
      important role in melanoma predisposition in this population. We began genome-wide scanning&#xD;
      of the first 47 families. There was no evidence for linkage to either chromosome 9 or&#xD;
      chromosome 1, previously shown to be susceptibility loci for melanoma. We extended the&#xD;
      samples size also including melanoma-prone families from other Italian investigators. We have&#xD;
      performed fine mapping of the loci that appeared interesting in the first linkage analysis.&#xD;
      We did not confirm the previous association with the disease and published a manuscript to&#xD;
      report the null results. Some of these families were also analyzed together with other&#xD;
      families worldwide in linkage and genome-wide association studies with the goal of&#xD;
      identifying loci potentially important for melanoma etiology. Moreover, some individuals from&#xD;
      this study are being analyzed for presence of variants in susceptibility genes in&#xD;
      pigmentation, DNA repair, and other pathways together with the melanoma samples from the&#xD;
      case-control study (02-C- N(35). Finally, some families with three or more affected&#xD;
      individuals are ongoing exomic sequencing with the goal of identifying novel loci associated&#xD;
      with melanoma susceptibility. More than 100 subjects have been sequenced to date. We have&#xD;
      identified a potentially important candidate gene for melanoma and are investigating&#xD;
      additional families and melanoma cases to verify whether we can replicate this finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol proposes to continue recruitment of families in order to reach a larger sample&#xD;
      size for future analysis. The additional families could provide an important contribution to&#xD;
      the understanding of melanoma development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this protocol proposes to continue recruiting subjects for the tissue study&#xD;
      subgroup at the Bufalini Hospital of Cesena, the Unviersity of I' Aquila, Italy and the&#xD;
      Istituto Valenciano de Oncologia, Valencia, Spain. To date, 98 subjects have been enrolled in&#xD;
      this study. The study aims at investigating the progression from nevi to melanoma in a cross&#xD;
      sectional study of melanoma cases. The tissue study component focuses on the comparison of&#xD;
      gene expression, somatic mutations, genetic variants, and proteomics profile in normal skin,&#xD;
      common melanocytic nevi, dysplastic nevi, and melanoma tissue samples from the same&#xD;
      individuals (familial or sporadic cases). Each subject completes an interview based&#xD;
      questionnaire on sun exposure, pigmentation, sunsensitivity, family and medical history, and&#xD;
      other melanoma risk factors and donates a blood sample.&#xD;
