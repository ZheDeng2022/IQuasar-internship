      Although clinical risk factors for postoperative development of vasodilatory shock and acute&#xD;
      renal failure have been identified; there is a considerable proportion of patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery where this syndrome cannot be predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We sought to investigate the impact of Catecholamine-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphism&#xD;
      on the duration of vasodilatory shock and other important clinical outcomes in cardiac&#xD;
      surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMT is a key enzyme in the degradation of catechols eg. catecholamines. 25% of the&#xD;
      population have a low activity (L/L) of this enzyme. Sustained low COMT activity is&#xD;
      associated with an altered metabolic profile of catecholamines and their degradation&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)over-activates some of the same mechanisms the&#xD;
      body uses to defend itself against severe infection. One of the main overactive defence&#xD;
      mechanisms is the release of highly toxic compounds derived from oxygen - a process called&#xD;
      'oxidative-stress'. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation can lead to&#xD;
      inactivation of biologic mediators, including catecholamines. It is well established that&#xD;
      some radicals autoxidizes catecholamines, including DA, NE, and epinephrine and contribute&#xD;
      significantly to vasoplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, we will take six 2.7mL samples of blood, collected before, and after&#xD;
      the operation, from the arterial catheter routinely inserted in every patient. This blood&#xD;
      will be used to measure COMT genotype, the concentration of plasma-catecholamines as well as&#xD;
      marker of oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our plan is to enrol patients undergoing cardiac surgery if the use of the CPB is planned.&#xD;

      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore if there is an impact of LL COMT genotype on clinical and biological outcome&#xD;
      variables in patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared to HH genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac surgery has been shown to be an effective method for prolonging life in patients with&#xD;
      severe coronary artery disease or valvular disease or a combination thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase (COMT) catalyses the O-methylation of biologically active&#xD;
      catechols and is responsible for the degradation of catecholamines and catecholestradiols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMT is an intracellular enzyme, which is widely distributed throughout most of all human&#xD;
      tissues (Roth, Maennistoe) Because COMT is expressed ubiquitously, it appears that the COMT&#xD;
      genotype significantly affects levels of catecholamines throughout the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 % of Caucasians are homozygous for low COMT activity, (COMT LL=Met/Met), 25% are&#xD;
      homozygous for high activity of COMT (COMT HH=Val/Val), and about 50% are heterozygous (COMT&#xD;
      HL=Val/Met). (Palmatier, Spielman, Boudikova)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, COMT polymorphism may play an important role in the outcome of patients after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, studies due to this polymorphism exist only for chronic, non-cardiac surgery&#xD;
      disorders like psychiatric diseases, breast cancer and alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective observational study, we used this model of CPB-induced stress-mediated&#xD;
      vasodilatory shock to investigate the impact of COMT polymorphism on relevant postoperative&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Within this model we tested the hypothesis that, in cardiac surgery&#xD;
      patients, the LL COMT genotype is associated with alterations in catecholamine metabolism and&#xD;
      adverse hospital outcomes such as prolonged vasopressor support and acute renal failure&#xD;
      compared to HL and HH COMT genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a L/L COMT polymorphism are probably used to higher concentrations of&#xD;
      endogenous catecholamines, because a low COMT enzyme activity can cause an impaired&#xD;
      degradation of catecholamines. Patients with a L/L COMT polymorphism require presumably&#xD;
      higher catecholamines support than other patients to maintain cardiovascular stability in&#xD;
      extreme stress-conditions occuring during CPB procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute renal failure (ARF) is a common postoperative complication in cardiac surgery patients&#xD;
      that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Catechol-O-methyltransferase&#xD;
      (COMT) shows high activity in proximal tubular epithelial cells - target cell in ARF. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that the COMT met158 genotype might be associated with increased risk of acute&#xD;
      renal failure compared to COMT val158 genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPB activates components of the non-specific immune system, which leads to the generation of&#xD;
      compounds containing oxygen free radicals. A study of 14 patients undergoing cardiac surgery&#xD;
      found increased levels of serum lipid peroxidation products (thiobarbituric acid reactive&#xD;
      substances) within 15 minutes of the commencement of CPB, which returned to preoperative&#xD;
      levels by the following morning. The total serum antioxidative capacity was correspondingly&#xD;
      decreased intraoperatively, and remained decreased at 24 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be the length of vasopressor support in patients with LL COMT genotype compared&#xD;
      to patients with HL and HH COMT genotype. We hypothesize that there is a significant increase&#xD;
      in the duration of vasopressor support in patients with LL COMT compared to patients with HL&#xD;
      and HH COMT genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional outcome measure and hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that differences similar to that seen in the duration of vasopressor support&#xD;
      will be seen in a higher proportion of postoperative acute renal failure (increase in serum&#xD;
      creatinine &gt;50% from baseline to peak value), longer duration of ICU and hospital stay in LL&#xD;
      COMT patients compared to HL and HH patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMT genotype will be determined and levels of endogenous catecholamines will be measured&#xD;
      before and after cardiac surgery. We hypothesize that higher levels of endogenous&#xD;
      catecholamines will be measured for patients with LL COMT genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design - overview and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMT genotype and outcome measurements of patients after cardiac surgery will be analyzed in&#xD;
      this study. Concentrations of plasma catecholamines and important degradation products will&#xD;
      be determined before and after the use of CPB. The duration and dose of postoperative&#xD;
      vasopressor support as well as stay in ICU and stay in hospital will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      age, sex, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA, insulin (IDDM) or non-insulin&#xD;
      dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,&#xD;
      preoperative serum creatinine, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking status,&#xD;
      peripheral vascular disease (PVD), carotid artery disease, myocardial infarction (MI) or&#xD;
      stroke within last six months, atrial fibrillation (AF), and grade of left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction defined by the left ventricular ejection fraction using EuroScore definition.&#xD;
      Pre-operative medication including: platelet inhibitors,&#xD;
      ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin-II-receptor1-antagonists, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker&#xD;
      and statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative data on type of cardiac surgery (valvular or coronary artery bypass (CABG),&#xD;
      concomitant or complex cardiac surgery involving the ascending aorta), Redo operation, take&#xD;
      back to operating room, electronically stored MAP and duration of CPB. The intra- and&#xD;
      post-operative use of vasopressor (norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, and&#xD;
      metaraminol) and inotropic medications (milrinone, dobutamine)hourly until discharge from the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We will note the lowest MAP and the lowest cardiac index (CI)&#xD;
      every 6 hours. Postoperative serum creatinine will be measured daily. Finally, ICU and&#xD;
      hospital length of stay as well as hospital mortality were documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal The treating clinician will have the right to withdraw the patient from the study&#xD;
      if he or she believes that continued participation is jeopardising the patient's well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Issues Given the potential knowledge for the future the balance of benefits and&#xD;
      risks, we consider it ethical to proceed and seek informed consent. This is not a drug trial&#xD;
      or an interventional trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indemnity This is an investigator-initiated study and is not sponsored by industry. The&#xD;
      investigator is a member of staff at Austin Hospital; the hospital is responsible for&#xD;
      indemnifying the investigator in relation to this study. Warringal Private Hospital will be&#xD;
      responsible for indemnification for patients recruited there.&#xD;
