  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular oedema is characterized by fluid accumulation in the retinal tissue from&#xD;
      leaking retinal vessels, the capillaries. This state can lead to severe visual loss and&#xD;
      blindness. According to basic physiologic rules several factors influence the fluid transport&#xD;
      between the capillaries and the surrounding tissue. One of these factors is the balance&#xD;
      between the large molecules within the vessel lumen and the retinal tissue. Some drugs change&#xD;
      this balance, the osmotic balance, by moving the fluid from the tissue to the vessel lumen.&#xD;
      In relation to diabetic macular oedema, treatment with such a drug potentially would reduce&#xD;
      the retinal thickness because it extracts fluid from the retinal tissue. Glycerol has this&#xD;
      potential. If reduction of the thickness with glycerol is confirmed, then it proves the&#xD;
      significance of the osmotic balance in the basic nature of diabetic macular oedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we therefore examine the time dependent change in retinal thickness after&#xD;
      glycerol intake by an instrument called optical coherence tomography (OCT). The participants&#xD;
      drink glycerol and the thickness of the retina is then monitored closely by OCT during the&#xD;
      following three hours. Since diabetic changes in the retina are focal pr. definition, the&#xD;
      secondary purpose of the study is to find any regional differences in the response. The&#xD;
      examinations are repeated at a second visit where the patient drink another dose of glycerol,&#xD;
      because we also want to analyse for a dose dependent response. Which dose is given at each&#xD;
      visit is randomised on beforehand. In addition to measuring the retinal thickness a variety&#xD;
      of examinations are performed both before and during the study, e.g. blood samples and&#xD;
      systemic blood pressure measurements.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In general, when oedema is present, increasing the osmotic pressure in the retinal&#xD;
      capillaries by an osmotic drug induces transcapillary fluid transport from the retinal tissue&#xD;
      to the vascular lumen, according to the Starling equation. Theoretically, in diabetic macular&#xD;
      oedema the event would lead to reduction of the retinal thickness, which could then be&#xD;
      visualised by Optical Coherence Tomography. The main purpose of this trial is therefore to&#xD;
      evaluate and quantify the changes in retinal thickness of the oedema after increasing the&#xD;
      intracapillary osmotic pressure with glycerol ingestion. A reduction of the retinal thickness&#xD;
      will confirm the application of the Starling osmotic forces on diabetic macular oedema.&#xD;
      Secondly, we want to describe any regional differences in the retinal response and analyse&#xD;
      for dose dependent variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principles of material and methods: A prospective, randomized, clinical trial on 15 patients&#xD;
      with diabetic significant macular oedema. At baseline the patients undergo a thorough&#xD;
      ophthalmologic examination including ETDRS visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, Optical&#xD;
      Coherence Tomography (Stratus-OCT), 7-field fundus photography followed by fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography. In addition the systemic blood pressure is measured and blood samples are taken&#xD;
      to rule out severe renal insufficiency and to estimate glycosylated haemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are all randomised to drink either 1.5 or 3 mL glycerol/kg body weight (max. 250&#xD;
      mL pr day) on the first of two visit dates. The last dose is given at the second visit. In&#xD;
      the following three hours the retinal thickness is then monitored closely by Stratus-OCT&#xD;
      after the glycerol ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma osmolality and plasma triglyceride (an indirect indicator of glycerol) are&#xD;
      confirmed by venous blood samples, also at predetermined times after the last swallow of&#xD;
      glycerol. In addition the systemic blood pressure and the capillary blood glucose are&#xD;
      monitored closely during the visit.&#xD;
