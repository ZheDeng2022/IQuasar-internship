  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 3-AP and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. 3-AP&#xD;
      may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. 3-AP and cisplatin may&#xD;
      make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving 3-AP and external-beam radiation&#xD;
      therapy together with cisplatin may kill more tumor cells. This phase I trial is studying the&#xD;
      side effects and best dose of 3-AP when given together with external-beam radiation therapy&#xD;
      with or without cisplatin in treating patients with gynecologic cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Triapine® when given in combination with&#xD;
      pelvic radiotherapy with or without weekly intravenous cisplatin chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of Triapine® when given in combination with&#xD;
      pelvic radiotherapy with or without weekly intravenous cisplatin chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety and sequelae of intravenous Triapine® when given in combination&#xD;
      with pelvic radiotherapy with or without weekly intravenous cisplatin chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluation of intravenous Triapine®'s targeted inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase&#xD;
      through tumor tissue biopsy at pretreatment evaluation and during external beam radiotherapy&#xD;
      (Day 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Serial monitoring of methemoglobin levels during therapy given Triapine®'s iron chelating&#xD;
      properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of 3-AP. Patients are assigned to 1 of&#xD;
      2 treatment groups based on eligibility* to receive cisplatin (yes vs no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients who refuse or are not candidates for cisplatin chemotherapy due to prior&#xD;
      platinum adverse sensitivity, active neuropathy, or comobid illness, as determined by the&#xD;
      treating physician, are eligible to receive 3-AP alone with pelvic radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patients undergo external-beam pelvic radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12,&#xD;
      15-19, 22-26, and 29-33. Patients also receive 3-AP IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10,&#xD;
      12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, and 33 and cisplatin IV over 1½ hours on day 2, 9, 16,&#xD;
      23, and 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Patients undergo external-beam pelvic radiotherapy and receive 3-AP as in group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, patients undergo intracavitary or interstitial brachytherapy at least once&#xD;
      weekly for 3-5 weeks during or after external-beam radiotherapy as per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in group 1 and 1-3 patients in group 2 receive escalating doses of&#xD;
      3-AP until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose&#xD;
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least&#xD;
      6 patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood draws on days 1 and 10 before treatment with 3-AP and at 2, 4, 6, and&#xD;
      24 hours after starting treatment to assess methemoglobin levels and 3-AP plasma levels.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo punch biopsy on days 1 and 10 to determine R2 protein levels by Western&#xD;
      blot analysis, ribonucleotide reductase R2 protein levels by flow cytometry, and cytidine&#xD;
      deoxyphosphate reductase assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pathologically-proven recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian or&#xD;
             endometrial cancer a) not amenable to curative surgical resection alone, b) are&#xD;
             planned for pelvic radiotherapy, and c) are amenable to tumor biopsy through the&#xD;
             vaginal canal are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other active invasive malignancies are excluded; patients with prior&#xD;
             malignancies in remission for at least six months and not being currently treated are&#xD;
             eligible; patients are excluded if their previous cancer treatment as determined by&#xD;
             their treating physicians contraindicates this protocol therapy or if they have&#xD;
             received prior low abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy that would contribute radiation&#xD;
             dose that would exceed tolerance of normal tissues (as determined by the principal&#xD;
             investigator or co-investigators); for patients relapsing at least four weeks after&#xD;
             initial surgery or chemotherapy, they must have fully recovered from side effects of&#xD;
             prior treatment, have measurable disease in the pelvis; measurable lesions are defined&#xD;
             as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter&#xD;
             to be recorded) as &gt;= 20 mm with conventional techniques (CT, MRI, x-ray or as &gt;= 10&#xD;
             mm with spiral CT scan; patients with metastatic disease to extra-pelvic sites are&#xD;
             eligible if pelvic radiotherapy is planned as primary management of the site of pelvic&#xD;
             disease. There is no numerical limit on prior chemotherapy regimens previously&#xD;
             received&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2; (Karnofsky &gt;= 50%)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  PT/aPTT =&lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have a serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5mg/dL to receive weekly intravenous&#xD;
             cisplatin chemotherapy; patients whose serum creatinine is between 1.5 and 1.9 mg/dL&#xD;
             are eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy if the estimated creatinine clearance is &gt;= 30&#xD;
             ml/min; for the purpose of estimating the creatinine clearance, the formula of&#xD;
             Jelliffe should be used: CCr = 0.9{98-[0.8(age-20)]}/Scr where CCr is the estimated&#xD;
             creatinine clearance, age is patient's age in years (from 20-80), and Scr is the serum&#xD;
             creatinine in mg/dL; patients eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy will also receive&#xD;
             intravenous Triapine®; patients who have refused or are not candidates for cisplatin&#xD;
             chemotherapy as defined above, have prior platinum adverse sensitivity, have active&#xD;
             neuropathy, or have intercurrent co-morbid illness as determined by treating&#xD;

             Triapine® alone with pelvic radiotherapy, patients must have a serum creatinine =&lt;&#xD;
             2.0mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of Triapine® on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason&#xD;
             and because heterocyclic carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazones as well as other&#xD;
             therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility of patients receiving any medications or substances known to affect or&#xD;
             with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of Triapine® will be&#xD;
             determined following review of their case by the Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to undergo and the willingness to sign a written informed consent for&#xD;
             placement of a PICC line or a central venous catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier are&#xD;
             excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Triapine® or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to receive intravenous chemotherapies as a consequence of poor&#xD;
             vascular access (for example, patient receiving hemodialysis) are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, known inadequately controlled hypertension, significant pulmonary disease&#xD;
             including dyspnea at rest, patients requiring supplemental oxygen, or poor pulmonary&#xD;
             reserve; proteinuria or clinically significant renal function impairment (baseline&#xD;
             serum creatinine &gt; 2mg/dL), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Triapine® is a heterocyclic&#xD;
             carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects; screening b-hcg levels and diagnostic tests will be used to determine&#xD;
             eligibility; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Triapine®, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with Triapine®; these potential risks&#xD;
             may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Triapine®; in addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
