  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Division of Cancer Preventionl (DCP, formerly DCPC), under extramural contracts to 10&#xD;
      U.S. clinical centers, is evaluating the effectiveness of screening for prostate, lung,&#xD;
      colorectal and ovarian cancer (The PLCO Trial). In 1996 the NCI Executive Committee approved&#xD;
      the expansion of the PLCO Trial to collect additional materials and to conduct additional&#xD;
      studies. About, 74,000 men and 74,000 women, aged 55-74 years, have been randomized on a&#xD;
      50/50 basis into screening or usual care arms. Additional blood is collected from screened&#xD;
      subjects and saliva for buccal cells from control subjects. Pathologic tissues are obtained&#xD;
      for selected cases that develop cancer or selected related diseases (e.g. colon polyps,&#xD;
      benign prostatic hyperplasia). Additional questionnaire-based risk and disease-related&#xD;
      information is also collected, withconfirmation of disease status from medical records.&#xD;
      Genetic, biochemical and questionnairebasedrisk information will be related to the&#xD;
      development of cancer and other diseases in this population. Volunteers who provide samples&#xD;
      for these studies will not routinely receive their individual results from the Additional&#xD;
      Investigation. Subjects requesting such information, however, will be provided their test&#xD;
      results. In 2009 the NCI Executive Committee approved the Extended Follow-up of subjects&#xD;
      beyond the original 13-year follow-up period. Participants will be reconsented for the&#xD;
      release of records to a single NCI-Designated Central Data Collection Center (CDCC), which&#xD;
      will administer the annual mailings containing the annual study update questionnaire and a&#xD;
      brief (1-2 page) risk factor questionnaire. Individuals who do not consent to release their&#xD;
      identifiers to the CDCC will be followed up passively through linkage to state cancer&#xD;
      registries and the National Death Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol Review Application is for (1) the collaboration of intramural scientists in the&#xD;
      Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) in the Additional Studies and (2) the&#xD;
      coordination, in collaboration with DCP, of the Extended Follow-up.&#xD;
