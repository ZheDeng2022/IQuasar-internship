  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HealthSpark is a community-based research network of childcare centers designed to improve&#xD;
      the health of children in Miami-Dade County. HealthSpark is the health component of SPARK&#xD;
      (Supporting Partnerships to Assure Ready Kids), a community coalition led by the Early&#xD;
      Childhood Initiative Foundation to improve school readiness in Allapattah/Model City and&#xD;
      Homestead/Florida City, two underserved Miami-Dade County communities. The goal of&#xD;
      HealthSpark I is to identify the health and healthcare needs of preschool children, then help&#xD;
      translate evidence-based intervention into community programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preschool children are at risk for developing health problems that affect school readiness&#xD;
      and that lead to significant health conditions through adulthood. Several decades of research&#xD;
      have demonstrated that early identification and intervention is the best approach to ensuring&#xD;
      healthy, successful children and adults. Despite advancements in our understanding of child&#xD;
      health, large gaps in services continue; especially for children in poverty and for&#xD;
      ethnic/racial minorities. National data supports the persistence of health disparities among&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In May 2004, the HealthSpark team began to collect data from the parents, child care center&#xD;
      directors, and local pediatricians in the two targeted communities. The HealthSpark I sample&#xD;
      included 681 assessments of parents with children ages three or four years old, 53 child care&#xD;
      center directors, and 30 primary care pediatricians. The parent assessments were conducted in&#xD;
      person at the child care center. Additionally, in September 2004 four focus groups were&#xD;
      conducted in the three primary languages of the communities, English, Spanish, and Creole. A&#xD;
      content analysis was done on these sessions to determine the most prominent issues in each&#xD;
      location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence rates for obesity (38.0%) and asthma (29.3%) among the children the team surveyed&#xD;
      were well above the national averages (20% and 7.4%). Despite high rates of health problems,&#xD;
      roughly 10% of families reported not being able to get medical care for their child when they&#xD;
      needed it, compared to the national average of 1.7% and a state of Florida average of 3.0%.&#xD;
      HealthSpark also discovered that 20.9% of children are not properly restrained in motor&#xD;
      vehicles. This statistic raises particularly high concern due to the fact that motor vehicle&#xD;
      accidents are a leading cause of death among children and proper restraint in a vehicle is&#xD;
      one step towards overcoming this statistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to health care is especially important for children with special health care needs. Of&#xD;
      the total population, 8.7% need or use more medical care, mental health, or educational&#xD;
      services than the average child. While this is low in comparison to the national average&#xD;
      (12.8%), it still accounts for a significant portion of the population and demonstrates the&#xD;
      need to ensure all children have appropriate access to care. Even though the majority of the&#xD;
      children HealthSpark surveyed had some form of health insurance, 11.3% did not have any. This&#xD;
      number is higher than the national average (9.5%) and raises concern over why specific&#xD;
      barriers to access healthcare have not been broken down. During focus group sessions, parents&#xD;
      described what specific issues were preventing them from either accessing medical care or not&#xD;
      getting their children enrolled in the proper insurance program; these problems varied by&#xD;
      region. Families located in the Allapattah/Model City region have access to Jackson Memorial&#xD;
      Hospital and clinics but described long waiting times before they were able to see a&#xD;
      physician. In contrast, families in Homestead/Florida City had more prevalence of uninsured&#xD;
      children and are limited by their lack of access to transportation. Few families have cars&#xD;
      and many described having to walk several miles in order to use public transportation. Many&#xD;
      parents are not satisfied with the quality of healthcare their children are receiving,&#xD;
      especially for families in the Homestead/Florida City area. Among the 43 healthcare&#xD;
      professionals who deliver most of the pediatric primary care in these communities, 42.9% are&#xD;
      not board-certified and only 26.2% are members of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In HealthSpark I, we discovered child health issues existed in large part because of the lack&#xD;
      of care and resources families in Miami-Dade County are receiving. However, even if every&#xD;
      family had access to a high quality pediatrician the health of children in these two areas&#xD;
      would not immediately improve. Interventions with a high level of collaboration among child&#xD;
      care centers, pediatricians, and health educators will be the first step to improving the&#xD;
      health of children within these two communities. In HealthSpark II, the intent is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that improved coordination and cooperation among professionals and families will&#xD;
      improve child health. The resources already exist in each community. In the initial&#xD;
      HealthSpark survey, a network of child care centers and pediatricians interested in improving&#xD;
      the health environment of the children in their community were identified. The HealthSpark&#xD;
      team plans on helping these professionals come together and form a relationship that will&#xD;
      improve and address the health needs of families.&#xD;
