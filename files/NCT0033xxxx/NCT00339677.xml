  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the structure of error in self-reporting instruments on diet, in&#xD;
      following up the Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition Study (OPEN) conducted in 1999 and&#xD;
      2000. The OPEN study, the largest of its kind, resulted in a wealth of nutritional biomarker&#xD;
      data-measurable indicators of changes in organisms at the level of molecules or cells. A&#xD;
      biomarker could help in understanding how environment and disease are related and about&#xD;
      disease risks. Furthermore, its findings showed that the relative estimates of disease risk&#xD;
      may be weakened by a food frequency questionnaire and a 24-hour questionnaire. Scientists&#xD;
      have long recognized that self-reported information from questionnaires and interviews&#xD;
      contains errors, but there has been uncertainty about the structure of such errors. For the&#xD;
      proposed study, a food record and a food checklist-adjusted food frequency questionnaire will&#xD;
      be compared with the previously used questionnaires, to determine whether the newer study&#xD;
      instruments present less chance of measurement error. The results may provide better tools&#xD;
      for a study on nutritional epidemiology, that is, the incidence and other aspects of disease&#xD;
      and nutrition. OPEN study participants will be invited for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who completed the 1999-2000 study who are not currently pregnant or a liquid weight&#xD;
      loss diet may be eligible for this study. The original study recruited men and women 40 to 69&#xD;
      years of age. A letter with summary results from the original OPEN study will be sent to each&#xD;
      of the 482 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the Food Record and the food checklist, called the Daily Food List, are instruments to&#xD;
      be given. The Food Record asks the participant to record all foods and beverages consumed.&#xD;
      The Daily Food List asks respondents to write in to the number of times a limited number of&#xD;
      food categories are consumed. In addition, respondents will be asked to complete the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ), identical to the one that they completed&#xD;
      in the original OPEN study, regarding the previous 12 months. Participants will randomly be&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups. All will receive four study mailings over a 3-month period:&#xD;
      the DHQ, First 4-Day Food Record (4-day FR), Second 4-day FR, and Booklet of 7-Day Food Lists&#xD;
      (7-day FL), the latter listing selected foods that the participants will mark if consumed on&#xD;
      the reporting day. Study Group A will receive the DHQ, first 4-day FR, second 4-day FR, and&#xD;
      7-day FL. Study Group B will receive the DHQ, 7-day FL, first 4-day FR, and second 4-day FR.&#xD;
      Within 10 days after receiving the DHQ, participants will be called to schedule an&#xD;
      appointment for a 30- to 45-minute visit. Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete the Physical Activity Questionnaire (by telephone for those who have moved out&#xD;
           of the local area or are unable to attend the visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have weight measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be asked about whether he or she has recently developed certain medical conditions,&#xD;
           experienced dramatic changes in diet, or gained special education in nutrition&#xD;
&#xD;
      The completion time for each instrument in dietary assessment is approximately as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DHQ-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each 4-day FR-80 minutes (20 minutes a day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7-day FL-35 to 49 minutes (5 to 7 minutes a day).&#xD;

      NCI carries out extensive research and surveillance activities that rely on self-reported&#xD;
      dietary information from questionnaires and interviews. Although scientists have long&#xD;
      recognized that this information contains error, considerable uncertainty remains about its&#xD;
      structure. The interpretation of findings from NCI's nutritional epidemiology and&#xD;
      surveillance efforts is critically dependent on the assessment of dietary measurement error.&#xD;
      We evaluated such measurement error in the previously conducted Observing Protein and Energy&#xD;
      Nutrition Study (OPEN) conducted in 1999 and 2000. This study, the largest study of its kind,&#xD;
      used unbiased biomarkers of dietary intake (doubly labeled water for energy and 24-hour&#xD;
      urinary nitrogen for protein) to assess measurement error in dietary assessment methods&#xD;
      commonly used in epidemiology and surveillance research around the world. The landmark&#xD;
      findings indicate that relative risk estimates in nutritional epidemiology may be severely&#xD;
      attenuated by the use of food frequency questionnaires and that the conventional use of&#xD;
      24-hour dietary recalls as reference measurements may lead to severe underestimates of the&#xD;
      extent of this attenuation. Key questions remain regarding whether these findings hold in&#xD;
      diverse populations, for other dietary-report or physical activity instruments, across&#xD;
      varying nutrients and food groups, and how measurement error affects relative risks in&#xD;
      existing prospective cohorts. In light of the OPEN study findings, we would like to&#xD;
      re-contact participants, for whom we already have a wealth of nutritional biomarker data, in&#xD;
      order to assess the structure of measurement error with respect to two other self-reported&#xD;
      dietary assessment instruments: the food record and a food checklist-adjusted food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire. Our intent is to evaluate whether these instruments might have more favorable&#xD;
      measurement error structure than the food frequency questionnaire, thereby providing better&#xD;
      tools for nutritional epidemiology.&#xD;

&#xD;
        As this is a follow-up to a previous study with NCI SSIRB approval, there will be no&#xD;
        recruitment of new participants. In the original OPEN study, we recruited a sample of men&#xD;
        and women between 40-69 years of age. This age group represents those most likely to be&#xD;
        recruited for large-scale epidemiological studies of diet and cancer. It is in this same&#xD;
        group that we seek to assess measurement error problems for other dietary assessment&#xD;
        instruments.&#xD;
