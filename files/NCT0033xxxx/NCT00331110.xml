  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to assess the effects of an ankle strap on the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      laterally-wedged insole with ankle strapping in reducing knee symptoms and improving static&#xD;
      and dynamic lower limb biomechanics. Using a repeated measures, modified cross-over design,&#xD;
      the following aims and hypotheses will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of the insole with ankle strapping significantly alters hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle&#xD;
           towards 180Â° or talar valgus angulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of the insole with ankle strapping significantly reduces peak knee external varus&#xD;
           moment during gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use of the insole with ankle strapping significantly reduces foot external rotation&#xD;
           (out-toeing) or widened base during gait analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The radiographic HKA angle and tilt angle of the talus will predict knee peak external&#xD;
           varus moment during gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The use of an insole with ankle strapping over a two-week period will reduce knee pain&#xD;
      (Visual analogue scale, and Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Survey).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a common cause of pain and disability and the medial&#xD;
      compartment is involved most frequently. If conservative mechanical therapies could reduce&#xD;
      knee OA symptoms, risks to patients might be minimized through reduction in use of&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy or surgery. A lateral heel wedge with strapping of the ankle joint has been&#xD;
      reported to induce a similar therapeutic effect to that of proximal tibial osteotomy. It is&#xD;
      presumed that the mechanism for this involves correction of genu varum. However, the effects&#xD;
      on the static lower limb mechanical axis and the dynamic knee adduction moment, a risk factor&#xD;
      for knee OA symptoms and progression, have not been assessed, so the mechanism of effect is&#xD;
      currently unknown. The proposed protocol would compare lower limb mechanical alignment&#xD;
      (measured by radiographic hip-knee-ankle angle) and dynamic knee varus moment (measured by&#xD;
      3-dimensional gait analysis) with and without the strapped insole to further understanding of&#xD;
      the mechanism of effect on subjects with knee OA. Additionally, this protocol would assess&#xD;
      analgesia and whether use of the insole reduces known knee joint unloading compensatory&#xD;
      mechanisms during gait. Through measurement of radiographic lower limb alignment, dynamic&#xD;
      knee varus moment, and ankle/foot static and dynamic angles, a model would be developed&#xD;
      relating radiographs with dynamic moments, potentially allowing greater risk stratification&#xD;
      for knee OA development and progression through use of radiographs. In addition to&#xD;
      elucidating the mechanism of effect of this insole and developing a model for radiographic&#xD;
      interpretation, this protocol would be the fist study of this insole involving non-Japanese&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects aged 45 or over will be included if they have predominantly medial&#xD;
             compartment knee OA by American College of Rheumatology criteria, with medial knee&#xD;
             pain rated at least 40/100mm on a visual analogue scale on most days of the month&#xD;
             during one of the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 35 will be excluded to&#xD;
             avoid the potential confounding effect of increased weight on the height of the&#xD;
             insole. Other exclusion criteria will include: known injury or surgery involving bone&#xD;
             or cartilage of the knee or ankle which may alter gait, history of factors which might&#xD;
             alter response to use of a laterally wedged insole (e.g. greater or similar reduction&#xD;
             in lateral compared with medial femorotibial jont space width on posterior-anterior&#xD;
             radiographs, tibial osteotomy, congenital foot problems, fused joints, foot deformity,&#xD;
             known limitation of range of motion of the subtalar joint), known neuromuscular&#xD;
             disease, co-morbid disease which might confound gait analysis (e.g. hip OA, ankle OA,&#xD;
             hallux rigidus, valgus deformity of the midfoot, other symptomatic deformity of the&#xD;
             foot, advanced arthroplasty of the hindfoot, previous ankle arthrodesis, unable to&#xD;
             walk without a gait aid), current use of an orthotic insole, inability to comply with&#xD;
             study protocol.&#xD;
