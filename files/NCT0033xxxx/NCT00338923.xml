  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter pilot study to assess the healing effects of HO/03/03 on diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathic plantar and venous ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HO/03/03 action mechanism involves the manipulation of keratinocyte and fibroblast migration&#xD;
      and differentiation at the wound area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary end point of this study is assessment of safety in treating with HO/03/03&#xD;
           and the efficacy of the drug to promote wound closure of chronic wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary end points are assessment time to closure and healing rate for the&#xD;
           measurement of wound healing progression.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter pilot study to assess the healing effects of HO/03/03 on diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathic plantar and venous ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretreatment phase: During a pretreatment phase that will last up to 14 days, all patients&#xD;
      will receive the conventional treatment once a day at the discretion of the investigator. All&#xD;
      wounds will be morphologically monitored by photo documentation daily and measurements of&#xD;
      wound area once a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial study visit: patients will begin treatment after completing all necessary demands in&#xD;
      pre-treatment phase or after ruling out of all exclusion criteria. All wounds will be cleaned&#xD;
      from previous treatment by surgical debridement and irrigation (saline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase: Following the pre-treatment phase, wounds will be treated topically with&#xD;
      HO/03/03 for 30 days. During this 30 day phase, patients will receive daily treatments with&#xD;
      HO/03/03 either at home by a certified nurse or at the clinic. Wounds will be monitored by&#xD;
      certified medical staff member as well as photo documentation. Then application of the&#xD;
      treatment followed by a 15-minute rest. Finally wound will be dressed with a fresh dressing&#xD;
      and monitoring of any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be administered HO/03/03 in addition to weight off-load Once a week wounds will&#xD;
      be monitored by a physician: wounds size will be determined and documented. Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated for pain sensation at the wound area by filling a pain scoring questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twice during the experiment patients will undergo blood profile, HbA1c, blood glucose, and&#xD;
      urine samples testing at the initial and terminating visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the treatment phase the following will be completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of all blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests (dip sticks);&#xD;
