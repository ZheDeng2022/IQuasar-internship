  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative pulmonary hypertension is a risk factor for right ventricular failure and an&#xD;
      increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Several treatments have been used to treat and reduce post operative pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
      Unfortunately none of these treatments are approved for use in this condition and only one&#xD;
      (inhaled nitric oxide) is specific enough to pulmonary hypertension to not cause dangerous&#xD;
      low blood pressure in the rest of the body. Sadly, inhaled nitric oxide is difficult and&#xD;
      expensive to use, and can cause lung damage. Sildenafil citrate is quite specific to the lung&#xD;
      vessels, is easy to administer and does not easily cause low blood pressure in other areas of&#xD;
      the body. We hypothesize that oral sildenafil 12.5mg will decrease the baseline (pre-dose)&#xD;
      mPAP by at least 20% compared with a placebo.&#xD;

      Sildenafil citarte is a selective pulmonary vasodilator without profound effects on systemic&#xD;
      hemodynamics making it an attractive option for treating post operative pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension in the cardiac surgical patients. It is inexpensive and feasible to administer.&#xD;
      Intravenous as well as oral doses have been shown to reduce the mean pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in animal models as well as in&#xD;
      clinical trials with adults with primary pulmonary hypertension and children after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery . However, no data exists to support the safety and efficacy of Sildenafil citrate in&#xD;
      the adult cardiac surgical population. The purpose of this study is to further investigate&#xD;
      the potential role of Sildenafil citrate to treat post operative pulmonary hypertension in&#xD;
      the cardiac population.&#xD;
