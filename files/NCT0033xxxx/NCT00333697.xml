      To determine the rate of thromboembolic complications (including death attributed to&#xD;
      thromboembolic disease) in patients with a score rated as &quot;DVT likely&quot; on a formalized&#xD;
      scoring system, when anticoagulation therapy is withheld on the basis of a negative&#xD;
      comprehensive duplex ultrasound examination. Participants are followed for three months after&#xD;
      a normal ultrasound to determine if any symptoms attributable to deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      develop. Any such symptoms are verified by objective tests.&#xD;

      Design: Prospective clinical cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: 193 sequentially enrolled patients evaluated for suspected symptomatic deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis of the leg, reporting to the LDS Hospital or Intermountain Medical Center&#xD;
      Peripheral Vascular Laboratory. Vascular technicians will screen patients for study entry&#xD;
      with a simple questionnaire. Those meeting screening criteria will then be interviewed by the&#xD;
      study coordinator to verify they meet inclusion criteria, have no exclusions, and provide&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and medical history information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study clinical variables are obtained from the enroller interview and electronic medical&#xD;
      record at entry and included in a computerized clinical database. They include age, sex,&#xD;
      weight, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and clinical information necessary to create the&#xD;
      pre-test clinical score. Demographic information and basic biometrics (gender, height,&#xD;
      weight, leg circumference) will be obtained and recorded by the study coordinator. Informed&#xD;
      consent documents will be obtained and stored according to the policies of the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board. All female patients will undergo urine or serum pregnancy testing prior to&#xD;
      study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: A research clinician will perform a brief clinical assessment specific for&#xD;
      determining pre-test probability of DVT prior to evaluation with diagnostic tests. This&#xD;
      formalized scoring system has been validated in a prior study. Patients with a clinical score&#xD;
      of &quot;DVT unlikely&quot; will undergo comprehensive duplex ultrasonography. If normal, patients will&#xD;
      be followed for clinical events as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients not studied(comprising a group with lower pre-test probability of DVT) will go on to&#xD;
      diagnostic testing and further care by the referring physician. Demographic information will&#xD;
      be used in the descriptive portions of the study to demonstrate risk prevalence, but patients&#xD;
      will not be followed for clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scoring system to determine pre-test probability is that described by Wells et al.&#xD;
      Patients with a score corresponding to &quot;DVT Unlikely&quot; will be tested and treated according to&#xD;
      the treating clinicians, and are not followed for outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive, real-time B-mode ultrasonography with color Doppler analysis (CDU) will be&#xD;
      performed on patients with a pre-test probability of &quot;DVT Likely.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized technique will be used for the CDU examination. Compressibility of the veins&#xD;
      will be assessed. The results will be categorized as normal if all imaged venous segments are&#xD;
      fully compressible, as abnormal if a noncompressible segment is identified, or as inadequate&#xD;
      for interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interpretation will be performed by experienced vascular surgery staff according to protocols&#xD;
      currently in use at LDS Hospital and Intermountain Medical Center. Findings will be redacted&#xD;
      to specific data fields by the interpreting surgeon according to a form generated for this&#xD;
      purpose. The form will be completed by the interpreting surgeon and added to the patient&#xD;
      logbook for entry into the database by the data entry clerk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interobserver variability will be limited by using a priori criteria for a positive and&#xD;
      negative study and by using only interpreters privileged by Intermountain Healthcare to&#xD;
      interpret vascular studies, who have substantial experience and expertise. Interobserver&#xD;
      agreement for this technique has been found to be high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the result of initial CDU is normal (no DVT identified), anticoagulation will be withheld,&#xD;
      regardless of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the result of testing is abnormal (DVT identified), anticoagulation will be given unless&#xD;
      contraindicated, according to established protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects whose results are classified as inadequate for interpretation will have reasons&#xD;
      logged and be excluded from analysis. They will receive further management according to the&#xD;
      discretion of the emergency physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-up Patients in the observation cohort (negative CDU) will be undergo three&#xD;
      months of clinical follow-up, a strategy used in many diagnostic trials for DVT. Patients&#xD;
      will be instructed to return immediately to our emergency department if they have symptoms or&#xD;
      signs of venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. A thromboembolic disease specialist will&#xD;
      assess them at 3 months by telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the follow-up assessment, an interval history will be taken with emphasis on specific&#xD;
      symptoms (including leg pain, tenderness and swelling, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and&#xD;
      syncope), hospitalization, interval evaluation for DVT or PE and use of anticoagulants. For&#xD;
      all patients who die, the cause of death will be determined from autopsy or by independent&#xD;
      clinical review if autopsy cannot be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the follow-up assessment will be entered on a data sheet by the assessing&#xD;
      clinician created for this purpose. This sheet will be added to the logbook by the study&#xD;
      coordinator and information appended to the database by the data entry clerk. The evaluating&#xD;
      clinician will refer patients for appropriate testing for thromboembolic disease based on&#xD;
      clinical suspicion. Patients suspected of having deep vein thrombosis will be referred for&#xD;
      compression ultrasonography. If CDU is abnormal, patients will be treated with&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapy. If normal, patients will be referred for venography (the current&#xD;
      gold standard test) to exclude the diagnosis of DVT. Patients suspected of having pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism will undergo objective testing with ventilation-perfusion lung scanning and, if&#xD;
      indicated, pulmonary angiography or high-resolution computed tomography. Qualified physicians&#xD;
      blinded to the subject's cohort will perform interpretation of all testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures and Statistical Comparisons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure will be venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism (VTE) and death from&#xD;
      thromboembolic disease during follow-up confirmed by objective testing in the 3 months&#xD;
      following enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be designed to estimate the event rate of thromboembolic disease and death&#xD;
      attributable to thromboembolic disease in the normal cohort during the three-month follow-up&#xD;
      period. An exact 95% confidence interval that excludes a rate of VTE of 3% will be defined as&#xD;
      clinically acceptable, in accordance with previous trials of DVT diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjudication of outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A panel of three independent physicians with established expertise in venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      will be named to adjudicate all suspected events of VTE and all diagnostic tests for VTE&#xD;
      occurring during the follow-up period. Simple majority will resolve disputes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological Issues and Avoidance of Bias Entering consecutive patients into the study will&#xD;
      avoid selection bias. To avoid bias during the initial testing period, we have established&#xD;
      pre-defined criteria for negative and positive studies. Further diagnostic testing on&#xD;
      patients with negative results will not be undertaken unless dictated by follow-up&#xD;
      evaluation. Patients in the observation cohorts will not be treated and therapy will be given&#xD;
      to all patients with positive results. Diagnostic suspicion bias will be avoided by&#xD;
      objectively testing all patients who return during follow-up with symptoms or signs&#xD;
      suggestive of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Interpretation bias will be&#xD;
      avoided by obtaining independent interpretation of follow-up testing in patients with&#xD;
      suspected disease. The interpreter will be blinded to the results of the initial ultrasound&#xD;
      and the cohort to which the patient belongs. All deaths will be independently reviewed. The&#xD;
      reviewer will be blinded to the cohort to which the patient belongs. Patient confidentiality&#xD;
      will be maintained by keeping the patient identity log separate from the database, which will&#xD;
      use only unique numerical identifiers. Complete data tracking will be assured by comparison&#xD;
      of enrollment log and database by independent reviewer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis and Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics for age, sex, symptoms at presentation (pain, tenderness, duration of&#xD;
      symptoms), clinical conditions (recent surgery, recent hospitalization, cancer, congestive&#xD;
      heart failure, recent immobilization, recent childbirth, cellulitis, superficial phlebitis&#xD;
      and family history of thromboembolic disease) and the pre-test probability score will be&#xD;
      calculated to characterize the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The event rate of thromboembolic complications and death from thromboembolic disease will be&#xD;
      calculated for patients in the two observation cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-sided confidence interval for the event rate (objectively verified venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism) will be calculated for the observation cohort by exact methods. If this&#xD;
      confidence interval excludes the commonly accepted threshold event rate of 3%, we will&#xD;
      conclude that the diagnostic strategy is clinically valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also describe the clinical characteristics of clots and other endpoints when those&#xD;
      data are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 193 patients who meet eligibility criteria was chosen so that an exact 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval would exclude an event rate of venous thromboembolism in the observation&#xD;
      cohort of 3%. Excluding an event rate of 3% is the commonly accepted standard by which&#xD;
      diagnostic strategies are deemed clinically acceptable.&#xD;
