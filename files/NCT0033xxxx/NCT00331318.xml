      This study will determine if applying electrical stimulation of the brain can influence&#xD;
      training to perform finger movements. The study may provide information that can be used to&#xD;
      design rehabilitation therapies for people who have lost the ability to move a part of their&#xD;
      body, such as an arm, leg, or hand following a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18-50 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened&#xD;
      with a medical history, physical examination, MRI (if one has not been done within the last&#xD;
      year), questionnaire to evaluate memory and attention and a pregnancy test for women who can&#xD;
      become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have the following tests and procedures in seven sessions over about 8 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires to test attention, fatigue and mood before, during and after each session&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surface electromyography: Electrodes are filed with a conductive gel and taped to the&#xD;
           skin over one small hand muscle to measure the electrical activity of muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation: A wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief electrical&#xD;
           current passes through the coil to stimulate the brain. During the stimulation, the&#xD;
           subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions.&#xD;
           The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the subject&#xD;
           may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) before and during motor training: Small, wet&#xD;
           sponge electrodes are applied to the head - one above the eye and the other on the back&#xD;
           of the head. A small electrical current is passed between them. The subject may feel an&#xD;
           itching or tingling sensation under the electrodes or see light flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor learning under tDCS: tDCS is repeated while the subject performs the training&#xD;
           task. The training task consists of performing voluntary brisk thumb movements in a&#xD;
           direction opposite to TMS-induced movement directions, during 30 minutes. Training&#xD;
           blocks are in 10-minute segments and tDCS is applied during the first 20 minutes.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training leads to performance improvements and motor learning. Cortical plasticity associated&#xD;
      with training (use-dependent plasticity, UDP) contributes to performance improvements after&#xD;
      brain lesions such as stroke. Recently, several interventional strategies have been proposed&#xD;
      to enhance UDP, including pharmacological approaches and brain stimulation. The magnitude of&#xD;
      improvements identified with these techniques is limited. It would be very useful to enhance&#xD;
      UDP beyond the limited effects of previously proposed interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One strategy recently proposed to enhance the effect of brain stimulation techniques on the&#xD;
      cerebral cortex is metaplasticity. This strategy focuses on the purposeful manipulation of&#xD;
      cortical activity before applying brain stimulation. For example, previous work demonstrated&#xD;
      that the magnitude of increase in cortical excitability elicited by stimulation of the&#xD;
      primary motor cortex (M1) is more prominent if stimulation is applied on a hypoactive M1. An&#xD;
      initial down-regulation of M1 activity (i) amplifies the effect of a subsequent intervention&#xD;
      that increases M1 activity, and (ii) reduces inter-individual variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown if this metaplasticity strategy can enhance the beneficial effects of anodal&#xD;
      tDCS (tDCS anodal) on training effects as it does with cortical excitability, an issue of&#xD;
      scientific and clinical interest, and the overall hypothesis of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we will test the hypothesis that metaplasticity (tDCS cathodal) followed by tDCS anodal&#xD;
      plus motor training will result in more prominent UDP than control interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 healthy adult volunteers for parameters estimation plus 25 healthy adult volunteers (total&#xD;
      = 31 healthy adult volunteers)&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, down-regulation of M1 activity will be accomplished by applying tDCS&#xD;
      cathodal, a tool extensively described in the literature to induce this effect. Therefore, we&#xD;
      will test the effects of this metaplasticity intervention on the beneficial action of tDCS&#xD;
      anodal to M1 in combination with motor training (MT). After a familiarization session,&#xD;
      subjects will participate in 6 randomized sessions in a cross-over design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preconditioning tDCS cathodal followed by Intervention tDCS anodal plus MT Purpose&#xD;
           Target metaplasticity condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preconditioning Sham followed by Intervention Sham plus MT Purpose Effects of motor&#xD;
           training alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Preconditioning Sham followed by Intervention tDCS anodal plus MT Purpose Mild&#xD;
           improvement in training effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Preconditioning tDCS cathodal followed by Intervention Sham plus MT Purpose Effects of&#xD;
           tDCS cathodal alone on MT&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Preconditioning tDCS anodal followed by Intervention Sham plus MT Purpose Effects of&#xD;
           polarity on tDCS effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Preconditioning tDCS anodal followed by Intervention tDCS anodal plus MT Purpose Control&#xD;
           for the metaplasticity condition&#xD;
&#xD;
      MT will consist of brisk repetitive thumb movements in a direction opposite to the baseline&#xD;
      direction of thumb movements evoked by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), in a&#xD;
      well-characterized UDP protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure reflecting the encoding of a motor memory will be the increased&#xD;
      proportion of TMS-evoked movements falling within the target training zone (TTZ) as a&#xD;
      function of MT and metaplasticity interventions.&#xD;
