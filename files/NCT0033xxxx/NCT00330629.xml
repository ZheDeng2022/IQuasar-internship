      We propose to add a treatment preference component to a larger study testing standard&#xD;
      behavioral treatment (SBT) for weight loss without specific food group restriction vs&#xD;
      standard behavioral treatment with gradual elimination of meat, poultry, and fish [a&#xD;
      lacto-ovo-vegetarian (LOV) meal plan]. Eligible respondents will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      conditions: Treatment Preference-Yes/No. Individuals in the Treatment Preference-Yes will be&#xD;
      assigned to their choice (SBT or SBT+LOV), those in Treatment Preference-No will be&#xD;
      randomized to either SBT or SBT+LOV without regard to their preference.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both groups will receive the behavioral treatment program (32 sessions over 12 months) that&#xD;
      has been used successfully in numerous behavioral weight loss studies conducted by Dr.&#xD;
      Wing.42-44 The Treatment Preference-Yes and -No Groups will meet on separate evenings to&#xD;
      avoid contamination across the conditions but will be led by the same multidisciplinary team&#xD;
      (behavioral scientists, nutritionist, exercise physiologist). A brief description of elements&#xD;
      common to both groups follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Sessions: Groups will meet for 45-60 minutes weekly for Months 1-6, bi-weekly for&#xD;
      Months 7-9, and monthly for Months 10-12. Participants will be weighed, receive nutritional&#xD;
      and behavioral counseling, turn in the weekly diaries, and receive homework assignments at&#xD;
      the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Restrictions: Calorie Goal. Participants will receive an individualized calorie goal&#xD;
      calculated from baseline body weight (1200 calories &lt; 200 lbs; 1500 calories for &gt; 200 lbs),&#xD;
      used successfully in previous studies.42 Fat Goal. Fat gram goals will approximate 25% of&#xD;
      calories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity and Exercise: Participants will gradually increase their exercise,&#xD;
      primarily walking, until they reach a minimum goal of 150 minutes per week (a caloric&#xD;
      expenditure of 1000 calories/wk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Strategies to Use in Changing Eating and Exercise Habits: The central features&#xD;
      follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal setting: daily/weekly goals for calorie and fat consumption, exercise time, and behavior&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-monitoring: systematically observing and recording one's behavior,45,46 which will be&#xD;
      reviewed by the therapists, and written feedback will be provided to reinforce positive&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulus control: behavioral strategies designed to assist participants in altering their&#xD;
      environment, minimize the cues that might trigger problematic behaviors, and add cues to&#xD;
      increase activity.10 Problem solving: consists of 5 steps: identifying the problem;&#xD;
      brainstorming solutions; evaluating the pros/cons of each potential solution; implementing&#xD;
      the solution plan; and evaluating its success.47,48 Social assertion: use assertive skills in&#xD;
      situations that may threaten their meeting eating/exercise goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback: therapists monitor the recorded behavior changes and provide&#xD;
      feedback/encouragement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive strategies: taught how to recognize patterns of negative thought that can interfere&#xD;
      with behavior change, how to counter these negative thoughts, and to use positive&#xD;
      self-statements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse prevention: recognize situations that place them at risk for lapses49 Maintenance:&#xD;
      weight loss maintenance will be addressed, identify their own problems related to maintaining&#xD;
      their new patterns of eating/exercising, develop problem-solving strategies.50-53&#xD;
      Reinforcement: provide a magazine subscription to reinforce what is learned in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ensuring dietary adequacy: diaries will be reviewed weekly for energy intake and expenditure&#xD;
      and for nutrient adequacy. A dietitian will be part of the team reviewing the diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incentives: will be given a monetary incentive for completing the paper-and-pencil&#xD;
      instruments, Three-Day Food Record, and appointment for phlebotomy at 6, 12, and 18 months,&#xD;
      and for completing the Final Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Session on Risk of Cholelithiasis: A brief (~15-20 minutes with Questions and&#xD;
      Answers to follow) educational session will be provided to study participants informing them&#xD;
      of risk factors for cholelithiasis. The information presented will include predisposing risk&#xD;
      factors (i.e., overweight/obesity at baseline, rapid weight loss, inadequate calorie and fat&#xD;
      gram intake) and guidelines for reducing risk for cholelithiasis (i.e., safe rate of weekly&#xD;
      weight loss, minimal caloric and fat gram intake per day). Participants will also be provided&#xD;
      with an informational letter on cholelithisis risk factors and risk reduction and will be&#xD;
      asked to sign this letter and return it to the staff on the project, to be placed in their&#xD;
      study participant files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c.6.2. Dietary Intervention The treatment conditions will differ in eating plans and breadth&#xD;
      of content (e.g., cooking classes, grocery shopping field trips) to better assist and support&#xD;
      SBT+LOV participants develop their skills to implement and maintain the vegetarian meal plan.&#xD;
      The differences are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c.6.2.1. Group 1: Dietary Intervention for the Standard Behavioral Treatment Group&#xD;
      Participants in this condition will receive the standard behavioral treatment (SBT) described&#xD;
      above. Food tastings will be held at the sessions and will focus on fat modified food&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c.6.2.2. Group 2: Dietary Intervention for the SBT+LOV Group Diet: In addition to SBT,&#xD;
      participants will aim to eliminate all meat, poultry, and fish from their diet over the first&#xD;
      6 weeks, and will be taught how to select appropriate substitutes for these foods, such as&#xD;
      low- or no-fat dairy products (cheeses, milk), and protein-containing vegetable sources (soy&#xD;
      products, legumes). The focus will be on the elimination of meat products as a means to&#xD;
      reduce fat intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-monitoring: In addition to energy intake/expenditure, record the number of meat meals&#xD;
      eaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social support for dietary changes: One session will be offered: an overview of the eating&#xD;
      pattern, how to merge different eating styles in one family, how to dine at the same&#xD;
      restaurant, and how to attend family and social functions. Participants will be encouraged to&#xD;
      bring family members. Family members will not be considered as subjects in the study and will&#xD;
      not be asked to provide any information. They will be there as guests to receive information&#xD;
      that may allow them to better support their family member who is participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modeling: Practicing vegetarians will share strategies on making the transition to a&#xD;
      vegetarian diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ensuring dietary adequacy: Menstruating females will be instructed to use vegetarian sources&#xD;
      of iron (e.g., legumes, dark leafy greens, dried fruits) and to use iron supplements if their&#xD;
      iron intake does not appear adequate on their reported diet. Hemoglobin will be measured at&#xD;
      each assessment point and results will be reported to patient's physician if value is below&#xD;
      normal. The cost for this test will be covered by the grant.&#xD;
