      This study, conducted by the National Cancer Institute and the University of Oklahoma, will&#xD;
      look for changes in cervix cells and other samples that may be signs of cervical disease.&#xD;
      Human papilloma virus, or HPV, is a common infection of the genitalia in women that usually&#xD;
      goes away by itself. If HPV infection does not go away, it might turn into cancer of the&#xD;
      cervix, although this is rare. This study will examine why many HPV infections go away and&#xD;
      why a few persist and lead to cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women 18 years of age and older who are referred for colposcopy (examination of the vagina&#xD;
      and cervix using an instrument with a magnifying lens) at the University of Oklahoma&#xD;
      following Pap smear diagnosis may be eligible for this study. Women will be in one of the&#xD;
      following diagnostic categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer: Stage 1-2 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Precancer: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HPV-infected: Positive for any of the 13 known cancer-causing HPV types, but not&#xD;
           diagnosed with cancer or CIN3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal: Negative for cancer-causing HPV and normal tissue laboratory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire: Covers demographic information (such as age, race, ethnicity, marital&#xD;
           status, etc.), pregnancy history, menstrual and sexual history, contraceptive history,&#xD;
           hormone medication history, medical history, smoking history, physical development,&#xD;
           family history, and health care access.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test: 2 tablespoons of blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colposcopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure to collect a sample of cervical cells and fluids for HPV testing and research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the past twenty years, large epidemiologic natural history studies have played a crucial&#xD;
      role in achieving our current understanding of cervical neoplasia. We now know that human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) infection is necessary but not sufficient cause of cervical cancer.&#xD;
      Cervical pathogenesis evolves as follows: normal 'yields' oncogenic HPV infection 'yields'&#xD;
      precancer 'yields' invasive cancer. The majority of women with oncogenic HPV infections will&#xD;
      not develop cancer, and most HPV infections, even those with associated cellular changes,&#xD;
      regress in 1-2 years, probably eradicated or controlled by cellular immune response.&#xD;
      Morevoer, while invasive cancer and precancer are histologically welldefined, the&#xD;
      histological classification of low-grade lesions, now better defined as HPV infection, is&#xD;
      very heterogeneous and poorly reproducible. Identifying women at highest risk for cancer&#xD;
      prior to neoplastic progression is therefore a challenge. At present, we are unable to&#xD;
      predict with any accuracy which HPV infections will progress and which are among the majority&#xD;
      that regress. Currently, cytologic, histologic, and to some extent, HPV DNA assays are the&#xD;
      basis for triage, treatment, and follow-up. While this approach has permitted successful&#xD;
      cervical cancer prevention efforts, millions of women are diagnosed each year with HPV&#xD;
      infections, and because of the inability to distinguish those who will progress from those&#xD;
      who will regress, many women are over-treated as a result. It is therefore of etiologic&#xD;
      interest and of public health benefit to develop a method for identifying the HPV-infected&#xD;
      women at risk for progressing to precancer and invasion. To develop an accurate and&#xD;
      reproducible division of precursor lesions (HPV infection and precancer) will require gaining&#xD;
      knowledge about the molecular distinctions at each progressive disease state. Our goal is to&#xD;
      therefore comprehensively assess biomarkers of risk for progressive cervical neoplasia, and&#xD;
      thus develop a new set of biomarkers that can distinguish those at highest risk of cervical&#xD;
      cancer from those with benign infection. Specifically, we will initially implement a&#xD;
      cross-sectional study to develop a comprehensive list of potential risk biomarkers by&#xD;
      examining cervical tissues of women with normal, HPV infection, precancer, and cancer. They&#xD;
      will measure gene expression profiles to gain an accurate and comprehensive in vivo picture&#xD;
      of cervical neoplasia carcinogenesis. We propose to then validate the most promising&#xD;
      identified candidate biomarkers in a prospective design by assessing their predictive values&#xD;
      for key outcomes related to progression (HPV persistence, diagnosis of precancer) or&#xD;
      non-progression (HPV clearance).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All women who are referred for cervical colposcopy to the University of Oklahoma will be&#xD;
        considered eligible for the study. These women will be categorized into four groups: (i)&#xD;
        cancer, (ii) precancer, (iii) HPV-infected, and (iv) normal. Cancers will be limited to&#xD;
        women diagnosed with early cancer (Stage 1-2) to minimize potential disease effects.&#xD;
        Precancers will be defined as women diagnosed histologically with cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
        neoplasia 3 (CIN3). This is a highly specific and well-reproduced diagnosis which&#xD;
        effectively represents carcinoma in situ. All women testing DNA positive for any of the 13&#xD;
        known oncogenic HPV types (HPV-infected), but not diagnosed with CIN3 or cancer (all&#xD;
        stages) will be placed in the HPV-positive group. This group will therefore encompass all&#xD;
        HPV-infected women diagnosed with either cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1), CIN2,&#xD;
        low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), atypical squamous cells of undetermined&#xD;
        significance (ASCUS), atypical glandular cells of underdetermined significance (AGUS), or&#xD;
        found cytologically normal. Women referred to the colposcopy clinic but found to be&#xD;
        negative for oncogenic HPV and normal upon histological diagnoses will be eligible as&#xD;
        normal controls; this approach will be an ethical method for collecting biopsies from&#xD;
        essentially &quot;normal&quot; women as there are many benign &quot;look alike&quot; conditions that are ruled&#xD;
        out in colposcopy clinics. While this group may not be a random sample of the general&#xD;
        population, the use of specimens from these women as controls will ensure a group of women&#xD;
        who are truly confirmed as having no neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women attending the clinic solely for vaginal colposcopies will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
        Women who are under 18 years of age or pregnant at the visit will also be excluded from the&#xD;
        study. In addition, women who have had prior treatment (women coming to the clinic for a&#xD;
        follow-up visit subsequent to treatment (women coming to the clinic for a follow-up visit&#xD;
        subsequent to treatment or women coming for their initial clinic visit following&#xD;
        pretreatment with chemotherapy or radiation) will be excluded. All women with known HIV or&#xD;
        AIDS will be excluded from the study. This information will not be readily available unless&#xD;
        the woman has previously been seen at the University of Oklahoma clinic. This event is&#xD;
        considered rare; recent studies of HIV and AIDS by the University of Oklahoma from the same&#xD;
        population have been terminated due to the lack of HIV/AIDS detected in the population.&#xD;
