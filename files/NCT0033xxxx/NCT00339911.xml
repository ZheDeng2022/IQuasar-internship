      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      -NCI-Frederick scientists performing in vitro studies involving human specimens have a need&#xD;
      for a reliable and consistent source of samples which protects the donor from research risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The purpose of this protocol is to establish a centralized repository for the collection and&#xD;
      distribution of samples (either blood, buccal mucosal cells, semen, urine, or nail clippings)&#xD;
      from paid, healthy volunteer donors for in vitro research conducted by NIH investigators&#xD;
      located at NCI-Frederick and Ft. Detrick. Research will include, but are not limited to,&#xD;
      genotype analysis, immune function studies, drug screening, vaccine development, method&#xD;
      development, quality control testing of reagents, and propagation of infectious agents,&#xD;
      including HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy NCI-Frederick employees and other NIH staff located at Ft. Detrick will be recruited.&#xD;
      Potential donors will be excluded if screening indicates exposure to HIV, HTLV, Hepatitis C&#xD;
      or Hepatitis B virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators requesting to participate to the Research Donor Program (RDP) by receiving&#xD;
      samples for research use will be required to submit a written memo of request, briefly&#xD;
      describing the nature of the research and providing assurance that samples provided through&#xD;
      this protocol will be used solely for in vitro research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These Investigators will receive samples that will be either anonymous or coded, depending on&#xD;
      the specific need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Codes will be securely maintained and under no circumstances will donor identity be released&#xD;
      to Investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will receive financial compensation for their time, discomfort and inconvenience&#xD;
      according to an established schedule; compensation for blood donation is based on the volume&#xD;
      donated....&#xD;
