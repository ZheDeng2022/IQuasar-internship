      This project is a collaboration between the Centre Regional de Medecine Traditionnelle (CRMT)&#xD;
      of the Malian National Institute of Public Health Research (INRSP) and the Section on&#xD;
      Socioenvironmental Studies (SSES). These units developed a three-pronged protocol reflecting&#xD;
      their joint and individual concerns:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effects of occupational complexity on psychological functioning. The project tests a&#xD;
           theory derived from previous SSES research demonstrating that in industrialized&#xD;
           societies doing relatively self-directed, substantively complex work increases&#xD;
           self-directed orientations to self, society and family and promotes effective&#xD;
           intellectual functioning. It uses sociological survey methodology to determine the&#xD;
           generalizability of this theory to an essentially pre-literate, preindustrial society.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effects of work-related stress on mental health. Earlier SSES work demonstrated that&#xD;
           stressful work conditions lead to distress in industrialized societies. This project&#xD;
           extends the investigation of these effects to a non-industrialized setting. It also&#xD;
           extends the investigation of work-related stress to include work-related migration,&#xD;
           resting a hypothesis that relates equally to SSES and CRMT concerns: that individuals&#xD;
           from rural ethnic groups with a cultural tradition of work-related migration will show&#xD;
           fewer mental health problems when migrating for nontraditional work than those from&#xD;
           cultures without such a tradition. Mental health problems are assessed through: a)&#xD;
           adaptations of standard survey-based psychological measures of components of distress,&#xD;
           b) general and culture-specific survey-based psychiatric screening questions, and c) a&#xD;
           psychiatric interview conducted by a CRMT psychiatrist trained in internationally&#xD;
           accepted diagnostic procedures and knowledgeable about local cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The effects of migration and cultural and socioeconomic factors on AIDS-related&#xD;
           knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. The survey addresses concern regarding the degree of&#xD;
           knowledge about the nature of AIDS among rural Malians who are relatively isolated from&#xD;
           urban oriented sources of information about culturally non-traditional issues. It also&#xD;
           examines how socio-cultural background and migration for work affect AIDS related&#xD;
           attitudes and self-reported behaviors in an African society where estimates of HIV&#xD;
           prevalence are still relatively low (less than 2%), compared to those of other&#xD;
           sub-Saharan African countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these prongs are distinguishable, each requires a longitudinal design, a&#xD;
      representative sample, extensive information about responders' social and cultural&#xD;
      backgrounds, occupational histories, work conditions, and personal orientations and beliefs.&#xD;
      Because of their overlapping theoretical approaches and methodological requirements,&#xD;
      combining them in one project increases the richness and efficiency of the data collected for&#xD;
      each.&#xD;

      Because of their overlapping theoretical approaches and methodological requirements,&#xD;
      combining them in one project increases the richness and efficiency of the data collected for&#xD;
      each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The division of responsibility between SSES and CRMT is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The survey questionnaire is the product of SSES/CRMT collaboration. It has been check by&#xD;
           Malian linguists, extensively pretested by CRMT, and found feasible to administer and&#xD;
           likely to provide highly reliable data with sufficient variance to permit the testing of&#xD;
           our hypotheses. The project has been independently review and approved by the relevant&#xD;
           Malian IRB the Ethics Committee and the Medical School of the University of Mali.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data Collection involves conducting structured sociological interviews with&#xD;
           representative rural samples from three Malian ethnic groups, carrying out psychiatric&#xD;
           interviews with respondents who fail the psychiatric screen. The collection, processing&#xD;
           and coding of the data is the responsibility of CRMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Analysis is primarily the responsibility of the SSES, which receives the data in a&#xD;
           form in which individual respondents cannot be identified.&#xD;
