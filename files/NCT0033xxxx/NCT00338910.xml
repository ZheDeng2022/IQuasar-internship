      The primary objective of this study is to describe a possible effect of metronidazole on PK&#xD;
      of budesonide in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effect of budesonide on metronidazole steady-state PK (primarily described as area under&#xD;
           the concentration-time-curve).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol (being a marker of CYP3A activity) and cortisol excretion&#xD;
           before and during metronidazole multiple-dose co-administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Safety parameters.&#xD;
