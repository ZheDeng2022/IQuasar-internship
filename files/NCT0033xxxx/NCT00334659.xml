      The purpose of this study is to confirm that apricitabine does not induce any clinically&#xD;
      significant effect upon electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters at doses consistent with the&#xD;
      maximum exposure expected to occur in clinical practice.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No clinically significant medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinically significant findings on complete physical examination, including blood&#xD;
             pressure, pulse rate and 12-lead ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal clinical safety laboratory results at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to sign an informed consent document indicating understanding the&#xD;
             purpose of and procedures required for the study and willingness to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

          -  Willing and able to stay in the clinic for the in-patient activities required by the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of clinically relevant pathology that could interfere with the study results&#xD;
             or put the subject's safety at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recurrent disease that may affect the action, absorption or disposition of&#xD;
             the study treatment, or clinical or laboratory assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or relevant previous history of serious, severe or unstable (acute or&#xD;
             progressive) physical or psychiatric illness, any medical disorder requiring treatment&#xD;
             or that may make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study, or any condition&#xD;
             that presents undue risk from the study treatment or procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of febrile illness within the 5 days prior to the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody or HIV test result at&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;

             excess of 5 cigarettes per day (or equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participated in a clinical study involving an investigational drug within 30 days or 5&#xD;
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation of one pint or more within 56 days of the start of the study.&#xD;

          -  Plasmapheresis or plasma donation within 30 days of the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Single 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt; 450 msec at screen. A single repeat ECG may be&#xD;
             done at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
