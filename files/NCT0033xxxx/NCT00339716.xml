      Iodine-131(131I) and other radioisotopes of Iodine are contained in fallout from atmospheric&#xD;
      nuclear weapons tests and are among the radionuclides most likely to be released in a nuclear&#xD;
      reactor accident. In spite of nearly 50 years of experience, the risk of thyroid disease,&#xD;
      especially thyroid cancer, attributable to exposure to 131I remains unknown, although the&#xD;
      carcinogenic potential of x-ray and gamma-ray exposure of the thyroid is reasonably well&#xD;
      known. The available data also indicate that children face greater risks of radiation-induced&#xD;
      thyroid cancer than do adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nuclear power plant accident at Chernobyl released large quantities of 131I and other&#xD;
      radioisotopes of iodine into the atmosphere, contaminating thousands of square kilometers and&#xD;
      exposing millions of people. It is proposed that a well-defined subset of Belarussian&#xD;
      children aged 0-18 years at the time of the accident be examined by well-trained specialists&#xD;
      for thyroid disease at least biennially for up to 30 years. A cohort of 15,000 children has&#xD;
      been identified, all of whom had their thyroids measured for radioactivity during the weeks&#xD;
      immediately following the accident. Under a rigid research protocol these children will&#xD;
      receive complete diagnostic thyroid examinations, including palpation, ultrasound scanning,&#xD;
      thyroid hormone and other laboratory tests, and fine-needle aspiration, as appropriate.&#xD;
      Cancer will be determined by expert pathology examination of tissue. In addition to the&#xD;
      analysis of thyroid radiation measurements made in May-June, 1986, efforts will be made to&#xD;
      reconstruct each person's exposure and to estimate the radiation doses to the thyroid. This&#xD;
      will involve the reconstruction of deposition patterns and environmental pathways of the&#xD;
      radioiodines, and of the location, dietary characteristics, and lifestyle of each person&#xD;
      throughout the exposure period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed to evaluate the relationship, if any, between thyroid disease,&#xD;
      especially cancer, and the radiation dose to the thyroid, with emphasis on the dose from&#xD;
      131I. The primary focus will be on dose-response analyses of person-year incidence data with&#xD;
      stratification by sex, age at exposure, geographic area, time, and age at risk. Confounding&#xD;
      factors, e.g., use of potassium iodide (KI) as a prophylactic measure, will be evaluated and&#xD;
      controlled in the analysis, and the uncertainty of the dose estimates will be taken into&#xD;
      account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to producing risk coefficients for thyroid cancer and other thyroid diseases in&#xD;
      children as a function of sex and age at the time of exposure, it is expected that the&#xD;
      analyses will contribute new knowledge of the carcinogenic effectiveness of 131I in&#xD;
      comparison with that of x-ray and gamma radiation. This information will fill a major gap in&#xD;
      the world's knowledge of radiation effects, and will provide guidance for radiation&#xD;
      protection and public health policies wherever nuclear reactors are in operation.&#xD;

      The nuclear power plant accident at Chornobyl released large quantities of Iodine-131 and&#xD;
      other radioisotopes of iodine into the atmosphere, contaminating thousands of square&#xD;
      kilometers and exposing millions of people. For this study, a well-defined subset of&#xD;
      Belarusian children under age 18 years at the time of the accident were identified and&#xD;
      examined by well-trained specialists for thyroid disease every two years for three cycles.&#xD;
      The study is a collaborative effort of researchers in Belarus and the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort includes approximately 12,000 persons who were children in 1986, all of whom had&#xD;
      their thyroids measured for radioactivity during the weeks immediately following the&#xD;
      accident. Under a rigid research protocol these subjects received diagnostic thyroid&#xD;
      examinations, including palpation, ultrasound scanning, thyroid hormone and other laboratory&#xD;
      tests. If indicated, they were referred for a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Interview&#xD;
      information regarding residential, health, diet and lifestyle history are also collected. All&#xD;
      subjects were followed for thyroid cancer morbidity and mortality. Overall, 163 cancers were&#xD;
      identified. Interviews with mothers of the subjects who were less than 10 years of age at the&#xD;
      time of the accident whose memory of events proved inadequate increased the total accrual to&#xD;
      13,552.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on thyroid radiation measurements made in May-June, 1986, and other information&#xD;
      (reconstruction of deposition patterns and environmental pathways of the radioiodines, and of&#xD;
      the location, dietary characteristics, and lifestyle of each person throughout the exposure&#xD;
      period), each person s radiation dose to the thyroid was estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the early and late morphologic and functional changes in&#xD;
      the thyroid glands of young persons exposed to radiation from radioactive materials released&#xD;
      as a consequence of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant accident, with emphasis on dose- and&#xD;
      time-specific changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active screening for thyroid cancers ended in September 2006. The third and final thyroid&#xD;
      screening examinations were completed in September 2006, identifying 163 cases of thyroid&#xD;
      cancer during the examination period. Subject accrual through screening is no longer ongoing.&#xD;
      Thyroid and other cancer case ascertainment is underway by linkage to the Belarusian Cancer&#xD;
      Registry. A paper has been published on the radiation dose response for prevalent thyroid&#xD;
      cancer and analyses of incident cancer cases and other thyroid disease are ongoing.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will include about 3,000 individuals born in Belarus from April, 26, 1986 through March,&#xD;
        31, 1987 who were exposed to internal and external sources of ionizing radiation during&#xD;
        prenatal and early postnatal periods due to the Chernobyl fallout.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the purpose of individual dose reconstruction we need to establish child-mother pair&#xD;
        for each cohort member and conduct personal dosimetric interview with child s mother. We&#xD;
        anticipate that some of the eligible subjects will be deceased at the time of the cohort&#xD;
        construction. Deceased subjects will not be included in the cohort. Excluded from the&#xD;
        interview study and the subsequent follow-up study will be those who are deceased, cannot&#xD;
        be located, refuse to participate in the study, or do not provide informed consent.&#xD;
