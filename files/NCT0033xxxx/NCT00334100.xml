      The purpose of the study is to determine whether treadmill training is safe and beneficial in&#xD;
      patients with walking difficulty because of multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous&#xD;
      system, which can cause episodic, static or progressive disability. Frequently, MS causes&#xD;
      weakness and spasticity of the legs leading to gait abnormalities and immobility.&#xD;
      Rehabilitation has been widely used in MS but has been the subject of limited investigation.&#xD;
      In particular, traditional thinking in MS providers was that aerobic exercise could cause&#xD;
      worsening of symptoms in some patients and should generally be avoided. Recent studies&#xD;
      suggest that both aerobic exercise is tolerated by most patients and improves fitness. In a&#xD;
      recent study however, training with bicycle ergometers did not translate into improved&#xD;
      biomechanics of gait. This suggests that aerobic training may need to be coupled to task&#xD;
      specific training to produce improved gait. With recent changes in medical care focusing on&#xD;
      cost containment, studies supporting the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies from the stroke literature suggest that task specific training may be useful in&#xD;
      promoting motor reorganization in the cortex, reversing muscle wasting and improving&#xD;
      cardiovascular de-conditioning. In particular, we have examined the use of treadmill training&#xD;
      in patients with chronic hemiparesis due to stroke and have found that a course of training&#xD;
      can improve walking ability, can cause an increase in motor representation of the effected&#xD;
      limb as measured by fMRI, can increase muscle mass as measured by thigh CT and muscle biopsy,&#xD;
      and can improve cardiovascular fitness as measured by treadmill stress testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed is a pilot study testing a program of treadmill training in patients with chronic&#xD;
      leg weakness and spasticity due to MS causing chronic gait problems. The primary objectives&#xD;
      of this pilot study are to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of the treadmill training&#xD;
      program in MS patients and to obtain preliminary data on outcomes to use to determine the&#xD;
      sample size for a larger trial designed to document efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Forty MS&#xD;
      patients with impaired ambulation will be randomized to a 3 month program of treadmill&#xD;
      training or a 3 month education and counseling program with attention equal to the treadmill&#xD;
      trained group. Both groups will be followed for a total of 6 months. The treadmill training&#xD;
      will be carried out in the Senior Exercise Research Center at the Baltimore VAMC. Outcome&#xD;
      measures will include measures of leg strength and spasticity, disability (EDSS), walking&#xD;
      ability, cardiovascular fitness, Quality of Life, depression, and healthcare costs and&#xD;
      utilization (compared to the year prior to enrollment). The results of this pilot study will&#xD;
      be used to design and gain support for a study sized to measure efficacy and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
