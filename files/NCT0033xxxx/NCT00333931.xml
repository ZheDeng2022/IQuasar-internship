  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify changes in brain functioning which are related to&#xD;
      reduced frequency and/or intensity of impulsive aggressive actions after treatment of&#xD;
      PTSD-related impulsive aggression with either phenytoin or cognitive behavioral therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective One: One study objective is to evaluate potential effect sizes of phenytoin and&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD-related impulsive aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Phenytoin and cognitive behavioral therapy are hypothesized to be effective in&#xD;
      the treatment of PTSD-related impulsive aggression based on studies previously outlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan: Patients enrolled in this pilot study will be randomized to receive an eight-week&#xD;
      course of treatment with phenytoin or cognitive behavioral therapy in the Trauma Recovery&#xD;
      Program at the Veterans's Affairs Medical Center in Houston, Texas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Two: Another study objective is to begin to attempt to delineate potential neural&#xD;
      correlates of treatment-related reductions in PTSD-related impulsive aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Potential neural correlates of treatment-related reduction in intensity and/or&#xD;
      severity of impulsive-aggressive acts are hypothesized to include changes in: 1) thalamic&#xD;
      activation reflecting more effective thalamic sensory gating, with anticipation of increased&#xD;
      activation of the thalamus post-treatment 2) activation of brain regions associated with&#xD;
      verbal information processing, with the anticipation of increased activation of these regions&#xD;
      post-treatment 3) activation of prefrontal regions, including the anticipation of increased&#xD;
      activation of the medial and/or orbital prefrontal cortex post-treatment, 4) amygdalar&#xD;
      activation, with the anticipation of decreased activation of the amygdala post-treatment 5)&#xD;
      hippocampal activation, with the anticipation of increased activation of the hippocampus&#xD;
      post-treatment, and/or, 6) right-left hemispheric dissociation of brain processing of&#xD;
      stimuli, with the anticipation of greater degrees of bilaterality of brain processing of&#xD;
      stimuli post-treatment. Specifically, greater degrees of activation of left hemispheric brain&#xD;
      structures are anticipated in post-treatment fMRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan: Patients with PTSD-associated impulsive aggression will undergo an eight-week course of&#xD;
      treatment with phenytoin or CBT. Treatment-related changes in impulsive-aggressive acts will&#xD;
      be correlated with changes in brain activation comparing pre- and post-treatment fMRI scans&#xD;
      utilizing a standardized Go-No Go task which has been used in the study of impulsive&#xD;
      aggressive individuals.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Inclusion Criteria for both groups will be right-handed adult combat veterans over the&#xD;
        age of 18 who meet criteria for PTSD via Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-I, First,&#xD;
        2002) and Impulsive Aggression as the primary diagnoses. To be included in the study with a&#xD;
        designation of Impulsive Aggression, patients must have committed at least three aggressive&#xD;
        acts over the preceding three months meeting criteria for impulsive aggressive acts by&#xD;
        Impulsive/Premeditated Aggression Scales (IPAS) criteria (Stanford et al 2003) based on a&#xD;
        semi-structured interview of the patient and his/her significant other. An impulsive&#xD;
        aggressive act is defined as a hair-trigger, non-premeditated response to a stimulus that&#xD;
        results in an immediate aggressive act or an agitated state that culminates in an&#xD;
        aggressive act, which is clearly disproportionate to the triggering stimulus. Inclusion&#xD;
        criteria for both groups also includes the availability for participation of a significant&#xD;
        other who can participate in the study. The significant other will need to accompany the&#xD;
        study participant to the initial assessment interview and complete measures of aggressive&#xD;
        acts which have been committed by the study participants in the three months prior to the&#xD;
        start of the study, and aggressive acts during the previous two weeks at two-week interval&#xD;
        follow-up visits throughout the eight-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion Criteria for both groups will include exclusion criteria for MRI scanning,&#xD;
             and known claustrophobia requiring sedation in the past during MRI scanning. MRI&#xD;
             exclusion criteria will include metallic implants, implanted devices of any kind, such&#xD;
             as a cardiac pacemaker, cardiac defibrillator, insulin pump, vagal nerve stimulator,&#xD;
             cochlear implant, metallic splinters in the eye, ferromagnetic clips or metal in the&#xD;
             head or brain (as from previous injury or head/brain surgery including brain aneurysm&#xD;
             clipping), lead wires of any kind, clips or stints anywhere in the body, such as clips&#xD;
             for arterial aneurysm clipping, stints in cardiac arteries or other arteries anywhere&#xD;
             in the body, prosthetic heart valves, stapedial implants of any kind (implants in the&#xD;
             inner ear).&#xD;
