  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are cholesterol-lowering medications that are often prescribed for individuals with&#xD;
      high cholesterol and who are at risk for heart disease. Preliminary research has shown that&#xD;
      statins may have other effects on the body that are unrelated to the heart. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the impact of statins on mood, mental processes, aggression, and&#xD;
      serotonin levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals at risk for coronary artery disease are often prescribed statins, which are&#xD;
      medications that reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood. By lowering cholesterol&#xD;
      levels, these individuals have a lower incidence of heart disease, heart attacks, and stroke.&#xD;
      Simvastatin and pravastatin are two common statins that are often prescribed for individuals&#xD;
      with high cholesterol. While statins are effective at lowering cholesterol levels, their&#xD;
      effect on mood, behavior, and aggression has not been widely studied. Preliminary research&#xD;
      has shown that lowering cholesterol levels may lead to an increase in aggressive behaviors&#xD;
      and a change in cognitive function. Serotonin, a type of neurotransmitter, is believed to&#xD;
      play an important role in the regulation of mood, as well as behavior and cognition. The&#xD;
      direct effect of statins on serotonin levels remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of simvastatin and pravastatin on mood, cognition, aggression, and&#xD;
      serotonin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll individuals who do not currently take cholesterol-lowering&#xD;
      medications. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 20 mg of simvastatin, 40 mg of&#xD;
      pravastatin, or placebo for 6 months. Study visits will occur at baseline and Months 1, 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 8. Height, weight, and waist circumference will be measured at all study visits. Blood&#xD;
      and urine will be collected for laboratory testing, and standardized psychological&#xD;
      questionnaires will assess cognition, aggression, mental flexibility, memory, depression,&#xD;
      sleep quality, and quality of life at Months 1, 6, and 8. At Month 3, medication side effects&#xD;
      will be monitored and a liver function test will be performed. Participants' partners will&#xD;
      take part in a telephone interview at this time. At baseline and Month 6, some participants&#xD;
      will undergo cardiac reactivity testing. During this procedure, participants will be&#xD;
      videotaped and monitored for vital sign changes (blood pressure and heart rate) while they&#xD;
      talk about potentially stressful situations.&#xD;
