      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      ifosfamide, etoposide, and topotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one&#xD;
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy before surgery&#xD;
      may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;
      Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is&#xD;
      not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating Ewing's&#xD;
      sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy and topotecan&#xD;
      to see how well they work compared with combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed localized Ewing's sarcoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the event-free and overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed localized&#xD;
           Ewing's sarcoma treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, vincristine,&#xD;
           etoposide, and ifosfamide with vs without topotecan hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the side effects of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate initial tumor size as a prognostic factor for event-free survival of these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate histological response as a prognostic factor for event-free survival of these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continue evaluation of biologic markers both as related to prognosis and as eventual&#xD;
           therapeutic targets via encouraging concurrent enrollment on COG-AEWS02B1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate radiologic response by positron emission tomography as a prognostic factor for&#xD;
           event-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (≤&#xD;
      17 vs ≥ 18 years of age) and primary tumor site (pelvic vs nonpelvic [including extra-osseous&#xD;
      Ewing's sarcoma]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive vincristine IV over 1 minute once a week on day 1 in weeks 1-3,&#xD;
           7-9, and 13-15; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 2 in weeks 1,&#xD;
           7, and 13; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1 in weeks 1, 7, and 13; and&#xD;
           ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 4, 10, and&#xD;
           16. Patients undergo local therapy comprising surgical resection in approximately week&#xD;
           18 and/or radiotherapy beginning in approximately week 19. Patients then receive&#xD;
           vincristine as above in weeks 19-21, 28-30, 34-36, 40-42, and 46-51; dexrazoxane&#xD;
           hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 2 and doxorubicin hydrochloride as above&#xD;
           in weeks 19 and 28; cyclophosphamide as above in weeks 19, 28, 34, 40, 46, and 49; and&#xD;
           ifosfamide and etoposide as above in weeks 22, 25, 31, 37, and 43.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive vincristine IV over 1 minute once a week on day 1 in weeks 1-3,&#xD;
           7-9, and 13-16; topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and&#xD;
           13; cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 13 and IV over 1 hour&#xD;
           on day 1 in weeks 7 and 16; ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1 hour on&#xD;
           days 1-5 in weeks 4 and 10; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1&#xD;
           and 2 in weeks 7 and 16. Patients undergo local therapy comprising surgical resection in&#xD;
           approximately week 18 and/or radiotherapy beginning in approximately week 19. Patients&#xD;
           then receive vincristine as above in weeks 19-21, 28-33, 37-42, and 46-48; topotecan&#xD;
           hydrochloride as above in weeks 19, 31, and 40; cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes in&#xD;
           weeks 19, 31, and 40 and IV over 1 hour in weeks 28, 37, and 46; ifosfamide and&#xD;
           etoposide as above in weeks 22, 25, 34, 43, and 49; dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV over 15&#xD;
           minutes on days 1 and 2 in weeks 37 and 46; and doxorubicin hydrochloride as above in&#xD;
           weeks 28, 37, and 46.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 528 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
