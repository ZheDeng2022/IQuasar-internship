      1. Main objective: To test the efficacy of anakinra treatment in children or young adults&#xD;
           with corticosteroid-resistant or -dependent Systemic-Onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis&#xD;
           (SO-JIA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Design: Double blind, randomized trial testing the efficacy of one month Anakinra&#xD;
           treatment versus placebo (2 groups of 12 patients each). All the patients will be&#xD;
           treated with anakinra during the following 11 months and the dose of corticosteroids&#xD;
           will be gradually tapered (= descriptive part of the trial to assess the tolerance and&#xD;
           efficacy over 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypothesis: 70% significant improvement after 1 month in Anakinra-treated patients&#xD;
           versus no more than 10% in the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Main inclusion criteria : diagnosis of SO-JIA (Durban consensus conference criteria),&#xD;
           age: 2 to 20 years at inclusion, active, corticosteroid-resistant or -dependent disease,&#xD;
           no previous IL-1ra treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SO-JIA (Edmonton's revision of Durban's consensus conference criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: at least 2 years and less than 20 years at treatment initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease duration of at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure of corticosteroid treatment or requirement for corticosteroid treatment at a&#xD;
             daily dose equal to or over 0.3 mg/kg (10 mg in patients whose weight is over 34 kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active and severe systemic symptoms and/or arthritis as assessed by an experienced&#xD;
