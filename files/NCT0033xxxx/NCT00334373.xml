  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare post-conditioning to standard angioplasty (50/50&#xD;
      chance) in patients who present with an acute heart attack and are taken directly for an&#xD;
      angioplasty procedure. Post conditioning is a procedure that involves balloon inflation&#xD;
      followed by deflation in a series of cycles that appears to show (based on early data) that&#xD;
      it can decrease the amount of damage to the heart muscle as compared to standard angioplasty&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: For Subjects undergoing direct PCI for STEMI, post conditioning with cycles of&#xD;
      balloon inflation/deflation within the first minute following the re-establishment of&#xD;
      coronary blood blow, will decrease the amount of irreversible myocardial damage assessed by&#xD;
      delayed enhancement contrast CMR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients who suffer a myocardial infarction, the blood flow usually ceases due to plaque&#xD;
      rupture leading to thrombus formation and vessel occlusion. The resultant entity is known as&#xD;
      ST Elevation segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) and is a significant health issue in&#xD;
      industrialized countries. There are over 50,000 STEMI's every year in Canada and up to 10% of&#xD;
      these patients die in hospital and another 10% die within the first year after their heart&#xD;
      attack. The more common problem however is not death, but irreparable damage to the left&#xD;
      ventricle leading to LV dysfunction and subsequent heart failure and arrythmias.&#xD;
      Re-establishing blood flow promptly by administering plasminogen activators (lytics) or&#xD;
      mechanically by performing angioplasty is possible and has lowered the mortality rate&#xD;
      dramatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although reperfusion is necessary, it gives rise to an entity known as ischemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      where acutely re-establishing blood flow and oxygen levels of the heart has detrimental&#xD;
      effects. Clinically this is manifested as no-reflow that causes subsequent damage to the left&#xD;
      ventricle and decreases the beneficial affect of early reperfusion by PCI. The&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion effect sets off a molecular cascade of events involving unfavorable&#xD;
      interaction between neutrophils, platelets and endothelium, that is fairly well identified.&#xD;
      Efforts to pharmacologically block this effect have not proven to be particularly effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post conditioning follows from a concept of pre-conditioning in animals that showed a&#xD;
      decrease in myocardial infarct size. Pre-conditioning is not useful as it requires to be&#xD;
      performed prior to the development of ischemia/injury. Post conditioning in preliminary&#xD;
      studies with animals and one small study in humans have shown promising results for decrease&#xD;
      in infarct size. Post conditioning is a procedure of gradual conditioning in which the artery&#xD;
      is opened and closed in cycles with inflation/deflation of the culprit artery followed&#xD;
      immediately by standard PCI and placement of stent.&#xD;
