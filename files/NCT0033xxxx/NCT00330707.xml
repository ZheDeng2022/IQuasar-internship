      To compare the toxicity and efficacy of the combination of BCG and interferon alpha to&#xD;
      standard dose and low dose BCG alone in high risk superficial bladder cancer&#xD;

    <textblock>
      140 eligible patients with high risk superifical bladder cancer would be randomised to&#xD;
      receive standard dose BCG, low dose BCG or the combination of low dose BCG and interferon&#xD;
      alpha in a schedule of &quot;6+3&quot; weekly intravesical instillations. Patients would be closely&#xD;
      monitored with cystoscopy and urine cytology and intravenous urograms when indicated. Pre-and&#xD;
      post-instillation urine samples would be collected for cytokine analysis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (1) Patients must have completely resected, histologically?proven urothelial carcinoma of&#xD;
        the urinary bladder, stage Ta or Tl 1 ? 16 weeks prior to registration, and/or&#xD;
        carcinoma-in-situ on bladder biopsy. Central pathology review was mandatory. (2) Patients&#xD;
        with Stage Ta urothelial carcinoma must be judged to be at increased risk of tumor&#xD;
        recurrence by virtue of any one of the following: (a) Tumor recurrence during the 56 weeks&#xD;
        prior to registration, (b) Two or more initial tumors within 28 weeks, (c) Grade III&#xD;
        urothelial carcinoma during the 16 weeks prior to registration, (d) Dysplasia or&#xD;
        carcinoma-in-situ on random biopsy or (e) Positive urinary cytology post tumor resection.&#xD;
        &quot;Suspicious&quot; or &quot;suggestive&quot; cytology is insufficient for this criterion. (3) Patients who&#xD;
        have received prior intravesical therapy other than BCG were eligible provided they had not&#xD;
        undergone a course of any other intravesical agent within two months prior to entry. (4)&#xD;
        There was no age restriction; however, all patients registered had to be willing to be&#xD;
        available for 5?year follow up and to have a life expectancy of at least two years. (5)&#xD;
        Patients had a Karnofsky score &gt;50. (6) Women of child?bearing age were using effective&#xD;
        contraceptive methods. (7) Patients agreed not to take vitamin supplements (except for&#xD;
        those prescribed in the study) for the duration of the trial. (8) Pretreatment laboratory&#xD;
        tests and radiological examinations must have been obtained during the 16 weeks prior to&#xD;
        patient registration. (9) All patients had to be informed of the investigational nature of&#xD;
        this study, and had to sign a written informed consent in accordance with institutional&#xD;
        guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) Patients with medical illness or mental status, which would preclude cooperation&#xD;
             with the study. (2) Patients who were immunodeficient, or had received&#xD;
             immunosuppressive radiation therapy or chemotherapy. (3) Patients with urothelial&#xD;
             carcinoma of stage T2 or higher. (4) Patients who had evidence of urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
             of the upper urinary tract at the time of recruitment. (5) Patients who had received&#xD;
             radiation therapy for bladder cancer within one year prior to registration. (6)&#xD;
             Patients who had been previously treated with intravesical BCG. (7) Patients with&#xD;
             active tuberculosis.&#xD;
