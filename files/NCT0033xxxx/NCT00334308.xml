      The Question posed is: Does an barley protein concentrate have health benefits similar to&#xD;
      those demonstrated for soy protein foods which would justify the use of the non-fiber&#xD;
      components of barley as functional food ingredients? Hypotheses: 1. Cholesterol Lowering:&#xD;
      There is good evidence indicating that soy protein lowers serum cholesterol levels. The&#xD;
      evidence was strong enough for a health claim for coronary heart disease risk reduction to be&#xD;
      approved by the FDA. In addition, we have found that wheat gluten significantly reduced serum&#xD;
      triglyceride levels. However, there is a need to assess the possible health benefits other&#xD;
      vegetable protein sources. Barley is grown in relatively large amounts in Canada and barley&#xD;
      protein would be a readily available vegetable protein source if health attributes could be&#xD;
      ascribed to it. In addition other components of barley, including plant sterols and&#xD;
      phenolics, may have hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant properties. 2. Antioxidant: In&#xD;
      addition to cholesterol-lowering and possibly of equal importance in terms of prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and other chronic diseases, the barley phenolics associated with barley&#xD;
      protein and may have added benefits as antioxidants. 3. Markers of Inflammation: Barley&#xD;
      components are considered to be hypoallergenic. Hence their use in the cosmetic industry.&#xD;
      Auto-immune and inflammatory responses are associated with increased CHD risk. Barley protein&#xD;
      consumption may therefore reduce the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines; and the acute&#xD;
      phase proteins. 4. Arterial Dilatation: Barley proteins may also have beneficial effects on&#xD;
      vascular reactivity which may reduce CHD risk on account of their higher arginine:lysine&#xD;
      ratio. Arginine enhances nitric oxide synthesis associated with endothelial relaxation and&#xD;
      arterial dilatation. Barley may therefore increase pulmonary nitric oxide levels.&#xD;

      Design: The effect of oat protein extract will be assessed in one-month feeding studies of&#xD;
      forty healthy men and women with raised serum cholesterol levels. Two breads will be&#xD;
      prepared, one control and one providing 45 g/d barley protein to be fed for one month each in&#xD;
      a randomized crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diets: The diets will be the subjects' usual diets which appropriately will be NCEP Step 2&#xD;
      diets for patients treated without medications with this degree of hyperlipidemia. Those who&#xD;
      are not on an NCEP Step 2 diet will be instructed accordingly. During the first phase, the&#xD;
      two one-week recorded diets for each patient will be photocopied and returned to the patient&#xD;
      to be used as the dietary model for the subsequent period. We have found that this approach&#xD;
      is effective in stabilizing the diets in our soy protein studies. Supplements: Will be breads&#xD;
      with test and control supplements providing the identical daily energy intake. The increase&#xD;
      in protein in the barley supplements will be matched by the use of protein from milk protein&#xD;
      (casein). Similarly the increased polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids&#xD;
      in the test supplement will be matched by addition of an appropriate blend of oils in the&#xD;
      control. Baked goods will be prepared at our clinic and a seven-day supply will be provided&#xD;
      to each participant at the beginning of each week. The exact formulation of the supplements&#xD;
      will involve product development, palatability testing and chemical analysis of the&#xD;
      prototypes in the initial phase of the study. Compliance: compliance will be assessed from&#xD;
      completed weekly diet records where supplement intake is recorded daily. These records will&#xD;
      be reviewed by a dietitian with the subject at the end of the week. In addition, uneaten&#xD;
      supplements will be returned, weighed and noted on the menu plans by the dietitian. Diet&#xD;
      records will also be assessed to ensure the predetermined diet plan is followed according to&#xD;
      the phase one recorded diet.&#xD;
