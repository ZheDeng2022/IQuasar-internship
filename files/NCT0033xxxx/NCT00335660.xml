      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of AV608, a neurokinin 1 (NK-1)&#xD;
      antagonist, in subjects with Idiopathic Detrusor Overactivity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of AV608 in subjects with idiopathic detrusor overactivity. Female subjects&#xD;
      between 18 and 65 years of age with a diagnosis of Overactive Bladder Syndrome and urodynamic&#xD;
      observation of involuntary detrusor contractions during the filling phase will be eligible&#xD;
      for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will complete a baseline urodynamic assessment. All subjects who&#xD;
      participate in the study will receive 3 weeks of treatment with AV608 or placebo. At the end&#xD;
      of the treatment period, subjects will complete a second urodynamic assessment.&#xD;
