  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma surgery is performed on children less than 3 years old for infantile glaucoma which&#xD;
      untreated can cause blindness. Glaucoma is an uncontrolled high eye pressure in these&#xD;
      children often due to incomplete development of the part of the eye which normally allows&#xD;
      fluid to drain out of the eye. Two procedures are possible and equal in their success of&#xD;
      lowering the eye pressure. However, one (the goniotomy procedure) is preferred since it takes&#xD;
      10 minutes rather than 1 hour (for the trabeculotomy procedure) to perform under general&#xD;
      anesthesia. This is important in young children to reduce anesthesia exposure especially if&#xD;
      both eyes need surgery. If the glaucoma has caused the cornea or front of the eye to become&#xD;
      too cloudy, then the view is too poor to place a lens on the cornea and use a needle to&#xD;
      perform the shorter procedure. However, a small endoscope which has been FDA approved for use&#xD;
      in the eye will allow direct viewing of the area which needs treatment. A needle attached to&#xD;
      this endoscope allows the shorter goniotomy to be performed rather than proceeding to the&#xD;
      longer trabeculotomy procedure. The outcome measure of this study is anesthesia time and&#xD;
      reduction in intraocular pressure .&#xD;

      b. The standard examination under anesthesia initially will be performed including measuring&#xD;
      the child's intraocular pressure, measuring dimensions of the eye, examining the front of the&#xD;
      eye under the operating microscope, examining the portion of the eye where the fluid drains,&#xD;
      evaluating the back of the eye with an ultrasound, and possible documentation with&#xD;
      photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the diagnosis is confirmed by this examination, the eye or eyes will be carefully&#xD;
      evaluated for their clarity. If a standard goniotomy procedure can not be done, then the&#xD;
      endoscopic goniotomy will be performed. The procedure is identical with: cleaning the eyelid&#xD;
      skin, using a speculum to open the eyelids, making a small cut into the cornea, and placing a&#xD;
      viscoelastic substance into the eye to maintain its shape. The procedure then differs since&#xD;
      the inserted needle is attached to the viewing endoscope. I will then view the inside of the&#xD;
      eye on a TV monitor in addition to looking through the operating microscope. This will allow&#xD;
      me to directly see the structures which I will need to cut. Normally, I depend upon looking&#xD;
      through a lens placed on the cornea which must be fairly clear so that I can see to cut the&#xD;
      structures in the standard procedure. The procedure should not take much longer than the&#xD;
      standard goniotomy and the same amount of tissue will be cut as in a standard goniotomy. The&#xD;
      needle is then removed. The remainder of the procedure is identical which includes placing a&#xD;
      stitch in the corneal incision, adjusting the amount of fluid in the eye so the pressure is&#xD;
      not too low or high, giving a dilating drop, giving a steroid and antibiotic injection around&#xD;
      the eye, giving steroid ointment and an eye patch.&#xD;
