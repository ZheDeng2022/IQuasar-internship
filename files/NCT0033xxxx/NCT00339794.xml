      This study, conducted by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the National&#xD;
      Human Genome Research Institute, will characterize family physicians' attitudes and practices&#xD;
      related to the genetics of complex disorders. As the front line of care for most Americans,&#xD;
      family medicine will have a central role in seeing that new findings in genetics lead to&#xD;
      disease prevention and health improvements. The information gained from this study could be&#xD;
      useful in understanding and shaping the dissemination of genetic medicine in ways that&#xD;
      improve the standard of primary care practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the AAFP will be randomly selected from the organization's membership records to&#xD;
      be invited to participate in this two-phase study. The first phase is a web-based survey of&#xD;
      AAFP members. In the second phase, a sub-sample of those who complete the survey will be&#xD;
      re-contacted; half will be members who have enrolled in a year-long web-based curriculum&#xD;
      related to medical genetics, and the other half will be those who have chosen not to enroll&#xD;
      in the curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey questions relate to the physicians' practices, knowledge, and opinions about&#xD;
      implications of genomic medicine. Survey areas include family history taking; opinions about&#xD;
      the future of genetics and family medicine; information about the physician and his or her&#xD;
      practice; and physician's skills, attitudes and knowledge.&#xD;

      Although the evidence base for genetic susceptibility markers for complex disorders (e.g.,&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, and obesity) and the clinical utility of the related genetic tests&#xD;
      has not been demonstrated, all signs suggest that genetics will become increasingly relevant&#xD;
      to and integrated into family medicine. In recognition of these emerging genomic innovations&#xD;
      and their potential for improving primary care practice, the American Academy of Family&#xD;
      Physicians (AAFP), in collaboration with the National Human Genome Research Institute&#xD;
      (NHGRI), has made genomic medicine the topic of their 2005 Annual Clinical Focus curriculum.&#xD;
      The AAFP is one of the largest medical organizations with a membership that comprises a group&#xD;
      of 56,400 active family physicians who deliver care in a broad array of practice settings in&#xD;
      rural and urban communities around the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and&#xD;
      Guam. This study seeks to take advantage of the plans for AAFP's clinical focus on genomics&#xD;
      to characterize family physicians' attitudes and practices related to the genetics of complex&#xD;
      disorders. This information could be useful in understanding and shaping the dissemination of&#xD;
      genetic medicine in ways that improve the standard of primary care practice. To this end, we&#xD;
      propose to conduct two phases of research activity. In the first phase, a web-based survey&#xD;
      will be conducted of members of AAFP. In the second phase, a sub-sample of those who complete&#xD;
      the survey will be re-contacted; half will be members who have enrolled in a year-long&#xD;
      web-based curriculum related to medical genetics, and the other half will be those who have&#xD;
      chosen not to enroll in the curriculum.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The sampling frame for this study is the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)&#xD;
        membership (estimated at 54,600 active members). The majority of the members of AAFP are&#xD;
        physicians with a family physicians residency background (89%) who tend to practice in&#xD;
        urban (71%), private office settings (89%) and provide direct patient care (82%).&#xD;
