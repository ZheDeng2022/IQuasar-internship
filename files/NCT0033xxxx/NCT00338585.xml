  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to directly compare the safety and efficacy of intra-thrombus&#xD;
      alfimeprase 0.3 mg/kg with placebo in acute peripheral arterial occlusion (PAO) as measured&#xD;
      by a 30 day open vascular free surgery rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an unmet medical need to improve thrombolytic therapy in acute peripheral arterial&#xD;
      occlusion (PAO). Currently used plasminogen activators can result in increased circulating&#xD;
      levels of plasmin that result in a systemic &quot;lytic state&quot; that does not distinguish between&#xD;
      physiologic and pathologic thrombosis. In general, mean plasminogen activator infusion&#xD;
      durations of greater than 24 hours in order to achieve successful thrombolysis are&#xD;
      problematic in a disease where delayed restoration of arterial flow can lead to irreversible&#xD;
      ischemic damage. A direct thrombolytic agent like alfimeprase, with a rapid mechanism of&#xD;
      action and a potentially safer bleeding risk profile, could facilitate a rapid restoration of&#xD;
      arterial flow and avoidance of open vascular surgery.&#xD;

             with abrupt onset of ischemic rest pain or abrupt onset/progression of&#xD;
             lifestyle-limiting claudication are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute PAO with a need for urgent surgical intervention to restore arterial blood flow&#xD;
             in the event of unsuccessful thrombolytic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Available for follow-up assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to systemic anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of endovascular procedure or open vascular surgery on the index limb within&#xD;
             the past 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant acute or chronic kidney disease that would preclude contrast&#xD;
             angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to contrast agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of heparin induced thrombocytopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any study of an investigational device, medication, biologic, or&#xD;
             other agent within 30 days prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any thrombolytic therapy within 5 days prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past participation in any alfimeprase trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, lactating, or actively menstruating women or women of childbearing potential&#xD;
