  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bloodstream infections are common in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). The need of a central&#xD;
      venous line increases the risk of bacteremia and central venous catheter (CVC) related&#xD;
      infections. The use of catheters coated and/or impregnated with different antimicrobial&#xD;
      agents has been proposed to reduce the risk of such infections. However, results obtained so&#xD;
      far did not reach enough clinical relevance to consider these medicated catheters as a valid&#xD;
      alternative to the conventional ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this comparative randomized study is to assess the ability of recently developed&#xD;
      silver ion-releasing central venous catheters in preventing associated infections in&#xD;
      comparison with the conventional ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental groups are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: patients treated with standard, triple lumen, non medicated catheters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: patients treated with triple lumen catheters impregnated with silver&#xD;
           nanoparticles&#xD;

      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central venous catheter (CVC) infections are one of the major causes of infections acquired&#xD;
      in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. About 25% of bloodstream infections recorded in ICUs&#xD;
      are secondary to proven catheter-related infections and up to 80% of the so-called primary&#xD;
      bacteraemia may be caused by catheters. Pittet et al. have estimated that nosocomial&#xD;
      bloodstream infection, irrespective of its source, was associated with an overall 35%&#xD;
      attributable mortality and a prolonged hospital stay of 32 days, including 8 days in the ICU.&#xD;
      Prevention of catheter-related infections is a priority for infection control programs. Clear&#xD;
      preventive measures include strict barrier precautions during insertion and careful aseptic&#xD;
      techniques during subsequent manipulations of catheters. Other preventive measures, including&#xD;
      the use of catheters specifically designed to inhibit microbial colonisation, such as&#xD;
      antimicrobial-coated catheters, are not universally accepted or recommended for routine use,&#xD;
      also due to their high cost. Previous trials have demonstrated a 50% risk reduction of&#xD;
      infection rates when using antiseptic-coated catheters; however, their efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      catheter related bloodstream infections is still unclear. A new generation of silver&#xD;
      nanoparticle impregnated CVCs (Logicath AgTive®, Medex Medical INC., UK), has become recently&#xD;
      available, but no clinical trial documenting their activity in preventing microbial&#xD;
      colonization of catheters has been carried out so far. In this study, we want to assess the&#xD;
      ability of this new generation catheters to prevent short-term (&lt; 28 days) catheter-related&#xD;
      infections in critically ill patients, in comparison with conventional untreated catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutively admitted critically ill patients needing central venous catheterization for&#xD;
      more than 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL OBJECTIVE AND PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to test the ability of these new medicated catheters, to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of Central Venous Catheter Related Infections (CVCRI) in ICU patients. CVCRI&#xD;
      is defined as a positive culture from the catheter when hemoculture is concurrently positive&#xD;
      for the same microbial strain for at least two consecutive times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, open, controlled, parallel multicenter study involving 5 Italian ICUs&#xD;
      and the supporting clinical microbiology laboratories under the supervision of Prof. Massimo&#xD;
      Antonelli, for the clinical issues and Prof Gianfranco Donelli, for the microbiology issues.&#xD;
      Statistical evaluation of the data will be under the responsibility of Dott. Andrea De&#xD;
      Gaetano, belonging to the Biomatematic Laboratory of the Italian National Research Council&#xD;
      (CNR-IASI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point is the difference in raw percentage occurrence of CVCRI (on a patient&#xD;
      basis) between groups A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end-point are the infection-free time and the probability of CVCRI as a&#xD;
      function of multiple predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Internet-based randomization scheme, stratified by center, age and gender will be&#xD;
      employed, indicating the allocated treatment at the moment of enrollment. The randomization&#xD;
      procedure will require that when guide wire exchange is performed, a catheter from the same&#xD;
      allocation group (medicated or not medicated) is used. The treatment will be open to the&#xD;
      physician performing the procedure, and data collection will indicate group membership as A&#xD;
      and B in random order. While the data manager will hold the key to the group/treatment&#xD;
      associations, both the adjudication committee members (deciding on database record freezing)&#xD;
      and the statisticians performing the analyses will be blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insertion and maintenance of catheters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations will be provided to study centers to comply with maximal barrier precautions&#xD;
      during insertion and repositioning of catheters, if indicated. A transparent, semipermeable&#xD;
      dressing, will be provided to all the participating ICUs to be used after insertion, to allow&#xD;
      daily inspection of the insertion site. Subsequent dressings will be carried out as&#xD;
      clinically indicated, at 2 to 5 days intervals. Line tubing and three-way stopcocks will be&#xD;
      changed on the basis of each unit's protocol at 1 to 3 days intervals, although changing&#xD;
      these after each blood product transfusion and following the administration of lipid&#xD;
      solutions will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The catheter will be kept in place as long as required in the absence of complications.&#xD;
      Catheters will be removed when no longer required, or because of malfunction, when suspicion&#xD;
      of infection or otherwise unexplained bloodstream infection occurs; and in the presence of&#xD;
      gross inflammation or pus at the catheter insertion site. In situ treatment of catheter&#xD;
      infection will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be recorded upon inclusion: age, sex, date of hospital&#xD;
      admission and to the intensive care unit; underlying disease and severity (McCabe class);&#xD;
      admission category (medical, surgical, whether or not scheduled, or trauma), diagnosis and&#xD;
      primary organ failure on ICU admission. The severity score SAPS II, organ dysfunction and&#xD;
      SOFA score will also be recorded, as well as the presence of an active infection focus,&#xD;
      ongoing antibiotic therapy, and presence of other intravascular devices. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up to 48 hours after catheter removal. Data recorded will include: a) Mechanical&#xD;
      complication occurring during insertion (number of venipunctures, arterial puncture,&#xD;
      hematoma, pneumothorax); b) presence of local signs suggesting infection (erythema at the&#xD;
      catheter skin entry site, scored as 0: absence; 1+: &lt;5mm; 2+: 5-10mm; 3+: &gt;10mm; presence of&#xD;
      induration or purulence); c) presence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome or of&#xD;
      symptoms characterizing severe sepsis; d) Presence of other documented infection ; e) other&#xD;
      intravascular devices in place or inserted each day; f) dressing changes; g) Results of blood&#xD;
      and catheter-tip cultures, and of other clinically significant microbiological samplings; h)&#xD;
      antibiotics administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood cultures will be obtained when temperature is &gt; 38°2 or &lt; 36°5C. Diagnostic samples of&#xD;
      any other suspected infection foci will be taken as clinically indicated. Upon catheter&#xD;
      removal, the intravascular catheter tip will be cultured using the semi quantitative culture&#xD;
      described by Maki et al. (Maki DG, Weise CE, Sarafin HW. A semiquantitative culture method&#xD;
      for identifying intravenous-catheter-related infection. N Engl J Med 1977;296:1305-1309).&#xD;
      This technique involves rolling of the catheter distal tip on Agar plate and reading the&#xD;
      high-density colonization on a semiquantitative culture (more than 15 colonies on each&#xD;
      plate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible when insertion of a central venous catheter (CVC) at a new site&#xD;
      (subclavian or internal jugular) has to be planned for therapy or monitoring of at least&#xD;
      3-day duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Age below 18 years and all patients with a history of failed&#xD;
      catheterization attempts or the need for catheterization at a site of previous surgery,&#xD;
      skeletal deformity, or scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Clinical Evaluation (Adjudication) Committee composed of the two coordinating investigators&#xD;
      (Prof. Massimo Antonelli and Prof. Gianfranco Donelli) and the statistician (Dr. Andrea De&#xD;
      Gaetano) will assess, blindly with respect to the randomization group, the evaluability of&#xD;
      catheters and the classification of all episodes of bloodstream infection and of catheters&#xD;
      having a positive culture, according to the above definitions. Catheters will be excluded&#xD;
      from the analysis when insertion fails. Catheters that have not been adequately followed-up&#xD;
      until the time of removal (transfer to another unit or hospital) will be censored on the last&#xD;
      day of follow-up in the ICU and classified by the Committee as infected or uninfected, using&#xD;
      the data available up to the last day of follow-up and any bacteriological data subsequently&#xD;
      received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of the procedure will be classified according to a Complications Diagnosis&#xD;
      Dictionary. Text comments will be added to the recordings as appropriate. Descriptive&#xD;
      analysis of the complications as well as comparison of complication rates (overall and by&#xD;
      family of most frequent complications) will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Computation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The catheter-related infection rate was estimated at 10% in the conventional catheter group.&#xD;
      Assuming a 50% relative reduction (to 5%) in the silver impregnated CVC treated group, the&#xD;
      number of patients needed (or equivalently the number of patients enrolled, assuming an&#xD;
      attrition rate of 10%) for each treatment group in order to reach the desired statistical&#xD;
      power is reported below, assuming a Type I error level of 0.05 and depending on the&#xD;
      significance level and the number of tails of the statistical test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-tailed tests will be considered throughout. A power of 80% will be considered sufficient.&#xD;
      Therefore, 472 patients per group should be enrolled.&#xD;
