      The proposed study is designed to estimate the proportion of 35-49 year-old women in a large&#xD;
      urban health plan who have had fibroids. The membership of the health plan is approximately&#xD;
      45% black, so estimates for black and white women can be compared. Risk factors for the&#xD;
      condition will be studied, and uterine tissue from women having hysterectomies or&#xD;
      myomectomies will be studied to identify genetic, hormonal, and protein mediators of tumor&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomly selected sample of about 1800 women age 35-49 who are members of the George&#xD;
      Washington University Health Plan will be invited to participate. Presence of leiomyomas for&#xD;
      premenopausal participants with no prior diagnosis of leiomyoma will be determined by an&#xD;
      ultrasound examination. Presence of leiomyomas for premenopausal women who report a prior&#xD;
      diagnosis of fibroids will be determined by ultrasound evidence in their medical record when&#xD;
      available, and by self-report when not available. History of fibroids in postmenopausal women&#xD;
      will be based on pathology records for those with surgical menopause and on radiology records&#xD;
      or self-report for the small number of naturally postmenopausal women. Estimates of the&#xD;
      proportion who have or have had fibroids will be compared for blacks and whites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine risk factors for leiomyoma we will conduct a case-control analysis. Cases will be&#xD;
      those women identified with leiomyoma from the random sample, supplemented by women in the&#xD;
      same age range who have hysterectomies or myomectomies during the study period and hose&#xD;
      excised uteri show evidence of fibroids on standard pathology examination. Women from the&#xD;
      random sample with ultrasound or pathology evidence showing no uterine fibroids will&#xD;
      constitute the control group. Controls will be compared to cases grouped by size of largest&#xD;
      fibroid and grouped by clinical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A telephone interview and self-administered questionnaire will provide information on&#xD;
      demographic factors, medical history, dietary intake, reproductive history, life style&#xD;
      factors, and occupational/environmental exposures. Blood will be collected from premenopausal&#xD;
      women to measure lipids, insulin, and potential susceptibility genes. Urine will also be&#xD;
      collected from premenopausal women early in their menstrual cycles to measure gonadotropin&#xD;
      levels. Blood pressure, heart rate, weight, height, and waist-to-hip ration will be measured.&#xD;
      Tissue from surgical specimens will be use by collaborators at NIEHS to measure cell&#xD;
      proliferation and apoptosis, genetic factors, estrogen and progesterone receptor levels,&#xD;
      protein markers of estrogen action, and growth factors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Uterine leiomyomas are the leading cause of hysterectomy in the United States, accounting for&#xD;
      over 200,000 procedures each year. Leiomyoma is a common condition with many tumors being&#xD;
      asymptomatic. It is not known which women who have fibroids will develop clinical symptoms.&#xD;
      In 1996-1999 the NIEHS Uterine Fibroid Study enrolled 1245 randomly selected premenopausal&#xD;
      women, aged 35 to 49, who had been randomly selected from the membership roles of George&#xD;
      Washington University Health Plan, a large prepaid health plan in Washington, D.C. Slightly&#xD;
      over half of the participants were African American. Participants were asked about prior&#xD;
      diagnoses of uterine leiomyomas, and 87% were examined by abdominal/transvaginal ultrasound&#xD;
      to screen for uterine leiomyoma. Sixty-two percent of the 1245 had either had a prior&#xD;
      diagnosis of leiomyoma or had sonogram evidence of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Monitor fibroid-related symptoms over time (Two follow-ups over a five-year period).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure the proportion of women who undergo major medical intervention (hysteroscopic&#xD;
           resection, uterine artery embolization, laser coagulation, myomectomy, or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify risk factors for increased symptom severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify risk factors for treatment intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Premenopausal participants in the Uterine Fibroid Study (1996-1999) will be&#xD;
      recontacted twice during the years 2001 - 2005 to obtain information about leiomyoma-related&#xD;
      symptoms and medical or surgical treatments. Data will be collected with a computer-assisted&#xD;
      telephone interview. Medical records of ultrasound or MRI examinations and major medical or&#xD;
      surgical interventions will be abstracted to verify medical follow-up and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The presence of leiomyomas can be identified with ultrasound screening when the&#xD;
      condition is asymptomatic. However, no data are available that allow clinicians to predict&#xD;
      which women will experience morbidity. This longitudinal study will trace disease&#xD;
      progression, and identify factors related to increased symptom severity and medical/surgical&#xD;
      treatment. The findings could then be used to develop a systematic scoring system that can be&#xD;
      used to identify women at high risk.&#xD;
