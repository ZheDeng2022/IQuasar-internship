  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics is conducting a collaborative randomized&#xD;
      multi-intervention trial with the Beijing Institute for Cancer Research to evaluate the&#xD;
      etiologic role of Helicobacter pylori, garlic, and certain micronutrients in the multi-step&#xD;
      process of gastric carcinogenesis. The primary endpoint will not be cancer, but rather the&#xD;
      precancerous lesions severe chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia.&#xD;
      The study is designed to detect a stabilizing or mild decrease in the expected age-related&#xD;
      progression of precancerous lesions over the course of the trial. Thus the trial can be&#xD;
      considered a study of the potential inhibitors of the process of gastric carcinogenesis. The&#xD;
      trial will also provide an evaluation of therapy for H. pylori, including an assessment of&#xD;
      reinfection rates, a critical need for formulating strategies for infection control in China&#xD;
      and other developing countries. Participating in the trial are approximately 3400 adults aged&#xD;
      35-70 who were part of an ongoing survey of precancerous gastric lesions in 13 Linqu villages&#xD;
      in Shandong Province. Linqu appears to be an ideal setting for the trial since stomach cancer&#xD;
      rates are among the highes in the world, precancerous gastric lesions are prevalent, and the&#xD;
      population is stable and well characterized. These individuals will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (taking H. pylori positivity into account) into 8 intervention groups according to a 2(3)&#xD;
      factorial design. The interventions are: 1) initial treatment of H. pylori infection with&#xD;
      ameprazole and amoxicillin followed by 2) daily supplementation with a combination of&#xD;
      alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, and selenium; and 3) daily supplementation with garlic extracts.&#xD;
      No serious side effects have been seen from any of the interventions to date. The study staff&#xD;
      will continue to monitor for possible adverse reactions and the population will receive&#xD;
      routine medical care follow-up throughout the course of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the ongoing study in Linqu, all participants received an endoscopic exam in the&#xD;
      fall of 1994. Repeat gastroscopic exams with biopsies at 7 standard gastric sites will be&#xD;
      conducted during March to May, 1999 and March to May, 2003 to detect early cancers and to&#xD;
      evaluate gasatric mucosal status. The subjects will be categorized according to the most&#xD;
      advanced lesions detected in all biopsies and assigned a severity score. The three major&#xD;
      endpoints for analysis will be: 1) prevalence of dysplasia or cancer 2) prevalence of sever&#xD;
      chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, or cancer; and 3) average&#xD;
      severity score.&#xD;

      the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the ongoing study in Linqu, all participants received an endoscopic exam in the&#xD;
      fall of 1994. Repeat gastroscopic exams with biopsies at 7 standard gastric sites conducted&#xD;
      during March to May, 1999 and March to April, 2003 to detect early cancers and to evaluate&#xD;
      gastric mucosal status. The subjects will be categorized according to the most advanced&#xD;
      lesions detected in all biopsies and assigned a severity score. The three major endpoints for&#xD;
      analysis will be: 1) prevalence of dysplasia or cancer 2) prevalence of severe chronic&#xD;
      atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, or cancer; and 3) average severity&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major endpoint paper was published in JNCI in 2006. Additional analyses of the trial data&#xD;
      are underway. A continuation study is proceeding that will allow for follow-up of the&#xD;
      approximately 3070 remaining trial participants through 2010 on the long-term effects of the&#xD;
      previous treatments on gastric cancer incidence and on cause-specific death rates and allow&#xD;
      approximately 364 participants in the previous study with advanced gastric lesions in 2003 an&#xD;
      opportunity for annual endoscopic screening for gastric cancer.&#xD;
