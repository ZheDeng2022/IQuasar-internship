      This study will create a database of clinical and biological research for use in future&#xD;
      studies, with information obtained from lung transplant recipients. The database will consist&#xD;
      of genetic material and clinical outcomes to be used in future genotyping studies, that is,&#xD;
      studies regarding the genetic makeup of individuals. Lung transplantation has become an&#xD;
      important option for patients with advanced lung disease. More than 10,000 patients have&#xD;
      received them to date, and about 1,200 transplant operations are performed worldwide each&#xD;
      year. Although short-term survival has continued to improve, the 5-year survival rate is less&#xD;
      than 50 percent. Most post transplant deaths are directly or directly caused by chronic lung&#xD;
      rejection, a condition of scarring that worsens lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients evaluated for lung transplants at Duke University Medical Center may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For developing the database, a small amount of blood, about 3 tablespoons, will be collected&#xD;
      from patients. Blood collection for the research will be done at the same time as blood is&#xD;
      drawn for necessary tests. The blood cells and DNA (which contains genetic material) will be&#xD;
      isolated for analysis. Patients' DNA samples collected will be identified by a code, and all&#xD;
      other identifying information will be removed. Patients may be asked to donate additional&#xD;
      blood samples after their lung transplant if researchers would like to reexamine their blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However, during the study, if it&#xD;
      is found that any patients have an inherited risk for a disease likely to cause early death&#xD;
      if the disease is not treated, then the researchers will attempt to notify those patients.&#xD;
      Overall, it is hoped that information gained during this study will help medical&#xD;
      professionals to learn more about immune activation and to see how the reactivity of lung&#xD;
      transplant patients changes over time. If specific genetic risks could be identified, it&#xD;
      might lead to individualized treatments that work on the immune system. Short-term and&#xD;
      long-term survival of lung transplant recipients may thus be improved.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation has emerged as a viable therapeutic option in the care of patients with&#xD;
      advanced pulmonary parenchymal and pulmonary vascular disease. Currently, over 10,000&#xD;
      patients have received lung transplantation with approximately 1200 transplant operations&#xD;
      performed worldwide each year. Short-term survival after lung transplantation has continued&#xD;
      to improve since the widespread application of this procedure and one-year survival at most&#xD;
      centers now approaches 80%. Unfortunately, long-term outcomes after lung transplantation are&#xD;
      disappointing with five-year survival below 50%. Most posttransplant deaths are due directly&#xD;
      or indirectly to the development of acute or chronic rejection. Acute rejection is defined by&#xD;
      the presence of perivascular mononuclear inflammatory cells. Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB)&#xD;
      describes fibrosis and obliteration of the small to medium size bronchioles, the histological&#xD;
      manifestation of chronic lung rejection. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is thought&#xD;
      to correlate with the development of histological OB when other causes of allograft&#xD;
      dysfunction have been excluded. The diagnosis of OB is based primarily on a decline in&#xD;
      spirometry with exclusion of alternative diagnoses with bronchoscopy and biopsy, i.e.&#xD;
      development of clinical BOS. Since the introduction of BOS nomenclature, numerous studies&#xD;
      have validated the clinical and prognostic importance of this syndrome and verified its&#xD;
      correlation with histological OB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic rejection describes a histological pattern of fibrous obliteration of endothelial or&#xD;
      epithelial structures in the allograft. A similar pattern of histological fibrosis is&#xD;
      observed in all types of solid organ transplants (e.g., obliterative arteriopathy in heart&#xD;
      transplant, BOS in lung transplant), and occurs despite the use of currently available,&#xD;
      primarily T-cell based, immune suppression. The rates of chronic rejection vary considerably&#xD;
      with the type of organ transplanted. By five years after transplantation histological&#xD;
      fibrosis occurs in approximately 20% of kidney, 40% of heart and 60-80% of lung recipients.&#xD;
      Thus, lung transplantation is characterized by an unusually high incidence of chronic graft&#xD;
      rejection manifest as BOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the high rate of acute and chronic lung transplant rejection, research designed to&#xD;
      better correlate clinical outcomes with the genetic risks for rejection is critical to&#xD;
      improving patient outcomes. We recently completed a study that demonstrated two single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile (polymorphisms of the human Toll 4&#xD;
      gene associated with endotoxin hyporesponsiveness) were associated with decreased acute&#xD;
      rejection after lung transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that other SNPs associated with either increased or decreased innate or&#xD;
      adaptive immune activation will be critical to determining the clinical outcome with regards&#xD;
      to acute and chronic rejection after lung transplant. If specific genetic risks for rejection&#xD;
      after transplant could be identified, this might lead to highly tailored immunosuppressive&#xD;
      regimens and improved clinical outcomes.&#xD;
