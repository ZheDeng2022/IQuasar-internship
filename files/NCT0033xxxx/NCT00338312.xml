  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Naturally menopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) were randomized into&#xD;
      a 52-week, multicenter, double-blind (DB), parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Patients&#xD;
      were stratified based on presence/absence of uterus and randomized to receive placebo or&#xD;
      testosterone transdermal system. Patients had to maintain a stable dose of estrogen/progestin&#xD;
      throughout the study. Patients who completed the first 52 weeks of the study were given the&#xD;
      opportunity to participate in year 2-4 open-label (active treatment) study extension which&#xD;
      was added to the protocol by amendment. Safety was assessed by adverse events, lipids, serum&#xD;
      chemistry with hepatic, renal and carbohydrate metabois in evaluation, coagulation testing,&#xD;
      and hermatology. Physical exam including clinical assessments of facial hair and acne were&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
