  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,&#xD;
      will explore the genetic influences on susceptibility to atherosclerotic cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (ASCVD). Atherosclerosis is a chronic narrowing of the arteries caused by an&#xD;
      incremental buildup of fatty substances on the linings of walls of arteries. This study will&#xD;
      examine the role of genes related to the inflammatory process on the incidence of ASCVD and&#xD;
      on levels of chemokines (proteins involved in inflammation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA samples, chemokines levels and relevant clinical data from patients enrolled in Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins's sibling and family heart studies are analyzed for specific gene markers. The&#xD;
      studies include: Nurse Model in Black Families at Risk for Heart Disease; Genotypic&#xD;
      Determinants of Aspirin Response in High Risk Families; and Coronary Disease Detection by&#xD;
      Thallium SPECT and Fast CT. All of the enrolled patients have consented to have their DNA&#xD;
      used for testing of genetic factors that may predict cardiovascular disease and do not&#xD;
      contain patient identifier information.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease classically triggered by hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, smoking and elevated cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that genetic predisposition plays a crucial role in an individual's&#xD;
      susceptibility to these risk factors with Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) being&#xD;
      identified as functional mediators of key inflammatory genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the frequency of haplotypes of SNP combinations in the proximal promoter region&#xD;
      of MCP-1, the MCP-3 gene, and eotaxin gene in patients with risk factors for CVD and their&#xD;
      siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the MCP-1 levels in an affected population with Coronary artery disease and&#xD;
      their siblings and certain haplotypes to determine a functional association between MCP-1&#xD;
      levels and haplotype frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria for enrollment in sib and family studies included: 1) having a sib or&#xD;
      1st degree family member with heart disease, 2) ability to give inform consent to participate&#xD;
      in the study, 3) age 18 years or older, 4) ability to speak English or Spanish. The entire&#xD;
      set of 2,000 samples available to the LDG will be analyzed. No subject will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNAs derived from properly consented subjects enrolled in three protocols sponsored by the&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins Heart Study will be sent to the LGD and used to test specific markers in the&#xD;
      MCP-1, MCP-3, and eotaxin chemokine family located in the C-C chemokine cluster on&#xD;
      chromosome17q11.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 11 SNPs will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sib-pair analysis will be utilized to identify associated markers. Linear regressions will be&#xD;
      used to analyze associations between genetic variations and chemokine levels. Haplotype will&#xD;
      be assigned to unrelated individuals using the maximum likelihood approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DNA samples, chemokine levels, and relevant clinical data provided by John Hopkins&#xD;
      University School of Medicine will be coded and linked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this study, the DNAs will be maintained in our repository and curated through our&#xD;
      central Laboratory database. Loss or destruction of these samples will be annotated to our&#xD;
      database and cannot impact the study participants in any way. We understand that studies&#xD;
      subsequent to the completion of this protocol will require additional OHSR/IRB approval prior&#xD;
      to commencement.&#xD;
