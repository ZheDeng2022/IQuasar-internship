      Chromatin Demethylation Apart from histone acetylation deacetylation, promoter&#xD;
      hypermethylation is another important and relevant mechanism involved in gene transcription&#xD;
      regulation (reviewed in Herman, 2003). Chromatin remodeling might thus be also targeted using&#xD;
      nucleoside analogues, such as 5 azacytidine or decitabine, which reactivate gene&#xD;
      transcription through DNA demethylation (Silverman, 2001). Recently, in in VITRO studies,&#xD;
      induction of gene expression by 5 AzaC has been obtained in primary AML and MDS cells by DNA&#xD;
      methylation dependent and independent mechanisms (SCHMELZ, 2005)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Again, AzaC has been demonstrated as capable to induce clinical hematological responses in&#xD;
      patients with MDS. A controlled study conducted by the US Cancer and Leukemia Group B&#xD;
      (CALBG)has reported a higher response rate, a lower incidence of leukemic transformation and&#xD;
      a prolonged survival as compared with supportive care alone in these patients Silverman,&#xD;
      2002. Another confirmatory Phase 3 study is ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AzaC, in combination with valproic acid, in leukemic cell line (HL60 and MOLT4, has&#xD;
      demonstrated a synergistic activity to induce gene reexpression (reactivation of p21 CIP1)&#xD;
      and a synergistic effect in terms of growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis (Yang H,&#xD;
      2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histone Acetylation Numerous investigator groups have tried to elucidate the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the ATRA induced differentiation in NB4 cells, fresh APL cells, APL&#xD;
      mice, or APL patients (Melnick 1999). One of the main issue was to understand the crucial&#xD;
      role of the PML RARα fusion protein in the differentiation response to RA. It was observed&#xD;
      first that therapeutic concentrations of ATRA resulted in the reformation of PML nuclear&#xD;
      bodies associated with a cleavage of the PML RARα fusion protein. Disappearance of this&#xD;
      fusion product which acts as a dominant negative regulator of RA target genes transcription&#xD;
      gave an explanation for the rerun of the differentiation process. The dominant negative role&#xD;
      of PML RARα was secondly explained by the association of the fusion protein to the&#xD;
      N-CoR-SMRT-Sin3 corepressor complex, leading to histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities&#xD;
      recruitment and to the lack of target genes transcription (REDNER, 1999). Of interest, a&#xD;
      similar recruitment of corepressor HDAC activities has been reported in other fusion gene&#xD;
      leukemia, including PLZF RARα ,AML1 ETO, CBFß MYH11, and TEL AML1 acute leukemia. In PML RARα&#xD;
      APL cells, therapeutic concentrations of ATRA allow the release of corepressor HDAC&#xD;
      activities, histone acetylation, chromatin remodeling, and transcription of target genes&#xD;
      potentially responsible for terminal granulocytic differentiation (REDNER, 1999; DILWORK,&#xD;
      2001). From this point of view, ATRA therapy of APL is the first example of a gene targeted&#xD;
      therapy which specifically targets pathogenic genetic abnormalities in a human leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In VITRO and in vivo resistance to ATRA-induced differentiation observed in patients with&#xD;
      PLZF RARα leukemia has been related to a more potent recruitment of corepressor HDAC&#xD;
      activities in this APL subset, as compared to classical PML- RARα APL (two corepressor&#xD;
      binding sites on PLZF instead of one on PML). Very interestingly, it has been recently&#xD;
      demonstrated that PLZF RARα leukemic cells are not actually completely resistant to&#xD;
      differentiation induction, especially if appropriate COSTIMULI are given. First, these cells&#xD;
      can differentiate in the presence of higher concentration of ATRA (3 microM instead of 1&#xD;
      microM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly the addition of a HDAC inhibitor (trichostatin A) restores the ATRA sensitivity at 1&#xD;
      microM (KITAMURY 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly G CSF signaling may force these cells to undergo terminal differentiation (JANSEN&#xD;
      2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HDAC inhibitors have also been shown as able to induce remission in transgenic models of&#xD;
      therapy resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia (He 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity of HL60 cells, which do not display any chromosomal rearrangement involving&#xD;
      the RARα locus, to RA induced differentiation may be related to these observations. One may&#xD;
      hypothesize that some unknown COSTIMULI including chromatin remodeling events contribute to&#xD;
      the RA sensitivity of HL60 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a therapeutic point of view, these observations lead to evaluate non targeted&#xD;
      transcriptional therapies combining ATRA with non targeted HDAC inhibitors and/or cAMP&#xD;
      inducers in non APL leukemias. Among the known HDAC inhibitors (trichostatin A, trapoxin A,&#xD;
      butyrate, oxamflatin, depsipeptide, and MS 275), sodium phenylbutyrate has been successfully&#xD;
      administered in combination with ATRA to a patient with clinically ATRA resistant APL&#xD;
      (WARRELL, 1998). This case report represents the first example of a targeted transcriptional&#xD;
      therapy in a human leukemia. It has recently been demonstrated that valproic acid (VPA)&#xD;
      belongs to the HDAC inhibitor family (PHIEL, 2001). Valproic acid is a short chained fatty&#xD;
      acid widely used as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristic delay in response to VPA and its teratogenic potential had led for a long&#xD;
      time to the proposal that it acts through modulation of gene expression. It has also been&#xD;
      reported that VPA can activate AP1-dependent transcription (ASGHARI, 1998; Chen, 1999 1;&#xD;
      Yuan, 2001) and upregulate bcl 2 (Chen, 1999 2). VPA was also recently demonstrated as&#xD;
      capable to induce differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma cells, which are known to be also&#xD;
      capable to differentiate in the presence of RA or cAMP (WERLING, 2001). Finally, VPA might&#xD;
      sensitize neoplastic cells to pro apoptotic stimuli through an inhibition of glutathione&#xD;
      (GSH) reductase, an enzyme required for maintaining high cellular levels of reduced GSH&#xD;
      (Moog, 1996), or an inhibition of the NF-κB pathway (ICHIYAMA, 2000). Interestingly, it was&#xD;
      also shown that lithium chloride (another mood stabilizer) acts synergistically with ATRA to&#xD;
      induce terminal differentiation of WEHI-3B leukemia cells. As observed with the combination&#xD;
      of ATRA and G CSF, this observed synergism appeared to be related to the prevention of RAR&#xD;
      protein loss usually observed under ATRA exposure (Finch, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of interest, VPA as single agent or administered in combination with ATRA has been recently&#xD;
      demonstrated as capable to induce clinical hematological responses in patients treated for&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes (KUENDGEN, 2004). In this study, a pretreatment with VA seemed to&#xD;
      be required for further positive effects of ATRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoic Acid :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoids represent a large group of compounds structurally related to vitamin A (retinol).&#xD;
      They act through binding to and activating specific nuclear receptors, which bind the DNA.&#xD;
      Retinoic acid (RA), the natural acidic derivative of retinol, is a key differentiating factor&#xD;
      involved in specific phases of the embryonic development, differentiation of the visual&#xD;
      system, and (of interest here) hemopoietic granulocytic maturation (CORNIC, 1994). In VITRO,&#xD;
      RA was demonstrated as capable to induce granulocytic differentiation of the HL60 cell line.&#xD;
      This cell line was established in 1977 from a patient with AML. The cells largely resemble&#xD;
      promyelocytes but can be induced to differentiate terminally. Some reagents, including RA,&#xD;
      cause HL60 cells to differentiate to granulocyte-like cells, others to&#xD;
      monocyte/macrophage-like cells. The HL60 cell genome contains an amplified c-myc&#xD;
      proto-oncogene and c-myc mRNA levels decline rapidly following induction of differentiation&#xD;
      (BIRNIE, 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent alterations of the gene coding for the RA alpha receptor (RARα, located on the&#xD;
      chromosome 17q12) are associated with some acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subsets. The most&#xD;
      common RARα gene alteration is the reciprocal t(15;17) chromosomal translocation observed in&#xD;
      the vast majority of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) corresponding to the AML-M3 subset of&#xD;
      the French-American-British (FAB) classification. This translocation fuses the RARα gene to&#xD;
      the PML gene (located on the chromosome 15q21), resulting in PML- RARα fusion products.&#xD;
      Variant translocations fusing the RARα gene with other partners including PLZF on chromosome&#xD;
      11, NPM on chromosome 5, NuMA on chromosome 11, and STAT5 on chromosome 17, have been rarely&#xD;
      or occasionally reported. The causal role of the RARα fusion proteins (at least PML- RARα and&#xD;
      PLZF- RARα) in APL has been demonstrated in murine models (KOGAN, 1999). It has been shown&#xD;
      that these fusion proteins may act as a dominant transcriptional repressor in APL cells&#xD;
      (Melnick, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NB4 cell line was established in 1991 from a patient with APL (LANOTTE, 1991). This cell&#xD;
      line has been widely used to study the biology of this disease. Conversely to HL60, NB4 is&#xD;
      carrying the t(15;17) translocation. As in HL60 cells, RA is capable to induce granulocytic&#xD;
      differentiation of NB4 cells leading to cell death through terminal induction of apoptosis.&#xD;
      These differentiating effects have been confirmed in vivo using different murine models of&#xD;
      APL (KOGAN, 1999; He, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these pre-clinical observations, oral all-trans RA (ATRA) has been successfully&#xD;
      administered to APL patients. In patients with relapsing APL, front-line therapy with ATRA&#xD;
      (45 mg/m2/day) induces in vivo differentiation of leukemic promyelocytes into abnormal&#xD;
      granulocytes still carrying the PML- RARα fusion, resulting in approximately 90%&#xD;
      hematological remission and 20% molecular remission rates as assessed by specific PML- RARα&#xD;
      RT-PCR negativation (Huang, 1988; CASTAIGNE, 1990; DEGOS,1995). This represented the first&#xD;
      example of a differentiation therapy in a human leukemia. Unfortunately, such beneficial&#xD;
      effects have not been observed in patients with other AML subtypes when treated with ATRA&#xD;
      using similar dosage and schedule. Following these results obtained in relapsing APL&#xD;
      patients, ATRA was then evaluated in combination with chemotherapy during front-line&#xD;
      treatment of newly-diagnosed APL patients. Several controlled trials have established the&#xD;
      ATRA-chemotherapy combination as the current standard therapy for newly-diagnosed APL.&#xD;
      Apparently, the best results are obtained when ATRA and chemotherapeutic agents are&#xD;
      administered simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other therapeutic interventions might be considered to increase the RA sensitivity in&#xD;
      RA-resistant cells. Actually, explanations for the RA resistance include RA-induced increased&#xD;
      expression of cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYPs), RA-induced increased expression of cytoplasmic&#xD;
      RA-binding proteins type II (CRABP-II), overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and acquired&#xD;
      mutations of the ligand-binding region of the RARα gene. Agents interacting with ATRA&#xD;
      metabolism, such as HIV-1 protease inhibitors (indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir) which&#xD;
      inhibit CYPs and P-gp and compete with ATRA for CRABP-I binding, could enhance the induction&#xD;
      of differentiation in RA-resistant cells (IKEZOE, 2000).&#xD;
