      The purpose is to analyze whether a follow-up telephone call by a pharmacist after patient&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital can improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be interviewed via telephone within 72 hours of being discharged home from the&#xD;
      hospital. Patients will be questioned on three main topics. They are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up appointments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to find out if people understand discharge medications, have obtained those&#xD;
      medications, are having any problems with their medications and have scheduled necessary&#xD;
      follow-up appointments. It will be determined if a telephone call by a pharmacist will&#xD;
      prevent patients from needing to go to the Emergency Room or being admitted back to the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is a time between hospital discharge and patient follow-up that has been deemed by many&#xD;
      healthcare workers as a &quot;black hole &quot; (1). It is a time during which continuity of care is of&#xD;
      utmost importance, yet there is no effective uniform system in place to ensure this vital&#xD;
      continuity. During the post-discharge period (time from when the patient leaves the hospital&#xD;
      to the time of first follow-up appointment), new medical problems can arise and old ones can&#xD;
      be exacerbated. Additionally, patients can encounter innumerable barriers to healthcare,&#xD;
      including difficulty obtaining medications and securing appointments with physicians or&#xD;
      specialists. Also, patients may not have received proper counseling on new discharge&#xD;
      medications, including proper use and potential side effects. Despite this important aspect&#xD;
      of patient care, only a paucity of literature on the topic exists. Of the literature that&#xD;
      does exist, it suggests that patient education concerning discharge planning and the&#xD;
      post-discharge period is an aspect of care that is in great need of improvement and an&#xD;
      excellent opportunity for intervention by a pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This led to our research hypothesis, can a follow-up phone call from a pharmacist improve&#xD;
      patient outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is a reduction in the number of hospital readmissions (any&#xD;
      cause) during the 30-day post-discharge period. Thirty-day readmission rates will be compared&#xD;
      to see if there is a difference between the intervention group (follow-up phone call) and&#xD;
      control group (no phone call). The secondary outcomes include the number of patients in the&#xD;
      study group for whom medication errors, complications or misuse could be identified.&#xD;
