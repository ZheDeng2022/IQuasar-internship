    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether serum resistin levels in asthmatics are&#xD;
      elevated. We will recruit subjects from the allergy/immunology clinic with a prior diagnosis&#xD;
      of moderate to severe persistent asthma in addition to subjects being seen for evaluation of&#xD;
      drug allergies. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria below, subjects will be placed&#xD;
      into a control and asthma group. Each subject will undergo one blood draw in the main lab at&#xD;
      WHMC, and return a lavender top tube to the allergy/immunology clinic for the EIA resistin&#xD;
      assay. The patient will then have a brief encounter with a physician to determine an up to&#xD;
      date history of asthma symptoms prior to participating in the exhaled NO test. The entire&#xD;
      subject encounter will take place with one clinic visit, and requires no follow up visits as&#xD;
      part of the study. The greatest risk to each subject will be the blood draw, as the exhaled&#xD;
      NO is a completely non-invasive test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma from each subject will be stored in a -70Â° freezer for no more than one month. Samples&#xD;
      will be analyzed for resistin levels using an EIA assay run monthly. Mean values from serum&#xD;
      CRP, serum glucose, serum resistin, and exhaled NO will be compared using a students T-test.&#xD;

      Resistin is part of the FIZZ (found in inflammatory zones) family of genes, and was first&#xD;
      characterized in murine models where it has been extensively studied as a potential link&#xD;
      between type II diabetes and obesity. The murine FIZZ gene family consists of three related&#xD;
      gene products: a)FIZZ-1 or Relm-a is found in adipocytes and lung tissue, b)FIZZ-2 or Relm-b&#xD;
      found in the gastrointestinal tract, and c)FIZZ-3 or Resistin also found in adipocytes.1&#xD;
      Mouse models have shown resistin to be linked to obesity and insulin resistance, and&#xD;
      thiazolidinedione has been shown to decrease resistin expression in mouse adipocytes.2&#xD;
      Distribution of the FIZZ gene products in humans is similar to mouse models: a)Relm-a is&#xD;
      found in adipose, heart, and lung, b)Relm-b is found in the gastrointestinal tract, and&#xD;
      c)Resistin is found in adipocytes and interestingly, is also found in circulating&#xD;
      macrophages.3 Given the findings correlating obesity with diabetes in the mouse model,&#xD;
      several studies were done in humans attempting to illustrate this same link. A study&#xD;
      comparing middle age type II diabetics with matched controls found serum resistin levels to&#xD;
      be increased in the diabetic group (16.6 vs 13.5, p&lt;0.004), but this elevation was&#xD;
      independent of adiposity, BMI, or insulin resistance. Elevation in C-reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
      in the diabetic group was the only factor that consistently correlated with elevation in&#xD;
      resistin levels in this study.4 A second study comparing older (60-75 years of age) type II&#xD;
      diabetics also found a significant elevation in serum resistin in the diabetic group that was&#xD;
      independent of gender, insulin resistance, BMI, blood pressure, or total cholesterol.&#xD;
      Interestingly, this study did find an association with plasma glucose concentration and serum&#xD;
      resistin levels.5 Although there seems to be no direct link between resistin and insulin&#xD;
      resistance in humans, the above data suggest a role for insulin in systemic inflammation&#xD;
      commonly associated with diabetes. Adipocytes are known to be a source of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6. TNF-a has been shown to be elevated in obesity, and many&#xD;
      acute phase reactants and cytokines are associated with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.6&#xD;
      In addition, resistin has been shown to induce VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and long pentraxin 3 (markers&#xD;
      of vascular inflammation) in mouse models. The resistin related induction of VCAM-1 was&#xD;
      partially blocked with a statin, indicating a role for resistin in vascular inflammation that&#xD;
      may contribute to atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease seen in diabetics and the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.7 Given the effects on vascular inflammation, resistin may be an important&#xD;
      cytokine involved in a common inflammatory pathway seen in both diabetics and asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like diabetes, asthma is a disease marked by chronic inflammation. The inflammation&#xD;
      associated with asthma has been predominantly illustrated in the airways, however, studies&#xD;
      have shown that induced bronchoconstriction and asthma do illicit a systemic response with&#xD;
      elevations in CRP thought to be mediated by IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a via activated&#xD;
      macrophages.8,9 In addition, CCL2 contributes to airway hyper-reactivity and cell migration,&#xD;
      and thiazolidinedione has been shown to inhibit the IL-1b and TNF-a induced expression of&#xD;
      CCL2 in the lung.10 Finally, a recent study illustrated an IL-4 and IL-13 induction of Relm-b&#xD;
      via STAT-6 in response to allergic asthma.11 The level of serum resistin in human asthmatics&#xD;
      is currently unknown, and may represent an important systemic marker of inflammation in this&#xD;
      disease. Relating levels of serum resistin with disease state in conjunction with&#xD;
      measurements of serum CRP and glucose would be an important aspect of further understanding&#xD;
      the potential systemic inflammatory implications of asthma. In addition, unpublished data on&#xD;
      exhaled NO have shown a positive correlation with asthma that could be used to further&#xD;
      strengthen evidence of systemic inflammation with airway inflammation.&#xD;
