  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether acamprosate (Campral) is safe and effective&#xD;
      in treating alcohol dependence in individuals with bipolar disorder. All subjects in the&#xD;
      study must be currently stabilized on mood-stabilizing medication. Half of the subjects will&#xD;
      receive acamprosate in addition to their mood-stabilizing medication; control subjects will&#xD;
      be maintained on their mood-stabilizing medication alone. Measures of alcohol use as well as&#xD;
      mood stability will be obtained weekly throughout the active phase of the study.&#xD;
