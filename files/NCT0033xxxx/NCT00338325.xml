      This study is designed to implement the reading of age appropriate books by a trained reader&#xD;
      into the waiting area of a pediatric day surgery unit to determine if it is effective at&#xD;
      reducing the anxiety and pain levels of parents and children by providing a safe and calming&#xD;
      activity for the child. This is a single-centre trial based at the IWK Health Centre. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be based on the anxiety and pain scores of the research participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is 1. to investigate the child and parental anxiolytic effects of&#xD;
      reading age-appropriate books by Read To Me readers to the children in the waiting room of&#xD;
      day surgery units 2. to investigate if parents use reading to assist their children during&#xD;
      their recovery period at home and the impact of this effort. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      report their feelings of anxiety before and after being read to using Kuttner's face scale of&#xD;
      anxiety and Speilberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for the adults. If the child&#xD;
      is less than 5 years of age, a proxy measure of child anxiety will be taken. The anxiety&#xD;
      measures will be taken immediately after consent is obtained and then will be taken again&#xD;
      20-60 minutes later. The exact time the second measure is taken after initial anxiety&#xD;
      measurements will be recorded. This procedure will be used for both experimental and control&#xD;
      groups. Parents will also be asked to fill out Conners' Parent Rating Scale - Revised to&#xD;
      assess the usual temperament of their child. Parents and children will be approached to&#xD;
      participate in the present study. Consent to be read to and consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be separated. Families may consent to be read to without consenting to the&#xD;
      research. As is the routine in other areas of the hospital, parents will be verbally asked&#xD;
      for consent to read to their children by the Read To Me staff. Two trained readers from the&#xD;
      Read To Me program at the IWK Health Centre will provide the reading of age-appropriate books&#xD;
      to participants in the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research personnel will obtain written consent for participation in the research. The Read To&#xD;
      Me activities will include being read to and receiving an activity bag with an&#xD;
      age-appropriate paper back book chosen by experienced literacy practitioners, a related craft&#xD;
      and literacy activity the child can complete at home after reading the story and a brochure&#xD;
      for parents which lists age-specific literacy skills, recommended book lists and reading tips&#xD;
      which explain how to share books with children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will then be asked a few questions in a semi structured qualitative interview&#xD;
      regarding their experience in the waiting room. Two days after surgery a follow up interview&#xD;
      will take place on the telephone that will include information the parents recorded in the&#xD;
      diary they were given at the time of participation in the study. Parents will be given the&#xD;
      diary at the time of consent where the child's pain with activity (2-3 times daily), the&#xD;
      child's anxiety (2-3 times daily) and the use of distracters during recovery can all be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred and fifty two day surgery patients and their parents were assessed for&#xD;
      eligibility. 52 refused to participate and 2 parents withdrew from the study because they&#xD;
      were not interested in continuing with the research. Two hundred children and their parents&#xD;
      were recruited for participation and were randomly assigned by cluster determined by the day&#xD;
      they came to surgery to either the control or the experimental group. One hundred and&#xD;
      eighteen participants were allocated to the experimental group while eighty-two participants&#xD;
      were allocated to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be evaluated for outcome results and will be compared to determine if there&#xD;
      is a difference in the anxiety and pain scores collected for each group. It is expected that&#xD;
      the children who were in the reading group will report less anxiety and pain during day&#xD;
      surgery and during recovery than the children who received usual care.&#xD;
