  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized trial of the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) versus user's choice&#xD;
      hormonal contraception (injectable progestins or oral contraceptive pills) among&#xD;
      HIV-infected, recently post-partum women in Lusaka, Zambia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the year 2000, there were over 37, 000 new acceptors of family planning in the Lusaka&#xD;
      District Clinics. A variety of methods were prescribed, including combined oral contraceptive&#xD;
      pills, injectable progestins, the intrauterine copper device, condoms, and others. The most&#xD;
      recent sentinel survey of reproductive age women estimated that approximately 30% of&#xD;
      reproductive age women in Lusaka are HIV-infected. Since voluntary HIV counseling and testing&#xD;
      is not yet universally available in many of the district clinics, women receive all different&#xD;
      types of contraception regardless of their HIV status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some observational data published recently that suggests hormonal contraception may&#xD;
      increase HIV viral load in the female genital tract and potentially increase HIV transmission&#xD;
      to the male partner. By contrast, barrier methods have historically been very unpopular in&#xD;
      stable couples and are not used consistently in many cases despite intensive counseling. The&#xD;
      IUCD represents one of the most inexpensive and effective methods of birth control available&#xD;
      in Lusaka. However, it has not been studied adequately to make policy recommendations&#xD;
      regarding its use in HIV infected women. The purpose of this study will be to evaluate safety&#xD;
      and acceptability of the IUCD versus hormonal methods of contraception in HIV-infected and&#xD;
      uninfected women in Lusaka. Specifically, we will 1) compare the contraceptive effectiveness&#xD;
      of the IUCD to the standard practices of user-chosen hormonal contraception, 2) compare the&#xD;
      rates of pelvic infection between IUD and hormonal contraceptive users, and 3) compare rates&#xD;
      of method discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have a continuing second trimester pregnancy, serologically confirmed HIV&#xD;
      infection, a desire for 24 months of contraception, and a willingness to be randomly assigned&#xD;
      either an IUCD or hormonal contraception postpartum will be screened at 32 weeks in their&#xD;
      pregnancies to receive either an IUCD or user chosen hormonal contraception postpartum. Women&#xD;
      will then be seen at postpartum weeks 4-6 for method randomization and then at months 6, 12,&#xD;
      18 and 24 to monitor pregnancy, continuation of method, side effects and any other problems.&#xD;
      Women will be encouraged to return for problems at any time. At least once yearly, women will&#xD;
      have a complete physical exam. CD4 and HIV clinical status will be monitored regularly.&#xD;
