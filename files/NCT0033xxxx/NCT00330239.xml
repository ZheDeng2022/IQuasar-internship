  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in a number of controlled trials in the treatment&#xD;
      of PTSD. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have proven particularly useful in&#xD;
      treating this disorder. Currently there are two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
      (Zoloft® and Paxil®), that have been FDA approved for treating PTSD. Coincidentally, this&#xD;
      same class of medications has also been shown to have efficacy in some trials in decreasing&#xD;
      alcohol consumption in heavy drinkers. The goal of the proposed study is to preliminarily&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of Paxil® (paroxetine), in decreasing symptoms of PTSD as well as&#xD;
      decreasing substance use, in individuals with concurrent substance dependence and PTSD. The&#xD;
      type of paroxetine used in this trial will be Paxil CR®, which is a sustained release&#xD;
      formulation of paroxetine, which has fewer side effects and greater tolerability. This is a&#xD;
      particularly important issue in substance using populations because medication compliance is&#xD;
      generally poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two specific hypotheses will be tested. 1) Individuals who receive Paxil CR® will have a&#xD;
      greater improvement in their PTSD symptoms (based on CAPS-2 and CGI) than those who receive&#xD;
      placebo. 2) Individuals who receive Paxil CR® will have greater improvement in their&#xD;
      substance use outcomes (based on UDS and TLFB) than will those who receive placebo.&#xD;

      Participants who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be randomized with a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive either Paxil CR or placebo for 12 weeks. Medication will be initiated at&#xD;
      12.5mg/day and will be increased weekly as tolerated to a maximum dose of 50mg/day.&#xD;
      Participants will be seen weekly and will be assessed for side effects, substance use since&#xD;
      last visit, urine drug screen, breathalyzer readings, vital signs and symptoms of PTSD&#xD;
      (TOP-8)at each visit. The Davidson Trauma Scale will be completed every two weeks, and the&#xD;
      CAPS-2 and MADRS will be completed monthly. Those who complete the first 12 weeks of&#xD;
      double-blind study medication will be eligible to receive open label medication for an&#xD;
      additional 12 weeks. Medication will be initiated at 12.5mg and increased every 3 days as&#xD;
      tolerated to the terminal dose in the double-blind phase, then adjusted as needed.&#xD;
      Participants will come in for assessments every two weeks of the open-label phase. Blood will&#xD;
      be drawn for blood chemistries and hematology at screening and weeks 12 and 24. Urine&#xD;
      pregnancy tests will be performed for women of childbearing potential at baseline and again&#xD;
      at weeks 4, 12 and 24.&#xD;
