  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to investigate effects of radon (plus CO2) baths on RA in contrast to&#xD;
      artificial CO2 baths in RA rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      134 patients of an in-patient rehabilitative programme were randomly assigned to the groups.&#xD;
      Outcomes were limitations in occupational context/ daily living (main outcome), pain,&#xD;
      medication, etc. measured before start, after end of treatment, and up to a year thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superiority of radon treatment was found regarding reduced limitations in daily living until&#xD;
      12 months after end of treatment. Steroid consumption and NSAIDs were significantly reduced.&#xD;

      Objective: To replicate former observed beneficial effects of Radon (plus CO2) baths on RA in&#xD;
      contrast to artificial CO2 baths and to investigate its long-term effectiveness and impact on&#xD;
      drug consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Randomised double-blinded trial with 2 randomised balanced groups enrolling 134&#xD;
      patients of an in-patient rehabilitative programme (a 3rd non-randomised group of 73&#xD;
      consecutive patients is not reported here). Outcomes were limitations in occupational&#xD;
      context/ daily living, pain, functional capacity, morning stiffness and medication measured&#xD;
      before start, after end of treatment, and quarterly in the year thereafter. Repeated-measures&#xD;
      analysis of covariance (RM-ANCOVA) of intent-to treat population was performed to investigate&#xD;
      treatment effects. Hierarchically ordered hypotheses ensured adherence of the nominal&#xD;
      significance level and allowed examining of long-term effects. Starting with all measures&#xD;
      until 6 months' follow-up, significant main effects for group allocation (GME) or significant&#xD;
      group x course-interactions (GxC) were regarded essential to add the next follow-up for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Radon treatment resulted in significantly lower limitations of daily living over at&#xD;
      least 9 months whereas reference patients returned to baseline level after 6 months already&#xD;
      (RM-ANCOVA until 6 months: pGME=.15, pGxC=.016/ 9 months: pGME=.11, pGxC=.025/ 12 months:&#xD;
      pGME=.17, pGxC=.033). Furthermore, consumption of steroids and NSAID was remarkably reduced&#xD;
      in the Radon group (RM-ANCOVA until 12 months: for steroids pGME=.064, interaction pGxC=.025,&#xD;
      maximum difference after 12 months; for NSAID pGME=.035, interaction pGxC=.008, maximum&#xD;
      difference after 9 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Results suggest beneficial long-term effects of Radon baths as adjunct to a&#xD;
      multimodal rehabilitative treatment of RA.&#xD;
