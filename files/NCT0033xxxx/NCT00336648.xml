      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To assess resectability rate in patients undergoing gemcitabine plus Avastin-based&#xD;
      chemoradiation followed by pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess disease free survival and overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess margin resection rate (R0 vs. R1) in these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess patterns of failure&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine is designed to disrupt the growth of the cancer cells, which causes the cancer&#xD;
      cells to start to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avastin is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of tumors by its damaging effects on&#xD;
      blood vessel growth in tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment starts, you will have a complete physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons)&#xD;
      will be drawn for tests, and a urine test will be performed. Chest x-rays and computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen will be done. Women who are able to have children must&#xD;
      have a negative blood (1-2 tablespoons) pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive gemcitabine once&#xD;
      a week, Avastin once every 2 weeks, and radiation 5 times a week. Gemcitabine and Avastin&#xD;
      will be given on Saturdays, and the radiation will be given Monday through Friday of each&#xD;
      week. You will receive this treatment as an outpatient for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive gemcitabine through a needle in a vein on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 (+/-&#xD;
      2 days). You will receive Avastin through a needle in a vein every 2 weeks on Days 1, 15, and&#xD;
      29 (+/- 2 days). On the days you receive both drugs, you will receive Avastin over 30-90&#xD;
      minutes and gemcitabine over 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose of Avastin will be given over about 90 minutes. If you do not have a reaction&#xD;
      (such as fever/chills), the next dose will be given over about 60 minutes, and if again no&#xD;
      reaction occurs, each dose after that will be given over about 30 minutes. If you experience&#xD;
      a reaction to the Avastin infusion, you may be given acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) by mouth&#xD;
      and/or diphenhydramine (Benadryl) by vein over 30 minutes before each dose to decrease the&#xD;
      risk of further reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation will be given Monday through Friday for 5 1/2 weeks. Each day of treatment, you&#xD;
      will lie on a treatment table. The radiation therapist will help position your body so that&#xD;
      the radiation goes to the right place. A machine will deliver the radiation. It will take&#xD;
      about 15-20 minutes to receive the radiation treatment each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any days of radiation are missed, these days will be made up at the end of your treatment&#xD;
      (at the end of 28 days) so that you receive the full amount of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, you will have physical exams weekly while you are receiving chemoradiation,&#xD;
      every other week while you are receiving chemotherapy after surgery, and every 4 months&#xD;
      during the follow-up period. You will have blood drawn (1-2 tablespoons each time) for&#xD;
      routine tests on a weekly basis while you are receiving chemoradiation, every other week&#xD;
      while you are taking Avastin after surgery for 3 months, and every 4 months during the&#xD;
      follow-up period. The possible development of side effects will be closely monitored and&#xD;
      could require extra blood and/or urine samples. You may also have physical exams, blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, x-rays, and scans after completing the chemoradiation part of the study,&#xD;
      depending upon what is medically needed for evaluation of ongoing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall effect of treatment will be evaluated at least 8 weeks (+/- 2 days) after the&#xD;
      completion of chemoradiation. A chest x-ray and CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis&#xD;
      will then be performed, and blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Some&#xD;
      participants will have surgery to remove part of the pancreas, if needed. The reason to wait&#xD;
      at least 8 weeks is to allow a safe period of time to pass after the last dose of Avastin to&#xD;
      prevent bleeding during surgery. It may also help decrease the risk of postoperative&#xD;
      complications, including bleeding and poor wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study allows participants to receive up to 3 infusions of Avastin during the&#xD;
      chemoradiation part of the study. If the treatment is shown to benefit you, your doctor may&#xD;
      continue to give additional infusions of Avastin every 2 weeks (+/- 2 days) for 3 months&#xD;
      after surgery. After the Avastin treatment, you will have a chest x-ray, abdominal CT scan,&#xD;
      and blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests every 4 months after surgery&#xD;
      for 2 years to check the status of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The study drugs are commercially available and FDA&#xD;
      approved, but their use together with radiation is experimental. Avastin is FDA approved for&#xD;
      colon and lung cancers but has not been evaluated by the FDA for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      Gemcitabine is FDA approved for pancreatic cancer. Avastin will be provided free of charge&#xD;
      during the study, however the cost of the infusion of the drug will be the responsibility of&#xD;
      you and/or your insurance company. The costs of gemcitabine and radiation are considered&#xD;
      standard of care, and will be the responsibility of you and/or your insurance company. Up to&#xD;
      31 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
