  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human phagocytic cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are readily mobilized to&#xD;
      sites of infection and ingest microorganisms by a process known as phagocytosis. The combined&#xD;
      effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteolytic peptides and enzymes released into&#xD;
      forming bacterial phagosomes kill most ingested bacteria. However, many human bacterial&#xD;
      pathogens have devised means to subvert normal phagocyte responses and the innate immune&#xD;
      response and cause severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to elucidate specific features of pathogen-phagocyte&#xD;
      interactions that underlie evasion of the innate immune response or contribute to the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of disease or inflammatory disorders. Therefore, specific projects will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify and characterize specific mechanisms used by pathogenic microorganisms to evade&#xD;
           or subvert normal phagocyte responses and therefore cause disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate phagocyte response mechanisms to specific pathogenic microorganisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify specific bacterial structures and/or (gene) products that dictate differences&#xD;
           in phagocyte responses among a range of pathogens so that generalized statements can be&#xD;
           made about the pathophysiology of disease states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies will be performed using multiple techniques including state-of-the-art equipment&#xD;
      for genomics and proteomics strategies to identify target bacterial genes/proteins of&#xD;
      interest or those up-regulated in phagocytes. Phagocyte-pathogen interactions will be&#xD;
      examined using fluorescence-based real-time assays and video microscopy, confocal and&#xD;
      electron microscopy in combination with enzymatic assays for ROS production, routine&#xD;
      biochemistry, immunology and cell biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementing these studies will require isolation of phagocytic leukocytes from venous blood&#xD;
      of healthy human volunteers. The study population will be all-inclusive except in certain&#xD;
      instances where individuals possess genetic defects that impair phagocyte function (e.g.,&#xD;
      myeloperoxidase-deficiency) or have altered phagocyte function due to outside influences such&#xD;
      as recent bacterial or viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed studies will likely provide new information pertinent to understanding host&#xD;
      cell-pathogen interactions and the pathophysiology of inflammatory conditions.&#xD;

      Human phagocytic cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils or PMNs) are readily&#xD;
      mobilized to sites of infection and ingest microorganisms by a process known as phagocytosis.&#xD;
      The combined effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides released&#xD;
      into forming bacterial phagosomes kill most ingested bacteria. However, many bacterial&#xD;
      pathogens have devised means to evade normal phagocyte responses and cause severe disease in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to elucidate specific features of pathogen-phagocyte&#xD;
      interactions that underlie evasion of the innate immune response or contribute to the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of disease or inflammatory disorders. Therefore, projects will address 3&#xD;
      specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify and characterize specific mechanisms used by pathogenic microorganisms to evade&#xD;
           or subvert normal phagocyte responses and therefore cause disease.&#xD;
