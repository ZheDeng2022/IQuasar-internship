  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful in suppressing&#xD;
      plasma HIV RNA levels and providing significant clinical benefit in infected patients, it&#xD;
      does not eradicate HIV infection. It is now clear that virus replication persists despite&#xD;
      undetectable plasma viremia in individuals receiving HAART. In this regard, withdrawing&#xD;
      HAART, even after prolonged periods of virus suppression, leads almost invariably to a rapid&#xD;
      rebound of plasma viremia. It is also now clear that prolonged, continuous HAART carries a&#xD;
      risk of significant toxicity and side effects. In addition, the monetary cost of HAART is&#xD;
      prohibitive for many individuals and countries. In terms of cost, 95% of the HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals in the world are beyond the reach of therapy as a direct consequence of the cost&#xD;
      of therapy. These observations may argue for a different approach to HAART with the goals of:&#xD;
      1) durable suppression of virus replication, without an attempt at eradication, 2)&#xD;
      minimization of toxicity and side effects and improvement in patient life-style, and 3) a&#xD;
      reduction in cost. Preliminary data from a pilot study conducted at the National Institutes&#xD;
      of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, USA, have demonstrated that short cycle structured&#xD;
      intermittent therapy, 7 days HAART drug followed by 7 days off HAART has maintained&#xD;
      suppression of plasma HIV RNA while preserving CD4+ T cell counts for up to 80 weeks. In&#xD;
      addition, there was no evidence for increased HIV in reservoir sites; nor was there evidence&#xD;
      for the development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs. Finally, there was a decrease in&#xD;
      parameters of toxicity. This approach may have particular applicability for the treatment of&#xD;
      HIV in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, we propose to study the virologic and immunologic&#xD;
      effects of short cycle intermittent versus continuous HAART in HIV-infected individuals from&#xD;
      the JCRC (Kampala, Uganda) in a randomized, controlled, intent-to-treat trial. We shall&#xD;
      evaluate both the 7 days on-HAART/7 days off-HAART as well as a 2 days off-HAART/5 days&#xD;
      on-HAART approach. In December, 2004, the 7/7 arm was discontinued....&#xD;
