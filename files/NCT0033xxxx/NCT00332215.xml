  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of inhaled sodium pyruvate in&#xD;
      people with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Further, to determine whether inhaled sodium pyruvate will&#xD;
      improve lung function, as determined by FEV1, or reduce inflammatory markers in induced&#xD;
      sputum of people with CF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that causes airway blockage and infection that damages the&#xD;
      lung. The lungs of CF patients are frequently loaded with inflammatory cells, damaging&#xD;
      proteins and oxidants. Oxidants are molecules that contain oxygen and are capable of&#xD;
      disrupting cells and tissue. The CF protein is involved in the transport of the important&#xD;
      antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Antioxidants are molecules that block oxidants and render them&#xD;
      inactive. The absence of this protection in the airways makes them prone to damage from&#xD;
      oxidants. Sodium pyruvate is part of the body's natural anti-oxidant defense system. Sodium&#xD;
      pyruvate reacts directly with oxygen radicals to neutralize them and increases cellular&#xD;
      levels of glutathione.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of 3 different single&#xD;
      dose levels of sodium pyruvate administered via a nebulizer to persons with CF lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a phase I study with 3 stages. In the first stage subjects will receive one of 3&#xD;
      possible doses of the active drug only once. In the second stage subjects will receive 2&#xD;
      doses of the active drug 12 hours apart. In the third stage subjects will receive either&#xD;
      active drug or placebo every 12 hours for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For stage 1 subjects will come to the University of Minnesota's General Clinical Research&#xD;
      Center (GCRC) for a screening visit. They will return to the GCRC 1 to 7 days later for a&#xD;
      baseline assessment that will be followed by study drug administration. The subject will be&#xD;
      observed for 4 hours and safety parameters will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For stage 2 subjects will come to the GCRC for a screening visit. They will return to the&#xD;
      GCRC 1 to 7 days later for a baseline assessment that will be followed by study drug&#xD;
      administration. Safety parameters will be obtained for the following 4 hours. 12 hours after&#xD;
      the first dose was given the subject will receive a second dose and safety parameters will&#xD;
      again be obtained over the next 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For stage 3 subjects will come to the GCRC for a screening visit. They will return to the&#xD;
      GCRC 1 to 7 days later for a baseline assessment that will be followed by study drug&#xD;
      administration. Safety parameters will be obtained for the following 4 hours. The subject&#xD;
      will be sent home to continue on study drug every 12 hours for the following 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      subject will be asked to return to the GCRC once a week for safety assessments.&#xD;
