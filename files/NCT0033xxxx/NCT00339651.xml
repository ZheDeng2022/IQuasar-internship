  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted jointly by the National Cancer Institute and the Kaiser Permanente&#xD;
      Center for Health Research Northwest (KPCHRN) in Portland, Oregon, will lay the groundwork&#xD;
      for a future study to identify precursors of endometrial cancer; that is, conditions that&#xD;
      precede development of cancer of the lining of the uterus. The diagnosis of endometrial&#xD;
      hyperplasia (a condition of abnormal proliferation of endometrial tissue) includes most&#xD;
      precursors of endometrial cancer, as well as many benign conditions. Currently, three methods&#xD;
      of classifying endometrial cancer precursors have been suggested based on endometrial&#xD;
      hyperplasia findings, but it is not known which classification best predicts cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine surgical specimens of hyperplasia and cancer from women diagnosed&#xD;
      with endometrial cancer at least 2 years after a diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia.&#xD;
      Investigators will estimate the percentage of cases with different degrees of hyperplasia,&#xD;
      and assess the subsequent cancers that developed. This will allow them to rank hyperplasia&#xD;
      lesions according to cancer risk and identify lesions that represent the most immediate&#xD;
      cancer precursors. They will also review patients medical charts for information related to&#xD;
      cancer risk and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will include women enrolled in the KPCHRN who are 40 years of age or older&#xD;
      and who were diagnosed with endometrial cancer at least 2 years after being diagnosed with&#xD;
      endometrial hyperplasia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three systems have been proposed to classify endometrial carcinoma precursors, but it is&#xD;
      currently unclear which system best predicts cancer risk and is most reproducible. The&#xD;
      optimal surrogate endpoint for endometrial carcinoma is therefore unknown. The pathologic&#xD;
      diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia (EH) includes most suspected immediate precursors and&#xD;
      many mild, highly reversible proliferations. We propose an exploratory study to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of investigating EH as a source of an endometrial carcinoma surrogate endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are conducting a nested case-control study within a large, population-based health care&#xD;
      plan. We will identify cases, defined as women who were diagnosed with EH at least one year&#xD;
      before being diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma or severe atypical hyperplasia at&#xD;
      hysterectomy, through a computerized search of plan databases. We will retrieve the slides&#xD;
      from the matching biopsy and hysterectomy on which carcinoma was diagnosed. Women ages 40 or&#xD;
      older who were plan members and received a biopsy or curettage diagnosis of EH between 1970&#xD;
      and 2002 will be eligible to be a case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform an initial histologic review of cases index biopsy slides to assess two types&#xD;
      of misclassification known to affect the diagnosis of EH: a) false-negative endometrial&#xD;
      carcinoma (i.e., prevalent carcinoma t the time of EH diagnosis) and b) false-positive EH&#xD;
      (i.e., a benign, non-hyperplastic lesion). From cases physical records and linked computer&#xD;
      records, we will collect data on histopathologic classification of EH lesions and subsequent&#xD;
      carcinomas; descriptive data (e.g., patient weight, parity, and menopausal status); and a&#xD;
      summary of relevant treatments and follow-up procedures (e.g., hormone therapy or additional&#xD;
      clinical procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will select controls, defined as women who were diagnosed with EH but then did not develop&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma or undergo hysterectomy for a follow-up interval that is equivalent to&#xD;
      the follow-up interval of the cases. Controls will be individually matched to cases on age at&#xD;
      EH diagnosis, date of EH diagnosis, and duration of follow-up, and also counter-matched based&#xD;
      on the original EH diagnosis. After selecting 3 controls per case, we will assemble the same&#xD;
      data from controls: histologic review of original slides, descriptive data from medical&#xD;
      records databases, and treatment and follow-up procedure data from linked databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will then be used to estimate the cancer risk associated with specific EH&#xD;
      classifications, identify other patient or clinical factors that might modify those risks,&#xD;
      explore predictors of EH, and explore molecular factors that might influence the probability&#xD;
      of developing carcinoma after a diagnosis of EH.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All women who were members of the KPNW health plan between 1970 and 2003 who were at risk&#xD;
        of developing endometrial carcinoma will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women will be considered ineligible if they had substantial gaps in KPNW coverage during&#xD;
        the years between the index biopsy and diagnosis date (cases) or censoring date (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
        NCI and KPNW will review otherwise eligible women who have coverage gaps to identify&#xD;
        substantial gaps and determine eligibility on an individual basis.&#xD;
