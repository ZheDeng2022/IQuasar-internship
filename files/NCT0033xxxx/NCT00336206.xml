  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate if the treatment with Alemtuzumab (after I or II line&#xD;
      chemotherapy) administered for 6 weeks followed by 4 months maintenance treatment compared to&#xD;
      a control group can reduce disease activity/residual disease and thereby delay the&#xD;
      reoccurrence of the CLL disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fludarabine (F) alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide (FC) is not a curative&#xD;
      treatment for patients with CLL, all patients will eventually relapse. Therefore there is a&#xD;
      medical need to look for consolidation followed by maintenance therapies which are able to&#xD;
      prolong response duration or which can shift anti-tumor therapy induced partial remissions to&#xD;
      complete remissions or eradicate minimal residual disease in complete - but still&#xD;
      PCR-positive - responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no standard consolidation therapy available at the moment and the role of&#xD;
      consolidation in CLL has recently been acknowledged as a research field of major importance&#xD;
      in B-CLL (Schering global advisory board meeting, Lisbon Nov 2005). Possible treatment&#xD;
      options are high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (the role&#xD;
      of which however remains uncertain with lack of worldwide consensus) or monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      therapy against antigens expressed by CLL cells. Alemtuzumab is directed against the&#xD;
      CD52-antigen which is present in high density on CLL cells and may therefore be most suitable&#xD;
      for treatment of residual disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alemtuzumab has shown significant remission rates in patients with fludarabine refractory CLL&#xD;
      and sub analysis revealed a very high effectiveness of the antibody in clearing CLL cells&#xD;
      from peripheral blood and bone marrow. These findings suggest that Alemtuzumab might be an&#xD;
      ideal candidate to eliminate minimal residual disease in a post-remission treatment after&#xD;
      anti-tumor therapy and to be used as maintenance therapy. The efficacy of Alemtuzumab as&#xD;
      consolidation therapy in CLL can easily be measured. There is evidence from several studies&#xD;
      that treatment with Alemtuzumab does not have a negative impact on stem cell mobilization.&#xD;
      Therefore, autologous stem cell transplantation still remains as a further treatment option&#xD;
      for those patients who still have detectable disease after primary cytoreduction followed by&#xD;
      consolidation therapy with Alemtuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects of s.c. Alemtuzumab in heavily pretreated patients with advanced disease are&#xD;
      tolerable and manageable. Data have suggested that the safety profile of this antibody is&#xD;
      even more favorable in less pretreated patients and the GCLLSG study suggests that a wash-out&#xD;
      period of more than 8 weeks and possibly also a lower dose is necessary to avoid severe&#xD;
      infectious problems. Campath administration started after a 2-month wash out period after&#xD;
      Fludarabine was shown to be feasible and good tolerated. Based on the collective data&#xD;
      obtained from other pilot or phase II studies, a subcutaneous consolidation dose of 30 mg&#xD;
      once weekly in previously treated and untreated CLL patients after an induction with&#xD;
      Fludarabine combination seems to be a safe and effective dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to evaluate the efficacy of low dose treatment with Alemtuzumab with&#xD;
      regard to the following questions: Does consolidation therapy with low dose Alemtuzumab&#xD;
      result in a prolonged time to disease progression in comparison to patients who do not&#xD;
      receive further treatment? Is it possible to turn a PR into a CR? Does maintenance therapy&#xD;
      with Alemtuzumab translate into a progression-free survival benefit compared to patients with&#xD;
      no further treatment? How is the safety profile in patients treated with low dose Alemtuzumab&#xD;
      as MRD elimination and as maintenance therapy?&#xD;
