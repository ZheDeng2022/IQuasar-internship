  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The theme of this Morehouse-Emory Partnership Program focuses on elucidating the etiologic&#xD;
      basis of ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and discovering new intervention&#xD;
      strategies to ameliorate CV health in all communities. The proposed Program uses a&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize ethnic differences in&#xD;
      obesity-related CVD by drawing upon the fields of physiology, psychology, biochemistry,&#xD;
      vascular biology, public health, nursing and clinical medicine.&#xD;

      Emerging evidence indicates that there are ethnicity-specific differences in the profile of&#xD;
      biochemical, metabolic and physiological perturbations associated with obesity. The&#xD;
      implications of these ethnic differences remain to be further defined. Several epidemiologic&#xD;
      studies have shown that vascular disease and its cardiovascular complications, carry&#xD;
      significantly higher morbidity and mortality in African Americans compared with&#xD;
      Caucasians.1-3 These observations may be partly explained by a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and&#xD;
      tobacco use among African Americans.4-6 However, the pathophysiological processes underlying&#xD;
      this racial predisposition have not been fully elucidated.7 It is likely that the etiologic&#xD;
      basis of ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease is multi-factorial and involves dynamic&#xD;
      gene-environment interactions in which variances in behavior and the social context are&#xD;
      critical determinants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed Program recognizes the importance of incorporating both biological factors and&#xD;
      social determinants in the analysis of cardiovascular disparities&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Our methodological approach will involve a random digit-dialing cross-sectional survey of&#xD;
        4000 Metro Atlanta area AA and white residents (ages 30-65 years). This aim will focus on&#xD;
        using well-validated survey instruments to examine self-reported perceptions of&#xD;
        psychosocial stress, neighborhood segregation factors and health beliefs related to&#xD;
        weight/weight control. These parameters will be assessed in relation to the differential&#xD;
        prevalence of three major outcomes: (1) self-reported maladaptive cardiovascular behaviors&#xD;
        that predispose to obesity-related CVD (ie high fat/sodium and low fruit/vegetables dietary&#xD;
        intake and physical inactivity); (2) obesity; and (3) hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will address the following research questions: Are the observed racial&#xD;
        differences in maladaptive health behaviors (diet/inactivity) and MetS components (obesity,&#xD;
        hypertension) associated with: a) perceived psychosocial stress, and if so, does&#xD;
        depression, neighborhood factors or health beliefs around weight and weight control modify&#xD;
        this relationship?&#xD;
