  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and Penn State University, will&#xD;
      examine how a diet high in legumes (dried beans) influences risk factors for colon cancer and&#xD;
      polyps. Many scientists believe that colon and rectal cancers develop from polyps (tumors of&#xD;
      the lining of the large bowel). This study will test whether a high-legume diet can reduce&#xD;
      levels of certain factors (blood insulin, blood glucose, and markers of inflammation such as&#xD;
      C-reactive protein) that at elevated levels are known to increase the risk of colorectal&#xD;
      polyps and colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy men between 35 and 75 years of age may be eligible for this study, conducted at Penn&#xD;
      State University in University Park, Pennsylvania. Candidates are screened with blood tests&#xD;
      and measurements of height, weight, and blood pressure. All candidates must have had a&#xD;
      colonoscopy within 2 years of entering the study. They may or may not have had adenomas and&#xD;
      may or may not be insulin-resistant. Candidates must not have cancer, heart disease, kidney&#xD;
      disease, diabetes, or other serious medical condition, and they must have no history of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, polyp removal, bowel surgery, polyposis syndrome, or inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caloric requirement testing: The subject's resting metabolic rate is measured while&#xD;
           fasting and in the early morning at rest to determine daily calorie requirement before&#xD;
           beginning the study diet. A special clear plastic hood is placed over the subject's head&#xD;
           while his breathing is measured. He can communicate with the technician at all times&#xD;
           during the 30-minute test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study diet: Subjects follow two required 4-week diets with a 3-week break in between,&#xD;
           followed by an optional third 4-week diet. Subjects eat a healthy American diet for both&#xD;
           of the required 4-week diet periods; about 1-1/2 cups of cooked legumes, such as pinto,&#xD;
           baked, and navy beans are added to one of the two required diets. For the third&#xD;
           (optional) diet period, subjects are given the same 1-1/2 cups of legumes, but are&#xD;
           allowed to lose weight. Participants are given packages with all of the food they are to&#xD;
           consume during the three diet periods. They may add up to five caffeine-containing&#xD;
           beverages per day and up to two alcoholic drinks per week. They must eat all of the food&#xD;
           they are given and only the food they are given. Subjects are expected to maintain a&#xD;
           constant body weight during the two 4-week required diets, and their caloric intake may&#xD;
           be increased or decreased as needed to maintain their screening weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight measurements: Subjects are weighed regularly at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples: Subjects have blood samples drawn at the mid-point of each of the two&#xD;
           required 4-week diets and at the beginning and end of each of the three 4-week diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine and stool samples: Urine and stool samples are collected at the beginning and end&#xD;
           of the two required 4-week diets.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Clinical, epidemiological, and molecular studies provide compelling evidence that most&#xD;
      colorectal cancers arise from adenomas. The epidemiology of adenomas closely resembles that&#xD;
      of colorectal cancer itself, and prevention of adenomas will most likely prevent colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are emerging as significant risk factors for&#xD;
      colorectal (CRC) cancer and adenomas. Insulin resistance is defined as impaired biological&#xD;
      response to the action of insulin. It is characterized by compensatory hyperinsulinemia and&#xD;
      is associated with increased risk for Type 2 diabetes. C-peptide, a marker of insulin&#xD;
      production, is elevated in IR and is also a risk factor for CRC. Both insulin resistance and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer are increasingly recognized as chronic, low-level, inflammatory states.&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein and a sensitive marker of sub-clinical&#xD;
      inflammation, is a risk factor for both IR and CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis from the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT), a multi-center, randomized trial of 1905&#xD;
      participants who had a colorectal adenoma, showed that legume consumption was significantly&#xD;
      associated with reduction of both adenoma recurrence and advanced adenoma recurrence. Legumes&#xD;
      are a rich source of dietary fibers and anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer phytochemicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are evaluating the effects of a legume enriched, low glycemic index, high fermentable&#xD;
      fiber diet, on CRP, (a measure of inflammation) and C-peptide (a measure of insulin&#xD;
      resistance) in participants with four possible combinations of the risk factors insulin&#xD;
      resistance and history of adenomatous polyps. In a randomized crossover design controlled&#xD;
      feeding study each participant consumed the above experimental diet and a control diet for&#xD;
      four weeks with a two week washout period between diets. 65 male participants were recruited&#xD;
      and randomized into four groups. A secondary objective is to assess whether these endpoints&#xD;
      change by IR status or a history of adenomas. In addition, potential fecal markers of CRC&#xD;
      risk are being measured to assess changes in gastrointestinal inflammation, including mRNA&#xD;
      from exfoliated fecal colonocytes. To our knowledge this is the first controlled feeding&#xD;
      study: 1. to examine the effects of legumes or a low GI diet on markers of inflammation; 2.&#xD;
      to compare the effects of a dietary intervention on patients with a history of colon adenomas&#xD;
      with or without IR; and 3. to measure the effects of dietary changes in human intestinal gene&#xD;
      expression profiles using exfoliated colonocytes.&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Subjects have a BMI 25.0-34.9 kg/m(2)&#xD;

               4. Subjects had a colonoscopy within the last two years&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Subjects who had had one or more histologically confirmed adenomas removed from&#xD;
                  the colon during a colonoscopy in the last two years, in which the cecum was&#xD;
                  visualized, all polyps were removed, and the bowel was adequately prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Subjects have had either an adenoma previous to the above colonoscopy or multiple&#xD;

               7. Subjects should have more than one previous adenoma in the colon. Rectal adenomas&#xD;
                  will be excluded. (If a person has only rectal adenomas or 1 colon and numerous&#xD;
                  rectal adenomas they will be excluded from the study, since the epidemiology for&#xD;
                  rectal and colon adenomas differ)&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Subjects are insulin resistance as determined by the Homeostasis Assessment Model&#xD;
                  (HOMA-IR), a mathematical model which allows values for insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
                  beta-cell function (expressed as percent of normal) to be obtained from&#xD;
                  simultaneous fasting plasma glucose and fasting insulin. HOMA-IRA is calculated&#xD;
                  by fasting serum insulin (FI in uU/mL); fasting glucose (FG in mmol/L) / 22.5 or&#xD;
                  HOMA-IR = FIxFG/22.5 (188). Values greater than or equal to 2.61 are considered&#xD;
                  insulin resistant&#xD;

&#xD;
              14. Subjects (controls) had a colonoscopy within the last two years and who had no&#xD;
                  histologically confirmed colorectal adenomas during the colonoscopy, in which the&#xD;
