      This study, conducted at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, England, will determine whether&#xD;
      cells passed from mother to offspring during pregnancy increase or decrease the child's risk&#xD;
      of developing type 1 diabetes. Previous research has shown that certain cells that can be&#xD;
      passed from mothers to their children during pregnancy may affect the child's chance of&#xD;
      developing other autoimmune diseases. The cells from the mother may persist in the child's&#xD;
      blood for years after birth and stimulate the child's immune system in such a way that may&#xD;
      either increase or decrease the chance of the child developing diabetes. This study will&#xD;
      determine whether these cells are present in identical twins, where only one of the twins has&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the British Diabetic Twins Study in England may be eligible to participate.&#xD;
      Of each twin pair in the study, one must have type 1 diabetes and the other must be free of&#xD;
      the disease. The twins' mother must be alive and willing to provide a blood sample. For&#xD;
      female twins only, their children must be alive and willing to provide either a blood or a&#xD;
      buccal cell sample (cheek swab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both twins in each twin pair provide a blood sample collected on a single occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mother of each twin pair provides a blood sample collected on a single occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children of female twins provide a single sample from either the mouth or blood. For&#xD;
           children younger than 12 years of age, a cell sample is collected from the inside of the&#xD;
           mouth (buccal) using a toothbrush. The child strokes the inside (cheek) of the mouth&#xD;
           with the toothbrush ten times on each side, spits this into a collection vial,&#xD;
           immediately rinses the mouth with water and adds this rinse to the sample collection&#xD;
           vial. Children over 12 years of age may provide either a buccal cell sample or a blood&#xD;
           sample.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is one of several autoimmune diseases of unclear etiology in which the&#xD;
      discordance rate between identical twins is between 30-40%, even after many years of&#xD;
      follow-up. This intermediate discordance rate indicates that there are clearly genetic&#xD;
      factors at play in susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, with most genetic contribution coming&#xD;
      from the HLA locus. However, this discordance rate also means that other, non-genetic&#xD;
      factors, possibly environmental, lead to the development of disease in only one of two&#xD;
      genetically identical individuals. No consensus exists on the nature of these putative&#xD;
      environmental differences, which are all the more remarkable for occurring in twins that&#xD;
      generally share the same intrauterine, family and school environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence has suggested that the development of certain autoimmune diseases,&#xD;
      particularly scleroderma, may be influenced by microchimerism: Both fetomaternal&#xD;
      microchimerisms (persistence of fetal cells in the maternal circulation after birth of the&#xD;
      child) and maternofetal microchimerism (persistence of maternal cells in the child's&#xD;
      circulation for years after birth) have been suggested as creating an abnormal environment&#xD;
      that might stimulate the development of autoimmunity in genetically susceptible individuals.&#xD;
      The reverse is also possible, i.e., that these abnormal cells may stimulate the immune system&#xD;
      in such a way that autoimmunity does not develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identical or monozygotic (MZ) twins who are discordant for type 1 diabetes offer a unique&#xD;
      experimental model in which to test the hypothesis that quantitative differences in&#xD;
      persistent maternofetal microchimerism influence the development of type 1 diabetes in these&#xD;
      genetically susceptible individuals. This study will use pairs of MZ twins discordant for the&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes that are already participating in the British Diabetic Twins Study being&#xD;
      conducted by Dr. David Leslie at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London, UK. If the mothers of&#xD;
      the twins (both female and male) and offspring of the female twins (only) are available for&#xD;
      study, they will be asked to provide a single blood sample (twins, mothers, offspring greater&#xD;
      than 12 years of age) or buccal cell sample (offspring less than or equal to 12 years of age)&#xD;
      from which DNA will be purified. This is to confirm the origin of the chimeric cells; since&#xD;
      cells are passed from the mothers to the offspring during pregnancy, we require (DNA) samples&#xD;
      from the mothers of all twins (male and female) who participate in this study. But since the&#xD;
      opposite is true, that cells can also be passed from offspring to their mothers during&#xD;
      pregnancy, we will require (DNA) samples from the female twins' offspring to determine the&#xD;
      true origin of any chimeric cells. The DNA will be used for HLA genotyping to identify&#xD;
      nonshared HLA alleles that can be used to develop specific assays for the persistence of&#xD;
      maternal DNA in the twins' circulation and quantitative PCR of the mother's genotype in CD3+&#xD;
      cells isolated from the twins. Since trafficking of chimeric cells can be bi-directional,&#xD;
      twins who have had offspring of their own may have chimeric cells of both fetal and maternal&#xD;
      origin in their circulation. To confirm the origin of the chimeric cells, the blood or buccal&#xD;
      cells collected from the offspring of the twins will be genotyped and these compared to the&#xD;
      genotypes of the twins' mothers. Blood will be drawn and DNA purified by Dr. Leslie's group&#xD;
      in London; the genotyping and quantitative PCR will be performed by Dr. Artlett's group at&#xD;
      Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, which has been studying microchimerism since 1998.&#xD;
      Results of the study may provide evidence in support of microchimerism as an influential&#xD;
      factor in the development of type 1 diabetes. Evidence in support to this concept would be an&#xD;
      important addition to the literature on &quot;environmental&quot; factors that influence type 1&#xD;
      diabetes etiology, and also suggest potential immunosuppression or other strategies in type 1&#xD;
      diabetes prevention.&#xD;
