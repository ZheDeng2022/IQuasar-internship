  <brief_summary>

      This study is for the purpose of determining whether cognitive remediation may improve&#xD;
      cognition and treatment response in patients entering substance abuse day treatment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients entering substance abuse treatment display cognitive deficits that may&#xD;
      reduce their ability to benefit from their treatment. While there is considerable variety in&#xD;
      the severity and types of cognitive impairment found in newly recovering patients, problems&#xD;
      with attention, memory and executive function are very common. Since treatment requires&#xD;
      sustained attention, remembering what is learned, integrating that knowledge and applying it&#xD;
      to recovery, impairment in underlying cognitive processes makes successful treatment less&#xD;
      likely. Although cognitive functioning improves with sustained sobriety, it is during the&#xD;
      early phase of recovery that most patients receive the most intensive treatment. Recent&#xD;
      research has suggested that cognitive remediation exercises during this early phase may speed&#xD;
      up the return of cognitive functioning and in so doing may have a direct effect on whether&#xD;
      patients find the treatment useful and complete their treatment. By keeping patients in&#xD;
      treatment longer, cognitive remediation may have an indirect effect on substance abuse&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To pilot test the introduction of cognitive remediation at the Substance Abuse&#xD;
      Day Treatment Program (SADP) at the Errara Community Care Center. Aims are 1) to assess the&#xD;
      receptivity of patients to the intervention by determining rates of agreement to participate,&#xD;
      2) to determine the number of cognitive remediation sessions that patients are willing to&#xD;
      engage in, 3) to assess a variety of cognitive remediation tasks for their acceptability, 4)&#xD;
      to evaluate neuropsychological improvements using pre-post assessment, 5) to evaluate its&#xD;
      effects on substance abuse treatment participation, and 6) to evaluate its effects on&#xD;
      substance abuse outcomes at 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized clinical trial of cognitive remediation with an active control condition&#xD;
      with observations at baseline, end of treatment and 6-months from intake&#xD;

  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The intervention could not be successfully carried out in the SADP setting because of issues&#xD;
    independent of the cognitive training intervention.&#xD;
