  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clofarabine is a new chemotherapy drug which was FDA approved for the treatment of acute&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia in children. This study is being done to see if Clofarabine works in&#xD;
      adult patients with B-cell types of lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done to develop new treatments for patients with lymphoma whose cancer&#xD;
      has returned or resisted treatment with previous chemotherapy.&#xD;
