      The Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis and the Pharmocogenetics Section of the Genetic&#xD;
      Epidemiology Branch will conduct a lung cancer case-control study in Baltimore, Maryland. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis of the study is to determine if mutagen sensitivity, p53 induction and&#xD;
      apoptosis in cultured lymphocytes will be predictive of lung cancer risk. While there are&#xD;
      some studies that examine mutagen sensitivity, none of these assays has been well-studied in&#xD;
      an epidemiological setting. Because of methodological issues described herein, and the&#xD;
      proposed development of new assays, this study will be viewed as a pilot and therefore&#xD;
      hypotheses generating. The design of this molecular epidemiology study has been specifically&#xD;
      developed to test the reliability and validity of the mutagen sensitivity assay, where a&#xD;
      case-control study is needed to assess the possibility of case bias (i.e., results vary due&#xD;
      to the concurrent presence of lung cancer rather than risk). Importantly, this protocol will&#xD;
      establish a resource that will allow for the validation of these assays and also for the&#xD;
      study of other biomarkers and gene-environment interactions, especially those related to DNA&#xD;
      repair. Th secondary goals of this study are to 1) demonstrate gene-neuro-behavioral&#xD;
      interactions for smoking addiction in controls and 2) assess the relationship of sex-steroid&#xD;
      metabolism an and estrogen exposure to lung cancer risk. Cases will have histologically&#xD;
      confirmed lung cancer and reside in Baltimore an and surrounding areas. They will be&#xD;
      identified through six hospitals in Baltimore. Cases will be recently diagnosed and blood&#xD;
      will be collected prior to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Because of this requirement to&#xD;
      obtain samples before treatment (or for surgical cases at least two months after surgery), we&#xD;
      recognize that case ascertainment will be reduced, but critical data to assess differences&#xD;
      between eligible and ineligible subjects will be collected through tumor registries. Two&#xD;
      control groups will be used, the first will be hospital-based (frequency matched by age,&#xD;
      gender, race, smoking and hospital) and the second will be population-based (frequency&#xD;
      matched by age-, gender and race). The first control group will allow us to examine risk&#xD;
      factors for lung cancer independent of smoking (odds ration for smoking = 1.0), and the&#xD;
      second will allow the results to be extrapolated to the general population and also will be&#xD;
      used to validate the phenotyping assays. The strategy for recruitment will allow us to&#xD;
      over-sample for women and African Americans, so that after examination of data for the entire&#xD;
      study group, we can assess differences by these subgroups. Cases and controls will receive a&#xD;
      structured, in person interview assessing prior medical and cancer history, tobacco use,&#xD;
      alcohol use, current medications, occupational history, family medical history, menstrual&#xD;
      history and estrogen use, recent nutritional supplements and caffeine intake, and&#xD;
      socioeconomic status. The questionnaire also will include the Fagerstrom index for nicotine&#xD;
      dependence (FTND), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, and a modified&#xD;
      version of the Horn-Waingrow Reasons for Smoking (RFS) Scale. The phenotypic markers to be&#xD;
      studied will assess DNA repair with cellular response by using lymphocyte cultures exposed in&#xD;
      vitro to radiation, bleomycin, benzo(a)pyrene-diol-expoxide and N-methyl-nitrosurea and then&#xD;
      measuring induction of chromosomal aberrations, p53 induction and apoptosis. DNA from cases&#xD;
      and controls also will be used for genetic polymorphism analysis of carcinogen metabolism,&#xD;
      and those relating to the dopaminergic system and nicotinic receptors. Tumors from cases will&#xD;
      be evaluated for estrogen and progesterone receptors. The target accrual number of total&#xD;
      subjects will be 1,200 where there will be 100 cases for each combination of gender and race&#xD;
      (Caucasian- and African Americans), matched to 100 each of the hospital-based and&#xD;
      population-based controls.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis is conducting an observational non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) case-control study in Baltimore, MD. This molecular epidemiology study was&#xD;
      developed to test the reliability and validity of the mutagen sensitivity assay, where a&#xD;
      case-control study is needed to assess the possibility of case bias. Importantly, this&#xD;
      protocol establishes a resource that allows for the study of additional biomarkers and&#xD;
      gene-environment interactions. Upon recruitment, cases and controls receive a structured, in&#xD;
      person interview assessing prior medical and cancer history, use of tobacco and electronic&#xD;
      cigarettes, alcohol use, current medications, occupational history, family medical history,&#xD;
      menstrual history and estrogen use, recent nutritional supplements and caffeine intake, and&#xD;
      socioeconomic status. Specimen collection consists of a one-time blood sample and/or&#xD;
      mouthwash to collect cheek cells (oral cells) and a one-time urine sample. In addition,&#xD;
      cancer and surrounding non-cancer tissue that was surgically removed and not needed for&#xD;
      diagnosis may be obtained for cases, as well as current medical information from medical&#xD;
      records. Primary cell cultures may be established from available fresh tumor tissue. The&#xD;
      phenotypic markers to be studied will assess proficiency of DNA repair in lymphocyte cultures&#xD;
      exposed in vitro to radiation, bleomycin, benzo(a)pyrene-diol-epoxide by measuring induction&#xD;
      of chromosomal aberrations, p53 and apoptosis. DNA from buffy coats or cheek cells will be&#xD;
      used for analysis of germline variation in the form of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)&#xD;
      in genes involved in DNA repair, innate immunity, cell cycle control, angiogenesis,&#xD;
      apoptosis, cytokines, nicotine addiction, inflammation, hormone metabolism and microRNA.&#xD;
      Additionally, IRB approval was received in 2010 to include this study in a multi-institution&#xD;
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) of lung cancer in African Americans. Tumors from cases&#xD;
      will be evaluated for estrogen and progesterone receptors, somatic mutations, and gene&#xD;
      expression. Urine, plasma, serum and tissue sample metabolomics will be analyzed by&#xD;
      untargeted approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if mutagen sensitivity, p53 induction, and apoptosis in cultured&#xD;
           lymphocytes are predictive of lung cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the relationship between sex-steroid metabolism, estrogen exposure, and&#xD;
           lung cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate and develop phenotypic or predictive markers of lung cancer risk and&#xD;
           survival, based on mutagen sensitivity, polymorphic markers, gene expression, and&#xD;
           metabolomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate racial disparities associated with lung cancer risk and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To examine the relationship between circulating cytokines with risk and survival of lung&#xD;
           cancer and to establish the most robust method of cytokine detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To generate a more accurate measure of ancestry using ancestry informative marker&#xD;
           analysis and to integrate this variable into our studies of health disparities&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To conduct studies of metabolomics on serum, plasma and urine for the purposes of&#xD;
           discovering novel markers of risk, diagnosis and prognosis. We will use ultraperformance&#xD;
           liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UPLS-MS) to search for small&#xD;
           molecular weight endogenous metabolites that can classify cancer and predict outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a novel approach for biomarker discovery that also leverages the non-invasive&#xD;
           process of biospecimen collection. Tumor and corresponding non tumor tissues from&#xD;
           corresponding patients will also be tested using the same methods to extend the&#xD;
           discovery of novel tumor metabolites. Further, metabolites of vitamin D will be examined&#xD;
           on serum samples from lung cancer cases and controls to assess the relationship between&#xD;
           circulating&#xD;
&#xD;
           levels of Vitamin D metabolites with cancer risk and survival. This analysis will be&#xD;
           coupled with testing of Vitamin D pathway SNPs in corresponding patients to determine if&#xD;
           certain SNPs are also associated with levels of vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To evaluate biomarkers of cancer diagnosis and prognosis in circulating tumor DNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To evaluate the microbiome (microbes) present in lung tissue using in situ hybridization&#xD;
           of fixed tissues to be completed at Mayo Clinic by collaborators. The collaborators will&#xD;
           receive no information on the samples other than their tissue of origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To collect data and biospecimens on patients that received low dose CT screening as part&#xD;
           of their lung cancer diagnosis. This is for the purposes of investigating non-invasive&#xD;
           biomarkers of lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Low-dose CT screening is now offered&#xD;
           at UMMS and the VA for the purposes of early lung cancer detection. These screening&#xD;
           guidelines are per CMS guidelines, i.e., age 55-77, &gt;=30 pack-years of smoking and have&#xD;
           quit smoking for 15 years or less. Such high-risk patients will be offered annual&#xD;
           screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. To culture lung cancer specific microbiome-bacteria from human lung cancers. This work&#xD;
           will, in part, be conducted with our collaborator Dr Paul Owrin, who is an expert in the&#xD;
           culture of microbial species from human tissues. These samples, approximately 10 per&#xD;
           year, will be de-identified of all patient information.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. To perform RNA analysis of tumor and normal tissues in collaboration with Dr Isidore&#xD;
           Rigoustos with the aim of discovering novel signaling pathways in lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. To contribute our data to larger consortia so that we can conduct studies with a higher&#xD;
           power and to make valuable, reproducible observations regarding the epidemiology of lung&#xD;
           cancer. We will establish this data transfer via a DTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. To conduct next generation DNA sequencing of tumors (and corresponding normal) of&#xD;
           patients enrolled in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. To collaborate with intramural colleagues, specifically Dr Jung Byun at NIMHD on the&#xD;
           genomic analysis (next generation DNA sequencing) of samples within this contract. We&#xD;
           anticipate sending up to 400 samples. No personal identifiable information will be sent&#xD;
           or included with these samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. To collaborate with extramural colleagues, specifically Dr John Simmons at Personal&#xD;
           Genome Diagnostics, and Dr Peter Campbell at the Welcome Sanger Institute, England, on&#xD;
           the genomic analysis (next generation DNA sequencing) of samples within this contract.&#xD;
           We anticipate sending up to 400 samples. No personal identifiable information will be&#xD;
           sent or included with these samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. To complete MTAs with colleagues outlined in point 16 above.&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. To capture exposures related to reproductive history in both men and women, among both&#xD;
           cases and controls and related these exposures to cancer risk and health disparity.&#xD;
&#xD;
       19. To use data collected through the questionnaire to geocode participants.&#xD;
