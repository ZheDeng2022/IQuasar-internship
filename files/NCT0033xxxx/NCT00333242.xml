      In the proposed study, we will build upon our previous studies validating and characterizing&#xD;
      hyperalgesia in MM samples to explore it's underlying mechanism from a pharmacological&#xD;
      perspective. Utilizing a double-blind, placebo-controlled designs, the proposed work will&#xD;
      evaluate the ability of dextromethorphan , an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists to&#xD;
      diminish or reverse the opioid-induced hyperalgesia complicating the pain states suffered by&#xD;
      MM patients. Specifically, in a sample of MM patients, dextromethorphan, theorized to&#xD;
      interfere with the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia will be evaluated for its&#xD;
      ability to ameliorate or diminish the opioid-induced hyperalgesia in these patients as&#xD;
      reflected by changes on pain threshold and tolerance to both cold-pressor and electrical&#xD;
      pain, at peak and trough methadone blood levels. The results of this work will not only&#xD;
      provide pharmacologic insight into the mechanisms underlying poor pain tolerance in this&#xD;
      at-risk population, but also direction for the medical management of pain complicated by&#xD;
      opioid-induced hyperalgesia.&#xD;

      Addressing the undertreatment of clinical pain has become a national priority, with a central&#xD;
      goal being to identify effective interventions for those subgroups of patients most at risk&#xD;
      for suffering unrelieved pain (NIH Program Announcement PA-01-115). In fact, the&#xD;
      undertreatment of pain was recently ruled a form of patient abuse with a California court&#xD;
      awarding one million dollars in damages to the family of such a patient. Novel data&#xD;
      accumulated by our investigative group has shown that patients maintained on the mu-opioid&#xD;
      agonist, methadone, for the treatment of addiction, are significantly hyperalgesic to&#xD;
      cold-pressor experimental pain as compared to normal controls. This diminished pain&#xD;
      tolerance, in addition to the contextual prohibitions associated with providing known opioid&#xD;
      addicts with opioid analgesics, makes them a population uniquely vulnerable to the&#xD;
      undertreatment of pain. Unfortunately, little is known about how to best manage the pain&#xD;
      suffered by the over 120,000 methadone-maintained (MM) patients in this country, in part&#xD;
      because the hyperalgesia they suffer appears to be akin to neuropathic pain and&#xD;
      opioid-induced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed series of studies, the Principal Investigator (a first-time R01 applicant)&#xD;
      will build upon her previous studies validating and characterizing hyperalgesia in MM samples&#xD;
      to explore it's underlying mechanism from a pharmacological perspective. Utilizing slightly&#xD;
      different double-blind, placebo-controlled designs, the proposed work will evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of three classes of medication (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists, adjuvant&#xD;
      anticonvulsant analgesics, and novel opioid analgesics) to diminish or reverse the&#xD;
      opioid-induced hyperalgesia complicating the pain states suffered by MM patients.&#xD;
      Specifically, in a sample of MM patients, (1) dextromethorphan, which interferes with the&#xD;
      development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, (2) gabapentin, which has proven efficacy in&#xD;
      treating neuropathic pain, and (3) oxycodone, which has novel opioid activity, will each be&#xD;
      evaluated for its ability to ameliorate or diminish the opioid-induced hyperalgesia in these&#xD;
      patients as reflected by changes on pain threshold and tolerance to both cold-pressor and&#xD;
      electrical pain, at peak and trough methadone blood levels. The results of this work will not&#xD;
      only provide pharmacologic insight into the mechanisms underlying poor pain tolerance in this&#xD;
      at-risk population, but also direction for the medical management of pain complicated by&#xD;
      opioid-induced hyperalgesia.&#xD;
