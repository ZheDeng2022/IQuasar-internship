  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of a medication applied&#xD;
      vaginally twice daily in females versus placebo (inactive substance). Study participants will&#xD;
      include 60 women, ages 18-24, non-pregnant, previously sexually active, Human&#xD;
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) negative and sexually transmitted infection (STI) free, in San&#xD;
      Francisco or Kisuma, Kenya. Each study participant will be followed for 14 days of product&#xD;
      use and an additional 7 days for safety assessments. Study procedures will include a physical&#xD;
      exam with a pap smear, urine testing, blood sample testing, and a colposcopy (exam of the&#xD;
      vagina and cervix using a lighted magnifying instrument). Information learned from this study&#xD;
      may help to develop a safe and effective medication that could prevent herpes simplex virus&#xD;
      and HIV. Participants may be involved in study related procedures for up to 55 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over half of global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections occur among those aged&#xD;
      18-24 years and young women are at a particularly high risk of acquiring genital herpes&#xD;
      caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and other sexually transmitted infections&#xD;
      (STI). This is a phase I, randomized, double blind, clinical trial of twice-daily vaginal&#xD;
      VivaGel™ (n equals 40) versus placebo gel (n equals 20). The primary aim of this protocol is&#xD;
      to test the safety and tolerability of VivaGel™ in young women, with the long-term aim of&#xD;
      testing the efficacy of this compound in preventing HSV-2 in a future phase II/III trial. A&#xD;
      total of 60 young women aged 18-24, non-pregnant, previously sexually active, STI and HIV&#xD;
      free, in San Francisco and in Kisumu, Kenya will participate in this study. Eligibility&#xD;
      screening will include medical history, pelvic exam with a Pap smear, urine pregnancy&#xD;
      testing, HIV and STI counseling and testing, hematology testing and liver and renal function&#xD;
      testing. Eligible participants will undergo a pelvic exam with colposcopy. Vaginal swabs will&#xD;
      be collected to evaluate H2O2-producing lactobacilli and Gram stain, Chlamydia, gonorrhea,&#xD;
      and prostate specific antigen (PSA) (to confirm lack of exposure to semen). Endocervical&#xD;
      samples will be collected to measure immunological status. Blood will be collected to conduct&#xD;
      hematology and liver and renal function testing, and plasma will be collected and stored for&#xD;
      batch testing. Subjects will be provided with the investigational product or placebo, given a&#xD;
      Daily Study Record, instructed how to use the product, complete the Daily Study Record, and&#xD;
      report any adverse events (AEs). Follow-up visits will occur on Days 2, 7, 14, and 21. The&#xD;
      primary study objective will be to determine the safety and tolerability of VivaGel™ applied&#xD;
      vaginally twice daily for 14 days in HIV negative and STI-free young women. Safety&#xD;
      assessments, comparing the VivaGel™ group to the placebo gel group, will include: incidence&#xD;
      and severity of AEs, including genital tract signs and symptoms and mucosal changes as&#xD;
      observed by colposcopy; vaginal microflora, including colonization with H2O2-producing&#xD;
      lactobacilli; and laboratory parameters, including serum chemistry and hematology. The&#xD;
      tolerability assessment, comparing the VivaGel™ group to the placebo gel group will include&#xD;
      the proportion of participants who discontinued product use due to overt (i.e. observable)&#xD;
      AEs, ascertained through a standardized questionnaire. The secondary objective of the study&#xD;
      will be to report the effect of VivaGel™ applied vaginally twice daily for 14 days on the&#xD;
      immune microenvironment in the lower genital tract of young women. Specifically, this will be&#xD;
      tested by determining its effect on: the number and activation levels of endocervical immune&#xD;
      cell populations; Secretory Leukocyte Protease Inhibitor (SLPI) levels; innate mucosal&#xD;
      defenses, including local levels of cytokines in cervical secretions, and Toll-Like Receptor&#xD;
      (TLR) expression by cervical immune cells; and the presence and expression levels of the HIV&#xD;
      co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, and of their principal chemokine ligands by endocervical immune&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has received or is anticipated to receive a new prescription systemic or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject had a clinically significant illness within 30 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has used a vaginal preparation within 30 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a clinically detectable genital abnormality (i.e. vulvar, vaginal,&#xD;
             cervical, perianal ulcer and/or deep epithelial disruption).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has signs, as seen on pelvic exam, consistent with an Sexually Transmitted&#xD;
             Infection (STI), other genital tract infection - other than bacterial vaginosis (BV) -&#xD;
             or trauma, including but not limited to: vaginitis, cervicitis, and laboratory&#xD;
             findings indicative of genital tract infection other than asymptomatic BV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Signs of asymptomatic BV include the presence of white to grey homogeneous discharge,&#xD;
        positive whiff test (amine odor) with addition of KOH, pH&gt;4.5, presence of clue cells,&#xD;
        decrease in lactobacilli morphotypes, and increase in non-lactobacilli morphotypes. Women&#xD;
        with clinical or gram stain evidence of BV and symptoms (discharge, odor, itching), or&#xD;
        yeast colonization and symptoms at screening should be treated and re-evaluated for&#xD;
        inclusion. Women without BV symptoms, but who have clinical or gram stain evidence of BV,&#xD;
        or asymptomatic yeast colonization, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject tests positive for serum antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus 1 and/or 2&#xD;
             (HIV-1 and/or HIV-2).&#xD;

             tract infection at screening or enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Women who have an STI or are symptomatic and have a positive urine culture (urinary&#xD;
        tract infection - UTI) at screening will be referred for and/or given treatment. Following&#xD;
        completion of treatment, women with a negative repeat test may be reconsidered for study&#xD;
        participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has an abnormal Pap smear at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has history in the last three months of: an IUD, vaginal contraceptive ring, a&#xD;
             pregnancy, cervical cryotherapy or laser therapy, gynecologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently breast feeding or is planning on breast feeding while&#xD;
             participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, should not participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with colposcopic evidence of deep epithelial disruption at the enrollment visit&#xD;
             will be excluded. In addition, based on the investigator's (medical examiner's)&#xD;
             opinion any colposcopic finding or any finding (normal or abnormal) that could&#xD;
             interfere with colposcopic examinations may also lead to exclusion. In this case, the&#xD;
             investigator may have the subject return within the screening window to determine if&#xD;
             the abnormality has cleared, and if she is eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
