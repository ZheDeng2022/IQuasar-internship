      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing,&#xD;
      or coming back. The use of nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid may prevent&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of nitric&#xD;
      oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid in preventing colorectal cancer in patients at high&#xD;
      risk of colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effects of nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid on aberrant cryptic&#xD;
           foci (ACF) in patients at high risk for colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the presence or absence of ACF in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the expression of PGE2, COX-1, COX-2, NF-kB, and β-catenin in colon tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of long-term nitric oxide-releasing&#xD;
           acetylsalicyclic acid in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group&#xD;
      study. Patients are stratified according to gender and race (black vs non-Hispanic white vs&#xD;
      Hispanic white vs Asian). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid twice daily&#xD;
           for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid twice daily for 6&#xD;
           months at a higher dose than in arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months. Patients undergo&#xD;
           sigmoidoscopies at baseline and at the completion of study treatment. Biopsies of&#xD;
           aberrant cryptic foci (ACF) and non-ACF sites are collected at both sigmoidoscopies.&#xD;
           Tissue is examined for biomarkers (PGE_2, COX, NF-kB, β-catenin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
