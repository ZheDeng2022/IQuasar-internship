  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the safety and efficacy of indocyanine green-mediated photothrombosis (i-MP) for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparative, controlled, multicenter, masked, randomized study, three parallel groups,&#xD;
      comparing the Indocyanine Green-Mediated Photothrombosis to two control groups, for the&#xD;
      treatment of neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients matching the following criteria are eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. BCVA worse than 20/80 and neovascular complex with some component of occult CNV as defined&#xD;
      by the fluorescein angiography, or; B. BCVA worse than 20/80 and neovascular complex with&#xD;
      total area of CNV (classic and occult) by fluorescein angiography occupying an area lesser&#xD;
      than 50% of the neovascular complex, or; C. BCVA worse than 20/200 and neovascular complex&#xD;
      with some CNV (classic OR occult) by fluorescein angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility of the patients will be assessed by an independent Centre of Interpretation&#xD;
      after masked analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be allocated into one of the three study groups, randomized at 2:1:1&#xD;
      proportion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Treatment Procedure #1 = i-MP (ICG + Laser), at proportion of 2. In this group the&#xD;
      patients will be submitted to endovenous infusion of ICG followed by irradiation with diode&#xD;
      laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Treatment Procedure #2 (Distilled water + Laser), at proportion of 1. In this group&#xD;
      the patients will receive endovenous placebo infusion (distilled water) followed by&#xD;
      irradiation with diode laser with same power utilized in Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Treatment Procedure #3 (Distilled water + Sham Laser), at proportion of 1. In this&#xD;
      group the patients will receive endovenous placebo infusion (distilled water) followed by&#xD;
      simulated application of laser.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of at least 1 soft drusen in the macular region, associated or not to pigment&#xD;
             alterations (hyper- or hypo-pigmentation), thus characterising AMD;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reduction of vision due exclusively to macular exudative processes resulting from the&#xD;
             formation of associated choroidal neovascularisation (neovascular AMD);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients presenting:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Neovascular complexes with total CNV (classic and occult) area by fluorescein&#xD;
             angiography occupying an area lesser than 50% of the neovascular complex and BCVA&#xD;
             worse than 20/80, OR;&#xD;
