  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether placement of composite (white) dental restorations&#xD;
      (fillings) increases concentrations of bisphenol A (BPA) and its metabolites in saliva and&#xD;
      urine. These compounds have estrogenic-like properties that have raised concerns about their&#xD;
      safety. Small amounts of the chemicals can leach out of dental sealants and be detected in&#xD;
      saliva soon after the sealants are applied. Dental composites also contain some of these&#xD;
      compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      U.S. Commissioned Corps officers who need fillings as part of their regular dental treatment&#xD;
      and who select composite (white) restorations instead of amalgam (metal) may be included in&#xD;
      this protocol. Participants are recruited from among officers receiving dental care at the&#xD;
      commissioned officers dental clinic in Rockville, Md.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete a 15-minute interview to gather information about their recent diet and&#xD;
      eating patterns. They also provide 3 to 4 urine and saliva samples, some collected before&#xD;
      their dental restoration and some after treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A study by Olea et al in 1996 reported quantities of specific estrogenic compounds, Bisphenol&#xD;
      A (BPA), bis-glycidyl methacrylate (bis-GMA) and Bis-A-dimethacrylate (bis-DMA) in saliva&#xD;
      associated with the placement of certain dental sealants. This report raised concern&#xD;
      regarding the safety of dental sealants and composite restorations. In a subsequent study&#xD;
      bis-GMA was found to be stable, but bis-DMA was shown to hydrolyze to BPA, which likely&#xD;
      accounts for the BPA detected in extracts from certain sealants. Another study reported&#xD;
      detectable amounts of triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) and BPA diglycidyl ether&#xD;
      (BADGE) were released from sealants into saliva. All of these compounds have been shown to&#xD;
      have deleterious effects for specific endpoints in vitro and various endocrine disruptive&#xD;
      effects in some animal models, although results have not been consistent across animal&#xD;
      strain, mode of administration, diet and other unknown factors. Detectable levels in plasma&#xD;
      have not been shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there are insufficient data on the leachability concentrations in body fluids of these&#xD;
      compounds associated with composite fillings in humans it is important to determine whether&#xD;
      or not there are detectable levels of these compounds associated with the placement of&#xD;
      composite restorations, and if so, whether the levels are sufficiently below the maximum&#xD;
      acceptable or reference dose established by the EPA. For bisphenol A the maximum acceptable&#xD;
      dose is 0.05 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (US EPA, 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, the National Toxicology Program&#xD;
      of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the Commissioned Officers&#xD;
      Dental Clinic Dentists have a unique opportunity to conduct a collaborative investigation at&#xD;
      the Commissioned Officers Dental Clinic (CODC) in Rockville, MD involving commissioned&#xD;
      officers who need dental restorations. This study will determine whether or not the placement&#xD;
      of composite restorations is associated with the presence of these compounds in saliva. This&#xD;
      is particularly timely since the number of composite restorations placed by dentists&#xD;
      practicing in the U.S is rapidly increasing with over 80 million composite restorations&#xD;
      placed in 1999 (ADA, 2001). It is of relevance to the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned&#xD;
      Officers Dental Clinic (CODC) because the CODC places composite materials in its dental&#xD;
      clinic and wants to ensure that commissioned officers are receiving the best and safest&#xD;
      possible dental care.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individual patients who require at least one restoration are eligible. We will give&#xD;
        preference to patients who require multiple restorations that qualify for a composite&#xD;
        filling material. Every attempt will be made to adequately represent women and minorities&#xD;
        into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individual patients who have received composite restorations or pit and fissure sealants&#xD;
        during the past 3 months and individuals who wear removable dental appliances, such as&#xD;
        orthodontic retainers or partial dentures, will be excluded.&#xD;
