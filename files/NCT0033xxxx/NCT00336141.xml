    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced/metastatic&#xD;
             colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as&#xD;
             greater than 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received prior therapy (in any setting) with 5-FU, CPT-11, and&#xD;
             oxaliplatin. Patients may have received prior erbitux and bevacizumab, but it is not&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor must be accessible for core biopsy at the beginning of treatment and patients&#xD;
             have a high intratumoral TS expression level prior to the beginning of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years. Because no dosing or AE data are currently available on the use of&#xD;
             vorinostat in patients greater than 18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study but will be eligible for future pediatric single-agent trials, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of &gt; 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2 (Karnofsky &gt; 50%; see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  leukocytes &gt; 3,000/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platelets &gt; 100,000/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hemoglobin &gt; 9 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin within 1.5 x normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) greater than or equal to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of&#xD;
             normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility of patients receiving any medications or substances known to affect or&#xD;
             with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of vorinostat will be&#xD;
             determined following review by the principal investigator. (A list of medications and&#xD;
             substances known or with the potential to interact with selected CYP450 isoenzymes is&#xD;
             provided in Appendix B.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INR is ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) unless receiving therapeutic&#xD;
             anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is highly unlikely to conceive as indicated by at least one &quot;yes&quot; answer to&#xD;
             the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a male and agrees to use an adequate method of contraception for the&#xD;
             duration of the study, and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a surgically sterilized female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a postmenopausal female ≥ 45 years of age with &gt; 2 years since last menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a non-sterilized premenopausal female and agrees to use 2 adequate barrier&#xD;
             methods of contraception to prevent pregnancy or agrees to abstain from heterosexual&#xD;
             activity throughout the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from AEs due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have received any other investigational agents within 28 days of&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not receive other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or&#xD;
             hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of&#xD;
             their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction&#xD;
             that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to vorinostat. These compounds include sodium butyrate, trichostatin A&#xD;
             (TSA), trapoxin (TPX), MS-27-275 and depsipeptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because vorinostat is a HDAC inhibitor&#xD;
             agent with an unknown potential for teratogenesis. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with vorinostat, breastfeeding should be discontinued before the mother is&#xD;
             treated with study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with vorinostat. Appropriate studies will be undertaken&#xD;
             in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is on any systemic steroids that have not been stabilized to the equivalent of&#xD;
             ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone during the 4 weeks prior to the start of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had an acute infection requiring intravenous antibiotic, antiviral, or&#xD;
             antifungal medications within 2 weeks prior to the start of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has an active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a history of GI surgery or other procedures that might, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, interfere with the absorption or swallowing of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had prescription or non-prescription drugs or other products known to&#xD;
             influence CYP3A4 that cannot be discontinued prior to day 1 of dosing and withheld&#xD;
             throughout the study until 2 weeks after the last dose of study medication. Refer to&#xD;
             Appendix B for a list of commonly used moderate and potent CYP3A4 modifiers and their&#xD;
             required washout periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had prior cancer treatment with an HDAC inhibitor (e.g., Depsipeptide, MS&#xD;
             275, LAQ-824, PXD-101, and valproic acid). Patients who have received such agents for&#xD;
             other indications, e.g., epilepsy, may enroll in the trial after a 30 day washout&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
