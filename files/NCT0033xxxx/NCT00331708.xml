  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the drug levels of artesunate and&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine found in pregnant women with malaria to those drug levels found in&#xD;
      non-pregnant women from other studies. In addition the efficacy and safety of the study drugs&#xD;
      will be determined for pregnant women and their babies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs is a serious impediment to the&#xD;
      control of malaria, and this poses a particular problem for the treatment of pregnant women,&#xD;
      a group especially vulnerable to malaria; pregnancy increases the risk of disease progression&#xD;
      and complications with up to a 10-fold increase in the malaria case fatality rate in areas of&#xD;
      low transmission. As falciparum parasites can sequester in the placenta, pregnant women have&#xD;
      been shown to develop recrudescence up to 85 days after quinine treatment, and are at&#xD;
      increased risk of gametocyte carriage. Artemisinin-based combination therapies have been&#xD;
      shown to improve cure rates and to delay antimalarial resistance. In humans the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of artesunate in the treatment of malaria in pregnancy has been studied in over 1000&#xD;
      women in which no evidence of foetal harm was demonstrated. Quinine is the only alternative&#xD;
      currently available in Mozambique for treating malaria in pregnancy however there is&#xD;
      relatively little data available on its efficacy or safety. There is no published information&#xD;
      on the pharmacokinetics of SP in pregnancy, however data show a marked reduction in&#xD;
      bioavailability of artesunate and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin. Thus, we cannot&#xD;
      be confident that the standard dosage regimens of SP and of artesunate are optimal for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy or whether altered pharmacokinetics is&#xD;
      contributing to the SP-treatment failures observed in pregnancy. This study creates the&#xD;
      opportunity to study whether the pharmacokinetic properties of SP and artesunate are altered&#xD;
      by physiological changes that occur during pregnancy.&#xD;
