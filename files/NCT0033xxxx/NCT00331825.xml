      We initiate a study with research grant from department of health and Taoyuan mental hospital&#xD;
      and choose risperidone and olanzapine as study medications. We compare the incidence of using&#xD;
      anticholinergic drugs in schizophrenic patients of Han ethnics with neuroleptic-induced acute&#xD;
      dystonia or parkinsonism to test the hypothesis that these two medications have different EPS&#xD;
      incidence in EPS intolerant population.&#xD;

      Objective: First generation antipsychotics frequently induced extrapyramidal side effects&#xD;
      (EPS). Second generation antipsychotics were the choices for EPS intolerant schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients. But which one of second generation antipsychotic was the better choice did not have&#xD;
      definitive results. We compared risperidone and olanzapine in schizophrenic patients with&#xD;
      acute dystonia or parkinsonism side effects and observed the incidence of needing concomitant&#xD;
      anticholinergic drugs. We also collected the data of average dose of risperidone and&#xD;
      olanzapine to help the dosing strategy guidelines for EPS intolerant schizophrenic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This randomized, rater-blind, parallel group, flexible dose study enrolled patients&#xD;
      from Taoyuan Mental Hospital from July 2000 to July 2003. Schizophrenia (DSM-IV) patients who&#xD;
      met the research criteria of neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia or parkinsonism research&#xD;
      criteria of DSM-IV and greater than moderate severity (&gt;4) of global impression of&#xD;
      extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS). 70 patients were random assignment to&#xD;
      risperidone or olanzapine for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was to compare the incidence of&#xD;
      concomitant anticholinergic drugs.&#xD;
