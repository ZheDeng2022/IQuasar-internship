    <textblock>
      This study will develop a survey instrument to measure primary care physicians' knowledge of&#xD;
      the variation in human genetics, their beliefs about biologic and genetic differences&#xD;
      according to patients' race and ethnicity, and how that knowledge is used in their clinical&#xD;
      decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomics research today is such that primary care physicians will be responsible for&#xD;
      translating new genetic knowledge, drug therapies, and single and multiplex genetic testing&#xD;
      into clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians who are board certified general internists, including those who practice and teach&#xD;
      in research and teaching hospitals in urban areas of the United States, may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Participants will be recruited through invitation and information letters mailed&#xD;
      to leaders of local chapters of physician organizations, through letters and e-mail sent to&#xD;
      qualifying general internists in databases, and through e-mail sent to academic physicians&#xD;
      who practice or teach medicine at medical schools that meet the inclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      number of participants is estimated at 96 in the first phase of the study. The researchers&#xD;
      are especially interested in general internists who provide general and preventative health&#xD;
      care services to patients of various racial, ethnic, and ancestral backgrounds. This study&#xD;
      will use qualitative methods-focus groups and semistructured interviews-and quantitative&#xD;
      methods. Two pilot focus group sessions, with about eight members each, are planned for&#xD;
      Washington, D.C. Other settings for the study are Atlanta, Detroit, Los Angeles, and&#xD;
      Philadelphia. Those locations were selected based on population density, availability of&#xD;
      several teaching hospitals with diverse patient populations, availability of physicians&#xD;
      meeting the study requirements, and the need to address important regions nationwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus groups will be separated by region and self-identified race-for example, one group&#xD;
      consisting of African American internists from Atlanta and another of white internists from&#xD;
      Atlanta. The facilitator will be a general internist of the same race. Each focus group&#xD;
      session, to last about 90 minutes, will be audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Data from the&#xD;
      focus groups will be analyzed for themes and phrases, and a scale will be developed to assess&#xD;
      responses. Then the scale will be reviewed by two panels of experts. One panel will be&#xD;
      experts in genetics and human genetic variation, and the other will be social scientists and&#xD;
      survey researchers who are experts in developing surveys. For the semistructured interviews,&#xD;
      two physicians who participated in a given focus group will be invited to participate, based&#xD;
      on their engagement in the discussion and interest in the project. This will be a&#xD;
      face-to-face interview of 60 to 90 minutes. A total of 32 interviews will be conducted. After&#xD;
      the scale is revised, a second pilot study will be done. For that study, 3,500 primary care&#xD;
      physicians will be invited to participate in a web-based survey by using the scale. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that there will be sufficient sample size to examine the properties of the scale.&#xD;
      The proposed timetable for the study is 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits from participating in the study include participants' increased understanding of&#xD;
      human genetic variation and awareness of how other physicians understand and use race and&#xD;
      ethnicity in their practice of medicine. Also, information gained will be useful to improve&#xD;
      physicians' training. There will be compensation for participation. Each physician will&#xD;
      receive $150, and those who participate in both the focus group and semistructured interview&#xD;
      will receive $150 for each session.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In recognition of the emerging social and scientific research related to assessing the&#xD;
      complex relationships between self-identified race, ancestral origin and the genetic&#xD;
      components of diseases, it is important to study physicians and other health professionals&#xD;
      knowledge of human genetic variation and how they interpret and apply race, ethnicity and&#xD;
      human genetic variation in their clinical decision making. Primary care physicians will be&#xD;
      responsible for the translation of new genomic knowledge, including the use of&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic and multiplex genetic testing in clinical practice. Understanding health&#xD;
      professionals knowledge, beliefs and practices will provide important data for furthering&#xD;
      health services and research. The Physicians Understanding of Human Genetic Variation study&#xD;
      (PUHGV) is a three-phase, mixed-method study using both qualitative (focus groups and&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews) and quantitative methods (web-based survey). The first phase of&#xD;
      the study used qualitative methods to investigate racial and ethnic differences in how&#xD;
      physicians understand and use genetics, race and ethnicity in their practice and to assist in&#xD;
      developing the Health Professionals Genetic Education Needs Exploration survey instrument (HP&#xD;
      GENE). Bonham and Sellers developed and piloted the Human Genetic Variation-Health&#xD;
      Professionals Knowledge, Beliefs, and Use Scales (HGV-HP) to measure physicians knowledge of&#xD;
      human genetic variation (HGV-HP Knowledge), beliefs about biologic and genetic differences&#xD;
      based upon their patients race and ethnicity (HGV-HP Beliefs), and use of these constructs in&#xD;
      their clinical decision making approaches (HGV-HP Use). The HGV-HP Scales are a component of&#xD;
      the larger HP GENE survey instrument. The second phase of the study piloted these instruments&#xD;
      with a random sample of United States general internists from diverse racial and ethnic&#xD;
      backgrounds and geographic areas of the United States to assess the psychometric properties&#xD;
      of the scales and investigate the role of incentives in recruiting physicians to participate&#xD;
      in web surveys. Informed by the pilot testing of the instrument, the third phase of this&#xD;
      study is to conduct a national survey using the instrument and scales with health&#xD;
      professionals from different health disciplines.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The population of interest for this phase of the study are currently practicing, board&#xD;
        certified general internists, both allopathic and osteopathic, whose offices are in the&#xD;
        United States. Investigators have selected this population for multiple reasons. General&#xD;
        internists are on the frontlines of health care delivery and have become increasingly more&#xD;
        responsible for the translation of genomic knowledge into clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Further, selecting general internists for this phase of the study is consistent with&#xD;
        populations included in Phases I and II of the study. Lastly, limiting our pool of&#xD;
        potential respondents to general internists helps to minimize costs associated with this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will exclude physicians with addresses outside of the continental United States, as well&#xD;
        as, physicians who are not in active practice (see patients &lt;10% of their time), deceased,&#xD;
        or retired prior to randomly selecting the sample. Because questions surrounding clinical&#xD;
        decision making are a key component of this survey, it is imperative that we only include&#xD;
        practicing physicians in the sample.&#xD;
