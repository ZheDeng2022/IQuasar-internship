  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human T-lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) is endemic in southern Japan and the Caribbean,&#xD;
      but disease manifestations differ across geographic regions. Though age, gender, and route of&#xD;
      infection may determine the natural history of this infection, the observed geographic&#xD;
      differences also may, in part, reflect the distinct genetic background of the host as&#xD;
      evidenced by the distribution of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and the presence of other&#xD;
      environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies already completed or ongoing have shown notable differences in incidence and&#xD;
      prevalence of HTLV-I associated diseases and underscore the need for comparative studies and&#xD;
      analyses in these areas. This prospective new study of blood donors in Jamaica provides us&#xD;
      with an opportunity to address many hypotheses regarding HTLV-I transmission and pathogenesis&#xD;
      in the Caribbean in comparison with an ongoing cohort study of HTLV-I carriers in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify host factors associated with HTLV-I carrier status and HTLV-I pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  directly calculate the incidence of HTLV-I associated diseases in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine the role of HTLV-I in the pathogenesis of other common infectious agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 5,000+ blood donors who came to the National Blood Transfusion each year will&#xD;
      be screened for HTLV-I serology. Of those who agreed to participate, all HTLV-I carriers and&#xD;
      age-, and sex-matched HTLV-I-negatives will be invited to the University of the West Indies&#xD;
      clinic for a full study enrollment. Study participants will be given a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire, a full physical examination, and a phlebotomy (25-30 mL), and will be followed&#xD;
      every other year for interim health status and additional phlebotomy. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive an ophthalmologic examination for detection of uveitis and other ocular diseases.&#xD;
      Some subjects will be further referred to a neurologist, hematologist or dermatologist,&#xD;
      according to their signs and symptoms. Approximately 1200 HTLV-I carriers and 600 HTLV-I&#xD;
      negatives will be recruited for a longitudinal follow-up over the next 5-year period. Two&#xD;
      types of analyses will be conducted: comparison of HTLV-I-positive and HTLV-I-negative&#xD;
      subjects, and comparison among HTLV carriers between those with a high level of viral load&#xD;
      and those with a low level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Southern Japan and the Caribbean are both endemic for human T-lymphotropic virus type I&#xD;
      (HTLV-I) infection. In these areas, however, epidemiology of HTLV-I appears to differ.&#xD;
      Various observations from population-based studies indicate that differences in host immune&#xD;
      response to virus infection is likely to result in different frequencies of disease&#xD;
      manifestations across geographic regions. While gender, age and route of infection may partly&#xD;
      determine host immune response, the observed geographic differences may also reflect, in&#xD;
      part, host genetic background as evidenced by the distribution of human leukocyte antigens&#xD;
      (HLA) and presence of other environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reported differences underscore the need for comparative studies in these endemic areas.&#xD;
      In addition, analyses of larger, pooled data of HTLV-I carriers from different geographic&#xD;
      areas are needed to ensure statistical power in studies of gene-environment interactions with&#xD;
      extended use of molecular markers. However, existing population-based studies from Japan and&#xD;
      the Caribbean are unfortunately no comparable with respect to the study subject's age and&#xD;
      gender distributions. In order to address this issue, we proposed a study of blood donors in&#xD;
      Jamaica, which enrolls a large number of both HTLV-I positive and HTLV-I negative, consisting&#xD;
      of subjects that are more comparable to existing Japanese study with respect to age and sex.&#xD;
      The proposed study will provide a basis for a comparative study of HTLV-I carriers in Japan&#xD;
      and Jamaica and a comprehensive analysis of host genetic background of HTLV-I associated&#xD;
      illnesses in the Black population.&#xD;
