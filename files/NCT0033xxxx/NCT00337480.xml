      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the follow up of patients with acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome and modifiable cardiovascular risk factors is efficient based on&#xD;
      outpatients visits in a House of Education, underlining the importance of nicotinic weaning,&#xD;
      weight loss and physical activity practice.&#xD;

      1. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of &quot;Resicard&#xD;
                Prevention&quot;, which is a structured health network within a House of Education&#xD;
                located outside of the hospital and based on outpatients' visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Another purpose is to facilitate and optimize physicians and all health members&#xD;
                communication around the acute coronary syndrome patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Method&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After randomization, patients are directed to one of the two following groups: the&#xD;
                conventional network group or the structured network group. Six and twelve months&#xD;
                after their hospitalization, a blood test will be performed and their weight, blood&#xD;
                pressure, waist measurement and cardiac frequency will be recorded in order to&#xD;
                monitor patients' cardiovascular risk factors.In any case, patients receive optimal&#xD;
                care with the participation of different health members (such as nurses, doctors,&#xD;
                dietician...).&#xD;
&#xD;
                a-The conventional network group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients are taken care of, according to good medical practice by their usual&#xD;
                general practitioner and cardiologist. The frequency of consultations is set up&#xD;
                according to symptoms. The follow up of patients is optimized as they are taken&#xD;
                care of by a multidisciplinary health team.&#xD;
&#xD;
                b-The structured network group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients in this group will have to consult their general practitioner and&#xD;
                cardiologist within the first month after their hospitalization. Two forms&#xD;
                summarizing their hospitalization facts and the objectives of the risk factors&#xD;
                correction will be electronically sent to their general practitioner, to their&#xD;
                cardiologist and to the House of Education. Patients have appointments at the House&#xD;
                of Education where a multidisciplinary team (with a nurse, a dietician,...)&#xD;
                welcomes them. They set up a schedule according to patients' needs:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  consultation for nicotinic weaning&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  some dietary advice in order to lose weight&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  some specific advice on diabetes and/or hypercholesteremia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  information about high blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  some advice to pursue a regular physical activity After each appointment at the&#xD;
                House of Education, a form summarizing the risk factors will be provided&#xD;
                electronically to patients' general practitioner and cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conclusion -This evaluation protocol should demonstrate the efficiency of a health&#xD;
           network based on the correction of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors within a House&#xD;
           of Education in secondary prevention after an acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
