      B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) is a hormone that is made by the pumping chambers of the&#xD;
      heart. The BNP level can be measured by a blood test and is used as a marker for heart&#xD;
      problems in adults. Deciding if a child has a heart problem or a lung problem can be very&#xD;
      difficult, especially in infants. Several studies have demonstrated that BNP levels are&#xD;
      elevated when children have heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the study is to be able to prove that obtaining BNP levels in pediatric&#xD;
      patients can be used to identify heart problems. We already know that kids with heart&#xD;
      problems have high BNP levels (&gt;200pg/ml). We need to prove that children who come to the&#xD;
      Emergency Department for non-cardiac problems still have normal BNP levels (&lt;100pg/ml,&#xD;
      slightly higher in the newborn population). This will be done by comparing BNP levels with&#xD;
      the final diagnosis made by the ED physician.&#xD;

      Introduction At Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, thousands of children are seen in the&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) each year for evaluation and treatment. Deciding if a child has a&#xD;
      cardiac or pulmonary problem can be very difficult, especially in infants. Early recognition&#xD;
      of cardiac disease can significantly impact the physician's ability to provide appropriate&#xD;
      treatment, make necessary interventions, and affect patient outcome. An accurate laboratory&#xD;
      marker of cardiac disease for pediatric Emergency Medicine does not exist. B-Type Natriuretic&#xD;
      Peptide (BNP) is a hormone produced by the ventricular myocardium (heart muscle) in response&#xD;
      to increased myocardial demands. It has been used extensively in the adult population to&#xD;
      evaluate patients for heart disease, and has been demonstrated to be very accurate in the&#xD;
      differentiation of heart disease from lung disease in the adult Emergency Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing experience with BNP in pediatrics for the evaluation of heart disease,&#xD;
      primarily in patients with congenital heart disease. The normal BNP level is less than 100&#xD;
      pg/ml, slightly higher in neonates. Patients who present to the ED and are diagnosed with&#xD;
      heart disease are often admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) for further&#xD;
      management and stabilization. Part of the initial evaluation is a BNP level. These patients&#xD;
      usually have marked elevation of the BNP levels in the 2000-5000 pg/ml range upon admission.&#xD;
      The level varies with the type and severity of their heart disease. However very little is&#xD;
      known about the non-cardiac ED patient BNP level. To utilize BNP as an accurate marker of&#xD;
      cardiac disease in the pediatric ED, a clear difference between cardiac and non-cardiac&#xD;
      patients needs to be demonstrated. If a large difference in BNP levels exists for the&#xD;
      pediatric patient with heart disease who presents to the ED when compared to the child who&#xD;
      presents to the ED with other non-cardiac disease processes, a useful marker of heart disease&#xD;
      in children would be demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of the proposed research is to determine the typical BNP level in&#xD;
      non-cardiac pediatric patients who present to the ED for evaluation of respiratory and/ or&#xD;
      infectious processes. The endpoint of the project will be the collection of BNP levels from&#xD;
      100 patients less than 6 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1 (H1): BNP levels for children with non-cardiac disease will be in the normal&#xD;
      range (&lt; 100pg/ml), and can be easily distinguished from the elevated levels seen in children&#xD;
      with congenital or acquired heart disease.&#xD;
