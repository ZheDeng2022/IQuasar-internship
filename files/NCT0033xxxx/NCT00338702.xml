      Foot ulcers represent a significant common complication in patients with diabetes. Wound&#xD;
      healing is a challenge. Some wounds do not respond to the best practices in wound care.&#xD;
      Considerable effort has been directed at therapies to improve the rate of healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a variety of growth factors which have been used to stimulate wound healing. Human&#xD;
      platelets are an autologous source of growth factors which probably can stimulate healing.&#xD;
      Autologous platelet gel (APG) is prepared by centrifugation of autologous human whole blood.&#xD;
      APG is rich in platelet growth factors. This study will investigate the potential improvement&#xD;
      in wound healing with this material in diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the use of autologous platelet gel ( study group) and standard care (&#xD;
      control group) in the treatment of diabetic plantar forefoot ulcers. This study will also&#xD;
      compare the cost and quality of life in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if topical APG (autologous platelet gel) is beneficial in the treatment of&#xD;
           diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if it will result in a faster rate of wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if it will improve the quality of life in patients with diabetic foot&#xD;
           ulcers.&#xD;

      Study Design This will be a single center, randomized, controlled, prospective study&#xD;
      comparing the use of autologous platelet gel (study group) and traditional moist dressing&#xD;
      (control group) in the treatment of plantar forefoot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Primary - Facilitation of healing of diabetic foot ulcers Secondary - Reduction&#xD;
      in amputations and average total cost of care. Determine the impact of diabetic ulcers on&#xD;
      patients' quality of life Research Background Foot ulcers represent a significant common&#xD;
      complication in patients with diabetes. It is estimated that twenty percent of all patients&#xD;
      with diabetes develop a foot ulcer which may subsequently lead to below knee amputation. 85 %&#xD;
      of them preceded by non-healing foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care costs associated with diabetic foot wound management are staggering. Armstrong et&#xD;
      al (1998) reported that wound care for foot ulcer patients over a two year period had mean&#xD;
      cost of $27,000.00 U.S. In Toronto, the average cost of below knee amputations, including&#xD;
      hospitalization and rehabilitation, is $40,000.00.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound healing in the context of diabetes is a challenge for both the health care provider and&#xD;
      the patient. In a systematic review conducted by Margolis et al (1999), wound healing&#xD;
      outcomes using best practices have yielded only 24% at 12 weeks, 31% in 20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falanga &amp; Sabolinski (2001) identified that initial wound size reduction of 0.1 cm/week is&#xD;
      highly predictive of wound closure whereas initial healing rates 0.06 cm or less predict&#xD;
      non-healing. Similarly, 51% percent reduction in 4 weeks was found to be a good predictor of&#xD;
      achieving wound closure (Margolis et al, 1999). Some wounds do not respond and considerable&#xD;
      effort has been directed at therapies to improve the rate of healing in this situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of growth factors which have been used to stimulate wound healing. Human platelets&#xD;
      are an autologous source which probably can stimulate healing. Autologous platelet gel (APG)&#xD;
      is a material presently utilized as a tissue adhesive. It is derived from platelet rich&#xD;
      plasma (PRP) that was first developed in the early 1990's to primarily address acute surgical&#xD;
      hemostatic and wound healing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APG is prepared by centrifugation of autologous human whole blood, which initially separates&#xD;
      it into three components: packed red cells, platelet poor plasma, and platelet rich plasma&#xD;
      (PRP). PRP has two to eight times the normal concentration of platelets in human blood. The&#xD;
      key element that differentiates APG from traditional fibrin glue is the presence of&#xD;
      concentrated platelets rich in platelet growth factors. These important elements of the&#xD;
      blood, in an increased concentration are potentially helpful in improving the rate of wound&#xD;
      healing. This study will investigate the potential improvement in wound healing with APG in&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the Research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if topical APG (autologous platelet gel) is beneficial in the treatment of&#xD;
           diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if it will result in a faster rate of wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if it will improve the quality of life in patients with diabetic foot&#xD;
           ulcers Study Population Subjects for this study will be recruited from our patient&#xD;
           population. Fifty patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups 9 study&#xD;

      purposes, diabetic foot ulcer will be a wound on the plantar aspect of the foot which has not&#xD;
      responded to at least 4 weeks of best practice care. Complete wound closure will be defined&#xD;
      as skin closure (100% re-epithelization) without drainage or dressing requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seeking treatment for diabetic foot ulcers that meet the entry criteria will be&#xD;
      considered for the study. Patients will be randomized to either the STUDY or the CONTROL&#xD;
      group with a 1:1 control to study ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY Group Patients will have APG (autologous platelet gel) applied to the wound in&#xD;
      accordance with institutional treatment protocols and manufacturer's guidelines. Dressing&#xD;
      changes will occur at least three times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of preparing and application of autologous platelet gel is as follows -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtain 54 cc of whole blood into a 60 cc syringe with 6 cc of citrate anticoagulant&#xD;
           through standard blood draw technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Slowly load blood filled syringe into GPS II unit's centre port. And centrifuge for 15&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Draw PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) concentrate from GPS II unit into a 10 cc syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prepare the wound bed through sharp excision of the eperbole, necrotic tissue &amp; wound&#xD;
           bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Aspirate PPP (Platelet Poor Plasma) from GPSII unit in to a 30 ml syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Inject Thrombin Reagent (5 cc of CaCl2) to Thrombin Processing Device and then add 11 cc&#xD;
           of the PPP from the syringe and after mixing let it stand for 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Draw 1 cc of thrombin/CaCl2 solution into a 1 cc syringe from Thrombin Processing&#xD;
           Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Connect syringe with PRP and syringe with thrombin/CaCl2 to a dual sprayer&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Spray solutions over entire wound bed. Protect surrounding skin (but not into the wound)&#xD;
           with barrier film.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Apply a semi-permeable, film-type dressing as primary dressing. Leave dressing in place&#xD;
           for 3-7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The affected limb will receive offloading in the form of a total contact cast, a&#xD;
           pneumatic walking cast or wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. After the first dressing with APG the wound will be dressed with a moist dressing,&#xD;
           similar to control group dressings. The dressings will be changed daily or on a&#xD;
           Monday-Wednesday-Friday routine based on the level of exudates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly standard therapy alone as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any debridement deemed necessary is performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ulcer-site will be dressed with a moist dressing such as cadexamer iodine ointment&#xD;
           (Iodosorb) and an absorbent covering dressing that is moisture retentive. Acceptable&#xD;
           other control group dressing types are: alginates, hydrogels and hydrocolloids and&#xD;
           saline gauze. The dressing will be changed daily or on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday routine&#xD;
           based on the level of exudate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The affected limb will receive offloading in the form of a total contact cast, a&#xD;
           pneumatic walking cast or wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase of the Study: Treatment in both groups will continue until the wound is&#xD;
      successfully closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12 weeks (3 months) wounds from both control and treatment groups will be evaluated. If&#xD;
      the wound does not show any signs of improvement (wound closure by 50% at 3 months) the wound&#xD;
      will be considered as a treatment failure and it will be treated with alternate dressing&#xD;
      according to hospital standard of care. These wounds will be followed every month till they&#xD;
      close.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-Month and 12 month follow-up: For patients who achieved wound closure at 12 weeks, or later&#xD;
      the wound site will undergo an examination for recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No patient will remain in the study for longer than 12 months (total study duration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessments A. Wound Debridement All wounds under study will be surgically debrided&#xD;
      The wound may be debrided by autolysis or sharp wound debridement as tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Laboratory Testing Up to seven days prior to the initiation of protocol treatment, blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken to determine serum pre-albumin, albumin and creatinine levels. If the&#xD;
      pre-albumin is &lt;16 mg/dl (&lt;160 mg/L) or the albumin level is &lt;3 g/dl (&lt;30 g/L), nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation will be started. The tests will be repeated at 12 weeks or at the time of&#xD;
      wound closure which ever comes first. Determination of HbA1c will be performed up to 30 days&#xD;
      prior to initiation of protocol treatment, and at 12 weeks or at the time of wound closure&#xD;
      which ever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial culture will be done at Day 0. Additional cultures may be obtained as clinically&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Wound Examination Ulcers will be examined at Days 0, 7 (1 wk), 14 (2wk), 28 (4wk) , 56&#xD;
      (8wk), 84 (12wk), 6 and 12 month follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ulcer will be classified using the University of Texas Scale Diabetic Foot ulcer&#xD;
      Classification System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ulcer will be evaluated using following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to closure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Granulation tissue formation will be categorically estimated in percentages and recorded&#xD;
           as 0-10%, 11-25 %, 26-50 %, 51-75 % or 75-100%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eschar and necrotic tissue estimation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound edge evaluation - evidence of epithelial tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount ( scant, moderate, copious) and quality ( serous, purulent, sanguinous) of wound&#xD;
           exudate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence of infection ( erythema, odor, pain at ulcer site, ulcer deterioration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound assessment will be done, to include measurement of standard wound width, length&#xD;
           and depth. Wound tracings will be performed using the Visitrak and depth will be&#xD;
           measured by the placement of a wooden end of sterile cotton tipped applicator into the&#xD;
           deepest part of the wound, withdrawing and measuring that length&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ulcer photographs will be taken using a digital camera. D. Wound Pain Assessments - The&#xD;
           patient will complete the wound pain assessment using a visual analog scale (VAS) at all&#xD;
           study visits. The pain assessment will be done prior to and within one-half hour after&#xD;
           the wound dressing changes. Pain medication use will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Documentation of Dressings - The number and type of dressings used will be documented by&#xD;
      the health care professional taking care of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Cost - Frequency of dressing changes and estimates of material cost and nursing time will&#xD;
      be documented Data Collection/Study Visit Procedures Visit 1 (Day -7 to Day 0) Screening&#xD;
      Patients will be screened and data will be collected for demographic details, relevant&#xD;
      medical and surgical history, lab values, results of vascular studies and Plastic and / or&#xD;
      Orthopedic Surgeons' consultations Visit 2 (Day 0) Randomization/Treatment It will take place&#xD;
      within 7 days after Visit 1. Patients will be randomized. Wounds will be assessed,&#xD;
      photographed and measured and data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (week 1 (05 days), week 2, 4, 8 and 12) Wounds will be assessed,&#xD;
      photographed and measured and data will be collected. Number of dressing changes per week,&#xD;
      materials used and the occupation of person performing the dressing change will be&#xD;
      documented. The time to definitive wound closure will be recorded. Pre-albumin, albumin&#xD;
      creatinine and HbA1c will be tested at week 12. Ulcer recurrence and its cause will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 8 and 9 (6 Month and12 Month Follow-up) Assessment of Recurrence These visits will&#xD;
      occur at 6 months and 12 months for both treatment groups. The wound will be examined for&#xD;
      recurrence or determination of wound status. Information about patient's quality of life&#xD;
      using Cardiff Wound Impact questionnaire, 6 months after healing of the ulcer will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events Through out the study period adverse events, also termed &quot;study events&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;adverse experiences&quot; and serious adverse events will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Endpoints will include: time to 25% percent closure at 6 weeks, time to&#xD;
      50% closure at 12 weeks and time to definitive closure Analyses will include - time to&#xD;
      50-percent-closure, time to definitive closure, percentage of wounds closed at study calendar&#xD;
      time points/visits, number of dressing changes and impact of diabetic foot ulcer on the&#xD;
      quality of life Survival analysis, ANOVA/ANCOVA, and non-parametric analysis will be used. A&#xD;
      repetitive measurement analysis will also be applied. Ordinal Categorical Analysis will be&#xD;
      performed on data from Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule.&#xD;
