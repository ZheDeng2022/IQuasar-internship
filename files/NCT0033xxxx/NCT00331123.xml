      This study is designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of a testosterone patch as treatment&#xD;
      for low libido in surgically menopausal women who are taking estrogen therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) who had undergone bilateral&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy were randomized into a 52-week, multicenter,&#xD;
      multinational study that included a 24-week, double-blind (DB), parallel-group,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled period followed by a 28-week open-label (OL) period. Patients were&#xD;
      stratified based on their use of oral or transdermal ET and randomized to receive placebo or&#xD;
      testosterone transdermal system. Patients had to maintain a stable dose of estrogen&#xD;
      throughout the study. Upon completion of the DB period, patients receiving placebo were&#xD;
      switched to TTS, while the active cohort remained on active treatment. All patients were then&#xD;
      followed for an additional 28 weeks for safety. Patients who completed the first 52 weeks of&#xD;
      the study were given the opportunity to participate in an open label extension (Years 2, 3 ,&#xD;
      and 4), which was added to the protocol by amendment. Safety was assessed by adverse events,&#xD;
      lipids, serum chemistry with hepatic, renal and carbohydrate metabolism evaluation,&#xD;
      coagulation testing, and hematology. Physical exam including clinical assessments of facial&#xD;
      hair and acne were monitored.&#xD;
