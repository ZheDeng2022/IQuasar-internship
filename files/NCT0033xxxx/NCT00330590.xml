  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a new device for guiding invasive procedures with ultrasound&#xD;
      (US), which they call the sonic flashlight (SF). They attach a half-silvered mirror and a&#xD;
      small flat-panel monitor directly to an ultrasound transducer to project a virtual image of&#xD;
      the US scan into its actual location within the patient. This permits the operator to guide a&#xD;
      needle through the skin by aiming directly at the image, using natural hand-eye coordination&#xD;
      rather than looking away from the patient at a conventional display. The device requires no&#xD;
      tracking or head-mounted apparatus, and provides an intuitive merger of the visual exterior&#xD;
      of the patient with an in situ ultrasound image, which can be simultaneously viewed by others&#xD;
      assisting the operator. The investigators believe the SF will increase the accuracy, safety,&#xD;
      and speed for a wide variety of invasive procedures, and will require less extensive training&#xD;
      than conventional US displays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the wide variety of procedures for which the SF could be used, the investigators have&#xD;
      narrowed their focus to applying it to a single application: vascular access. They have&#xD;
      demonstrated clinically that the SF can be used successfully to guide the placement of the&#xD;
      peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines. The research proposed here will expand&#xD;
      this application to include the insertion of other central venous access (CVA) lines through&#xD;
      the internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, and femoral vein. The historical approach to CVA&#xD;
      line placements has involved the physical exam and identification of visible landmarks. With&#xD;
      the introduction and common usage of ultrasound, it has become routine to use ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the difficulty in learning conventional ultrasound (CUS) guided procedures stems from&#xD;
      the displaced sense of hand-eye coordination that occurs when the operator looks away from&#xD;
      the operating field to see the ultrasound display. The SF directly addresses many of these&#xD;
      issues and therefore the investigators believe that it is well suited for this application.&#xD;
      They have already shown that novice US users learn vascular access procedures in training&#xD;
      phantoms more quickly using the SF than CUS. They have also shown that intravenous (IV) team&#xD;
      nurses already proficient in CUS guided PICC lines perform vascular access in training&#xD;
      phantoms more quickly using the SF than CUS guidance. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the&#xD;
      investigators have shown that the SF can be used successfully to guide the placement of PICC&#xD;
      lines. This study will test the hypothesis that the SF will successfully facilitate catheter&#xD;
      placement in the subclavian, femoral, and internal jugular veins demonstrating equal&#xD;
      vasculature visualization as conventional ultrasound.&#xD;

      We have developed a new device for guiding invasive procedures with ultrasound (US), which we&#xD;
      call the Sonic Flashlight (SF). We attach a half-silvered mirror and a small flat-panel&#xD;

      its actual location within the patient. This permits the operator to guide a needle through&#xD;
