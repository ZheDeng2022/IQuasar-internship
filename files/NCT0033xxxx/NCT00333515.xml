  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose regimen of human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) in healthy&#xD;
      adults at 3 ascending dosage levels administered IV. HuBChE, which occurs naturally in human&#xD;
      plasma, is being evaluated for prophylaxis and treatment in the event of exposure to chemical&#xD;
      nerve agents (as employed during chemical warfare or as an act of terrorism). Volunteers in&#xD;
      each dosage cohort will be randomized to treatment with HuBChE active drug or normal saline&#xD;
      placebo in a 3:1 ratio. The volunteers will remain in the study for 90 (+/- 7) days. For the&#xD;
      first 3 days following dose administration, they will remain at the clinical trial site as&#xD;
      inpatients and will be closely monitored for patient safety. Afterwards, they will return to&#xD;
      the trial site (at pre-determined intervals) as outpatients for 8 further visits, where&#xD;
      patient safety will be assessed.&#xD;
