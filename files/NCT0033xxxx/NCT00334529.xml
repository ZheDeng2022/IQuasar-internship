      This study will determine if oseltamivir (Tamiflu(Registered Trademark)) is safe and&#xD;
      effective given less frequently than the currently prescribed dose of twice a day for 5 days&#xD;
      to people who have the flu, and once a day for up to 6 weeks in people who have been exposed&#xD;
      to someone else with flu and want to prevent getting it themselves. This study will see if&#xD;
      the drug can be given once every other day instead of daily if given with another medication&#xD;
      called probenecid (Benemid(Registered Trademark) or Probalan(Registered Trademark)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of the following regimens for 2 weeks: 1) 75&#xD;
      milligrams (mg) of oseltamivir once a day; 2) 75 mg of oseltamivir once every other day plus&#xD;
      500 mg probenecid four times a day; or 3) 75 mg of oseltamivir once every other day plus 500&#xD;
      mg probenecid twice a day. All medications are taken by mouth. On study day 0, subjects have&#xD;
      the following baseline procedures: measurement of vital signs, review of medical and&#xD;
      medication history, physical examination, blood draw and urine test. They also receive the&#xD;
      first dose of oseltamivir or oseltamivir and probenecid. In addition, they undergo the&#xD;
      following procedures as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 1 and 4: Vital signs; review of clinical symptoms, side effects and medications&#xD;
           taken; urine testing and blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 8: Same as day 1 plus count of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 14: Same as day 8 plus pharmacokinetic study to measure the amount of oseltamivir&#xD;
           and probenecid in the blood. For this test, a catheter is inserted into an arm vein and&#xD;
           blood samples are collected through the catheter before taking the study medications, at&#xD;
           the time the medications are taken, and again at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes and&#xD;
           1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after the medication is taken. The catheter is then&#xD;
           removed. This is the last day to take the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 15: Blood draw for 24-hour (post medication) blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 16: Blood draw for 48-hour (post medication) blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 21 and 28: Same as day 1.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pandemic influenza infection has the potential for causing significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in the United States and elsewhere. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu[R]) is a selective&#xD;
      inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase and is U.S. FDA approved for both treatment and&#xD;
      prophylaxis against influenza A and B viruses. However, at a time of national emergency, the&#xD;
      supply of oseltamivir may be limited and alternative dosing strategies may be needed in order&#xD;
      to provide as wide protection as possible from influenza or to treat as many infected&#xD;
      patients as possible. Agents such as Probenecid that may extend the half-life of oseltamivir&#xD;
      while maintaining effective oseltamivir plasma levels may potentially be useful in this&#xD;
      regard. In this multi-center, three-arm, open-label, 48 patient trial, we propose to explore&#xD;
      the relative safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir plus Probenecid for 14 days in normal&#xD;
      volunteers above and below the age of 65, according to the following dosing strategies: 16&#xD;
      subjects will be assigned to Group I Control Arm (Tamiflu[R] 75 mg given orally once daily),&#xD;
      16 subjects will be assigned to Group II Treatment Arm (Tamiflu [R] 75 mg orally once every&#xD;
      other day plus Probenecid 500 mg orally four times daily), and 16 subjects will be assigned&#xD;
      to Group III Treatment Arm (Tamiflu[R] 75 mg orally every other day and Probenecid 500 mg&#xD;
      orally twice daily).&#xD;
