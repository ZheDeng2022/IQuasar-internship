      Patients within the intensive care unit who have severe infections causing shock and kidney&#xD;
      failure have almost a 60% risk of dying despite antibiotic therapy, surgical drainage of the&#xD;
      site of infection and intensive care support with fluids, nutrition, mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      and continuous artificial kidney support. This persistently high death rate continues to&#xD;
      stimulate the development of new approaches to the treatment of septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much clinical and molecular biology research suggests that these patients die because of an&#xD;
      uncontrolled immune system's response to infection. This response involves the production of&#xD;
      several substances (so called &quot;humoral mediators&quot;), which enter the blood stream and affect&#xD;
      the patient's organs ability to function and the patient's ability to kill germs. These&#xD;
      substances may potentially be removed by new artificial filters similar to those currently&#xD;
      used during continuous hemofiltration (the type of artificial kidney support used in&#xD;
      intensive care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent investigations by ourselves and others, however, have made the following findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard filters currently used in intensive care are ineffective in removing large&#xD;
           amounts of these &quot;humoral mediators&quot; because the holes in the filter are too small to&#xD;
           allow all of them to pass through&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The standard filters currently used in intensive care are also ineffective in removing&#xD;
           large amounts of these &quot;humoral mediators&quot; because the standard filtration flow through&#xD;
           the membrane is less than 100 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When the filtration flow through the membrane is increased to above 100ml/min, patients&#xD;
           require a lesser dose of drugs to support their blood pressure which is an indirect sign&#xD;
           that the filters are clearing some of the &quot;humoral mediators&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Even when the blood flow through standard filters is increased to above 100ml/min, there&#xD;
           is still not optimal clearing of &quot;humoral mediators&quot; It is possible, however, that,&#xD;
           using a different filter membrane with bigger holes in it, would make it easier to clear&#xD;
           the blood of these &quot;humoral mediators&quot;. It is thought that this would be noticeable&#xD;
           clinically in the amount of drugs required to support blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A filter that has these bigger holes is now available. It is made of the same material as the&#xD;
      standard filters that are currently used in the intensive care unit, only the holes have been&#xD;
      made bigger to allow these &quot;humoral mediators&quot; to be removed from the blood. This polyamide&#xD;
      filter is made of synthetic semipermeable material. This material is highly compatible with&#xD;
      human blood. This modified polyamide filter is made of exactly the same compatible material&#xD;
      but the holes in the material are slightly larger through a minor modification of the&#xD;
      manufacturing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This larger hole filter has now been used in preliminary studies in humans and has been found&#xD;
      to reduce the blood levels of some &quot;humoral mediators&quot;. Laboratory studies conducted by&#xD;
      ourselves showed that this new filter can achieve the highest reported clearance of some of&#xD;
      the &quot;humoral mediators&quot; with minimal effect on useful proteins in blood such as albumin&#xD;
      during hemodialysis. This loss is very small and unlikely to contribute to any detectable&#xD;
      clinical changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We, therefore, now propose to study the effect of using new large hole filters with&#xD;
      hemodialysis in patients with severe infections and acute kidney failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to compare the effect of this new therapy to that of standard filters. The new&#xD;
      therapy will be considered to be effective if it lowers the amount of drugs used to support&#xD;
      blood pressure and if it lowers the blood levels of some &quot;humoral mediators&quot; more than&#xD;
      standard therapy. We will also monitor blood levels of important components of blood such as&#xD;
      albumin and electrolytes in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study involving only 10 patients who will each receive 4 hours of the&#xD;
      standard therapy and 4 hours of the new therapy. Which treatment the patient receives first&#xD;
      will be random (like the tossing of a coin). Blood samples will be taken at the start and&#xD;
      after 4 hours of each treatment. The waste product of dialysis called spent dialysate will&#xD;
      also be collected for the measurement of humoral mediators at the start and after 4 hours of&#xD;
      each treatment. The changes in blood pressure and drugs used to support it will be recorded&#xD;
      hourly. As patients involved in the study would normally receive hemofiltration because of&#xD;
      their kidney failure, all the risks and benefits associated with the procedure would be&#xD;
      unchanged. The only risk to patients would come from exposure to a modified membrane and from&#xD;
      having two additional spoonfuls of blood taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this new membrane were found to have a major effect on the blood level of &quot;humoral&#xD;
      mediators&quot; and on the patients' blood pressure, further studies would then be justified to&#xD;
      assess its clinical effects (time in ICU, time in hospital, time on ventilator, duration of&#xD;
      organ failure, etc).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of acute renal failure (ARF) and sepsis is associated with a very high&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality (1). Accordingly, there have many attempts to develop better&#xD;
      treatments for this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much clinical and molecular biology research suggests that septic shock occurs because of the&#xD;
      uncontrolled immune system's response to infection (2-13). This response involves the&#xD;
      production of several substances (so called &quot;humoral mediators&quot;), which enter the blood&#xD;
      stream and, at different times in the course of the patients' illness, cause either severe&#xD;
      inflammation or profound depression of the immune system's ability to kill microbes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vast majority of these substances (cytokines, complement anaphylatoxins, platelet&#xD;
      activating factor, leukotrienes, chemokines), which are responsible for this state of &quot;blood&#xD;
      poisoning&quot; are water soluble and of small to middle molecular weight (up to 40 kilodaltons).&#xD;
      These properties make them potentially removal by artificial membranes similar to those used&#xD;
      during continuous hemofiltration (the type of artificial kidney support used in intensive&#xD;
      care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that using a different and more porous membrane, the removal of such cytokines&#xD;
      would be much more efficient and the clinical benefits of blood purification would,&#xD;
      therefore, be greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A membrane of this kind is now available. It is a modification (moderate increase in pore&#xD;
      size) of standard material called polyamide, which has already been used in millions of&#xD;
      people for dialysis and hemofiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This larger pore polyamide membrane has now been used in preliminary studies in humans (14)&#xD;
      and has been found to be capable of lowering the blood levels of a marker cytokine&#xD;
      (interleukin-6, molecular weight: 26.2 kD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In laboratory studies conducted by ourselves, this new polyamide membrane achieves the&#xD;
      highest reported cytokine and beta2-Microglobulin - as another marker of removal of middle&#xD;
      molecules - clearances in the literature and is associated with a negligible loss of albumin&#xD;
      (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent investigations by ourselves and others, however, have made the following findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard membranes are of only limited effectiveness in filtering these &quot;humoral&#xD;
           mediators&quot; (16)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unless high volume plasma-water exchange is applied (100 ml/min), the effect of blood&#xD;
           purification on the blood levels of these mediators are minimal (17-20)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. High volume hemofiltration with standard membranes, results in an improvement in the&#xD;
           state of the circulation such that the infusion of drugs used to support blood pressure&#xD;
           (noradrenaline) can be decreased (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Even with high volume hemofiltration the removal of &quot;humoral mediators&quot; such as&#xD;
           cytokines is still of limited efficiency (20)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that using a different and more porous membrane, the removal of such cytokines&#xD;
      would be much more efficient and the clinical benefits of blood purification would,&#xD;
      therefore, be greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A membrane of this kind is now available. It is a modification (moderate increase in pore&#xD;
      size) of standard material called polyamide, which has already been used in millions of&#xD;
      people for dialysis and hemofiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We, therefore, propose to study the effect of combining hemodialysis and this new polyamide&#xD;
      membrane with larger pores in the treatment of patients with sepsis and acute kidney failure.&#xD;
      We wish to compare the effect of this new therapy to that of hemodialysis with a standard&#xD;
      membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The terms of comparison (outcome measures) will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A). The effect of each therapy on the blood concentration of several cytokines (TNF-alpha,&#xD;
      IL-1 beta, Il-6, IL-8, and IL-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B). The effect of each therapy on the blood concentration of beta2-Microglobulin as another&#xD;
      marker of removal of middle molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C). The effect of each therapy on blood pressure and the need for noradrenaline infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      and, for safety assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      D). The effect of each therapy on the blood concentration of albumin and electrolytes&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this new membrane were found to have a major effect on the blood concentration of&#xD;
      cytokines and on the patients' blood pressure, further studies would then be justified to&#xD;
      assess its clinical effects (time in ICU, time in hospital, time on ventilator, duration of&#xD;
      organ failure, etc) in further trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of hemodialysis combined with a larger pore&#xD;
      membrane to that of hemodialysis with a standard membrane on&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the serum concentration of several cytokines (efficacy assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the serum concentration and clearance rates of beta2- Microglobulin (efficacy&#xD;
           assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. blood pressure and noradrenaline requirements (efficacy assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the serum concentration of albumin and electrolytes (safety assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
           NULL HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of hemodialysis combined with a larger pore membrane has no effect on serum&#xD;
           cytokine or beta2-Microglobulin levels, blood pressure and noradrenaline requirements&#xD;
           when compared to hemodialysis with a standard membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is a phase I/II equivalent investigation. It is a pilot, randomised,&#xD;
           crossover, controlled study. Eligible patients will receive both treatments. However,&#xD;
           the order of treatment (first treatment A and then B or vice versa) will be allocated in&#xD;
           a random fashion (computer generated random numbers).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After completing the first treatment, patients will then be crossed over to the&#xD;
           alternative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatments will consist of either:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A) hemodialysis with a new polyamide (P2SH) membrane for 4 hours or B) hemodialysis with&#xD;
           a standard polyamide membrane&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood will be sampled (serum cytokine and beta2-Microglobulin measurement) at the start&#xD;
           of each treatment and after 4 hours of each treatment. Dialysate will also be collected&#xD;
           for the measurement of cytokines and beta2-Microglobulin in order to calculate cytokine&#xD;
           and beta2-Microglobulin clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The changes in blood pressure and noradrenaline dose will be recorded hourly as is&#xD;
           routine in Intensive Care. Patient treatment will otherwise continue according to&#xD;
           clinical needs and to standard ICU care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is important to note that patients involved in the study would normally receive&#xD;
           standard hemofiltration anyway because of their kidney failure, with all the risks and&#xD;
           benefits associated with the procedure (insertion of double lumen catheter,&#xD;
           extracorporeal circulation, anticoagulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
           As part of the study, however, they will also receive increased intensity of treatment,&#xD;
           4 hours of exposure to a modified membrane and some additional blood sampling (one&#xD;
           spoonful).&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is possible that the effect of the first therapy would cross over to the second. To&#xD;
           control for this crossover effect, statistical comparison will be undertaken according&#xD;
           to order of treatment as well as type of treatment, as recently published. (23)&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients who fulfil the consensus criteria for sepsis (21) and recently proposed&#xD;
           criteria for severe ARF (1) are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients under 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with a known allergy to polyamide&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients expected to die within 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients in whom there are limitations on the intensity of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           ENROLMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once patient eligibility is established informed consent will be sought from the next of&#xD;
           kin. If informed consent is obtained, the patient will be enrolled in the study. The ICU&#xD;
           research nurse will be responsible for enrolment and subsequent data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following enrolment and randomisation, the patient will be allocated to either treatment&#xD;
           A or B.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An extracorporeal circuit will be set up for dialysis with the Fresenius 2008 machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The only difference will be that, one filter which is being applied, will be a larger&#xD;
           pore polyamide filter. The other filter whic is being applied, will be a standard&#xD;
           polyamide filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each treatment will be applied for 4 hours. After each treatment, the extracorporeal&#xD;
           circuit will be flushed with Hartmann's solution and the membrane changed to the&#xD;
           alternative material (cross over).&#xD;
&#xD;
           For each treatment, the following technical settings will apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Blood flow at 200 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Dialysate flow at 300 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Anticoagulation of filter with prefilter heparin, if necessary (e.g. 1,000 IU/hr)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Bicarbonate-buffered dialysate&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the completion of the 2 periods of 4 hours of hemodialysis, patients will revert&#xD;
           to standard therapy (hemofiltration with AN 69 membrane at 2 L/hr of plasma water&#xD;
           exchange) and continue their normal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomisation and Concealment&#xD;
&#xD;
           The randomisation will be based on random numbers generated by computer. The allocation&#xD;
           to either treatment A or B as the first treatment will be placed in an opaque envelope&#xD;
           by an independent person.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once consent is obtained, the envelope will be opened and treatment initiated. Filters&#xD;
           will be blinded and both will have identical appearance, outlining only &quot;Filter A&quot; or&#xD;
           &quot;Filter B&quot;, respectively, on a label sticking to each filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For reasons of patient safety, filter monitoring for membrane clotting requires that the&#xD;
           filter be visualized at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
           EXPECTED SIZE OF TREATMENT DIFFERENCE&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is designed to detect a 30% decrease in IL-6 levels. From a previous very&#xD;
           similar investigation (19), we also assume a standard deviation equal in size to the&#xD;
           effect being tested for. Using non-parametric paired comparison statistics (Wilcoxon&#xD;
           ranked sign test), a sample of 10 patients would offer a &gt; 80% power of detecting a 30%&#xD;
           difference at an alpha of 0.05 (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
           CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary analysis will be performed on the basis of intention to treat. Secondary&#xD;
           analysis will be performed on per protocol analysis. The primary outcome measure for&#xD;
           this study is the clearance and the change in IL-6 levels The secondary outcome is the&#xD;
           the clearance and change in the levels of other cytokines and beta2-Microglobulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The other secondary outcome is the change in noradrenaline dose required to maintain&#xD;
           baseline mean blood pressure (typically 70 mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment groups will be analysed for differences in IL-6 levels after 4 hours of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is expected from clinical observation that the criteria for normal distribution will&#xD;
           be violated. Therefore comparison will be performed using a non-parametric test&#xD;
           (Wilcoxon ranked sign test). Statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The groups will also be tested for differences in secondary outcome variables. Such&#xD;
           secondary outcome variables are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Absolute change in all serum cytokine levels for each cytokine and for&#xD;
                beta2-Microglobulin&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Percentage change in noradrenaline dose&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Change in blood pressure from pre-treatment value to value after 4 hours of&#xD;
                treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Percentage change in serum cytokine levels for each cytokine&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using the primary outcome variable, this study has an 80% power of detecting a 30%&#xD;
           difference at an alpha of &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is expected from clinical observation that recruitment of 10 patients will take 3&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection will be by the Intensive Care Dept. research nurse and research fellows.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following variables will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Name, gender, age and medical record number&#xD;
&#xD;
           Date of admission to ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
           Admission diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
           SAPS II illness severity score on admission&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time of onset of septic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time of onset of ARF&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time of onset of hemofiltration&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hemodynamic indices, temperature and biochemical indices at baseline and after 4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
           Use of inotropic drugs and dose&#xD;
&#xD;
           Use of vasopressor drugs and dose&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hourly urine output (if present)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time of onset of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fluid balance during each 4 hours of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Albumin and electrolytes at baseline and after 4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
           CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concomitant medications will be administered according to standard intensive care&#xD;
&#xD;
           ADVERSE EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           If any adverse events occur which may be related to the trial device, treatment will be&#xD;
           stopped. The event will be immediately reported to the Ethics Committee according to&#xD;
           institutional protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
           All protocol violations will be recorded. It will then be decided whether the nature of&#xD;
           such violations has been such that the patient should be excluded from primary data&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           WITHDRAWAL&#xD;
&#xD;
           The treating clinician will have the right to withdraw the patient from the study if he&#xD;
           or she believes that continued participation is jeopardizing the patient's well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who require take back to theatre during the study period for a surgical&#xD;
           emergency will be withdrawn from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CONSENT TO TRIAL ENROLMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           In all patients it may be necessary to ask for consent from the next of kin. All of&#xD;
           these patients are mechanically ventilated and too ill to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
           ETHICAL ISSUES&#xD;
&#xD;
           The polyamide material used for the study membrane is very safe and has been used in&#xD;
           millions of patients. Its modification is exclusively to the pore size, not to its&#xD;
           composition. The effect of pore size on protein losses appears minimal for proteins &gt; 60&#xD;
           kD in molecular weight such as albumin. Accurate in vitro testing confirms this.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preliminary phase I data also confirms such safety. We consider the potential benefit of&#xD;
           this intervention theoretically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given the balance of benefits and risks, we consider it ethical to proceed and seek&#xD;
           informed consent.&#xD;
