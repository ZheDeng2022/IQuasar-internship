  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed solid tumors such as sarcomas and neuroblastoma have a poor survival,&#xD;
      generally &lt; 20%. There is an urgent need for new treatments that are safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSV1716, an oncolytic virus, is a mutant herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I, deleted in the&#xD;
      RL1 gene which encodes the protein ICP34.5, a specific determinant of virulence. Mutants&#xD;
      lacking the RL1 gene are capable of replication in actively dividing cells but not in&#xD;
      terminally differentiated cells - a phenotype exploited to selectively kill tumor cells. In&#xD;
      previous clinical studies, HSV1716 has been shown to be safe when injected at doses up to&#xD;
      10^5 plaque forming units (pfu) directly into human high-grade glioma and into normal brain&#xD;
      adjacent to tumour, following excision of high-grade glioma. In an extension study, HSV1716&#xD;
      has been shown to be safe when injected at a dose of up to 10^6 pfu directly into brain&#xD;
      tumours. Replication of HSV1716 in human glioblastoma in situ has been demonstrated.&#xD;
      Following a single administration of HSV1716 by direct injection into active recurrent tumor&#xD;
      or brain adjacent to tumor, some patients have lived longer than might have been expected.&#xD;
      This study seeks to evaluate the safety of a single injection of HSV1716 in the treatment of&#xD;
      extracranial solid tumors in adolescents and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSV1716 has also proved safe when given by direct intra-tumoural injection in patients with&#xD;
      squamous carcinoma of the head and neck, and in patients with malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replication of HSV mutants in human sarcomas and neuroblastoma in cultured cells and human&#xD;
      xenograft models has been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed in two parts. PART 1 of the study specifies a single dose of virus.&#xD;
      Participants who experience at least stable disease or relapse following a determination of&#xD;
      stable disease, may qualify for subsequent doses in PART 2. PART 2 requires signing of a&#xD;
      separate consent.&#xD;
