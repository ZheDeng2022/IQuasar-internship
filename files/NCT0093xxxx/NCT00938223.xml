    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II study of a vaccine comprising melanoma peptides and a tetanus&#xD;
      helper peptide, administered in GM-CSF-in-adjuvant. Patients will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      one of two different vaccine regimens. Patients will be stratified by stage of disease (IIB&#xD;
      versus III versus IV).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each vaccination will be administered over a 6-week period (days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43).&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into one of two groups, Group A or Group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will receive 4 class I MHC-restricted synthetic melanoma peptides (1 each restricted&#xD;
      by HLA-A1, -A3, and two restricted by HLA-A2) and a tetanus helper peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B will receive the 12 class I MHC-restricted synthetic melanoma peptides (4 each&#xD;
      restricted to HLA-A1, -A2, and -A3) and a tetanus helper peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All vaccines will contain GM-CSF-in-adjuvant and will be administered intradermally and&#xD;
      subcutaneously. Concurrent with the first three of these vaccinations, each patient will also&#xD;
      receive an additional set of 3 identical vaccinations in a distal site, the response to which&#xD;
      will be evaluated at the draining lymph node. This node will be harvested using lymphatic&#xD;
      mapping and sentinel node biopsy methods and will be referred to as the sentinel immunized&#xD;
      node (SIN).&#xD;

             females must agree, in the consent form, to use effective birth control methods during&#xD;
             the course of vaccination. This is consistent with existing standards of practice for&#xD;
