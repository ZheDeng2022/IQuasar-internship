  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is defined as a lifelong pervasive developmental disability, as such, symptom recovery&#xD;
      is considered rare. Reports by Lovaas and McEachin, Smith &amp; Lovaas and more recently by&#xD;
      Cohen, Amerine-Dickens, &amp; Smith, Smith Groen et al. and Sutera Pandey et al suggest that&#xD;
      intensive behavioral intervention programs during preschool years may result in improvement&#xD;
      to the point where some children no longer meet criteria for autism by the time they reach&#xD;
      school age. Similarly, there are a large number of anecdotal reports of children with autism&#xD;
      who, following intensive biomedical intervention (e.g., gluten/casein free diets, vitamin&#xD;
      supplements, chelation), are indistinguishable from their typically developing peers. The&#xD;
      goal of the current research is to characterize the behavioral and biological profiles of&#xD;
      children with autism who show significant symptom reduction such that they no longer meet&#xD;
      criteria for autism (Remitted Autism [REM-AUT]) and to contrast them with a group of children&#xD;
      who continue to meet criteria for autism (AUT) and to typically developing (TD) group of&#xD;
      children. Examining whether neurobiological and neurobehavioral symptoms commonly reported in&#xD;
      autism are as frequent and severe in children who have responded to treatment is an important&#xD;
      first step in determining what factors may contribute to symptom remission in autism. In&#xD;
      addition, understanding how children with remitted autism compare to typically developing&#xD;
      children will help us better understand whether symptom improvement is through remediation&#xD;
      (normalization of function) or compensation (achieving the same behavioral/adaptive outcome&#xD;
      but through an alternative process).&#xD;

&#xD;
        STUDY SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Remitted Autism (REM-AUT) Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of autism prior to symptom improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. valid administration of ADI and/or ADOS with accompanying interpretive report&#xD;
                  yielding an autism diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
                  OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. clinical/developmental evaluation including a detailed review of the child s&#xD;
                  history and direct observation of current behavioral functioning resulting in a&#xD;
                  documented diagnosis of autism by a child developmental specialist experienced&#xD;
                  with autism spectrum disorders such as a developmental pediatrician,&#xD;
                  developmental psychologist, child clinical psychologist, or a child psychiatrist&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. measure of cognitive ability from within 1 year of initial autism diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. objective measure indicative of prominent autism symptoms using a recognized and&#xD;
                  standardized assessment of autism symptoms such as the Social Responsiveness&#xD;
                  Scale (SRS), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), or the Modified Checklist for&#xD;
                  Autism in Toddlers (MCHAT) or video tapes of assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. initial diagnosis of autism prior to age 6&#xD;
&#xD;
                  AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Medical, educational, treatment record review by PDN branch clinicians to confirm&#xD;
                  diagnostic impressions including a detailed description of child s behaviors that&#xD;
                  support an autism diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. The final decision for meeting diagnostic and treatment history inclusion&#xD;
                  criteria is based on PDN branch staff review of the case&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Treatment history: all participants must have received adequate treatment&#xD;
                  intervention for their autism symptoms. Participant medical and treatment records&#xD;
                  will be carefully reviewed to ascertain their treatment history&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current functioning:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Parent report and report of at least one professional that child is no longer&#xD;
             autistic&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At screening visit (after meeting initial eligibility), will not meet criteria for&#xD;
             autism&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Must not meet criteria for autism per overall clinical impression based on&#xD;
                  information collected from administration of the ADOS, current ADI-R symptoms,&#xD;
                  and other clinical observations made the assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Teacher/informant report of autism symptoms (such as results from the SRS) not&#xD;
                  indicative of autism diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Minimum improvement of symptoms required from group assignment: approximately 2&#xD;
                  point CGI severity of illness change (or equivalent) based on PDN impression of&#xD;
                  change in illness severity from initial diagnosis (estimated based on review of&#xD;
                  past medical records) and current functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
                  OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Current assessment of functional impairment due to autism symptoms using a&#xD;
                  standardized assessment measure such as the Developmental Disability-Children s&#xD;
                  Global Assessment Scale will reflect adequate functioning in all areas and/or a&#xD;
                  clinically significant improvement in functioning, consistent with common&#xD;
                  psychiatric treatment definitions for treatment response&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to participate in study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        AUTISM Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of autism following the same criteria as described above&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Treatment history: all study participants must have received adequate treatment&#xD;
             intervention. Treatment history will be matched to treatment provided to children in&#xD;
             the REM-AUT group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Screening visit (after meeting initial eligibility): will meet criteria for autistic&#xD;
             disorder using the same diagnostic process described for the REM-AUT group above&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Matched to REM-AUT group on IQ, age of diagnosis, and treatment history. IQ matching&#xD;
             between the AUT and REM-AUT groups will be based on pretreatment estimates of&#xD;
             cognitive level obtained from the medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to participate in study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. IQ matched to a sub-sample of children in the REM-AUT group with normal range&#xD;
             intellectual functioning. IQ matching between the TD and REM-AUT groups will be based&#xD;
             on current intellectual functioning at the time of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to participate in study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Prematurity at birth less than 36 weeks gestation); or birth weight significantly&#xD;
