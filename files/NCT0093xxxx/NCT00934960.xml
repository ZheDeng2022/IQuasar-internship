    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate vision at different distances (far (13 ft),&#xD;
      intermediate (2.0 ft) and near (13 to 15 in)) with and without the patient's glasses (if the&#xD;
      patient wears them), range of vision (the difference between the farthest distance and the&#xD;
      closest distance that the patient can comfortably read 20/25 of the near card), and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction (how satisfied/happy is the patient with their vision) following bilateral&#xD;
      implantation of different multifocal IOLs after routine phacoemulsification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are being asked to participate in this study because you have had cataract&#xD;
      surgery and have received one of the IOLs implanted: ReSTOR +4.0 D, ReSTOR +3.0 D,&#xD;
      Crystalens, and/or ReZoom. The investigator in charge of this study is Dr. Helga Sandoval.&#xD;
      This study is being conducted at Storm Eye Institute at the Medical University of South&#xD;
      Carolina and will involve approximately 50 volunteers.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, unmasked pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SETTING:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Storm Eye Institute, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 patients of both sexes and any race or ethnic background who underwent&#xD;
      uneventful routine bilateral cataract extraction and multifocal or accommodating intraocular&#xD;
      lens implantation will be included. Subjects will be divided in 5 groups of 10 subjects each&#xD;
      based on the IOL implanted as follows: ReSTOR +4.0 D, ReSTOR +3.0 D, Crystalens, ReZoom, and&#xD;
      Mix-and-match (patients implanted with ReSTOR in one eye and ReZoom in the fellow eye).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment included a thorough medical history and a complete eye examination. The latter&#xD;
      will include ETDRS visual acuity at distance (4 mts), intermediate (60 cm) and near (33 or 40&#xD;
      cm accordingly to the lens, under photopic conditions) evaluated uncorrected and&#xD;
      best-corrected as well as distance-corrected near and intermediate visual acuity, , and range&#xD;
      of vision (uncorrected and distance-corrected); the previous tests will be done per eye and&#xD;
      both eyes (visual summation). Slit-lamp exam, eye dominance, stereopsis, pupil size under&#xD;
      photopic conditions, corneal topography and a satisfaction questionnaire will be evaluated as&#xD;
      well. A defocus curve will be performed as follows: a phoropter and a 100% contrast ETDRS&#xD;
      chart positioned 4 meters from the subject under photopic lighting conditions will be used.&#xD;
      Manifest refraction will be used to designate the zero (0) baseline. To begin the testing,&#xD;
      subjects will be defocused -5.00 D spherical correction from their best distance correction&#xD;
      (manifest refraction). The logMAR acuity at this refraction will be recorded. Minus spherical&#xD;
      power will be decreased in 0.50 D increments (i.e., -4.50 D, -4.00 D, -3.50 D, etc.) with&#xD;
      logMAR acuity recorded at each change in correction until only the best distance correction&#xD;
      (manifest refraction) remains. In a further step, subjects will be defocused +2.00 D&#xD;
      spherical correction from the best distance correction (manifest refraction) and the logMAR&#xD;
      acuity will be recorded. Plus spherical power will be decreased in 0.50 D increments (i.e.,&#xD;
      +1.50 D, +1.00 D, +0.50 D) with logMAR acuity recorded at each change in correction until&#xD;
      only the best distance correction (manifest refraction) remains.&#xD;
