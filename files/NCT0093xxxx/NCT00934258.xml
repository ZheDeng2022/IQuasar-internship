  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies indicate that the variant status of detoxification proteins is different&#xD;
      among Taiwanese and other ethnic groups. For example, in Taiwanese, the major SNPs of CYP2C9&#xD;
      are CYP2C9*2 (430C&gt;T) and CYP2C9*3 (1075A&gt;C) and their frequencies are different from that in&#xD;
      Caucasians [11]. The second example is that the frequency of the A(TA)7TAA allele in the&#xD;
      promoter area of the UGT1A1 gene is substantially lower, while for the rate of variation&#xD;
      within the coding region is much higher in Taiwanese than that in Caucasians (14.3% vs. 35.7-&#xD;
      41.5% and 29.3% vs. 0.1%, respectively) [12]. The third example is that the frequency of&#xD;
      388A&gt;G of the OATP2 gene in Taiwanese (0.68) [13] is in between that in European Americans&#xD;
      (0.30) and African Americans (0.74) [14]. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that, in&#xD;
      Taiwanese the SNPs of detoxification proteins modulate the lipid-lowing effects of RVA and&#xD;
      fenofibrate may be different from those for Caucasians.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since April 2008, we have started to run a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label,&#xD;
      blinded end-point classification trial to test the hypothesis in Taiwan that the addition of&#xD;
      fibrate on statin would provide a further reduction in the major coronary events in the&#xD;
      patients with diabetes or atherosclerotic vascular diseases with metabolic syndrome. With the&#xD;
      advantage of this large-scaled prospective trial, it is also a good opportunity to identify&#xD;
      simultaneously the genetic determinants of wide range of interindividual variability in&#xD;
      phenotypic and clinical response to two major lipid-lowering drug classes, rosuvastatin and&#xD;
      fenofibrate. The aim of this proposal is to find which SNPs influence the therapeutic&#xD;
      effectiveness of lipid lowering therapy in Taiwanese hyperlipidemic patients. A key feature&#xD;
      is the use of multiple drug-treated population samples to get the findings derived from both&#xD;
      candidate gene and genome-wide searches for SNP associations with markers of drug efficacy as&#xD;
      well as side effects. Thus the promise of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics-- &quot;individualized&#xD;
      medicine&quot; will come true in treating hyperlipidemia in Taiwanese.&#xD;

    <description>All potential patients will be screened for the eligibility in a screening visit. Those who fill the inclusion criteria at screening will be invited for the registry study into different groups. The follow-up will take place at months 6, 12, 18, and every year thereafter for another 3 years, through clinical visiting, phone follow-up, or records from the NHIB Taiwan. At each clinical visit, vital signs, clinical endpoints, adverse events, concurrent medication information and laboratory specimens will be obtained as complete as possible. With phone or records from NHIB, only clinical endpoints will be recorded. If the primary care physician intends to treat the patient's lipid profile to the target, he/she can add, delete or adjust the LLT by his/her clinical judgement</description>
