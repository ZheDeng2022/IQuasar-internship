      Title: Culturally tailored behavioral interventions to enhance living kidney donation/living&#xD;
      kidney transplantation Applicants: Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, National Kidney&#xD;
      Foundation of Maryland Principal Investigator: Neil R. Powe, MD, MPH, MBA Address: 2024 E.&#xD;
      Monument Street, Suite 2-600, Baltimore, MD, 21205 Phone: 410-955-6953; Email:&#xD;
      npowe@jhmi.edu; Fax: 410-955-0476 Rates of kidney donation have been largely stagnant for the&#xD;
      past 10 years, resulting in large imbalances in numbers of persons on transplant waiting&#xD;
      lists and the number of persons receiving kidney transplants. Slow improvement in donation&#xD;
      and transplantation rates are exacerbated by ethnic/racial disparities in kidney transplants,&#xD;
      in which minorities, particularly African Americans, are far less likely to receive deceased&#xD;
      kidney transplants. Although living related kidney donation (LD) offers patients an&#xD;
      opportunity to bypass many barriers contributing to disparities in kidney transplantation&#xD;
      (e.g. waiting lists and immunological incompatibility issues), African Americans remain less&#xD;
      likely to receive living related kidney transplants (LRT), further exacerbating disparities&#xD;
      in transplant rates. Recent research demonstrates many ethnic minorities desire kidney&#xD;
      transplantation, but rates of patient-physician and patient-family discussions regarding&#xD;
      LD/LRT are suboptimal. Compared to Whites, African Americans have also been shown to have&#xD;
      disproportionately greater rates of culture-specific concerns (such as mistrust in health&#xD;
      care) that could impede them from seeking important medical therapies. It is unknown whether&#xD;
      culturally tailored behavioral interventions to enhance patient/family decision-making&#xD;
      regarding LD/LRT before the onset of end stage renal disease could improve rates of LD/LRT or&#xD;
      could narrow racial disparities in the receipt of transplantation. The primary goal of this&#xD;
      proposal is a) to use focus group methodology to develop culturally tailored educational&#xD;
      materials for patients/families considering LD/LRT and b) to perform a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to test the effectiveness of a culturally tailored social-worker led intervention&#xD;
      (using established behavioral problem-solving therapeutic techniques) in enhancing rates of&#xD;
      family communication, donor evaluations, and transplantation. The substantial experience of&#xD;
      our consortium, including the National Kidney Foundation of Maryland and the Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      Medical Institutions (Welch Center and the Medical Surgical Transplant Services in the School&#xD;
      of Medicine), in the evaluation/ implementation of donor/recipient educational programs as&#xD;
      well as the conduct of behavioral, epidemiologic and interventional studies related to&#xD;
      donor/recipient health and psychology provides a strong foundation for the conduct of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
