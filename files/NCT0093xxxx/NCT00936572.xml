      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of probiotic bacteria has been hypothesized to affect the composition of&#xD;
      the intestinal microflora with reduction of pathogens in favour of non-pathogens. These&#xD;
      events might modulate the immune and inflammatory responses, and the gut function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental data demonstrated that the modulation of the mucosal function and enteric&#xD;
      microflora by Lactobacillus plantarum reduces septic morbidity and mortality in animals. The&#xD;
      administration of a mix of probiotics has been shown to be more effective than antibiotics to&#xD;
      cure pouchitis in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since patients undergoing colorectal operations have a high risk to develop infections due to&#xD;
      the intraoperative contamination with enteral content and the occurence of bacterial&#xD;
      translocation, changing the intestinal microflora, by giving lactobacilli may result in&#xD;
      important advantages to reduce the risk of intraoperative complications and post operative&#xD;
      sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if preoperative administration of mucosa reconditioning by probiotic may result&#xD;
      in adherence to the colonic mucosa and change of the gut microflora, and may modulate the&#xD;
      immune and inflammatory responses and gut function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Design and Control Methods Prospective, randomized, double-blind study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centers Departement of Surgery, San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy Departement of Surgery,&#xD;
      San Gerardo Hospital, University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects/assignment to Formula Groups In these departements about 50 patients are&#xD;
      operated for colorectal disease yearly with laparoscopic approach. All these patients are&#xD;
      potential candidates to partecipate in the study. It is expected that at least 80% of the&#xD;
      patients will agree with partecipation, while during the course of the study about 25% of the&#xD;
      partecipants are expected to withdraw. During the intake procedure the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are checked. Eligible patients are informed about the objectives, the&#xD;
      background and the design of the study. When the patient has given his or her consent to&#xD;
      partecipate in the study, the preoperative status is assessed. The patients are then included&#xD;
      in the study population and randomly assigned to one of the treatments. During surgery the&#xD;
      intraoperative exclusion criteria are checked and non eligible patients excluded from further&#xD;
      study. Each group consist of 15 patients in order to assure that at the end of the study 10&#xD;
      patients per group will have completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: high dose of probiotics (active) compared with B: low dose of probiotics (control) and C:&#xD;
      vehicle (placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing Regimen ??&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing Scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative day 5 through 1. Postoperative day 3 through 8. The three preparation will be&#xD;
      give 3 times per day (6 hours interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study 6 months&#xD;

      GF= gastrointestinal function, fecal pH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological- inflammatory data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DHR, lymphocyte subset (CD3, CD4, CD8, NK), IgA serum levels, CRP, IL-6, lactate.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Microbiological data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative and qualitative culture of stool and colonic mucosa (aerobic and anaerobic total&#xD;
      count, aerobic gram negative and positive count)&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ During surgery two mucosal samples will be collected for microscopic (adherence test) and&#xD;
      microbiological evaluation of the presence of probiotic on the mucosa. Moreover, lymph nodes&#xD;
      of the mesentery will harvested for microbiological analysis to assess translocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of surgery, blood loss, transfusion (amount and type), abdominal contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal function:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Concomitant Medication and Treatments All patients will receive an antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      with cefotetan 2gr 30 minutes before surgery (single shot) and bowel preparation with iso&#xD;
      osmotic solution and enema the day before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PARAMETERS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morphological and microbiological evaluation of the colonic microflora&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gastrointestinal function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immune and inflammatory response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bacterial translocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events encountered during the study will be reported on the Case Report Form. An&#xD;
      adverse event is any adverse change from baseline, including intercurrent illness, wich&#xD;
      occurs during the course of the study after treatment has started, whether considered related&#xD;
      to treatment or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three study formulae are blinded towards each other. Both researches and patients will be&#xD;
      blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of patients into three groups is performed with the computer randomization&#xD;
      program &quot;Random&quot;. In this way patient numbers are assigned at random to the group &quot;active&#xD;
      formula&quot;, &quot;placebo fromula&quot; or &quot;control formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the three groups randomization is done in blocks of 10 patientnumbers. Per study group&#xD;
      three letters are used which are assigned at random to the patientnumbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization list may be broken by them in case of an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulation and Packaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formulation of the trial formulae will be in sachet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dispensing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator is responsible for storage of the study formulae during the time of the&#xD;
      study. The sachets must be stored refrigerated until the time of handout. During the actual&#xD;
      time that the patient takes the study formula no refrigeration of sachets is required. The&#xD;
      investigator is responsible for the hand out of the study formulae in the order of the&#xD;
      patientnumber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dispensary record of the study formula issued and of any material returned will be kept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation, Administration and Dosage of test formulae&#xD;
&#xD;
      Route&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the operation the supplement is consumed orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration protocol For 5 preoperative days in addition of a free choice of hospital&#xD;
      food, and after surgery from day 3 to 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will take high care that patients comply with the conditions set for the&#xD;
      study, in order to prevent unnecessary withdrawal because of non compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS FROM STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The&#xD;
      investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study in the event of&#xD;
      intercurrent illness, adverse events, treatment failure after a prescribed procedure,&#xD;
      protocols violation, cure, administrative reasons or other reasons. It is understood by all&#xD;
      concerned that an excessive rate of withdrawal can render the study uninterpretable:&#xD;
      therefore, unnecessary, withdrawal of subjects should be avoided. Should subjects decide to&#xD;
      withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observation as thoroughly as&#xD;
      possible. A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient's withdrawal should be made&#xD;
      with an explanation of why the subjects was withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the reason for removal of a patient from the study is an adverse event or an abnormal&#xD;
      laboratory test results, the principal specific event or test will also be recorded on the&#xD;
      Case Report Form. In the event of an emergency when the patient's condition requires&#xD;
      knowledge of the test treatment, the label may be opened to determine the nature of the test&#xD;
      formula dispensed. ANY BROKEN CODE WILL BE CLEARLY JUSTIFIED AND EXPLAINED BY A COMMENT ON&#xD;
      THE CASE REPORT FORM, along with the data on which the code was broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REPLACEMENT POLICY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients withdraw from the study will be replaced if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR EXCLUSION OF SUBJECTS' DATA FROM ANALYSES OF STUDY PARAMETERS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra operative exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extensive evidence of non compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Probiotic bacteria do not affect the microbiology of the gut mucosa and stools&#xD;
      gastrointestinal function, immunological or inflammatory parameters compared with control or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Probiotic bacteria significantly diminishes the number of adhrent and stool pathogens&#xD;
      improves gastrointestinal function and/or immunological parameters and/or inflammatory&#xD;
      parameters compared with control or placebo.&#xD;
