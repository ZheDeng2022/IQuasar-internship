  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According available data individuals with ADHD are impaired in their driving ability which&#xD;
      can be improved by stimulant medication. The impact of the specific&#xD;
      noradrenalin-reuptake-inhibitor atomoxetine on driving ability of patients with ADHD has&#xD;
      never been studied so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to evaluate the effects of atomoxetine treatment in patients with ADHD&#xD;
      on practical driving abilities which will be assessed with a standardized driving test, a&#xD;
      structured one-week driving diary and driving related neuropsychological processing&#xD;
      especially different aspects of attention and executive functions which will be assessed with&#xD;
      a neuropsychological test battery designed for the assessment of drivers fitness. A&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) - investigation will also be performed at the&#xD;
      beginning and after a 10-week treatment with atomoxetine. The study will be conducted in a&#xD;
      single-blind placebo controlled parallel group design in cooperation of the academic Adult&#xD;
      ADHD-outpatient clinics of the Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim and the Institute&#xD;
      of Legal and Traffic Medicine of the University of Heidelberg, Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that treatment with atomoxetine will improve practical driving abilities and&#xD;
      driving related neuropsychological processing. It is expected that risk taking and impulsive&#xD;
      decision making will be reduced and sustained attention and overview of complex traffic&#xD;
      situations will be improved while driving.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Informed Consent Form signed by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients are 16-50 years of age when the informed consent document is obtained (Visit&#xD;
             1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients have been judged by the investigator to be reliable to keep appointments for&#xD;
             clinic visits and all tests, including venipuncture and examinations, required by the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD assessed by the Conners' Adult ADHD&#xD;
             Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (CAADID) and KIDDIE-SADDS-PL respectively and&#xD;
             according to expert consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must also have a significant other evaluation of their current ADHD using the&#xD;
             Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Observer: Screening Version (CAARS-O: SV) and&#xD;
             Conners' Rating Scales- Revised (CRS-R):SV respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have a CGI-ADHD-S score of more than 4 points (moderate symptoms) at&#xD;
             Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients aged 18 and older must have a valid driver's license.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have laboratory results assessed at Visit 1, including serum&#xD;
             chemistries, haematology, and thyroid function, that show no significant&#xD;
             abnormalities. Significant would include laboratory deviations requiring acute medical&#xD;
             intervention or further medical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have a negative urinary drug screen at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must have no medical history of heart disease that could be destabilized by&#xD;
             increases in heart rate or blood pressure. The screening electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
             performed at Visit 1 must not show significant abnormalities. Significant would&#xD;
             include a heart rate of less than 40 bpm and more than 120 bpm respectively, any&#xD;
             disturbances in rhythm and conduction as well as ECG-findings pointing to myocardial&#xD;
             infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Females of childbearing potential defined as women not surgically sterilized and&#xD;
             between menarche and 1 year post-menopause must test negative for pregnancy at Visit 1&#xD;
             based on an urinary pregnancy test and agree to use a reliable method of birth control&#xD;
             (e.g., oral contraceptives, a reliable barrier method of birth control like&#xD;
             diaphragms, intrauterine devices; partner with vasectomy or abstinence) during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The exclusion criteria are designed to eliminate patients who do not meet study&#xD;
             population criteria or whose participation in the study would be inappropriate due to&#xD;
             underlying safety issues and to ensure that patients participating in the study are in&#xD;
             a stable physical condition. They further are designed to maintain consistency with&#xD;
             the approved global labeling for atomoxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are investigator site personnel directly affiliated with the study, or&#xD;
             are immediate family of investigator site personnel directly affiliated with the&#xD;
             study. Immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent, child, or sibling, whether&#xD;
             biological or legally adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who meet full DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for any history of bipolar or&#xD;
             psychotic disorder, current major depression, current generalized anxiety disorder or&#xD;
             panic disorder will be excluded from the study. Assessment will be done by clinical&#xD;
             history and a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I disorders (SCID).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are currently using alcohol, drugs of abuse, or any prescribed or&#xD;
             over-the-counter medication in a manner which the investigator considers indicative of&#xD;
             abuse or who meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for substance abuse, assessed by clinical history&#xD;
             and a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Patients must not use drugs of&#xD;
             abuse or illicitly obtained prescription drugs during the study, and a urine drug&#xD;
             screen may be obtained at any time during the study. Alcohol use should be&#xD;
             discouraged, and if, in the investigator's judgment, the patient is using alcohol to&#xD;
             excess, the patient should be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients, who in the opinion of the investigator, are at serious suicidal or homicidal&#xD;
             risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with organic brain disease, for example, dementia, traumatic brain injury&#xD;
             residual, or a history of any seizure disorder (except febrile seizures during&#xD;
             childhood).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a history of severe allergies to more than one class of medications or&#xD;
             multiple adverse drug reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have a known history of narrow angle glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Males with prostatic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with significant medical conditions that are likely to become unstable during&#xD;
             the trial or would likely be destabilized by treatment with atomoxetine, (for example,&#xD;
             cardiovascular disease that would be at aggravated by increased heart-rate), or&#xD;
             require treatment with excluded medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who have any medical condition or who are taking a medication on a daily&#xD;
             basis (for example albuterol, inhalation aerosols) that has sympathomimetic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with hypertension. For the purposes of this protocol, hypertension will be&#xD;
             defined as average systolic or diastolic blood pressure, measured on at least 2&#xD;
             separate occasions, greater than or equal to 140/90. Patients whose blood pressure is&#xD;
             controlled with non-excluded medication are eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient taking any psychotropic medications on a daily basis within 2 weeks before&#xD;
             Visit1. However, zolpidem to a dose of 10 mg may be used intermittently as needed for&#xD;
             insomnia provided they are not used more than 3 times weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who have received regular treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that&#xD;
             has not received regulatory approval for any indication or taking any antipsychotic&#xD;
             medication at the time of study entry.&#xD;
