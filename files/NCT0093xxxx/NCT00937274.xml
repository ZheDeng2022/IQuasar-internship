  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study hopes to demonstrate the potentials of a new form of therapy for childhood&#xD;
      diarrhea, a major cause of morbidity and deaths in Bangladesh and other developing countries,&#xD;
      and thus a priority for improving child health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized double-blind, placebo controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      oral administered E. coli phage in children aged 4-60 months of age with proven ETEC and EPEC&#xD;
      diarrhea. Children will be screened to exclude V. cholerae infections by dark field&#xD;
      microscopy, rotavirus by stool ELISA, and invasive diarrhoea clinically as well as by stool&#xD;
      microscopy, to identify children with possible ETEC and EPEC diarrhoea. Enrolled children&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned, in equal numbers, to receive either: (i) a new T4 phage cocktail&#xD;
      or (ii) Russian anti-E. coli phage cocktail (Microgen) at the dose recommended by the&#xD;
      manufacturer or (iii) only oral rehydration solution (placebo) for 5 days in addition to&#xD;
      management of dehydration and continued feeding in accordance with WHO guidelines. Duration&#xD;
      of diarrhea, daily and cumulative stool output, volume of oral rehydration solution intake,&#xD;
      stool frequency, time to recovery and weight gain will be the main outcome measures. As the&#xD;
      dose of phage we intend to use in this therapeutic trial is higher than the dose administered&#xD;
      to young children in earlier safety trial, we plan to initially conduct a safety study with&#xD;
      these three study products in 45 children with non cholera, non rotavirus and non invasive&#xD;
      diarrhea, to randomize equally in the three intervention groups, as for the final study&#xD;
      mentioned above. The outcome measures in this safety part will include assessment of&#xD;
      laboratory parameters including renal and liver function tests, haematological indices, and&#xD;
      microbiological efficacy of phage by measuring phage and E. coli titre in daily stool&#xD;
      samples. If the higher dose is found safe, tolerable, and not associated with any significant&#xD;
      adverse event, we will proceed to the clinical efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe if T4 coli phage is assessed to be effective in the overall diarrhea management,&#xD;
      this might lead to development of an affordable and sustainable adjunct to the currently&#xD;
      available case management of E. coli diarrhea, benefiting millions of children worldwide.&#xD;
