      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the safety, extent and route of [3H]&#xD;
      BMS747158 radioactivity eliminated (mass balance) in urine and feces of healthy male&#xD;
      subjects. The safety of [3H] BMS747158 administration will also be assessed, as well as&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of [3H] BMS747158 and metabolite identification.&#xD;

      This Phase I, nonrandomized, open-label study will enroll up to seven healthy male subjects&#xD;
      who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Subjects will receive 100&#xD;
      (±20) μCi of [3H] BMS747158. Subjects will undergo blood, urine, and fecal collections to&#xD;
      evaluate [3H] activity for a minimum of 7 days post-dose. Safety will be assessed by&#xD;
      monitoring of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).This Phase I, nonrandomized, open-label study will&#xD;
