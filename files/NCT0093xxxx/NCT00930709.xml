      The purpose of this study is to compare efficacy, feasibility and cost effectiveness of&#xD;
      botulinum toxin type A injections to active nine weeks strength training and stretching&#xD;
      program in the treatment of the chronic lateral epicondylitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that the botulinum toxin type A injections may enable more rapid pain&#xD;
      relief while strength training may provide better functional results and less relapses during&#xD;
      the follow-up.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is a frequent repetitive stress injury, affecting the&#xD;
      common extensor muscles at the lateral humeral epicondyle. Lateral epicondylitis has a&#xD;
      well-known spontaneous healing tendency. Still the prevalence of the chronic lateral&#xD;
      epicondylitis is 1.4% in working populations causing significant occupational disability and&#xD;
      financial burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic reviews of the effectiveness of different treatment modalities for lateral&#xD;
      epicondylitis present conflicting results. There are no consistent guidelines for management&#xD;
      of the prolonged lateral epicondylitis. Progressive strengthening and stretching exercises as&#xD;
      well as botulinum toxin type A injections have been suggested to be effective in treatment of&#xD;
      chronic cases. However, there are only a few studies comparing different treatment modalities&#xD;
      and botulinum toxin treatment have not been included in any of these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare efficacy, feasibility and cost effectiveness of the&#xD;
      botulinum toxin type A injections to active nine weeks strength training and stretching&#xD;
      program in the treatment of the chronic lateral epicondylitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that the botulinum toxin type A injections may enable more rapid pain&#xD;
      relief while strength training may provide better functional results and less relapses during&#xD;
      the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 120 participants with an equal drop-out rate of 15 % per group was&#xD;
      determined in advance to detect a clinically significant 30 percentage points difference in&#xD;
      outcome measures between the treatment groups with the minimum success rate of 65 % at the&#xD;
      statistical significance level of 0.05 and power of 80 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the recruitment process all patient newly referred to Department of PM&amp;R outpatient&#xD;
      clinics in the Seinäjoki Central Hospital due to elbow pain are evaluated by the study&#xD;
      investigators. Every eligible patient with written informed consent is recruited. A&#xD;
      computerised random number generator is used to draw up an allocation schedule. Patients are&#xD;
      allocated in treatment groups via opaque sealed envelopes marked according to the random&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and training instructions are performed by five trained physical therapists. In&#xD;
      addition to detailed personal training instructions given by physical therapist, illustrated&#xD;
      instructions as well as instruction video will be provided for patients in the training&#xD;
      group. Physical therapists instructing patients do not perform any measurements to enable&#xD;
      blinding of assessor. Measurement devices are calibrated regularly according to the&#xD;
      manufacturers' recommendations and quality assurance measurements with test weights are&#xD;
      performed on regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal statistical analysis will be done on an intention-to-treat basis. Repeated&#xD;
      measures of ANCOVA and Cox Proportional Hazard Regression are planned to be used as primary&#xD;
      methods. If there will be relapses, more advanced longitudinal models such as Generalised&#xD;
      Estimating Equations and Random Coefficient Analysis will be used.&#xD;
