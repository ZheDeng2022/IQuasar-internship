    <textblock>
      People who have had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA or &quot;mini-stroke&quot;) are at high&#xD;
      risk of having another stroke or a heart attack. Conditions like high blood pressure and high&#xD;
      cholesterol, along with other lifestyle behaviors (e.g., smoking), substantially increase the&#xD;
      risk of stroke and heart disease. Aggressive treatment of these risk factors however, can&#xD;
      significantly reduce the chance of another stroke, heart attack or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at different ways to optimize blood pressure and cholesterol levels and&#xD;
      educate people about positive lifestyle changes.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown that a number of conditions increase the risk&#xD;
      of stroke and other vascular diseases and there is compelling evidence from large randomized&#xD;
      trials that treatment of these risk factors, especially hypertension and high cholesterol,&#xD;
      can significantly lower future cardiovascular risk. Survivors of TIA or stroke are at high&#xD;
      risk for recurrent stroke, MI, or death (22% at one year) and aggressive treatment of&#xD;
      vascular risk factors can reduce the risk of recurrence by over 25%. However, vascular risk&#xD;
      factors, especially hypertension and high cholesterol, are not managed optimally in patients&#xD;
      after a TIA or stroke, even in those patients seen in specialized Stroke Prevention Clinics&#xD;
      (SPCs). This gap between the evidence for secondary prevention of stroke and the clinical&#xD;
      reality leads to sub-optimal patient outcomes. There is limited data on interventions proven&#xD;
      to improve outcomes in patients with stroke or TIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the quality of care for any condition or patient population, one needs to address&#xD;
      structure, process, and outcomes. In this study, we will be creating and testing a new&#xD;
      structure for delivery of stroke prevention services - we anticipate this new structure will&#xD;
      improve processes of care which in turn should lead to improved outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with usual care, we hypothesize that a pharmacist case manager intervention will&#xD;
      improve blood pressure and serum lipid levels (by employing standardized treatment protocols&#xD;
      to guideline-recommended targets), the management of other risk factors,enhance medication&#xD;
      adherence, and increase health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomized, controlled open-label with blinded ascertainment of outcomes&#xD;
      (PROBE) trial. Patients with a recent stroke or TIA evaluated in any of the 3 stroke&#xD;
      prevention clinics (SPC) in Edmonton, Canada,will be randomized to usual care or the&#xD;
      &quot;pharmacist case manager intervention&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care patients will will receive the same educational materials about stroke risk&#xD;
      factors and medication adherence as the &quot;intervention&quot; patients, will be seen monthly by a&#xD;
      study nurse, will have the same number of BP measurements as &quot;intervention&quot; patients, and&#xD;
      will have a fax sent to their family physician after each study visit reporting their BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over and above usual care, the intervention group will include intensive pharmacist&#xD;
      case-management over 6 months consisting of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  monthly follow-up visits with focus on vascular protection; these clinic visits will be&#xD;
           run parallel to, but independent of, any follow-up at the SPC and will include provision&#xD;
           to each patient of their individual cardiovascular disease risk profile using the the CV&#xD;
           Health Manager software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initiation, monitoring and titration of medications related to blood pressure and&#xD;
           dyslipidemia, using Canadian national guideline-recommended treatment targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication adherence management on an ongoing basis, including access to DosettesÂ®,&#xD;
           blister packs, and reminder tools as deemed necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independent capacity to refer to allied health services (including dieticians and weight&#xD;
           loss services, diabetes education centres, and smoking cessation counselors).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular feedback to the primary care physician and the stroke specialist of record,&#xD;
           regarding all stroke prevention related activities.&#xD;
