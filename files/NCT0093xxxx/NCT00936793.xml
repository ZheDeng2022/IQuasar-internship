    <textblock>
      Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and respiratory disease commonly require&#xD;
      protease inhibitors (PIs) and orally inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids alone&#xD;
      do not generally cause systemic adverse effects because of low systemic bioavailability, but&#xD;
      the combination of inhaled fluticasone and various PIs has led to increased systemic&#xD;
      fluticasone levels and multiple cases of secondary adrenal insufficiency. A study in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers showed &gt; 350-fold increase in fluticasone area under the curve when ritonavir&#xD;
      (RTV) 100mg twice daily was coadministered with intranasal fluticasone compared to intranasal&#xD;
      fluticasone alone. The mechanism of this drug interaction is presumably secondary to PI&#xD;
      inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4, the enzyme responsible for fluticasone metabolism. As a&#xD;
      result, inhaled fluticasone is not recommended in combination with most PIs unless the&#xD;
      benefit outweighs the risk. One possible alternative to fluticasone is inhaled&#xD;
      beclomethasone, which has not been studied in combination with PIs. Although beclomethasone&#xD;
      also undergoes metabolism via CYP3A4 in vitro to its more active metabolite,&#xD;
      beclomethasone-17-monopropionate, it appears to be largely hydrolyzed by esterases in vivo.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic properties of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate, such as&#xD;
      relatively short half-life, low maximum plasma concentration, and low volume of distribution,&#xD;
      suggest that systemic accumulation leading to significant adverse effects is unlikely even in&#xD;
      the presence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as a PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open-label study, 46 subjects will receive inhaled beclomethasone for 6 weeks from&#xD;
      Days 1 to 42. Subjects will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups, such that from Days 15 to 42,&#xD;
      18 subjects will add no additional study drugs, 14 subjects will add RTV 100mg twice daily,&#xD;
      and 14 subjects will add DRV/r 600/100mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic sampling for&#xD;
      beclomethasone and beclomethasone-17-monopropionate levels will occur on Days 14 and 28.&#xD;
      Pre-cosyntropin cortisol levels and a low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation&#xD;
      test will be performed on all subjects on Days 1, 14, 28, and 42. Data from this&#xD;
      investigation will determine whether RTV and/or DRV/r, potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, alter the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of beclomethasone and its active metabolite,&#xD;
      beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (primary objective), and whether or not a possible increase&#xD;
      in systemic bioavailability of beclomethasone and beclomethasone-17-monopropionate alters&#xD;
      pre-cosyntropin cortisol levels and responses to ACTH stimulation test over a 4-week period&#xD;
      (secondary objective). Results from this investigation will provide pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic data to assist clinicians in determining whether inhaled beclomethasone is an&#xD;
      appropriate option in HIV-infected patients requiring concomitant therapy with an inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid and PIs.&#xD;
