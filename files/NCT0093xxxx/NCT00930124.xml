    <textblock>
      Cleft lip and palate patients normally present with a sunken face due to collapse in the&#xD;
      middle part of the face and inability of the upper and lower teeth to meet during chewing.&#xD;
      This situation constitutes a serious aesthetic and mastication problem. A single surgical&#xD;
      operation known as orthognathic surgery was traditionally performed to move the upper jaw&#xD;
      forward to a more normal position and allow chewing function to be regained. However, due to&#xD;
      scar tissue from the original surgical repair of the cleft palate, this procedure is known to&#xD;
      be unstable causing bone to rapidly go back to its original position. A new concept of moving&#xD;
      the upper jaw bone gradually by 1mm per day using a special device attached to the bone&#xD;
      called distraction osteogenesis was established in 1996. Animal studies have shown that this&#xD;
      technique can produce stable results with minimal relapse. The feasibility of correcting&#xD;
      cleft deformities by gradual distraction has been confirmed by our own clinical studies. The&#xD;
      aim of this study (which is the first of its kind) is to conduct a prospective randomized&#xD;
      controlled study and compare the treatment outcomes of the current standard (orthognathic&#xD;
      surgery) with distraction osteogenesis (gradual bone movement). The objectives focus on four&#xD;
      aspects: morbidity, stability, speech function and psychological impact. The results from&#xD;
      this study will clarify several clinical dilemmas in decision making when choosing whether to&#xD;
      use orthognathic surgery or distraction osteogenesis in the treatment of cleft lip and palate&#xD;
      patients. In addition, it will also inform our multidisciplinary research team to improve the&#xD;
      total care of the cleft lip and palate patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gradual bone distraction of the midface in cleft palate patients is more stable, less&#xD;
      detrimental to speech, and no more troublesome to the patient than conventional osteotomy and&#xD;
      bone transposition (orthognathic surgery).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maxillary hypoplasia leading to sunken midface is a common developmental problem in CLP&#xD;
      patients and is related to a combination of congenital reduction in midfacial growth and the&#xD;
      surgical scar from the repair of the cleft palate. Therefore CLP patients commonly present&#xD;
      with short midface and narrow hard palate and severe malocclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional orthognathic surgery can advance, expand and lengthen the maxilla to a normal&#xD;
      position in relation to the skull and the occlusion. However, such immediate surgical&#xD;
      transposition of the cleft maxilla is technically difficult due to the severe deformity&#xD;
      demanding large surgical movement and the tension from the palatal scar. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that the repositioned maxilla is rather unstable in the long term. In addition,&#xD;
      velopharyngeal competence could be compromised by this immediate advancement technique&#xD;
      resulting in abnormally nasal speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of gradual lengthening of the under-developed mandible in syndromal patients&#xD;
      by distraction osteogenesis has been proven. The gradual movement of the maxilla activated by&#xD;
      the implanted distractors can theoretically overcome the tension from the palatal scar and&#xD;
      the soft palate musculature. This may reduce the long term skeletal relapse of the cleft&#xD;
      maxilla and the speech distortion. On the other hand, the distraction procedures involve the&#xD;
      surgical insertion and removal operations and the retention of the devices over a two month&#xD;
      period. This may increase the chance of infection, social inconvenience and ultimately affect&#xD;
      the patient's satisfaction.&#xD;
