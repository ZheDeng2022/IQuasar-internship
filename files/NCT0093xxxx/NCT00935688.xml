  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In areas of which are co-endemic for vivax and falciparum malaria, treatments for the two&#xD;
      diseases often differ and this may lead to mistreatment. This places an emphasis on diagnosis&#xD;
      at the health service provision level. Diagnosis is also important when malaris endemicity is&#xD;
      low - most fevers are not caused by disease. These two issues mean that most malaria and&#xD;
      fevers are not adequately treated, even though the drugs may be effective; many patients who&#xD;
      do not have malaria are treated for the disease, and patients with malaria may get the wrong&#xD;
      treatment for their species. The study aims to test the effectiveness of employing rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic tests and will study the effect on correct treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will randomly assign diagnostic methods, either with clinical diagnosis, field&#xD;
      microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. The study will take place in 22 clinics in Eastern and&#xD;
      Northern Afghanistan, both areas with low transmission of predominantly vivax malaria. They&#xD;
      differ in their locations and their current standard diagnostic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will examine the result of the diagnostic test in the clinic against the result of&#xD;
      reference slides and PCR to estimate the number of cases correctly treated in each arm. This&#xD;
      will be a measure of the effectiveness of diagnosis (and the physicians response to the&#xD;
      diagnosis) and be influential in considering modalities for diagnostic delivery&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient where the clinician* considers malaria in the diagnosis - either&#xD;
             prescribing an antimalarial or would request a malaria test if available or referring&#xD;
             for diagnosis of malaria elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient, or parent/guardian, gives informed consent to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a result from another facility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients referred on for diagnosis in the private sector&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients the clinician decides to treat presumptively without requesting a test&#xD;
             (defined as treating prior to randomisation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where the clinician requests microscopy specifically due to clinical need prior to&#xD;
             randomisation will not be randomised in the trial, but will be noted as part of the&#xD;
             study and a reference slide and clinical information will be taken following consent.&#xD;
