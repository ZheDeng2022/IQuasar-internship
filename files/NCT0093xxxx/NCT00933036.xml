  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year in the United States more than 700,000 people suffer from compression fractures of&#xD;
      the spinal column , and the number of people affected is much higher across the world.&#xD;
      Osteoporosis is the main cause of fractures of the vertebral bodies. Other causes of&#xD;
      vertebral fractures include malignant processes including benign lesions (hemangioma) and&#xD;
      malignant lesions (metastatic cancers, myeloma), infections and trauma; however, osteoporosis&#xD;
      is by far the main cause of this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a normal person, the vertebral bodies are composed of a porous structure called trabecular&#xD;
      or spongy bone encapsulated within a thin external cap of cortical (dense) bone. In a person&#xD;
      with osteoporosis, the trabeculae that form the central porous bone become thinner and&#xD;
      weaker. When this occurs, the vertebral bodies begin to fracture and become deformed. This&#xD;
      deformation of the vertebral bodies is classified into three types, according to the shape:&#xD;
      wedge, biconcave, and crush. The degree of severity of these deformations is classified as&#xD;
      grade A1.1, grade A1.2, or grade A1.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Crosstrees PVA™ Pod™ is a device designed to percutaneously provide controlled delivery&#xD;
      of PMMA bone filler material during vertebral augmentation. The Crosstrees PVA System for&#xD;
      Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation (PVA) is designed for use with Crosstrees Fortibrae PMMA.&#xD;
      The system is novel in providing the ability to control the delivery of PMMA to the vertebral&#xD;
      body without the need for an additional permanent implant to remain within the patient. The&#xD;
      Crosstrees System for Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation will be used with Crosstrees Access&#xD;
      Tools, which are regulated as Class I exempt orthopedic manual surgical instruments.&#xD;
