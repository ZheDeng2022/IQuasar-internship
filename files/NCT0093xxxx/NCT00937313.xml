      -  To assess whether acute, moderate Champagne wine consumption modulates endothelial&#xD;
           function in healthy human volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the bioavailability of Champagne wine polyphenols and their metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects refrained from consuming high polyphenol foods for 48 h prior to the start of the&#xD;
      study and for 32 h post initiation. In particular, the following foods and beverages were&#xD;
      excluded from volunteer diets: cocoa containing products, coffee, tea and wine. The study was&#xD;
      designed as a single blind, randomized, crossover intervention trial, where volunteers were&#xD;
      asked to consume either 375 ml of Champagne wine or a placebo matched for alcohol content,&#xD;
      sugars and fruit-derived acids. Subjects were assessed for anthropometric measurements and&#xD;
      provided a urine sample prior baseline Laser Doppler Imaging with iontophoresis (LDI)&#xD;
      measurements. Subjects were then cannulated and a baseline blood sample was collected.&#xD;
      Subjects were then randomly assigned to either the Champagne wine or placebo group and asked&#xD;
      to consume the beverage within a 10 min period. Following a standardised breakfast blood&#xD;
      samples were collected at: 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360 and 480 minutes post&#xD;
      consumption and pooled urine samples were collected over 3 x 8 h periods. A standardised&#xD;
      breakfast and lunch were also consumed at 15 and 200 minutes post beverage. LDI measurements&#xD;
      were carried out at 120, 240, 360 and 480 minutes. Subjects also provided 24 h and 32 h blood&#xD;
      and urine samples. Following a washout period of 28 days, volunteers returned to the unit to&#xD;
      complete the second arm of the study where the procedure above was repeated.&#xD;
