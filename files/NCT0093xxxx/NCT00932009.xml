      STUDY POPULATION The study will be performed in an urban and a rural setting in Tanzania. In&#xD;
      the urban setting we aim to include men from different employment categories at larger&#xD;
      industries, which potentially have already been identified (Twinga cement, ALAF-Aluminum&#xD;
      Company, Bakhresa Food Industry, Simba plastics Industry, and Mohamed Enterprise Food&#xD;
      Industry), and in addition we will include men from the College/University environment in Dar&#xD;
      es Salaam (Vocational Education Training Dar-es-salaam branch, and Dar-es-salaam Institute of&#xD;
      Transport). From the 2002 Census it has been estimated that the population of Dar es Salaam&#xD;
      was 2,497,940&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of men for the study in the rural setting will take place in villages in the&#xD;
      Kihaba district and the Bagamoyo district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kibaha is one of the 6 districts of the Pwani Region located in Eastern Tanzania. It is the&#xD;
      capital of Pwani region. The district is bordered to the North by the Bagamoyo District, to&#xD;
      the East by Dar-es-Salaam, to the South by the Kisarawe District and to the West by the&#xD;
      Morogoro Region. One of the villages potentially selected for this study is Mlandizi village&#xD;
      located in Kibaha district. According to the 2002 Tanzania National Census, the population of&#xD;
      the Kibaha District was 132,045 Bagamoyo is also one of the 6 districts of the Pwani Region&#xD;
      of Tanzania. It is bordered to the North by the Tanga Region, to the West by the Morogoro&#xD;
      Region, to the East by the Indian Ocean and to the South by the Kibaha District. The district&#xD;
      capitol is at Bagamoyo. According to the 2002 Tanzania National Census, the population of&#xD;
      e.g. the Bagamoyo District was 230,164.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study population in the present investigation will include 2000 men aged 18-60&#xD;
      years. Based on our experience from the recent male study conducted in Denmark and also on&#xD;
      the experience obtained in the female study in Tanzania, we will establish a study team that&#xD;
      will travel to the different study sites and obtain the penile samples, do interviews, and be&#xD;
      responsible for the HIV counseling at the respective study site. The study team will consist&#xD;
      of a male doctor to take the penile swabs, two male study assistants to do the interviews,&#xD;
      and one HIV counselor. We will also employ a Danish researcher who will work together with&#xD;
      the Tanzanian doctor and the rest of the study team in the data collection and entry of the&#xD;
      data. Dr. Crispen Kahesa, who was also involved in our study of HPV infection in Tanzanian&#xD;
      women, and the Danish researcher will collaborate in the day-to-day conduct of the study with&#xD;
      the supervision/assistance of Dr Julius Mwaiselage on a weekly basis and with Professor&#xD;
      Susanne Krüger Kjær. Before initiation of the study, the Danish part of the team from the&#xD;
      Danish Cancer Society will teach the investigating team to take the penile swabs so that it&#xD;
      will be done the same way as it was done in the recent Danish male study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION We have chosen an HPV strategy which matches the strategy we are using in the&#xD;
      female Tanzanian study and previously have used in our Danish male study, namely initial&#xD;
      testing with HC2 followed by genotyping of the samples positive for HC2 high-risk (HR) types&#xD;
      and/ or low-risk (LR) types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV DNA prevalence: HPV samples will be obtained by rubbing a moist cotton swab on glans&#xD;
      penis (including sulcus coronarius and underneath preputium), the penile shaft, scrotum and&#xD;
      perineum following a loosening of the cells with a nail file. This procedure is adapted from&#xD;
      the Merck male clinical studies. We have previously documented that this technique is useful&#xD;
      for obtaining HPV samples among men (Morré et al., 2000; Morré et al., 2002; Kjær et al.&#xD;
      2005), and most recently, we have included more than 2,500 men from Danish military barracks&#xD;
      in a study assessing the presence of HPV DNA and HPV type distribution in Danish men. The HPV&#xD;
      samples from the Tanzanian men will be sent with currier to Prof. Iftners laboratory in&#xD;
      Germany where they will be tested for HPV by means of the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) method&#xD;
      (Digene), low-risk and high-risk probes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV type distribution: HPV genotyping will be performed using Papillocheck - a DNA-Chip&#xD;
      analysis for the type-specific identification of 18 high-risk and 6 low-risk types of HPV.&#xD;
      Alternatively if funding allows it, we will use a reverse hybridization line probe assay test&#xD;
      (LiPa test) from Innogenetics (which is more expensive, but is slightly more sensitive than&#xD;
      the Papillocheck test, and another advantage is that we have used this test in our Danish HPV&#xD;
      study of 2,500 men). The testing strategy will be to genotype all HC2 positive (HR positive&#xD;
      and/or LR positive) samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of HIV status: An HIV test will be offered to all men enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      performed taking into account the individual person's wish to be tested and informed about&#xD;
      their HIV status. HIV antibody presence in whole blood samples will be assessed following the&#xD;
      WHO approved HIV serial testing algorithm. Initially, the Bioline HIV-1/2 immunodetection is&#xD;
      used, and is subsequently followed by Determine HIV-1/2 test in order to confirm Bioline&#xD;
      potentially positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of risk factors associated with HPV infection: A structured interview focusing on&#xD;
      socio-economic characteristics, circumcision status, sexual activity, STI history and&#xD;
      knowledge about HPV and the HPV/ cancer relationship, will be conducted.&#xD;
