  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Phase I part of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose of Revlimid® (lenalidomide) that can be given in combination with paclitaxel to patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer who have failed treatment with taxanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the Phase II part of this clinical research study is to learn if lenalidomide and&#xD;
      paclitaxel can help to control prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of this combination treatment will be studied in both phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPDATE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study was terminated early due to slow accrual as a Phase I dose escalation study, without&#xD;
      progression to Phase II study portion.&#xD;

      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is a drug that changes the immune system and it may also interfere with the&#xD;
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Taking lenalidomide could&#xD;
      prevent the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel is designed to disrupt the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells to&#xD;
      die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phases I and II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you joined the study. Up to 10 groups of 3 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the Phase I portion of the study, and 1 group of up to 42 participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase I portion, the doses of lenalidomide you receive will depend&#xD;
      on when you joined this study. The dose of paclitaxel will be the same for all patients. Up&#xD;
      to 5 dose levels of lenalidomide will be tested in the Phase I portion. The first group of&#xD;
      Phase I participants will receive the lower doses of lenalidomide. Each new group enrolled&#xD;
      will receive the higher doses, if no intolerable side effects were seen. Groups will continue&#xD;
      being enrolled (up to 10) until the highest tolerable dose of lenalidomide (in combination&#xD;
      with paclitaxel) is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive lenalidomide at the highest&#xD;
      dose that was tolerated in the Phase I portion in combination with paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are assigned a dose, you will take lenalidomide capsules by mouth once a day for 21&#xD;
      days in a row, followed by 7 days of rest (Days 22-28). This will be called the &quot;lead-in&quot;&#xD;
      period.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will the begin taking lenalidomide and paclitaxel on 28 day study cycles. You will take&#xD;
      lenalidomide by mouth every day on Days 1-21 of each cycle. Paclitaxel will be given by vein&#xD;
      over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. On Days 22-28 of each cycle, you will take no&#xD;
      study drugs. The Day 1 dose of Lenalidomide in each combination cycle may occur within +/- 5&#xD;
      days of the Day 1 paclitaxel dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should swallow lenalidomide capsules whole with water at the same time each day. Do not&#xD;
      break, chew, or open the capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled&#xD;
      day (do NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide you should seek emergency medical&#xD;
      care, if needed, and contact study staff right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females of childbearing potential that might be caring for you should not touch the&#xD;
      lenalidomide capsules or bottles unless they are wearing gloves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to participate in this study you must also register into and follow the requirements&#xD;
      of the RevAssist® program of Celgene Corporation. This program provides education and&#xD;
      counseling on the risks of fetal exposure, blood clots, and reduced blood counts. You will be&#xD;
      required to receive counseling every 28 days during treatment with lenalidomide, follow the&#xD;
      birth control requirements of the program that are appropriate for you, and take telephone&#xD;
      surveys about your compliance with the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle (before you receive paclitaxel), the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and tests of your prostatic&#xD;
           specific antigen (PSA) and testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have experienced since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8 and 15 of each cycle (before you receive paclitaxel), the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and every 2 cycles thereafter, you will have the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to check the status&#xD;
           of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test your testosterone level and your liver&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are being treated with paclitaxel at your local oncologist's office, you are only&#xD;
      required to return to M. D. Anderson on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of each cycle&#xD;
      after that. All other study visits may be done at your local oncologist's office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue on this study as long as you are benefiting. You will be removed from the&#xD;
      study if you experience intolerable side effects, if the disease gets worse, or if the study&#xD;
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off study, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and tests of your PSA and&#xD;
           testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have experienced since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Lenalidomide is approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) and commercially available for the treatment of specific types of&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. Paclitaxel is FDA-approved&#xD;
      and commercially available for the treatment of bladder cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer,&#xD;
      and pancreatic cancer. The use of these drugs in combination is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 72 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
