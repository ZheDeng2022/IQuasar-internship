      The investigators hypothesized that Oral amoxicillin (25mg/kg/dose bid) given to children&#xD;
      aged 2-59 months with pneumonia, would lead to better clinical outcome on day three in 89.9%&#xD;
      of the children compared to 77.0% of children receiving oral cotrimoxazole (8 mg/kg/dose&#xD;
      trimethoprim, 40 mg/kg/dose sulphamethoxazole). A double blind randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      was conducted in the Assessment Center of Mulago Hospital. Children with non-severe pneumonia&#xD;
      were randomized to receive either oral amoxicillin (25 mg/kg/dose) or cotrimoxazole&#xD;
      (trimethoprim 8 mg/kg and sulphamethoxazole 40 mg/kg) and followed up on day 3 and 5 of&#xD;
      treatment. The primary outcome measures were normalization of respiratory rate by day 3 of&#xD;
      treatment. Secondary outcome measures were antimicrobial susceptibility to cotrimoxazole and&#xD;
      amoxicillin.&#xD;

      A triage Nurse identified and recorded children aged 2- 59 months who presented with a&#xD;
      history of cough, difficult breathing, or fast breathing (tachypnea) in the Assessment Center&#xD;
      of Mulago Hospital. Children aged 2-11 months with a respiratory rate&gt;50 breaths per minute&#xD;
      and those aged 12-59 months with a respiratory rate of &gt; 40 breaths per minute were enrolled&#xD;
      into the study following informed consent from parents/caretakers. Clinical history included&#xD;
      the patient's detailed record of the illness, previous medical history and antibiotic use in&#xD;
      the current illness. The IMCI approach was particularly employed during history taking and&#xD;
      examination. The Principle Investigator and the research assistant interviewed the caretakers&#xD;
      using a structured questionnaire. 5 mls of blood was drawn from the ante cubital fossa for a&#xD;
      complete blood count and blood cultures.In addition thin and thick blood smears for malaria&#xD;
      parasites were taken using finger prick blood samples. Rapid HIV antibody test was done to&#xD;
      determine the HIV serostatus of the children. Children less than 18 months with a positive&#xD;
      antibody test were referred to the Paediatric Infectious Disease Clinic (PIDC) Mulago&#xD;
      Hospital for a DNA-PCR test to confirm their HIV infection status. Study participants were&#xD;
      placed in a well aerated room and subjected to sputum induction. The principal investigator,&#xD;
      with the help of the research assistant and a nurse performed the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study patients were nebulised with salbutamol at a dose of 0.1mg/kg in 3ml of Normal&#xD;
      saline. 3mls of 3% sterile saline was administered through a facemask nebuliser for about&#xD;
      10-15 minutes.Sputum was obtained by expectoration (in children who could do it) or by&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal suction in those who were unable to expectorate. Gram stain, ZN stain and&#xD;
      culture and sensitivity was performed on sputum. Oxygen saturation was measured before and&#xD;
      after sputum induction. For those children who had oxygen saturation of less than 92% or&#xD;
      could not tolerate the sputum induction, the procedure was deferred to the following day when&#xD;
      the children were more stable. However, they continued with treatment. Treatment assignment&#xD;
      was concealed from patients, parents, and study personnel. Children assigned co-trimoxazole&#xD;
      received active medicine (8 mg/kg/dose trimethoprim + 40 mg/kg/dose sulphamethoxazole) and&#xD;
      amoxicillin placebo twice a day. Children assigned amoxicillin received active medicine (25&#xD;
      mg/kg/dose) and co-trimoxazole placebo twice a day.A randomization scheme was developed using&#xD;
      a table of random numbers generated by computer. Study participants were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      treatment in blocks of 4 to 12. Both drugs and placebo were manufactured and packaged in&#xD;
      volumes of 100mls and had the same color. Treatment was started as soon as patients were&#xD;
      enrolled in the study after withdrawal of blood and sputum samples. Drug doses were&#xD;
      calculated according to the body weight. Cotrimoxazole was given orally (syrup) in a dose of&#xD;
      8mg/kg/dose trimethoprim, 40mg/kg/dose sulphamethoxazole and oral (syrup) amoxicillin in a&#xD;
      dose of 25mg/kg/dose every 12 hours until a total of 5 days was reached. The study had two&#xD;
      treatment arms; one arm was randomly assigned to receive active amoxicillin plus placebo&#xD;
      cotrimoxazole orally and the other arm was randomly assigned to receive active cotrimoxazole&#xD;
      with placebo amoxicillin two doses per day. The study nurse and the principle investigator&#xD;
      demonstrated to the parent/caretaker how to give the study drugs by giving the first dose&#xD;
      from the clinic. An explanation was given on how to give medication at home and the level of&#xD;
      understanding was checked before leaving clinic. Caretakers were instructed not to give any&#xD;
      other medications especially antibiotics other than those given in the hospital and were&#xD;
      instructed to return to the clinic on day 3 and 5 of treatment. Paracetamol syrup was&#xD;
      administered to febrile children at a dose of 15 mg/kg 4 - 6 hourly if their axillary&#xD;
      temperature were 38.5 degrees Celsius and above. Vitamin A was given according to the&#xD;
      national recommendation guidelines. Patients who were diagnosed with malaria from blood&#xD;
      slides were given Arthemeter-Lumefantrine tablets. Other medications were as well given&#xD;
      according to the presentation and the diagnosis.The day of enrollment was counted as day 0.&#xD;
      After three days of treatment, patients were checked for general danger signs and assessed&#xD;
      for cough or difficult breathing and the respiratory rate counted. Improvement was defined as&#xD;
      slower respiratory rate (either back to normal range for age, or more than 5 breaths per&#xD;
      minute lower compared to the previous evaluation), less fever, normal oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      better appetite, then patients were requested to complete the 5 days antibiotics and final&#xD;
      follow up on the day 5 of treatment.&#xD;
