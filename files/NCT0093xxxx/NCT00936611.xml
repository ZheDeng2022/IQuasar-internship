  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess the overall response rate of LBH589 in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. LBH589 is a newly&#xD;
      discovered compound that has killed Waldenstrom cells in laboratory studies, however, it is&#xD;
      not known if LBH589 will show the same activity in people with Waldenstrom's&#xD;
      Macroglobulinemia. This drug has been used in research for the treatment of other types of&#xD;
      cancer, such as multiple myeloma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This phase II study is designed to assess the toxicity profile and the proportion of overall&#xD;
      response in patients with relapsed or refractory WM. This will study the effect of single&#xD;
      agent LBH589 on response in these patients. Efficacy measures will include both objective&#xD;
      clinical measurements and investigator-reported outcomes. Response and time to event analyses&#xD;
      will follow the criteria set forth in the International Waldenstrom consortium&#xD;
      recommendations. Prior to the start of the study, investigators will assess disease and&#xD;
      perform a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response will be assessed after 2 cycles. If patients have stable disease or response, then&#xD;
      they will continue on therapy until progression or unacceptable toxicity, being assessed&#xD;
      every cycle until the sixth cycle and then every 3 months. Patients who show progression&#xD;
      after 2 cycles will come off therapy and undergo event monitoring every 3 months. All&#xD;
      responses will be assessed by M-protein quantification and immunofixation from serum and IgM&#xD;
      monoclonal protein level. In addition, BM biopsies will be done at baseline, at the end of&#xD;
      cycle 6 and at the end of all therapy. The protocol was amended because of concerns of&#xD;
      toxicity to allow a starting dose of 25 mg; 12/36 (33%) patients were enrolled on the 25 mg&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
