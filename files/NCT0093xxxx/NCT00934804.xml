  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of the Galilei corneal analyzer to&#xD;
      calculate the effective corneal power (keratometry, corneal curvature) in patients who have&#xD;
      undergone both corneal refractive surgery and lens extraction with intraocular lens&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;

      The accuracy of IOL calculation is important for the visual outcome of patients undergoing&#xD;
      cataract extraction and IOL implantation. Different formulas such as Holladay I, HofferQ,&#xD;
      SRKT have been used with excellent results. All formulas use the corneal power among other&#xD;
      factors to calculate the IOL power. Corneal refractive surgery i.e. radial keratotomy (RK),&#xD;
      photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), and Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) changes the&#xD;
      corneal power; therefore, it is difficult to measure the true corneal power after surgery by&#xD;
      any form of direct measurement, such as keratometry, or corneal topography. Keratometry and&#xD;
      topography assume a normal relationship between the anterior and posterior corneal&#xD;
      curvatures, and measure the anterior corneal radius. RK for myopia flattens both the anterior&#xD;
      corneal radius and the posterior corneal radius while PRK and LASIK for myopia flattens the&#xD;
      anterior corneal radius but leaves the posterior corneal radius mostly unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard keratometry measures an intermediate area and extrapolates the central power based&#xD;
      on some very broad assumptions. For this reason, keratometry, autokeratometry and simulated&#xD;
      keratometry by topography will typically over-estimate central corneal power following&#xD;
      keratorefractive surgery for myopia. This inaccuracy leads to an inability to meet the&#xD;
      patients' rising expectations and with the increasing popularity of refractive surgery,&#xD;
      calculating intraocular lens (IOL) power after refractive surgery is becoming increasingly&#xD;
      important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different methods to calculate the effective corneal power (keratometry) after refractive&#xD;
      surgery have been described (historical data, effective refractive power, modified Maloney&#xD;
      method, etc), however, intraocular lens power calculations in eyes with previous refractive&#xD;
      surgery remains difficult because of the inaccuracy of keratometry power measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Galilei dual Scheimpflug analyzer is a non-invasive, diagnostic system that combines dual&#xD;
      rotating Scheimpflug camera measurements and Placido optical system for corneal topography&#xD;
      and 3D analysis of the anterior eye segment. It provides pachymetry as well as elevation and&#xD;
      curvature mapping of the cornea. Additionally, the Ray tracing system delivers a more&#xD;
      accurate total corneal power and anterior chamber depth. The total corneal power that the&#xD;
      Galilei provides is an alternative that seems to be more accurate to calculate the IOL power&#xD;
      in patients who have undergone keratorefractive surgery prior to cataract extraction and IOL&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of the Galilei to calculate the&#xD;
      effective corneal power (keratometry, corneal curvature) in patients who have undergone both&#xD;
      corneal refractive surgery and lens extraction with intraocular lens implantation.&#xD;
