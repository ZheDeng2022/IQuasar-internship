      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe clinical and functional characteristics of the obese hypoventilating patient; to&#xD;
      study the relation between the obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and the obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). In the second stage of the study, to assess patient&#xD;
      response to non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP), and to identify predictors of unfavourable response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients: Patients with obesity degree I-III, with pCO2 awake and at rest &gt; 45 mmHg,&#xD;
           with no underlying pulmonary or neuromuscular lung disease; two control groups, one of&#xD;
           non-hypoventilating obese patients and the other of obese patients with OSAHS, will also&#xD;
           be studied over the same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design: Prospective observational study. In the first stage anthropometric, clinical,&#xD;
           functional and metabolic data will be recorded for the obese hypoventilating patients&#xD;
           and the two control groups (obese patients without respiratory pathology, and obese&#xD;
           patients with OSAHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage patients with OHS will be divided into two subgroups: group 1: patients&#xD;
      with polysomnography (PSG) suggestive of hypoventilation, in whom NIV treatment will be&#xD;
      initiated; group 2: patients with PSG suggestive of OSAHS (apnea-hypopnea index &gt;15), who&#xD;
      will be administered CPAP. Patients will be examined one month and three months after the&#xD;
      start of treatment. The same measurements will be carried out as at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study, with the exception of the polysomnographic study. Nonetheless, pulse oximetry and&#xD;
      arterial gases will be performed on waking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with OHS may be characterized and differentiated from obese patients without&#xD;
      associated respiratory pathology on the basis of clinical, functional and metabolic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a group of patients with association between OSAHS and OHS that do not respond to&#xD;
      treatment with CPAP, and this unfavorable response can be predicted in advance.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with OHS may be characterized and differentiated from obese patients without&#xD;
      associated respiratory pathology on the basis of clinical, functional and metabolic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a close relation between OHS and OSAHS. It is important to define this relation more&#xD;
      precisely because of its implications for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus on the best ventilatory method for the treatment of OHS. In the case of&#xD;
      an association between OSAHS and OHS the International Consensus proposes initial use of&#xD;
      CPAP, based on empirical data. We believe that there is a group of patients that do not&#xD;
      respond to this treatment and that this unfavorable response can be predicted in advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the clinical, functional and metabolic characteristics of the patient with&#xD;
           obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the frequency and characteristics of the relation between OHS and the&#xD;
           obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the predictive factors of the response to treatment with CPAP in patients with&#xD;
           OHS and associated OSAHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY STUDY SETTING: Pneumology and Endocrinology Services at the Hospital de la Santa&#xD;
      Creu i Sant Pau. Hospitalization Unit, Sleep Clinic and Pulmonary Function Laboratory.&#xD;

&#xD;
      In parallel, two control groups will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A group of obese patients with similar age, sex and BMI. Subjects will be included if&#xD;
           their pCO2&lt; 45 mmHg and if the nocturnal pulse oximetry and specific clinical&#xD;
           questionnaire are not suggestive of OSAHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A group of obese patients with the same characteristics as above, but with diagnosis of&#xD;
           OSAHS by polysomnograph or polygraph study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric and socio-demographic data: age, sex, weight, height, BMI, waist&#xD;
           circumference (above the iliac crest), neck diameter. Age of onset of obesity and length&#xD;
           of period of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General clinical questionnaire: family history, history of episodes of acute respiratory&#xD;
           insufficiency, cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective assessment of degree of sleepiness: analysed using the Epworth scale (MW&#xD;
           Johns, Sleep 1991, 14;540).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Degree of sleepiness according to the definition of the American Thoracic Society:&#xD;
           classification in four categories: absent, mild, moderate and grave.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of respiratory function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forced spirometry and inspirometry. Maximum F/V loop performed with datapir 500&#xD;
           spirometer (SIBEL, Barcelona), in accordance with the norms and reference values of the&#xD;
           SEPAR (Roca et al. Respir Med. 1998 Mar;92(3):401-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Static lung volumes. Measured in accordance with the norms and reference values of the&#xD;
           SEPAR (Roca et al. Respir Med 1998 Mar;92(3):454-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial gases at rest. Maximum respiratory pressures (PIMAX, PEMAX): using the method&#xD;
           described by Morales P. et al (Arch de Bronconeumol 1998; 34: 142-151)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional polysomnography (PSG). PSG will be performed during an entire night using&#xD;
           Siesta, Compumedics equipment, recording two channels of the electroencephalogram,&#xD;
           electrooculogram, electromyogram of chin muscles, hemoglobin saturation by pulse&#xD;
           oximetry, oro-nasal flow by means of thermistor, thoracic and abdominal movements,&#xD;
           electrocardiogram, anterior tibial electromyogram and body position. Sleep staging will&#xD;
           be manual, following the classical criteria of Rechschaffen &amp; Kales. The minimum&#xD;
           recording time will be 6 hours, and the total time of minimal sleep will be 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of apnea: absence of flow for at least 10 s. Definition de hypopnea: any reduction&#xD;
      in the flow of at least 10 s, accompanied by a desaturation (a noticeable fall in saturation&#xD;
      with rapid recovery) and/or transitory waking or arousal (defined according to the ASDA&#xD;
      criteria: Sleep, 1992; 15: 173-184). Definition of hypoventilation: Prolonged periods of&#xD;
      arterial desaturation not preceded by episodes of respiratory events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be recorded: number of apnea/hypopnea episodes per hour (IAH),&#xD;
      percentage of time in apnea and/or hypopnea, number of arousals/hour, sleep efficiency (total&#xD;
      sleep time /length of recording), percentage of time in phases 1, 2, 3-4 and REM, initial&#xD;
      saturation, mean saturation, minimal saturation, time with saturation below 90% (CT90).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radioimmunoassay determination of the level of leptin in serum, determination of&#xD;
           baseline insulinemia, determination of TSH, lipids study (triglycerides, cholesterol&#xD;
           (total cholesterol, HDL, VDL, LDL, Apo-B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjustment of the optimal level of CPAP: after a second conventional polysomnography&#xD;
           study, the optimal level of CPAP will be adjusted in the patients who present an IAH &gt;15&#xD;
           on conventional polysomnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire on compliance with, and side effects of, CPAP/VNI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First phase: All patients from the semicritical unit, conventional ward, pneumology&#xD;
      outpatient service and the Sleep Clinic who meet the entry requirements will be included.&#xD;
      Patients recruited in acute phase will be placed in the pre-inclusion group and will be&#xD;
      definitively included in the study once their condition has been stable for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of obese control patients (BMI&gt;30 Kg/m2 and pCO2 below 45 mmHg), who do not present&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria described above, will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT PERIOD: At the start of the recruitment period the patients will be informed of&#xD;
      the nature of the study and will be asked to give written consent to participate. Then, the&#xD;
      data on the study variables will be compiled: anthropometric and sociodemographic data,&#xD;
      general and specific clinical questionnaire, degree of sleepiness, study of respiratory&#xD;
      function, leptin, baseline insulinemia, and conventional polysomnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control patients polysomnography will be performed if they present clinical symptoms&#xD;
      suggestive of OSAHS or hypoventilation and/or CT 90 &gt; 1% on the nocturnal ambulatory oximetry&#xD;
      (L. Hernandez Plaza et al. Eur Resp J 1996; 9:74S).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second phase: After the polysomnographic study two population groups will be defined: Group&#xD;
      1: OHS patients: polysomnographic study suggestive of hypoventilation without associated&#xD;
      OSAHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Patients with OHS and OSAHS: polysomnographic study suggestive of hypoventilation&#xD;
      associated with OSAHS: IAH&gt;15, with a predominance of obstructive events (&gt;50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group 1 (patients with OHS) will begin NIV treatment, using a BIPAP ventilator in&#xD;
      Spont/timed mode (RF 12) and nasal masks. The parameters of the respirator will be adjusted&#xD;
      during a nap; expiratory pressure (EPAP) will be at least 4 cm H2O and inspiratory pressure&#xD;
      10-20 cm H2O, depending on the patient's tolerance. Oxygen will be added until a continuous&#xD;
      saturation of between 93-95% is obtained, and a gas sample will be taken on waking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients in group 2 a CPAP titration study will be carried out. The pressure will be&#xD;
      adjusted on the basis of a new polysomnographic study. Once the optimum pressure is&#xD;
      established, a nocturnal pulse oximetry will be performed and arterial gases assessed on&#xD;
      waking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment response will be considered inadequate and the CPAP treatment discontinued during&#xD;
      the night of titration if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' tolerance of treatment is poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no correction of obstructive events and/or episodes of hypoventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this case NIV treatment will be initiated, following the procedure described in group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1: One month after the beginning of treatment with CPAP/VNI. Patients will be administered a&#xD;
      questionnaire assessing clinical symptoms, compliance and side effects of treatment, physical&#xD;
      examination, and arterial gases at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T3: After three months the same measurements will be carried out as at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study, with the exception of the polysomnographic study. Nonetheless, pulse oximetry and&#xD;
      arterial gases will be performed on waking, using the treatment method assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who present clinical or gasometric deterioration during follow-up requiring a&#xD;
      change of treatment will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, univariate analysis will be performed on the variables recorded in the patients&#xD;
      and control groups. The results of the categorical variables will be expressed in percentages&#xD;
      and those of the continuous variables as means + standard deviation, as median or range&#xD;
      depending on the form of their distribution. Groups will be compared with the chi-squared&#xD;
      text or through means comparison as required. Subsequently, the variables for which relations&#xD;
      are found and those considered clinically important will be included in the multivariate&#xD;
      logistical regression model in order to determine a predictive model of the presence of&#xD;
      hypercapnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage of the study, over a 12-week period, the baseline and final scores of the&#xD;
      variables will be compared using the most suitable statistical test. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same analysis will be conducted to evaluate the relation between the different variables&#xD;
      and the presence of OSAHS.&#xD;
