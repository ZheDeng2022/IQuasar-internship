      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Avandamet&#xD;
      that can be given in combination with exemestane to patients who are obese and postmenopausal&#xD;
      with hormone-receptive-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exemestane decreases the ability of estrogen to help cancer cells grow. This could cause the&#xD;
      cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avandamet contains two drugs commonly used to control blood sugar levels in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes (metformin and rosiglitazone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the dose of Avandamet you receive&#xD;
      will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the&#xD;
      lowest dose level of Avandamet. Each new group will receive a higher dose of Avandamet than&#xD;
      the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the&#xD;
      highest tolerable dose of Avandamet is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of exemestane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug(s) will be given in 28-day &quot;cycles.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take an exemestane tablet by mouth every day. You will also take tablets of&#xD;
      Avandamet by mouth 1 or 2 times a day depending on the dose level to which you are assigned.&#xD;
      You should take Avandamet at meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4, and then every 3 months after that, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may have taken or may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This blood draw can be done&#xD;
           up to 3 days before each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoons) will be drawn for blood sugar tests. If you have a history of&#xD;
           diabetes, you will need to fast for 8 hours before these blood sugar tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months, you will have scans to check the status of the disease. The scan performed&#xD;
      will depend on where the disease is located in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months, you will also have an echocardiogram (ECHO) or a multi-gated acquisition&#xD;
      (MUGA) scan to test your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Blood Draws:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will also be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK&#xD;
      testing measures the amount of study drug(s) in the body at different time points. Blood will&#xD;
      be drawn for PK testing before you take the study drug(s) and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 23 hours after&#xD;
      you take the study drug(s) on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may take the study drug(s) for as long as the disease is stable and/or responding. You&#xD;
      may be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Exemestane and Avandamet are FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available. Exemestane is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Avandamet is&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of diabetes. The use of this drug combination is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
