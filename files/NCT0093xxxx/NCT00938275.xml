    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of a single 500&#xD;
      mg dose of SRT2104 administered as an oral suspension and a capsule formulation to normal&#xD;
      healthy male and female volunteers in both the fed and fasted state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerance of SRT2104 administered as an&#xD;
      oral suspension and as a capsule formulation to healthy male and female volunteers in both&#xD;
      the fed and fasted state.&#xD;

    <description>Cohort 1 (10 males) &amp; Cohort 2 (10 females) must attend the clinic on 4 separate treatment visits during the study; each treatment visit will be one week apart. At each treatment visit, subjects will receive one of the following 4 treatments:&#xD;
A) 0.5g SRT2104 administered as an oral suspension in the fasted state B) 0.5g SRT2104 administered as an oral suspension following consumption of a standard meal C) 0.5g SRT2104 administered as two 0.25g capsules in the fasted state D) 0.5g SRT2104 administered as two 0.25g capsules following consumption of a standard meal.&#xD;
For treatments A and C, subjects will have fasted for at least 10 hours overnight. Water will be restricted from 1h prior to dosing until 1h post dose. A light lunch will be provided 4h post dose. For treatments B and D, subjects will receive SRT2104 within 30 min following the start of consumption of a standardized non high-fat meal (approximately 650 kcal with approximately 30% of calories derived from fat).</description>

    <description>SRT2104 will be supplied in two forms: as 0.5g powder which will be prepared by the pharmacist/designee into a liquid suspension and as two hard gelatin capsules, each containing 0.25g SRT2104. The dosing vehicle for the liquid suspension is 1% (by weight) hypromellose acetate succinate in water, which is used as a suspension aid and a dispersant for the SRT2104.&#xD;
Each formulation of test material will be administered orally, in a single dose to the subjects in the fasted state and following consumption of a standard meal. Neither the investigator nor the subjects enrolled will be blinded to treatment assignment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be a healthy male or female within the age range of 18 to 55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Voluntarily sign a Research Ethics Committee (REC)-approved informed consent form to&#xD;

             and discussed with the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have Hematology, Coagulation, Clinical Chemistry and Urinalysis test results that are&#xD;
             within normal, allowable limits (if out-of-range, must be considered clinically&#xD;
             significant to be exclusionary) and performed within 21 days of receiving first dose&#xD;
             of test material.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Be clear of any history of HIV and hepatitis B and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have no significant disease or clinically significant abnormal laboratory value as&#xD;
             deemed by the investigator on the laboratory evaluations, medical history, or physical&#xD;
             exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a normal 12-lead ECG or an ECG with abnormality considered to be clinically&#xD;
             insignificant.&#xD;
&#xD;

             study, this is defined as the subject being amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive&#xD;
             months or at least 6 weeks post-surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy. (Menopausal status will be confirmed by demonstrating levels of follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) of 20 - 138 mIU/ml and oestradiol &lt; 20 pg/ml at entry. In&#xD;
             the event a subject's menopause status has been clearly established (for example, the&#xD;
             subject indicates she has been amenorrheic for 10 years), but FSH and/or oestradiol&#xD;
             levels are not consistent with a post-menopausal condition, determination of subject&#xD;
             eligibility will be at the discretion of the principal investigator following&#xD;
             consultation with the sponsor.&#xD;
