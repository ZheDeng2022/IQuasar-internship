  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since subjective well-being and quality of life (QoL) are increasingly being recognized as&#xD;
      important treatment outcomes in patients with schizophrenia (Hofer et al., 2004; Becker et&#xD;
      al., 2005), the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of treatment with quetiapine&#xD;
      XR on these parameters in the acute hospital and the subsequent ambulant care setting. The&#xD;
      study is planned to be conducted in 15 centers all over Austria and, overall, about 150&#xD;
      inpatients with a ICD-10 diagnosis of acute schizophrenia are planning to be enrolled. The&#xD;
      duration of the whole trial will be approximately 4 months, whereas 2 visits during&#xD;
      hospitalization and two further visits after discharge will be scheduled. At each visit,&#xD;
      adverse events and safety parameters, patient satisfaction and effectiveness of the current&#xD;
      treatment, as well as concomitant medication and dosing schedules will be assessed and&#xD;
      documented.In addition to that, the patients' overall satisfaction with antipsychotic therapy&#xD;
      and their current quality of life will be determined using a QoL questionnaire, focussing on&#xD;
      the subjective experience with quetiapine XR.&#xD;
