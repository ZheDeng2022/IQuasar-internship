  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine the effects of an enhanced caregiver training protocol&#xD;
      that not only teaches informal caregivers knowledge and skills for managing patient symptoms,&#xD;
      but also provides strategies for managing their own psychological distress. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate this training will increase caregivers' self-efficacy and improve important&#xD;
      caregiver outcomes (depression, anxiety, burden, quality of life) and patient outcomes&#xD;
      (symptom distress/intensity, depression, anxiety, and quality of life). The study will&#xD;
      compare the effects of this protocol to an education control condition that equates for&#xD;
      interventionist time and attention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptom management is essential in home caregiving. However, many informal caregivers are not&#xD;
      confident of their ability to assist their their loved ones with their cancer symptoms at&#xD;
      home. A low level of confidence or self-efficacy may negatively affect a caregiver's&#xD;
      psychological well-being which is already vulnerable as a consequence of caregiving. Because&#xD;
      of the reciprocal nature in a caregiver-patient dyad, caregiver decline is likely associated&#xD;
      with patient decline. Improving caregivers' self-efficacy to manage their loved ones'&#xD;
      cancer-related symptoms may mitigate their psychological decline and may positively affect&#xD;
      patients' well-being by alleviating their symptom distress. Additionally, training in&#xD;
      self-management of stress may promote coping among caregivers as many data show that&#xD;
      caregiver stress is overwhelming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the effects of an Enhanced Caregiver Training protocol delivered to&#xD;
      informal caregivers of cancer patients before hospital discharge. The primary aim is to test&#xD;
      the effects of the training on caregivers' self-efficacy in cancer symptom management and&#xD;
      self-efficacy in self-management of stress. The study will also look at the effects of this&#xD;
      training on caregiver outcomes (depression, anxiety, quality of life, caregiver stress) and&#xD;
      patient outcomes (symptom distress and intensity, depression, anxiety, quality of life). The&#xD;
      study will use a treatment and attention-control group. Subjects in the treatment group will&#xD;
      receive an individualized experiential caregiver training in strategies for managing&#xD;
      patient's symptoms and in the use of pleasant imagery and muscle relaxation to manage stress,&#xD;
      whereas subjects in the attention-control group will receive an informational session about&#xD;
      cancer and resources for caregiving. Data will be collected before and after the training,&#xD;
      and at 2 and 4 weeks after hospital discharge. Descriptive statistics and multivariate&#xD;
      analysis including mixed models will be used for data analysis This study could have&#xD;
      important implications for the nursing community on how to effectively prepare informal&#xD;
      cancer caregivers for home caregiving prior to hospital discharge. The long term goal is to&#xD;
      refine and expand the training so that it can be used to teach and support informal&#xD;
      caregivers of patients suffering from other chronic illnesses, and to determine the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of this training.&#xD;
