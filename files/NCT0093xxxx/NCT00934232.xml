      Two main objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the MTD of Busulfex ® that can be given safely over the least number of days to&#xD;
      myeloma patients who are either ≥65 years of age (Group 1) or have renal insufficiency (Group&#xD;
      2), defined as creatinine &gt;3mg/dL or creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform pharmacokinetic (PK) studies to evaluate individual variability and the&#xD;
      relationship to toxicities in each of the two groups at each proposed dose level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is for first line treatment for multiple myeloma patients in patients &gt;65 years or&#xD;
      have renal insufficiency Busulfan introduces cytopenia much slower than melphalan while the&#xD;
      time to recover after transplantation is the same. The duration of cytopenia with busulfan&#xD;
      should therefore be shorter. Busulfan given in myeloma patients with renal failure has proven&#xD;
      to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial proposed dose level in our study will be 3.2mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for&#xD;
      3 days. The next levels will be 3.2mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 4 days, 4.3 mg/kg of&#xD;
      body weight over 6 hours for 3 days, 5.6 mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 2 days, and&#xD;
      6.4 mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 2 days. Three patients per group will be entered at&#xD;
      the first level. Further enrollment will be dependent upon toxicities observed. All dose&#xD;
      escalations will be initiated after the PI has reviewed the toxicity data available on the&#xD;
      prior dose levels and confirms that it is safe to proceed to subsequent dose level(s).&#xD;
      Maximum tolerated dose will defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at&#xD;
      which ≥ 2 of 6 patients experiences a grade 4 non-hematological toxicity that is unexpected,&#xD;
      related, and serious, and it will be evaluated separately for patients &gt; 65 years of age or&#xD;
      in patients with renal insufficiency.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have ≥ 3 x 106 CD34 cell/kg in storage for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must have symptomatic multiple myeloma at their new patient consult at HCI&#xD;
             that, in the opinion of the enrolling physician, requires treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be at least 65 years of age and/or diagnosed with renal insufficiency,&#xD;
             defined as serum creatinine ≥3mg/dL or a creatinine clearance of less than&#xD;
             30mL/minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must not have a history of chronic obstructive or chronic restrictive&#xD;
             pulmonary disease. Subjects must demonstrate adequate pulmonary function studies&#xD;
