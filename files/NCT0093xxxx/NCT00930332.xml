      RATIONALE: Methadone hydrochloride may reduce chronic neuropathic pain in patients with&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of methadone&#xD;
      hydrochloride as first-line therapy in treating patients with chronic neuropathic cancer&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the optimum starting dose (defined as the dose that does not require&#xD;
           modification within the first 4 days of treatment for lack of efficacy or the occurrence&#xD;
           of adverse events) of methadone hydrochloride as a first-line opioid treatment in&#xD;
           patients with chronic neuropathic cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the number and timing of breakthrough analgesic usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the number of episodes of breakthrough pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the total daily dose of methadone hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the average pain score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and adverse event profile of methadone hydrochloride as a&#xD;
           first-line opioid in the treatment of chronic neuropathic cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the frequency and severity of sleep disturbance associated with the use of&#xD;
           methadone hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of recruiting patients with chronic neuropathic cancer pain&#xD;
           in a reasonable time frame for a future phase III study of methadone hydrochloride vs&#xD;
           morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to a group according to their&#xD;
      average daily dosage of morphine-equivalent for the 3 full days prior to study entry (≤ 45&#xD;
      mg/day OR &gt; 45 but ≤ 75 mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral methadone hydrochloride at various doses every 8 hours. Patients also&#xD;
      may receive breakthrough oral methadone hydrochloride every 2 hours, as needed, for up to 6&#xD;
      breakthrough analgesics per day. Treatment continues for up to 35 days. Treatment stops if&#xD;
      the patient has well-controlled pain or experiences intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire at baseline. Patients rate their&#xD;
      pain according to questions from the Brief Pain Inventory on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10&#xD;
      (worst pain imaginable) to best describe pain at its worst in the last 24 hours, pain at its&#xD;
      least in the last 24 hours, pain on average, and pain right now; record the number and timing&#xD;
      of breakthrough analgesic usage, the number of episodes of breakthrough pain, and the total&#xD;
      daily dose of methadone hydrochloride; and complete nausea and sleep assessments once daily&#xD;
      on days 1-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4, 6-7, and 28 days.&#xD;
