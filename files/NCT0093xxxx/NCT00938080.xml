  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of AG013 (genetically&#xD;
      modified L. lactis bacteria engineered to secrete human Trefoil Factor 1), and to explore the&#xD;
      ability of AG013 to attenuate the course and severity of oral mucositis (OM) in subjects&#xD;
      receiving induction chemotherapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of AG013 in subjects&#xD;
      who are at risk for oral mucositis (OM) and to assess clinical efficacy of AG013 in the&#xD;
      reduction of signs and symptoms of OM in patients receiving induction chemotherapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of their head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AG013 is made up of genetically modified (GM) bacteria called Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis).&#xD;
      Wild type L. lactis are commonly used to produce dairy products including cheeses and milk.&#xD;
      To make AG013, the DNA of L. lactis has been changed in the laboratory to secrete a protein&#xD;
      called human Trefoil Factor 1 (hTFF1). hTFF1 is normally secreted in saliva and intestines.&#xD;
      Trefoil factors have been shown to be important in protecting and healing mucosal tissues,&#xD;
      such as the tissue in the mouth, when these tissues are damaged by cancer therapies such as&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed Phase 1b clinical trial will enroll subjects with head and neck cancer who&#xD;
      develop OM during their first cycle of treatment with induction chemotherapy. OM is a&#xD;
      painful, common toxicity of many forms of drug and radiation therapy used for the treatment&#xD;
      of cancer. Subjects with OM get soreness, irritation, and ulcers in the mouth and may have&#xD;
      difficulties eating, drinking or swallowing as a result of their cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second cycle of induction chemotherapy, eligible subjects will receive AG013 or&#xD;
      placebo for 14 consecutive days at a frequency of one rinse, three rinses or six rinses per&#xD;
      day (sequential dose escalation design).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 21 subjects will be enrolled in the study. For each of the three daily dose levels,&#xD;
      5 subjects will be assigned to AG013 (n=5) and 2 subjects will be assigned to placebo (n=2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, safety will be monitored by collecting and recording Adverse Events,&#xD;
      laboratory assessments and the presence of sAGX0085 bacteria in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be constituted before the enrollment&#xD;
      of subjects in order to review safety data from each enrollment group.&#xD;
