  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron Emission Tomography Imaging with 3-Deoxy-3'-[18F]Fluorothymidine (FLT) can&#xD;
      selectively identify proliferating and non-proliferating tissues, including tumors. FLT&#xD;
      uptake in the tumor is an indirect marker of DNA synthesis activity, which is a target of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Our hypothesis is that early change in FLT uptake in tumor with chemotherapy&#xD;
      will predict pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. Tumor uptake of&#xD;
      FLT will be imaged and measured with positron emission mammography (PEM), a PET scanner&#xD;
      optimized for breast imaging with a significantly improved resolution compared to&#xD;
      conventional whole-body PET imaging systems.&#xD;

        Women diagnosed with breast cancer whose recommended treatment is neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must have histologically confirmed breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must be scheduled to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery for&#xD;
             their standard cancer care. Treatment decisions will be made by the treating surgeon&#xD;
             and the medical oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Karnofsky at least 60% at time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject must have normal organ and marrow function (as defined below) within 30 days&#xD;
             of study enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes at least 3,000/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets at least 100,000/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin Equal or less than 1.0 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT) no greater than 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT (SGPT) no greater than 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine Equal or less than 1.4 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  BUN Equal or less than 20 mg /dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The effects of FLT on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. A screening urine hCG will be administered in the Nuclear Medicine to&#xD;
             women of childbearing potential before each FLT scan and pregnant women will not be&#xD;
             accepted as subjects in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject with a Karnofsky score of below 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. FLT PET has potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             effects. Because there are potentially unknown risks for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with FLT, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is imaged with FLT and may not resume for 48 hours after&#xD;
             the FLT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects taking nucleoside analog medications such as those used as antiretroviral&#xD;
             agents.&#xD;
