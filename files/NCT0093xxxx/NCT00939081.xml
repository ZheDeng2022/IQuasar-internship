      The purpose of this study is to examine whether pedometer step count recommendations (10,000&#xD;
      steps/day versus an adaptive recommendation) are differentially associated with the primary&#xD;
      outcome of adherence to the pedometer-based physical activity regimen and the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes of change in physical activity and body mass index (BMI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term promotion of physical activity is necessary to achieve obesity prevention. This&#xD;
      represents a particular challenge for our intervention design, as few studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated positive long-term physical activity promotion outcomes among Black women. We&#xD;
      have demonstrated the utility of pedometers among low income, ethnically diverse populations.&#xD;
      The efficacy of pedometer utilization for the prevention of weight gain, however, hinges on&#xD;
      long-term utilization of the devices. We hypothesize that recommendation for the step count&#xD;
      attainment may affect individual's long-term utilization of pedometers, as well as physical&#xD;
      activity levels and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a 24-week experimental trial to examine whether intervention recommendations&#xD;
      promote long-term adherence to a pedometer-based physical activity regimen. A two-group,&#xD;
      block design will be used in the proposed study. Eligible women will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two experimental conditions (n=75 per condition): 1) receiving a 10,000 steps/day&#xD;
      recommendation and 3 health education sessions or 2) receiving an adaptive recommendation and&#xD;
      an obesity prevention intervention. The adaptive step recommendation will update&#xD;
      participants' recommended step counts, starting at 7,000 steps/day, then 8,000 steps/day,&#xD;
      then finally 10,000 steps/day. Participants in the adaptive recommendation group will be&#xD;
      provided with 3 educational sessions and will be asked to report their daily progress on&#xD;
      weight maintenance goals via text message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided pedometers and will be asked to wear them every day of the&#xD;
      24-week trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments (including self-report survey and anthropometric measurements) will be conducted&#xD;
      at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks post-baseline.&#xD;
