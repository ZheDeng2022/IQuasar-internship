      -  Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The objective of this study was to assess the relative bioavailability of two&#xD;
                formulations of immediate release amlodipine 10 mg under fasted conditions, in&#xD;
                healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This was an open-label, single-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period, randomized, crossover&#xD;
                study.Twenty-two healthy subjects were enrolled. Subjects who successfully&#xD;
                completed the screening process checked into the research center the night before&#xD;
                first dose. Subjects who continued to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria the morning&#xD;
                of dose were assigned a subject number, based on the order in which they&#xD;
                successfully completed the screening process and procedures as outlined in the&#xD;
                study protocol. Subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence and&#xD;
                received two separate single-dose administrations of study medication, one&#xD;
                treatment per period,according to the randomization schedule. Dosing days were&#xD;
                separated by a washout period of at least 14 days. Subjects received each of the&#xD;
                treatments listed below during the two treatment periods following an overnight&#xD;
                fast of at least 10 hours: amlodipine by Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Norvasc&#xD;
                by Pfizer, Inc.&#xD;
