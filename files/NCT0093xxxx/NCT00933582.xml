  <brief_title>A Clinical Study to Investigate the Effect on Pain Relief of a Single Dose of JNJ-39439335 in Patients With Chronic Osteoarthritis Pain of the Knee</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single-center study is to evaluate the potential analgesic effects of a&#xD;
      single oral dose (50 mg) of JNJ-39439335, an investigational drug being developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of pain in patients with chronic osteoarthritis pain of the knee. The study will&#xD;
      also evaluate the pain treatment response assessments and methods being used in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will also take naproxen (500 mg) and placebo (an inactive substance) during the&#xD;
      study. Pain assessments after taking JNJ-39439335, naproxen and placebo will be compared.&#xD;

      The purpose of this single-center study is to evaluate the potential analgesic effects of a&#xD;
      single oral dose of JNJ-39439335 (50 mg), an investigational drug being developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of pain, in patients with chronic osteoarthritis pain of the knee. The study will&#xD;
      also evaluate the pain treatment response assessments and methods being used in this study.&#xD;
      Naproxen (500 mg) will be used as the active control. The hypothesis of the study is that a&#xD;
      single 50 mg oral dose of JNJ-39439335 will be superior to placebo in relieving pain in&#xD;
      patients with osteoarthritis knee pain following exercise. Patients will receive JNJ-39439335&#xD;
      , placebo (an inactive substance, like a sugar pill), or naproxen (500 mg) in the clinic on&#xD;
      Days 1, 15, and 29, based on the randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) treatment sequence.&#xD;
      Patients will stay in the clinic for pain assessments up to 4 hours post-dose. At 6 hours&#xD;
      post-dose, patients will be discharged from the clinic. Patients will then take naproxen (500&#xD;
      mg) or matching placebo at 12 hours post-dose and continue taking naproxen (500 mg) or&#xD;
      matching placebo every 12 hours for the following 6 days. During the study, starting from the&#xD;
      first screening visit, patients will be required to discontinue all pain medication and will&#xD;
      be encouraged not to take any rescue medication (quick-relief or fast-acting medications that&#xD;
      work immediately to relieve pain), especially during the dosing periods, for up to 6 days&#xD;
      after each in-clinic study drug dosing on Day 1, Day 15, and Day 29, respectively. When&#xD;
      needed, patients may take paracetamol (500 mg per dose for up to a maximum of 2 grams per&#xD;
      day) as rescue medication; however, patients are required not to take any rescue medication&#xD;
      starting from 12 hours before through 6 hours after the in-clinic dosing on Day 1, Day 15,&#xD;
      and Day 29, respectively. Patients' pain will be evaluated for each of the 3 treatments.&#xD;
      Safety assessments, including vital signs, physical exams, electrocardiograms and clinical&#xD;
      lab tests will be performed at timepoints throughout the patients' study participation.&#xD;
      Patients will receive JNJ-39439335 (50 mg), placebo, or naproxen (500 mg) oral tablets on&#xD;
      Days 1, 15, and 29, based on the assigned treatment sequence. At 12 hours postdose, patients&#xD;
      in the naproxen treatment arm will start self-administering naproxen (500 mg) twice daily for&#xD;
      6 days while patients in the placebo or the JNJ-39439335 treatment arm will take placebo&#xD;
      twice daily for 6 days.&#xD;
