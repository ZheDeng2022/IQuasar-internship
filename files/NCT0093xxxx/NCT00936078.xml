  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Living kidney donors and non-donor controls will be studied before and after the living donor&#xD;
      transplant. The donor and non-donor will be followed for up to 5 years. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to see if there are any differences between the two groups in regards to blood&#xD;
      pressure, rate of hypertension, kidney function and psychological well being and economical&#xD;
      status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transplantation is the preferred treatment option for patients with kidney failure. Compared&#xD;
      to dialysis, patients who receive a transplant have a substantial reduction in the risk of&#xD;
      death, an improved quality of life, and decreased health care costs. The demand for kidneys&#xD;
      has resulted in long waiting lists for deceased donor kidneys. Therefore, living kidney&#xD;
      donations have been on the increase over the years in order to meet this demand for kidneys.&#xD;
      Living donation also has the added benefit of a shorter waiting time, increased graft success&#xD;
      and increased recipient survival compared to deceased donor transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from the advantages for the recipient, living transplantation is a complex medical&#xD;
      practice which we must conduct in a safe and ethical manner. The premise for accepting living&#xD;
      donors is that the &quot;minimal&quot; risk of short and long-term medical harm realized by the donor&#xD;
      is outweighed by the definite advantages to the recipient and potential psychosocial benefits&#xD;
      of altruism to the donor. The short-term potential medical consequences for living kidney&#xD;
      donors have been well established. Yet, the long-term implications of living kidney donation&#xD;
      are far less certain. Potential medical risks include hypertension, proteinuria, reduced&#xD;
      kidney function, premature cardiovascular disease and death. Estimates of these outcomes vary&#xD;
      substantially in the literature. As well, the potential long-term medical risks are also&#xD;
      communicated inconsistently across transplant community. It is accepted that most living&#xD;
      donors experience increased self-esteem, feelings of well-being and an improved quality of&#xD;
      life after their altruistic act. However, some donors have negative psychosocial outcomes&#xD;
      which require further clarification. There is also a financial burden to the donor from the&#xD;
      donation process. Concerns about future life, disability and medical insurance have been&#xD;
      raised. These issues will be addressed through this research study on the long term&#xD;
      implications of donation.&#xD;

        The donors will come from the identified population of people who will be donating their&#xD;
        kidney at the hospital sites participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The non-donor population will be people who the donors identify and ask to act as their&#xD;
        control person. As well, controls will also be found using pamphlet and poster board&#xD;
