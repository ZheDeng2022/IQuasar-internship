      Rationale: The drug etomidate causes increased mortality if used for continuous sedation in&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients; however, etomidate continues to be widely used as a&#xD;
      single-bolus induction agent for endotracheal intubation because of its favorable hemodynamic&#xD;
      properties. Recent data have raised questions regarding the safety of using etomidate for&#xD;
      even a single bolus in patients at risk of adrenal insufficiency, emphasizing the fact that&#xD;
      single bolus doses of etomidate cause measurable adrenal suppression, and consequently may&#xD;
      cause increases in vasopressor requirements and in hospital length of stay. Alternative&#xD;
      FDA-approved induction agents, such as midazolam, may be safer than etomidate; however, no&#xD;
      studies have formally compared these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that in critically ill trauma patients&#xD;
      presenting to the emergency department requiring rapid sequence intubation, the hospital&#xD;
      length of stay for patients given etomidate will be greater than for patients given midazolam&#xD;
      for induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The specific aim is to determine the difference in hospital length of stay&#xD;
      between trauma patients given etomidate and those given midazolam for induction during rapid&#xD;
      sequence intubation in the emergency department. The investigators plan to compare the two&#xD;
      groups in terms of hospital length of hospital stay, length of stay in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit, and duration of intubation by performing a prospective, randomized, trial of critically&#xD;
      ill trauma patients presenting to the emergency department requiring intubation. The&#xD;
      investigators will also compare the mortality rates in these two groups while controlling for&#xD;
      severity of illness and the use of steroids while hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: If the use of etomidate to induce anesthesia prior to intubation adversely&#xD;
      affects the hospital length of stay of trauma patients, this length of stay might be reduced&#xD;
      in such patients by using alternative agents for induction. Since etomidate is currently in&#xD;
      widespread use as an induction agent, the results of this study could have significant&#xD;
      implications for patient management.&#xD;
