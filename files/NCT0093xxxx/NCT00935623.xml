  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that volunteers can be safely and reproducibly&#xD;
      infected with Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) by the bites of experimentally infected Anopheles&#xD;
      dirus (An. dirus) mosquitoes carrying P. vivax sporozoites in their salivary glands.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a proof-of-concept clinical investigation designed to develop a safe and&#xD;
      practical sporozoite challenge model for Plasmodium vivax in humans with a goal of 100%&#xD;
      infectivity rate. The development and standardization of such a model will make possible&#xD;
      efficacy evaluations of candidate P. vivax vaccines in Phase 2a trials. This trial is&#xD;
      conducted in collaboration with Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS)&#xD;
      investigators in Bangkok, Thailand, who will be recruiting adult blood donors from a pool of&#xD;
      patients who present with active P. vivax infections in Thailand. Samples of P. vivax&#xD;
      infected blood will be collected and fed via membrane feeding apparatus to colony-reared&#xD;
      Anopheles dirus mosquitoes at the AFRIMS Entomology Lab. A portion of the same blood will&#xD;
      meanwhile be screened for potential co-infections at the AFRIMS Retrovirology Laboratory.&#xD;
      When screening tests have confirmed the presence of only P. vivax in the blood (no&#xD;
      co-infections with other malaria species), and selected dissection on days 3-7 has revealed&#xD;
      oocyst production in the blood-fed mosquitoes, the mosquitoes will be transported from the&#xD;
      AFRIMS insectary in Thailand to the WRAIR insectary in the US by a standard procedure (herein&#xD;
      described) including permits and assurance against accidental release of the infected&#xD;
      mosquitoes. Transport will be conducted in compliance with Thai exporting and US importing&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will involve two cohorts, each to be challenged once, in the hope of demonstrating&#xD;
      reproducibility of the entire challenge procedure. Each cohort comprises up to 6 healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers. The first cohort will be challenged with 5 bites from P. vivax-infected&#xD;
      mosquitoes each carrying at least a grade 2 sporozoite infection (&gt;10 sporozoites in salivary&#xD;
      gland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If all six volunteers in the first cohort develop P. vivax infection, the same procedure will&#xD;
      be repeated in the second cohort. If the first cohort has less than 100% infectivity rate,&#xD;
      the second cohort will be challenged with up to 10 grade 2 infective bites to ensure 100%&#xD;
      infectivity rate. Volunteers will be closely monitored post-infection, and will be treated&#xD;
      with standard chloroquine and primaquine therapies when the infection becomes patent in the&#xD;
      peripheral blood.&#xD;
