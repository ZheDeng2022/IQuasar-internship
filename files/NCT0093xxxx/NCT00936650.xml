  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with primary HPT was designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL)&#xD;
      of AMG 073 when administered 2 times a day (BID). The study consisted of 3 phases: a 12-week&#xD;
      dose-titration phase, a 12-week maintenance phase, and a 28-week follow-up phase.&#xD;
