  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is whether the provision of tuberculosis care using volunteer&#xD;
      community health workers or self-administered treatment for 7 months is equally effective&#xD;
      with the existing 8 months of TB care in public health facilities by health workers. Patient&#xD;
      care by volunteer community health workers and 7 months of self-administered treatment are&#xD;
      more patient-convenient delivery options than the ongoing TB care in health facility.&#xD;

      Study setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 10 districts which fully implemented the DOTS program in all&#xD;
      their health facilities in order to determine whether better patient quality of care and&#xD;
      convenience using three TB care options could improve treatment outcome. In the study&#xD;
      districts there are 149 tabias and 1163 kushets with 1.2 million residents representing 30%&#xD;
      of the total population of the region. All public health facilities (8 hospitals, 11 health&#xD;
      centres and 48 health posts) in these districts will be included. District hospitals and&#xD;
      health centres provide TB diagnostic services. The study districts comprise 2316 volunteer&#xD;
      community health workers (CHWs) who are functional and accountable to the public health&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the 10 study districts of all public health institutions&#xD;
      which serve both urban and rural population. New patients diagnosed in the study districts (8&#xD;
      hospitals and 10 of the health centres) and those referred for treatment will be included.&#xD;
      Patients suspected of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) disease will be diagnosed based on the&#xD;
      following case definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A patient with at least one of the following criteria will be diagnosed as smear&#xD;
           positive PTB:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Two initial smear examinations positive by direct microscopy for acid-fast bacilli&#xD;
                (AFB) or,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. One initial smear examination positive by direct microscopy and culture positive,&#xD;
                or&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. One initial smear examination positive by direct microscopy and x-ray abnormalities&#xD;
                suggestive of active TB as determined by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A patient is diagnosed as smear negative PTB when three initial smear examinations were&#xD;
           negative by direct microscopy for AFB, and there was failure to respond to a course of&#xD;
           broad-spectrum antibiotics followed by there were three negative smear examinations and&#xD;
           x-ray abnormalities suggestive of active TB as determined by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both smear positive (PTB+) and smear negative pulmonary (PTB-) patients will be recruited to&#xD;
      increase the generalizability of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-trial measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions to improve the quality of TB care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline studies were conducted to determine the quality of TB diagnosis, patient care and&#xD;
      treatment outcome and to identify alternative options TB care appropriate to local&#xD;
      conditions. Six months prior to the trial, the limitations of the ongoing DOTS found by these&#xD;
      studies were communicated to district health office heads, hospital directors and district TB&#xD;
      experts in order to strengthen the quality of TB care and management of district TB programs.&#xD;
      Specific tools that were not developed by the National Tuberculosis Program (NTC) to ensure&#xD;
      consistent application of diagnostic criteria, patient counselling/health information,&#xD;
      standards on supervisory support, drug supply and district evaluation were prepared in&#xD;
      consultation with district health management experts and hospital directors. Subsequently,&#xD;
      district TB coordinators, health institution-based TB focal persons and clinicians were&#xD;
      trained on patient diagnosis, patient care, community-based tuberculosis care and the study&#xD;
      protocol. Based on our baseline assessment of quality of care, the following measures which&#xD;
      improve patient-centred care were instituted at health facility level:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quality control measures to improve the quality of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Definition of what health information should be conveyed to patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient teaching using a one to one interactive counselling method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Training of health workers in TB management (TB focal person) with particular emphasis&#xD;
           on patient management, management of drug side effects and interpretation of treatment&#xD;
           outcome, and reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treatment in patients' most convenient health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Provision of daily out patient TB services in health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Continuous support by health workers or CHWs with a workable referral system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis treatment registers were translated into the local language and were modified to&#xD;
      fit with the monitoring and interpretation of treatment outcomes at health facility level for&#xD;
      patients in the three treatment groups. Volunteer CHWs were also trained by their nearby&#xD;
      health institution TB focal person on patient care, drug handling, indications for referral,&#xD;
      managing side effects, and the use of the patient adherence card. Quarterly supervisory&#xD;
      support was given by regional experts to district health offices, while health institutions&#xD;
      were supervised on a monthly basis by district TB coordinators. The nearby TB focal person&#xD;
      provided technical support to volunteer CHWs during their monthly meeting in the respective&#xD;
      health facilities. Biannual evaluation between district health staff with HQ staff and&#xD;
      district health staff with TB focal persons were instituted. The implementation of the above&#xD;
      measures prior to the launching of the trial created 'operational conditions' of components&#xD;
      of the strategy as recommended by the NTC and International Union against Tuberculosis and&#xD;
      Lung disease (IUTL)/WHO (Wold Health Organisatio) guidelines. Strengthening the health system&#xD;
      based on local conditions is assumed to be a basis for determining specific needs, and for&#xD;
      creating the conditions for the development of the necessary managerial and technical skills&#xD;
      for effective implementation of a community-based TB care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of delivery options for TB care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four prominent TB care delivery options were identified from our community based survey:&#xD;
      Volunteer CHWs, Public health workers, Self-administered treatment and Family member. Further&#xD;
      assessment regarding their reliability and implications for the DOTS strategy was made using&#xD;
      the following selection criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Uninterrupted supply of anti-TB drugs to patients could be ensured,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quality of care comparable to the prevailing health facility based TB care could be&#xD;
           instituted,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Accountability in terms of guaranteeing proper use of drugs and monthly reporting of&#xD;
           treatment outcomes of patients to the public health system,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Feasibility in terms of cost when applied on a larger scale and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Level of acceptance by local communities as determined from our cross-sectional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the prevailing health facility-based TB care, the use of volunteer CHWs and&#xD;
      self-administered treatment were found to be appropriate options for pilot testing. Based on&#xD;
      our criteria, care by family members had the least operational feasibility because the costs&#xD;
      involved to families (labour cost from interruptions of daily activities and transport cost)&#xD;
      and the health systems (health worker time and cost of training) could be high. Operational&#xD;
      difficulties were also anticipated in setting up an appropriate system for monitoring of&#xD;
      anti-TB drugs used, provision of health education, referral, monthly reporting of treatment&#xD;
      outcome particularly among family members who could be in remote parts of the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decentralization of TB care at community level using the existing volunteer CHWs program&#xD;
      was anticipated to be a feasible option to institute most of the components of the&#xD;
      WHO-recommended DOTS strategy. Volunteer CHWs can be trained in patient care on a continuous&#xD;
      basis. Accountability on anti-TB drugs used and reporting on treatment outcomes can be&#xD;
      obtained using the existing link between CHWs and nearby public health facilities. The&#xD;
      services they render are appreciated by respective communities. The self-administered&#xD;
      treatment option was considered after critical examination of previous effectiveness studies,&#xD;
      patients' convenience to tuberculosis care and, most importantly, taking into account the&#xD;
      views expressed by communities and patients. Operational challenges, in which health workers&#xD;
      could be forced to allow patients to take treatment by themselves when there are no volunteer&#xD;
      CHWs who could offer TB care in remote areas was also considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defining intervention arms&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final step was how optimal quality of TB care with less inconvenience could be reached&#xD;
      among the two alternative options from patients' perspective in order to achieve optimum&#xD;
      treatment outcome target. These integrated interventions were therefore targeted to test&#xD;
      treatment outcome by instituting both a comparable patient quality care and patient&#xD;
      convenience to TB care among the three strategies. In order to do this three factors were&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Epidemiological factors From the baseline study, most patients do not interrupt&#xD;
           treatment during the intensive phase of treatment. But, the occurrence of death is high&#xD;
           during the first 2 months of treatment. Even though its contribution is unknown in&#xD;
           Ethiopia, the high HIV-TB co-morbidity and mortality during anti-TB therapy has been&#xD;
           attributed in other sub-Saharan countries. Thus, proper management in health facilities&#xD;
           during the first 28 days for patients assigned into volunteer CHW care or&#xD;
           self-administered groups would ensure their health care needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Operational factors The intervention was designed to be implemented under operational&#xD;
           conditions of the district health system and the ongoing community-based volunteer CHW&#xD;
           programme. CHWs get technical and material support form nearby health facilities. They&#xD;
           are required to submit their activity report at these facilities on a monthly basis.&#xD;
           This arrangement has been found effective in maintaining the functionality of CHWs while&#xD;
           minimizing disruptions in their daily life. Given this operational condition, patients&#xD;
           have to be managed in nearby health facilities for the first four weeks until proper&#xD;
           selection and introduction with respective CHWs are made. Other operational factors in&#xD;
           favour of this arrangement include its feasibility when scaling up the intervention, low&#xD;
           time cost of CHWs and the health system. This operational set up was anticipated to&#xD;
           enable TB focal persons to organize a monthly evaluation session with CHWs in their&#xD;
           catchments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ethical issues Health interventions should be safe and minimize potential risks leading&#xD;
           to patient morbidity and mortality. In Ethiopia a significant proportion of tuberculosis&#xD;
           patients are also infected with HIV. The fact that assigning such patients into an&#xD;
           intervention whose effectiveness is unknown (volunteer CHWs) or allowing them to die&#xD;
           (self-administer group) was also regarded as unethical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, all patients should receive daily TB care including observed daily doses of&#xD;
      treatment for the first 28 days from the most convenient health facility. Patients have to be&#xD;
      properly counselled about their illness and managed accordingly by the TB focal persons.&#xD;
      Counselling should be conducted using a standard procedure developed from our baseline&#xD;
      studies in order to ensure good quality of tuberculosis care. They should be taught&#xD;
      specifically on the causes and prevention of TB, side effects of drugs, treatment adherence&#xD;
      and the schedule for follow up examinations. During this time, the TB focal persons need to&#xD;
      assist patients to select volunteer CHWs from their village. They should explain their role&#xD;
      and created confidence between them. All eligible patients should be treated using anti-TB&#xD;
      drugs recommended by the national tuberculosis control of Ethiopia. PTB+ patients should&#xD;
      receive weight adjusted Ethambutol (E), Rifampicin (R), Isoniazid (H) and Pyrazinamide (Z)&#xD;
      during the first 8 weeks of treatment followed by 6 months of EH, while PTB- should be&#xD;
      treated with weight adjusted RHZ for two months, followed by 6 months of EH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the health worker-TB care group (HW-TC) should be followed as per the&#xD;
      national TB guideline, i.e. daily care including observed treatment by the TB focal persons,&#xD;
      in their respective nearby health institutions during the first 8 weeks followed by&#xD;
      self-administered treatment for the remaining 6 months. During the continuation phase&#xD;
      patients are expected to visit their nearby health facility every month for follow up.&#xD;
      Supervisory support will be given to TB focal persons by the respective district TB&#xD;
      coordinators on a monthly basis. Anti-TB drugs will be delivered to health institutions on a&#xD;
      quarterly basis by district TB coordinators during supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the volunteer CHW-TB care group (CHW-TC) should have daily TB care by&#xD;
      the CHWs in their villages for the second month followed by a monthly visit to the CHWs' home&#xD;
      for the remaining 6 months of self-administered treatment. Patients are expected to visit&#xD;
      health facility at the end of the second months and the end of treatment for sputum&#xD;
      examination. Technical support and anti-TB drugs should be given to CHWs by TB focal persons&#xD;
      every fortnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those assigned to the self-administered treatment group (SA-TC) should take their medication&#xD;
      at home for seven months. They should be taught by the TB focal person to collect their&#xD;
      anti-TB drugs fortnightly and report missed daily doses. Follow up assessment and continued&#xD;
      support should be made by TB focal persons on a monthly basis in their nearby health&#xD;
      facility. Patients should also be told to report when they encountered severe side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled design will be used to compare the existing HW-TC with CHW-TC and&#xD;
      self-administered treatment. Eligible PTB+ and PTB- patients should be assigned using random&#xD;
      numbers, computer generated by a statistician at regional level. To avoid disproportionate&#xD;
      allocations among treatment groups two separate random blocks of 3 for PTB+ and PTB- are&#xD;
      arranged. Two sets of sequentially numbered sealed envelopes for each district will be&#xD;
      prepared. Two separate boxes containing sealed envelopes for PTB+ and PTB- will be given to&#xD;
      the head of each district health office. The district recruiting officers should obtain the&#xD;
      allocation arm for each patient from these district health office heads. For each district,&#xD;
      allocation codes used should be recorded weekly by telephone. A statistician will monitor the&#xD;
      quality of assignment by cross checking the original list in the research HQ with the&#xD;
      sequence of patients' attendance for recruitment. Recruiting officers will be trained using a&#xD;
      pre-tested guideline prepared to ensure that standard procedures are applied consistently in&#xD;
      screening and informing patients. Written consent should be obtained from every patient&#xD;
      following proper counselling, with particular emphasis on tuberculosis treatment and the&#xD;
      alternative options of care. Patients who refused the randomly assigned method of TB care&#xD;
      should be allowed to select either of the two remaining care options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A request for a haemoglobin test from every eligible patient should be made by the health&#xD;
      facility TB focal person in the diagnostic health facilities (hospitals and health centres)&#xD;
      in order to collect serum for anonymous HIV testing before patients are sent to the district&#xD;
      recruiting officer. Laboratory technicians should send 5 cc of serum labelled by a coding&#xD;
      system developed by the Regional Research Laboratory (RRL) in the HQ. HIV test (Determine®&#xD;
      HIV-1/2, Abboti Laboratories) results should be made available to the research team at the&#xD;
      end of the trial. Baseline data should be collected from each eligible patient before he/she&#xD;
      is referred to the most convenient health facility. Patients are only identified by code&#xD;
      numbers in order to maintain confidentiality about their assignment. The codes should be&#xD;
      revealed to the study team after the preliminary data analysis and draft reporting phases are&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment outcome indicators developed by the WHO and the NTC will be used to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of the strategies. Treatment outcome data will be collected by a&#xD;
      team of three tuberculosis experts who are not involved in the study. Treatment outcome of&#xD;
      PTB+ patients should be assessed by sputum microscopy for the presence of acid fast bacilli&#xD;
      while clinical improvements and adherence to treatment will be used to assess the outcome of&#xD;
      PTB- patients by clinicians. Cure and treatment completion rates are used to compare&#xD;
      treatment groups. A patient is declared cured if confirmed to be sputum smear negative at the&#xD;
      end of treatment or one month prior to the completion of treatment and on at least one&#xD;
      previous occasion. A patient should be recorded as &quot;treatment completed&quot; if smear results&#xD;
      were not available on at least two occasions or has negative pre-treatment results. A patient&#xD;
      who has been on treatment for at least 4 weeks and whose treatment was interrupted for more&#xD;
      than 8 consecutive weeks or for a cumulative period of more than 12 weeks should be&#xD;
      classified as a defaulter and a patient who remains smear-positive at 5 months or later&#xD;
      during treatment should be considered to be a failure. A patient who had started treatment&#xD;
      for at least 4 weeks and had been transferred to another district should be recorded as&#xD;
      transferred out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparative effectiveness of health workers-TB care to that of volunteer CHW-TC and SA-TC&#xD;
      in randomized control trials has never been reported so far. It is hypothesized that no&#xD;
      significant difference in cure and treatment completion rate among the three care groups&#xD;
      would be shown, taking the prevailing health facility-based TB care as the gold standard of&#xD;
      care. The sample size for PTB+ (179 patients per arm) was planned to detect at least a 10%&#xD;
      difference in treatment success rates between any of care groups (assuming 85% treatment&#xD;
      success rate in the highest arm and a baseline treatment success rate of 72%) with a power of&#xD;
      80% at a significant level of 5%. With the same assumption (85% treatment completion rate in&#xD;
      the highest arm and a baseline treatment completion rate of 69%), all eligible PTB- patients&#xD;
      (131 patients per arm) should also be included during the study period. Separate comparisons&#xD;
      of effectiveness between the three methods of TB care will be carried out for PTB+ and PTB-&#xD;
      patients. Comparison of effectiveness of the care groups will be undertaken according to the&#xD;
      principle of intention-to-treat. The strength of association between treatment outcomes and&#xD;
      each care group will be determined using the chi-square test. Adjusted effects of patients'&#xD;
      characteristics, area of residence, HIV status, time elapsed by each patient for treatment,&#xD;
      the type of health facility and method of TB care used on treatment outcomes will be computed&#xD;
      using logistic regression analysis.&#xD;
