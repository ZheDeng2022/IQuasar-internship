  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ARTEMIS is a study to assess how educational material affects overall adherence to&#xD;
      anastrozole by evaluation of patients' electronically compiled dosing histories. Patients'&#xD;
      dosing times are compiled electronically using Medication Event Monitoring System&quot; (MEMS®) in&#xD;
      order to be able to gather accurate, objective and up-to-date patients' dosing histories. For&#xD;
      subjects in Group A, the control group, the adherence to anastrozole in the standard clinical&#xD;
      practice will be evaluated. For subjects in Group B, on top of the standard clinical&#xD;
      practice, they will also receive educational material by mail at week 0 (study registration),&#xD;
      week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 12, month 5, month 7, and at month 10. This procedure is&#xD;
      the same as in the ongoing CARIATIDE study. One of the reasons of poor adherence (either&#xD;
      early discontinuation of the treatment or missing doses while still engaged to the therapy)&#xD;
      can be some side effects experienced by the patients during the anastrozole treatment.&#xD;
      Recording the reasons at discontinuation allows us to identify reasons for treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation. Recording reasons of anastrozole interruptions during the study period&#xD;
      allows us to relate these events to patients' adherence to anastrozole. During the study, no&#xD;
      pro-active safety data collection will take place. Spontaneous reported adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions (ADRs) will be reported according to local post-marketing pharmacovigilance&#xD;
      regulations.&#xD;
