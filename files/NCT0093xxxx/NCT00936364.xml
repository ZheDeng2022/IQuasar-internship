    <textblock>
      This partially randomized clinical trial studies short-term fasting in reducing side effects&#xD;
      in patients receiving gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin for advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
      Short-term fasting before chemotherapy may reduce the side effects caused by chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of short-term fasting prior to administration of&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy with platinum in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the toxicity profile of platinum-based chemotherapy in subjects who eat&#xD;
      normally compared to those who undertake short-term starvation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate changes in plasma insulin, glucose, IGF1 and IGF binding protein (IGFBP)&#xD;
      levels, and oxidative stress markers in subjects who undertake short-term fasting compared to&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate whether changes in grp78 expression occur after fasting and after&#xD;
      chemotherapy administration in human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE I: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. GROUP I: Patients fast for 24&#xD;
      hours on day-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients fast for 48 hours on days -2 and -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Patients fast for 72 hours on days -3, -2, and-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP IV: Patients undergo a modified 48-hour fast with minimal caloric intake on days -2 and&#xD;
      -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients fast for 72 hours on days -2, and on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients proceed to chemotherapy without fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and&#xD;
      cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

                  the effect of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stage I: subjects may have already received no more than 2 cycle of&#xD;
                  platinum-based chemotherapy, but should not have received other prior&#xD;
                  chemotherapy regimens with the exception of patients with metastatic disease who&#xD;
                  received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and that chemotherapy was completed&#xD;

                  months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
