  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to define the effect of Tysabri in patients with&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS) over 2 years. The investigators will also&#xD;
      explore the extent of remyelination in MS patients treated with Tysabri over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of this study is to investigate differences in the capacity for&#xD;
      remyelination between patients who do or do not respond to Tysabri monotherapy during the&#xD;
      same 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tertiary objective of this study is to monitor Tysabri effect in MS antiphospholipid&#xD;
      antibodies positive and MS antiphospholipid antibodies negative patients and to determine&#xD;
      perfusion differences according to the antiphospholipid antibodies positivity status.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) is a widely used tool for characterizing the evolution&#xD;
      of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and normal appearing brain tissue (NABT). As remyelination&#xD;
      and demyelination are heterogeneous in each lesion and NABT, techniques such as voxel-wise&#xD;
      based MTR dynamic mapping may help predict an individual's clinical course, as well as the&#xD;
      effect of treatment, by revealing evidence of myelin repair and neuroprotection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natalizumab (Tysabri) showed a robust effect on the decrease of inflammation in phase II and&#xD;
      III clinical trials, as evidenced by the decrease in Gd enhancing and T2 lesions and on the&#xD;
      decrease of clinical activity as measured by reduction of clinical relapses and progression&#xD;
      of disability. The effect of Tysabri on non-conventional measures is only partially known.&#xD;
