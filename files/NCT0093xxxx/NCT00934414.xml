      MKC-TI-016 is a parallel, prospective, controlled, open-label, 1-period, single-dose trial&#xD;
      utilizing a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure to evaluate the bioavailability and&#xD;
      bioeffect of inhaled TI Inhalation Powder in type 2 diabetic subjects who smoke compared to&#xD;
      nonsmoking type 2 diabetic subjects.&#xD;
