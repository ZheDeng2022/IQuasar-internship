    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is very common in the intensive care unit (ICU),&#xD;
      affecting 9 to 40% of ICU patients and mortality rates range from 20 to 50% and may reach&#xD;
      more than 70% when the infection is caused by multi-resistant and invasive pathogens. The&#xD;
      most common pathogens that cause VAP are the Gram(-) bacteria. Findings indicate that TLRs&#xD;
      serves as an important signal in the generation of protective innate responses to bacterial&#xD;
      pathogens of the lung and that is required for effective innate immune responses against&#xD;
      Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. There is genetic evidence that mutations in TLRs increase&#xD;
      the risk of developing nosocomial infections. Understanding the TLR system should offer&#xD;
      invaluable opportunity for manipulating host immune responses.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) typically refers to nosocomial pneumonia developing 48&#xD;
      hours later from endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.ICU patients who receive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation have 4-fold higher risk of developing pneumonia with a rate of 3% per&#xD;
      day after day 7 in the intensive care unit. Several risk factors have been reported to be&#xD;
      associated with VAP, including the duration of mechanical ventilation, the presence of&#xD;
      chronic pulmonary disease, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), neurological&#xD;
      disease and trauma. The immune system defends the host against infection. Protective immunity&#xD;
      can be divided into innate and adaptive immunity. The innate immune response evolves as a&#xD;
      first defence barrier in the host and mounts an immediate, but nonspecific, immune response&#xD;
      to rapidly destroy or limit the invaders. The innate defense mechanisms are the external&#xD;
      epithelia, the mucosal surfaces, the cells (NK cells, phagocytes) and the complement system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive immunity is a second line defence that includes T (cellular) and B (humoral) cell&#xD;
      mediated responses. This is specific, targets only pathogens and not self, and has memory to&#xD;
      sustain a long-lasting immunity against reinfection. Although the innate immune system lacks&#xD;
      the fine specificity of adaptive immunity it can distinguish self from non self. Innate&#xD;
      immune recognition is mediated by a system of germline-encoded receptors named pattern&#xD;
      recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize conserved molecular patterns (pathogen-associated&#xD;
      molecular patterns, PAMPs) that are associated with microbial pathogens. These receptors are&#xD;
      coupled to signal transduction pathways that control expression of a variety of inducible&#xD;
      immune-response genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TLRs control both innate and adaptive immune responses. The TLR-induced inflammatory response&#xD;
      is dependent on a common signaling pathway that is mediated by the adaptor molecule MyD88.&#xD;
      TLR expression is observed in a variety of cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic&#xD;
      cells, epithelial cells derived from gut, lung and derma, B-and T-lymphocytes.TLR4 was the&#xD;
      first mammalian TLR identified and is involved in the recognition of lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
      (LPS), a major cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria which can induce sepsis. TLR2 is&#xD;
      the most powerful receptor and recognizes a wide variety of PAMPs from bacteria, yeast,&#xD;
      fungi, parasites and viruses. TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG motifs present in bacterial&#xD;
      DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis syndrome is frequently complicated by the development of nosocomial infections,&#xD;
      particularly Gram-negative pneumonia. Findings indicate that TLR9 serves as an important&#xD;
      signal in the generation of protective innate responses to bacterial pathogens of the lung&#xD;
      and that is required for effective innate immune responses against Gram-negative bacterial&#xD;
      pathogens. Unmethylated CpG motifs are prevalent in bacterial but not vertebrate genomic DNA.&#xD;
      The recognition of CpG motifs activates host defense mechanisms leading to innate and&#xD;
      acquired immune responses. Cells that express TLR-9 are the plasmacytoid dendritic cells&#xD;
      (PDCs) and the B cells and as a consequences produce Th1-like proinflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      interferons and chemokines. Activation of TLR-9 induces the production of a) cytokines&#xD;
      (IL-12, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8), interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-)α which are Th1&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines and b) IL-10 and IL-4 which are Th2 proinflammatory cytokines that&#xD;
      induce immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Th1 cytokines play a central role in inflammation and activation of macrophages, NK cells and&#xD;
      neutrophils. Th2 cytokines inhibit Th1 immune response. This causes a systemic systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome. Also, toll-like receptors-2 (TLR2) and -4 (TLR4) play a&#xD;
      crucial role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Their activation by LPS of Gram&#xD;
      (-) and Gram (+) bacteria leads to activation of neutrophils, NK cells, T-, B- cells and&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines. In chronic disease, dysregulated inflammation maintains these systems&#xD;
      in a state of constant activation, potentially resulting in tissue damage and progressive&#xD;
      disease. Understanding the TLR system should offer invaluable opportunity for manipulating&#xD;
      host immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate and elucidate the role of CD4+ και CD8+ Τ lymphocytes in pathogenesis of&#xD;
           VAP. Also, the level of cytokines IL-4 and IFN-γ the time when the patients in ICU&#xD;
           develop VAP and the changes to the subpopulations of Τ lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate apoptosis of macrophages and their capacity to phagocyte in VAP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the expression and possible polymorphisms of TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-9 genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding of immune response to VAP will allow the preparation of immunotherapy protocols&#xD;
      so as to regulate immunological response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoalveolar lavage processing&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first day, in each patient samples of blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and&#xD;
      tracheobronchial aspirate (TBA) will be taken. Bronchoscopy is a technique of visualizing the&#xD;
      inside of the airways for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. A bronchoscope is inserted&#xD;
      into the airways, usually through the nose or mouth, or occasionally through a tracheostomy.&#xD;
      This allows the practitioner to examine the patient's airways for abnormalities such as&#xD;
      foreign bodies, bleeding, tumors, or inflammation. Specimens may be taken from inside the&#xD;
      lungs: biopsies, fluid (bronchoalveolar lavage), or endobronchial brushing. BAL is typically&#xD;
      performed to diagnose lung disease. In particular, BAL is commonly used to diagnose&#xD;
      infections in people with immune system problems, pneumonia in people on ventilators and some&#xD;
      types of lung cancer. BAL is often used in immunological research as a means of sampling&#xD;
      cells or pathogen levels in the lung (T-cell populations). Specimens may be taken again in 48&#xD;
      hours from the diagnosis of VAP. BAL will be placed in 10%FBS-RPMIc and centrifuges at 400g,&#xD;
      5 min, and then will be added RPMI-1640 and 10% FBS. The number and the type of the cells&#xD;
      will be defined by Μay-Grunwald-Giemsa staining, and the subpopulations with flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBMC isolation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human lymphocytes can be isolated most readily from peripheral blood by density&#xD;
      centrifugation with the carbohydrate polymer Ficoll (Ficoll Histopaque, Sigma, Cat 1077-1).&#xD;
      This yields a population of mononuclear cells at the interface that has been depleted of red&#xD;
      blood cells and most polymorphonuclear leukocytes or granulocytes. The resulting population,&#xD;
      called peripheral blood mononuclear cells, consists mainly of lymphocytes and monocytes.&#xD;
      Diluted anticoagulated blood is layered over Ficoll and centrifuges at 400g, 30min at 20ºC&#xD;
      (slow acceleration, no brake). Red blood cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes or granulocytes&#xD;
      have higher density from Ficoll and are to the bottom of the tube. But mononuclear cells&#xD;
      consisting of lymphocytes together with some monocytes band over it and can be recovered at&#xD;
      the interface. Cells are washed using 1xPBS with 1mM EDTA 3 times to remove Ficoll and&#xD;
      platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody labeling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-CD3-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate), anti-CD8-PE (phycoerythrin), anti-CD4-PE,&#xD;
      anti-IFN-γ and anti-IL-4, anti-CD4, anti-CD8 and controls IgG-FITC and -PE will be used for&#xD;
      labeling cells. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) a reactive derivative of fluorescein, has&#xD;
      been one of the most common fluorophores chemically attached to other, non-fluorescent&#xD;
      molecules to create new fluorescent molecules for a variety of applications. DAKO system will&#xD;
      be used. For staining, immunochemistry will be used after plating the cells on Superfrost&#xD;
      Plus slides by cytocentrifugation with the kit of DAKO according to instructions of the&#xD;
      manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphocytes will be stimulated in 24-well plates in RPMI-1640 at 10% fetal calf serum in the&#xD;
      presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate, 25 ng/mL; ionomycin; 1 µmol; and Brefeldin A, 10&#xD;
      µg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich; St, Louis, MO). Cytospins will be made using cytocentrifugation of 150&#xD;
      µL of the stimulated suspension and store at - 80°C. Approximately 175,000 cells will be&#xD;
      cytospun on each slide of which are sufficient lymphocytes to stain. The double&#xD;
      immunocytochemical method for the determination and measurement of CD8+IFN-+, CD8+IFN-+ (or&#xD;
      CD4+IFN-+, CD4+IFN-+) will be performed in two steps. At step one, use the primary anti-CD8&#xD;
      (or anti-CD4, respectively) mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody with secondary rabbit&#xD;
      anti-mouse IgG-FITC antibody. At step two, after permeabilization, a primary anti-IFN- or&#xD;
      IL-4 mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody (Caltag; Burlingame, CA) with secondary rabbit&#xD;
      anti-mouse IgG-PE. A permeabilization kit of will be used according to the instructions of&#xD;
      the manufacturer (Dako). For the estimation of each ratio, 500 T cells we count &gt; 10&#xD;
      cytospins stained if necessary because this number is sufficient to obtain a mean value per&#xD;
      subject that remain constant after further increasing the number of cells counted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow Cytometric Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples prepared as described above were analyzed on a fluorescence activated cytometer&#xD;
      (EPICS ELITE; Coultronics; Louton, UK). The lymphocytes were tightly gated by volume and&#xD;
      complexity on a forward (0o) and side light scattering (90o) mode. Phycocyanate-conjugated&#xD;
      anti-human CD45 monoclonal antibodies (DAKO; Ely, UK) will be used as pan-leukocyte stain to&#xD;
      exclude non leukocyte events by logical gating. The percentage of one-color, two-color, and&#xD;
      three-color positive cells will be measured and the mean channel value as well as the&#xD;
      relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) corresponding to the antigen density wii be estimated.&#xD;
      QC-Combo Kit (FCSC; San Jun, Puerto Rico) will be used for the quantification of antibody&#xD;
      binding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normality of the numerical parameters will be tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test for nonparametric outcomes and paired t test for parametric&#xD;
      outcomes will be used for comparison of data at two different time points (at stable&#xD;
      condition and at exacerbation). Statistical software (SPSS version 11.0; SPSS; Chicago, IL)&#xD;
      will be used for analysis.&#xD;
