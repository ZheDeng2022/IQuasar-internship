  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the medical complications more prevalent during&#xD;
      pregnancy. In Canada, approximately 1% of pregnancies have complications due to a&#xD;
      pre-existing hypertension, 5-6% because of hypertension of pregnancy without proteinuria and&#xD;
      1-2% by preeclampsia. Metabolomics involves a new technology to investigate small molecules&#xD;
      that characterize biochemical pathways of interest. The change in concentration levels of&#xD;
      these molecules in various biological samples such as urine and blood in the presence of a&#xD;
      disease or a patient can be particularly useful for identifying new biomarkers. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that metabolic patterns in blood and urine of pregnant women who had&#xD;
      preeclampsia differ from the metabolomics patterns of patients without preeclampsia.The whole&#xD;
      research program has two complementary objectives in order to expect a decrease of&#xD;
      prematurity: a) better understanding of all the physiological mechanisms leading to&#xD;
      prematurity and b) better identification of patients at high risk for a better management of&#xD;
      these women.&#xD;

      Metabolomics involves a new technology using the methods of separation and detection complex&#xD;
      to investigate a set of small molecules that characterize biochemical pathways of interest.&#xD;
      The change in concentration levels of these molecules in various biological samples such as&#xD;
      urine and blood in the presence of a disease or a patient can detect metabolic fingerprints&#xD;
      that can be particularly useful for identifying new biomarkers. These will thereafter be&#xD;
      quantified and validated by metabolic profiling. To our knowledge, there are few studies on&#xD;
      metabolomics and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studied population will be women hospitalized for preeclampsia (after 20 SA). Women in&#xD;
      the control group will be matched to women hospitalized for pre-eclampsia according to&#xD;
      gestational age at diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, maternal age, parity, ethnicity and body mass&#xD;
      index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case control:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the diagnosis of preeclampsia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each blood test requested by the physician during the follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the patient will be in labor (cervix ripening &gt; 5 cm) or before the caesarean&#xD;
           section&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  48 hours after delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-8 weeks after delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the inclusion as a control in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At admission for delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the patient will be in labor (dilation &gt; 5 cm) or before the caesarean section&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  48 hours after delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-8 weeks after delivery&#xD;
