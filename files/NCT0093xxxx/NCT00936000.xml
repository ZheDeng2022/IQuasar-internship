  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol is one of the most commonly abused drugs in the world. Up to 40% of medical and&#xD;
      surgical patients have alcohol related problems, and alcohol use accounts for more than 10%&#xD;
      of U.S. health care costs. In the intensive care unit (ICU), patients with a history of&#xD;
      alcohol abuse are common where their rates of mortality and ICU-related morbidity are&#xD;
      significantly higher when compared to patients without a history of alcohol abuse. Though ICU&#xD;
      patients are a heterogeneous group, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a devastating&#xD;
      form of acute lung injury, is one of the more frequent diagnoses among these critically ill&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1996, we made the novel observation that a prior history of chronic alcohol abuse is&#xD;
      associated with an increased incidence and severity of ARDS in critically ill patients. In&#xD;
      our epidemiological studies of over 570 critically ill patients, 50% of all patients with&#xD;
      ARDS have a significant history of chronic alcohol abuse. Since ARDS affects approximately&#xD;
      150,000 patients per year in the United States, and mortality is 40-50% even in previously&#xD;
      healthy individuals, alcohol-related ARDS is an enormous national health care problem. We&#xD;
      estimate that between 15,000 and 25,000 deaths per year in the United States are associated&#xD;
      with alcohol-related ARDS, a number consistent with or even exceeding the number of deaths&#xD;
      due to many other alcohol-related diseases such as cirrhosis of the liver and alcohol-related&#xD;
      traffic accidents. Further investigations of the association between chronic alcohol abuse&#xD;
      and ARDS are needed to develop therapies that improve morbidity and mortality in this&#xD;
      important patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical syndrome of ARDS is defined as refractory hypoxemia with bilateral infiltrates&#xD;
      on chest radiograph in the absence of left atrial hypertension. Pathophysiologically, ARDS is&#xD;
      characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, increased pulmonary alveolar-capillary&#xD;
      permeability, and the subsequent accumulation of extravascular lung water. In animal models&#xD;
      of chronic alcohol abuse, we showed that chronic ethanol ingestion causes chronic oxidative&#xD;
      stress, depletes lung glutathione, impairs alveolar-capillary barrier function, and&#xD;
      exaggerates endotoxin-mediated acute lung injury. Ethanol-mediated disruption of the&#xD;
      alveolar-capillary barrier, and the associated susceptibility to acute edematous injury, is&#xD;
      modified by glutathione (GSH) replacement therapy in animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responding to NIH emphasis on studies of the mechanisms of disease and evaluation of&#xD;
      therapies in human subjects, our group has initiated translational studies that expand our&#xD;
      basic observations of the effects of chronic alcohol abuse on ARDS to the clinical setting.&#xD;
      We recently reported that lung epithelial lining fluid from individuals with a prior history&#xD;
      of chronic alcohol abuse is deficient in GSH, an essential antioxidant. The translational&#xD;
      experiments outlined in this proposal will identify alterations in the structure and function&#xD;
      of the lung in individuals with a history of chronic alcohol abuse and test a novel medical&#xD;
      therapy that may ultimately decrease the morbidity and mortality for 50,000-75,000 ARDS&#xD;
      patients with a prior history of chronic alcohol abuse per year in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose the following hypothesis that antioxidant deficiency is a cause of abnormal&#xD;
      alveolar-capillary barrier function in individuals with a history of chronic alcohol abuse,&#xD;
      and oral anti-oxidant replacement therapy will correct the abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this hypothesis can be confirmed, this work would pave the way for testing antioxidant&#xD;
      replacement as prophylaxis against acute lung injury in alcoholic patients at risk for the&#xD;
      development of ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: To determine the safety and efficacy of in vivo antioxidant replacement therapy&#xD;
      on alveolar-capillary barrier function in individuals with a history of chronic alcohol&#xD;
      abuse.&#xD;
