  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Stroke is a leading cause of death and chronic serious disability worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minocycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline, has consistently been shown in recent years to be&#xD;
      neuroprotective in animal models of brain ischemia. Furthermore, a small, open label study&#xD;
      done in humans with acute ischemic stroke published late last year showed that minocycline,&#xD;
      when administered for 5 days, within 6 to 24 hours after stroke onset was highly effective in&#xD;
      improving functional outcome even as early as 7 days after stroke onset. However, further&#xD;
      well-conducted, randomized controlled translational studies using minocycline are currently&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine if minocycline, administered within 3 to 48 hours after acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke onset is superior to placebo in reducing neurological deficit and improving&#xD;
      functional outcome at 90 days post stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators plan to do a multi-centre randomized, double-blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial in which ischemic stroke patients will be randomized to treatment with&#xD;
      either oral minocycline or placebo within 3 to 48 hours of symptom onset. The primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint will be the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score for all randomized subjects&#xD;
      at 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include improvement of the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score from&#xD;
      baseline and Barthel index at 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NeuMAST will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Minocycline, compared with placebo, when administered between 3 to 48&#xD;
      hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke improves recovery and functional outcome as&#xD;
      assessed by mRS scores on day 90 post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Minocycline compared to placebo, when administered between 3 to 48 hours after onset of&#xD;
           acute ischemic stroke improves recovery and functional outcome as assessed by&#xD;
           improvement of NIHSS score on day 90 post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Minocycline compared to placebo, when administered between 3 to 48 hours after onset of&#xD;
           acute ischemic stroke improves functional outcome as assessed by the Barthel Index (BI)&#xD;
           score on day 90 post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Minocycline, compared with placebo reduces 90 day risk of recurrent stroke, MI or death&#xD;
           when administered between 3 to 48 hours after acute ischemic stroke onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive result will have a significant impact in the management of acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      and pave the way for future studies aimed at finding the optimal dose and formulation of&#xD;
      minocycline for treating acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;

      A) Specific Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine if minocycline, administered within 3 to 48 hours of acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      onset is superior to placebo in reducing neurological deficit and improving functional&#xD;
      outcome on day 90 post stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Specific Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if minocycline administered within 3 to 48 hours of acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
           onset is superior to placebo in reducing the 90 day risk of recurrent ischemic stroke,&#xD;
           myocardial infarction (MI) and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study and compare the differential efficacy of minocycline administered as stated&#xD;
           above, on the four stroke subtypes according to TOAST criteria, i.e. lacunar stroke,&#xD;
           large vessel atherosclerosis, cardioembolic and cryptogenic stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Primary Efficacy Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is the modified Rankin scale score at 90 days for all&#xD;
      randomized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Favorable outcome at day 90 is defined as achieving an mRS score of 0 to 1. Last observation&#xD;
      carried forward (LOCF) will be used for subjects without assessments of the primary efficacy&#xD;
      variable at Day 90. Deaths will be assigned a score of 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Secondary Endpoint measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NIHSS score at day 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Difference of NIHSS scores between baseline and days 7 (plus or minus 2 days) and 90&#xD;
           post stroke. (Favorable outcome at day 90 is defined as achieving a decrease of &gt; 6&#xD;
           points on NIHSS from baseline or NIHSS &lt; 1 at day 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. mRS scores at days 7 (plus minus 2 days) and 30 post stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Barthel index at day 90. (A score of &gt; 85 is defined as good outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. First documentation during follow-up of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or death&#xD;
           from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to NNI (TTSH campus) and CGH ASU during the study&#xD;
      period who are eligible to participate in this study based on criteria stated above will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in this study. Approximately 1300 and 800 patients with acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke are admitted to NNI (TTSH campus) and CGH ASU respectively per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time window for enrolment will be within 3 to 48 hours of symptom onset. For patients who&#xD;
      are found with stroke on awakening, it will be assumed that the stroke occurred the last time&#xD;
      that the patient was known to be normal. All eligible patients will be identified by the ward&#xD;
      and on-call Neurology/Medical teams and referred to the study research assistants or&#xD;
      investigators; who will then screen the patient for participation in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assigned treatment, i.e., Minocycline 200mg or matching placebo will be administered once&#xD;
      daily for 5 consecutive days soon after informed consent is taken and the patient is enrolled&#xD;
      into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurologic deficits, global functional abilities and level of handicap will be scored&#xD;
      using the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at baseline and on day&#xD;
      7 (plus or minus 2 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 30 post-stroke, a telephone assessment with additional questions will be performed to&#xD;
      obtain the mRS score, document any recurrent stroke, MI or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 90, in addition to a neurological evaluation, mRS and NIHSS scoring, the Barthel Index&#xD;
      (BI) score, a measure of independence in activities of daily living, will be obtained for all&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
