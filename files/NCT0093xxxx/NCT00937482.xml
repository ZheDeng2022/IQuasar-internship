  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cediranib maleate when given&#xD;
      together with whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases from&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation&#xD;
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink&#xD;
      tumors. Giving cediranib maleate together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability (maximum tolerated dose, or MTD) of AZD2171 when&#xD;
      combined with WBRT in patients with brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the objective response rate (ORR) in the central nervous system (CNS),&#xD;
      neurologic progression-free survival (N-PFS), overall survival, and cause of death, and to&#xD;
      explore the vascular normalization window using serial, noninvasive imaging parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral cediranib maleate on day 1. Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy 5&#xD;
      days a week for 3 weeks beginning on day 3. Treatment continues treatment in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;

             York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
