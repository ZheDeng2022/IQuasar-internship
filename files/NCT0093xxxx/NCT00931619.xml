      Objective: To study the relative balance of GABA (A) binding potential and glutamate&#xD;
      utilization in subjects with localization-related epilepsy with and without depression,&#xD;
      subjects with major depressive disorder alone, and in subjects with generalized epilepsy&#xD;
      (expected not to have significant comorbid depression). Pilot data shows that GABA(A) binding&#xD;
      potential and glutamate utilization are tightly coupled in healthy subjects particularly in&#xD;
      the mesial temporal lobe. We hypothesize that subjects with epilepsy will not exhibit the&#xD;
      same degree of coupling, and that subjects with both epilepsy and depression will exhibit an&#xD;
      even more pronounced decoupling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Subjects aged 18-55 with localization-related epilepsy with and without&#xD;
      depression, subjects with generalized epilepsy, subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD)&#xD;
      alone, and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a neuroimaging study, using positron emission tomography (PET) with&#xD;
      [11C]flumazenil, to measure GABA(A) binding potential, and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, to&#xD;
      measure glucose utilization (reflective of neuronal glutamate release) Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy (MRS), will be used to measure GABA and glutamate in the mesial temporal cortex,&#xD;
      and corroborate the PET results. Structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) will be obtained&#xD;
      for MRS localization and partial volume correction of PET images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The binding potential of GABA(A), the regional rate of glucose metabolism,&#xD;
      and the levels of GABA and glutamate as measured by MRS. Patients will be stratified by&#xD;
      seizure type and depression ratings.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects aged between 18 and 55 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Epileptic patients must have clinically documented partial seizures, in either the&#xD;
             left or right temporal lobe, or generalized seizures with consistent EEG evidence as&#xD;
             defined by the 1981 International Classification of Epileptic Seizures, refractory to&#xD;
             standard antiepileptic treatment for at least one year. This criterion will be&#xD;
             established by preliminary screening in the NINDS CES outpatient clinic, and, where&#xD;
             previous studies are not adequate, by inpatient video-EEG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects with epilepsy must exhibit seizures not adequately controlled by&#xD;
             medication alone, despite adequate trials of multiple agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with epilepsy must currently be taking an AED which exerts its primary method of&#xD;
        action on a system other than GABA. Examples include sodium or calcium channel blockers&#xD;
        (phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, zonisamide, and ethosuximide), drugs&#xD;
        that bind to SV2A sites (levetiracetam), or drugs which bind to the alpha2delta subunit of&#xD;
        calcium channels (gabapentin and pregbalin). Patients on AEDs that have direct effects on&#xD;
        GABA and glutamate (vigabatrin, phenobarbital, benzodiazepines, tiagabine) will be&#xD;
        excluded. No subject s medication will be changed for the purpose of inclusion in this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with TLE and depression must currently meet DSM-IV criteria for the category&#xD;
             &quot;Mood disorder due to epilepsy&quot; (293.83), and the subtype &quot;with Major Depressive-Like&#xD;
             Episode&quot;, 296.2 Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, or 296.3 Major Depressive&#xD;
             Disorder, Recurrent, indicating that subjects meet diagnostic criteria for a major&#xD;
             depressive episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with MDD alone must currently meet DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive&#xD;
             Disorder, and also have either a family history of mood disorders, or a history of&#xD;
             multiple major depressive episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy control subjects who do not meet criteria for any DSM-IV axis I psychiatric&#xD;
             disorder, and have no family history (in first degree relatives) of a mood or anxiety&#xD;
             disorder will also be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to give written informed consent prior to participation in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with major medical or neurological disorders (besides TLE or generalized&#xD;
             epileptiform disorder) expected to influence cerebral blood flow or morphology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with epilepsy taking any medications (other than antiepileptic drugs) that&#xD;
             may affect cerebral blood flow, GABA or glutamate neurotransmission, or metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with epilepsy taking AED s known to exert direct effects on GABA or&#xD;
             glutamate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with epilepsy with depression who have taken anti-depressant drugs within 2&#xD;
             weeks of the study (4 weeks for fluoxetine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically healthy depressed subjects who have taken any drugs, including&#xD;
             anti-depressants, expected to influence cerebral blood flow, metabolism, or morphology&#xD;
             within 2 weeks of the study (4 weeks for fluoxetine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy subjects who are taking any medications expected to influence cerebral blood&#xD;
             flow, metabolism, or morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy subjects must be free from a personal history of seizure disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In order to exclude subjects at-risk for the development of a mood disorder, healthy&#xD;
             control subjects must be free from either a personal or family history (first-degree&#xD;
             relatives) of Axis I psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of drug or alcohol abuse within one year, or a lifetime&#xD;
             history of alcohol or drug dependence (DSM-IV criteria). Subjects who consume an&#xD;
             excessive amount of alcohol (more than 7 drinks per week for women, more than 14&#xD;
             drinks per week for men) will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with structural lesions visible on MRI, excluding mesial temporal sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with suicidal ideation, or a past history of suicide attempts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with psychotic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects in whom MRI is contraindicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are lactating or pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an IQ of less than 80 will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
