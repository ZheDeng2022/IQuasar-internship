      The Eustachian tube is a tube that connects the back of the nose with the ear. Its job is to&#xD;
      keep the pressure on the inside of the eardrum close to the pressure outside the eardrum, so&#xD;
      that the eardrum can vibrate properly. Usually this tube is closed, but it opens briefly&#xD;
      during swallowing. In the condition called patulous eustachian tube, this tube is open all&#xD;
      the time. This is a benign condition but it can be very bothersome to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction is about 0.3-6.6% of the population.&#xD;
      However, about 15% of the people who have this condition are bothered enough by it that they&#xD;
      seek medical attention. This condition is more common in females than males and is more&#xD;
      common in adults than children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the common symptoms of patulous eustachian tube can include roaring tinnitus&#xD;
      synchronous with nasal respiration, audible respiratory sounds, sensation of a plugged ear&#xD;
      and fluctuating aural fullness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases the cause is idiopathic. Some predisposing factors include weight loss,&#xD;
      stress,anxiety,fatigue, pregnancy, and temporomandibular joint syndrome. It can also be&#xD;
      caused by adhesions in the nasopharynx following surgery on the adenoids. Sometimes it can be&#xD;
      associated with medications such as diuretics and oral contraceptives. Neuromuscular&#xD;
      disorders that cause atrophy such as multiple sclerosis, stroke and motor neuron disease have&#xD;
      also been postulated to cause patulous eustachian tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to learn more about the condition and help us learn about how&#xD;
      the eardrum might be treated to prevent it vibrating with sounds or noises coming up the&#xD;
      Eustachian tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study will consist of a questionnaire to help to further define the&#xD;
      symptoms of patulous eustachian tube, and to measure how severe these symptoms are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are few treatments that are satisfactory for patients. Common surgical&#xD;
      therapies include injections of various substances into the Eustachian tube opening including&#xD;
      paraffin, Teflon,or gelfoam. Unfortunately, these methods are either temporary or have lead&#xD;
      to serious complications including cerebral thrombosis and death (due to inadvertent&#xD;
      injection into the carotid artery). Other treatments have focused on cauterizing the&#xD;
      Eustachian tube opening but these have been either unsatisfactory or caused damage to the&#xD;
      trigeminal nerve. Myringotomy and insertion of a ventilation tube has helped some patients&#xD;
      but others have found that this increased the patient's discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have been treating patients recently by placing some putty like clay&#xD;
      material on the eardrum, which stops it vibrating so much with the patient's own voice, and&#xD;
      this appears to be quite effective for many patients. It is also easily removed if the&#xD;
      patient does not find it helpful. However, the investigators do not really have a good idea&#xD;
      of exactly which patients are helped by this, and which are not, and just how much their&#xD;
      symptoms are helped, as well as how long the treatment helps them for.&#xD;

      incidence of patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction is about 0.3-6.6% of the population.&#xD;
      However, about 15% of the people who have this condition are bothered enough by it that they&#xD;
      seek medical attention. This condition is more common in females than males and is more&#xD;
      common in adults than children.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the common symptoms of patulous eustachian tube can include roaring tinnitus&#xD;
      synchronous with nasal respiration, audible respiratory sounds, sensation of a plugged ear&#xD;
      and fluctuating aural fullness.&#xD;

      disorders that cause atrophy such as multiple sclerosis, stroke and motor neuron disease have&#xD;
      also been postulated to cause patulous eustachian tube.1 -2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to learn more about the condition and help us learn about how&#xD;
      the eardrum might be treated to prevent it vibrating with sounds or noises coming up the&#xD;
      Eustachian tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study will consist of a questionnaire to help to further define the&#xD;
      symptoms of patulous eustachian tube, and to measure how severe these symptoms are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are few treatments that are satisfactory for patients. Common surgical&#xD;
      therapies include injections of various substances into the Eustachian tube opening including&#xD;
      paraffin, Teflon,or gelfoam. Unfortunately, these methods are either temporary or have lead&#xD;

      trigeminal nerve. Myringotomy and insertion of a ventilation tube has helped some patients&#xD;
      but others have found that this increased the patient's discomfort.3-4&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have been treating patients recently by placing some putty like clay material on the&#xD;
      eardrum, which stops it vibrating so much with the patient's own voice, and this appears to&#xD;
      be quite effective for many patients. It is also easily removed if the patient does not find&#xD;
      it helpful. However, we do not really have a good idea of exactly which patients are helped&#xD;
      by this, and which are not, and just how much their symptoms are helped, as well as how long&#xD;
      the treatment helps them for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have not found any permanent hearing loss from putting the putty on the eardrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be approximately twenty patients in total. The absolute number will depend on the&#xD;
      number of patients that present with patulous eustachian tube and agree to participate. All&#xD;
      patients will have been referred to our clinic from other otolaryngologists for treatment of&#xD;
      this particular problem. These patients will be selected if they meet the diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      for patulous eustachian tube. There will be no exclusion criteria based on age or gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan There will be no randomization procedure, as all patients will receive&#xD;
      treatment for their condition. The investigators will not be blinded, as they are the only&#xD;
      ones able to perform the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to follow up in clinic as per his regular visit protocol. They are&#xD;
      usually booked for four-month follow up appointments. If they have concerns they will be&#xD;
      asked to call and book an appointment for an earlier date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no laboratory testing. The amount of clay to be used is the amount to cover the&#xD;
      size of a dime. If there are any concerns or adverse reactions to treatment the patient will&#xD;
      have the treatment stopped. The clay or steristrip will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Data The data will be compiled and sent to a member of the statistics department&#xD;
      at Dalhousie University. All identifying data will be removed. The pre-treatment values will&#xD;
      then be compared to post treatment values to see if a statistical significance exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality All data will kept in a locked filing cabinet and office for 25 years, and&#xD;
      only research staff will have access to it. The data will be analyzed using various computer&#xD;
      programs, such as Gaitview 2002, Microsoft Office programs, and SPSS for statistical&#xD;
      analysis. The data on these programs will only be available to research staff via a secure&#xD;
      password. Names of patients will only be available to research staff, and numerical codes&#xD;
      will be used in any presentations or publications of the data. The research team will collect&#xD;
      and use only the information they need to judge the safety and usefulness of the study. This&#xD;
      information will only be used for the purposes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only Dr.Bance and Dr.Bartlett will have access to the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms There are very few risks to this trial. It is generally a well-tolerated procedure. The&#xD;
      biggest risk is failure of the procedure. It does not work for everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laser measurements of the eardrum are without risk. This laser does not damage tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Putting the steri-strip or clay weight on the eardrum may carry about a 1 in 300 risk of a&#xD;
      small puncture to the eardrum. Of these, over 95% heal up by themselves, but some may need to&#xD;
      be repaired. This, however, is currently our preferred first line treatment for patulous&#xD;
      Eustachian tube currently anyway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no financial incentive to join the trial. The major benefit will be a potential&#xD;
      resolution of the symptoms of patulous eustachian tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The societal benefits are an easy safe treatment for this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial Compensation&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no financial compensation for anyone involved in this trial. This includes&#xD;
      participants and researchers.&#xD;
