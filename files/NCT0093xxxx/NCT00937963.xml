    <textblock>
      Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a molecule that consists of two fatty acid chains bound by ester&#xD;
      links to a glycerol molecule, in the form of 1,2 and 1,3 structural isomers. Approximately&#xD;
      10% of the edible oils on today's market are comprised from DAG. DAG oil has a similar taste,&#xD;
      appearance, and fatty acid composition as conventional triacylglycerol oil (TAG; consists of&#xD;
      3 fatty acids chains bound to a glycerol molecule), yet recent studies suggest that due to&#xD;
      its different chemical structure, DAG oil may induce cardiovascular (CV) benefits.&#xD;
      Specifically, human studies in the United States (US) and Japan have shown that long-term&#xD;
      consumption of a diet containing DAG oil enhances loss of body weight and body fat compared&#xD;
      with TAG oil of similar fatty acid composition. In postprandial studies, serum triglycerides&#xD;
      (TG) and remnant like particle cholesterol concentrations, have shown to be lower following&#xD;
      ingestion of DAG-enriched oil compared to conventional dietary oil (e.g., soybean, corn), or&#xD;
      TAG oil. Therefore, DAG oil appears to be effective for preventing postprandial&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, which is a risk factor for arteriosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis that the investigators propose in this pilot study is that intake of DAG oil,&#xD;
      compared to TAG oil will result in a lower LDL-C, and lower LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, as well as a&#xD;
      reduction in TG levels. Given the significance of such findings, if confirmed, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate other important clinical biomarkers for chronic disease (CV&#xD;
      Disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome), such as insulin sensitivity and inflammation&#xD;
      [as determined by C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 &amp; tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-alpha (TNF-α)], which also may be beneficially affected by consumption of the palm DAG&#xD;
      oil. During the pilot study, the investigators will reserve serum/plasma samples so that&#xD;
      these additional assays may be run upon approval of the modification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Commonly consumed vegetable fats and oils are comprised predominantly of TAG, and small&#xD;
      amounts of DAG and monoacylglycerol. TAG consists of 3 fatty acid ester, whereas&#xD;
      diacylglycerol oil has 2 fatty acid esters linked to a glycerol backbone. Recently, Watanabe&#xD;
      et al., developed a process by which the ratio of glycerides found in plant oils such as&#xD;
      soybean, canola (rapeseed), or corn can be shifted from TAG to DAG, leading to the formation&#xD;
      of oil composed largely of DAG. Commercially, DAG oil is produced by esterification of fatty&#xD;
      acids derived from natural edible plant oils in the presence of lipase enzyme. Commercially&#xD;
      produced vegetable DAG oil contains &gt;80% DAG, &lt;20% TAG, &lt;5% monoacylglycerols, and small&#xD;
      amounts of emulsifiers and antioxidants to maintain quality. The main constituent fatty acids&#xD;
      of DAG oil are oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic (C18:3) acids, present as 1,3-&#xD;
      and 1,2 (or 2,3)-DAGs in a ratio of 7:3, respectively. These structural differences may be&#xD;
      responsible for the purported metabolic effects of DAG compared to TAG oil, DAG oil has fewer&#xD;
      fatty acids than TAG, and DAG-oil with a greater proportion of DAG in the sn-1,3 versus&#xD;
      sn-1,2 form may be more readily oxidized. Thus, the effects of DAG oil on increasing LDL-C&#xD;
      would be expected to be less than TAG oil.&#xD;
