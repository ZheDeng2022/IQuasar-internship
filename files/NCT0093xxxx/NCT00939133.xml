  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of topical retinoids is a mainstay and basis of early acne treatment to prevent the&#xD;
      progression to inflammatory lesions. Post oral isotretinoin, it is not uncommon for&#xD;
      non-inflammatory papules and comedones to recur. However, there has been no formal study to&#xD;
      look at the prevention of recurrence of these acne lesions post isotretinoin in a long term&#xD;
      basis. This may enhance the therapeutic options for post isotretinoin patients in order to&#xD;
      prevent recurrence of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Tretinoin microsphere 0.04% will prevent recurrence of acne lesions.&#xD;

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to study product or vehicle. Subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to each group by an unblinded dispenser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be 24 weeks with visits at baseline (week 0), week 4, week 8, week 16&#xD;
      and week 24. All study products will be administered once daily for 24 weeks. Subjects will&#xD;
      apply a sufficient amount of study product to cover the entire face.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must fulfill all of the following criteria to be eligible for study admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males aged between 18 and 45 years old who have successfully completed a treatment of&#xD;
             acne with oral isotretinoin (Min 4 months/Maximum 6 months with an average of 5 months&#xD;
             and a total of 120-150mg/kg/course).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Who can attend scheduled study follow-up visits at the outpatient dermatology clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to informed consent for participation in a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to comply with the treatment and follow up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who receive isotretinoin for condition other than acne vulgaris.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been off isotretinoin for less than 30 days or more than 90 days at&#xD;
             the time of enrollment of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have used prescription topical acne treatment (tretinoin, benzoyl&#xD;
             peroxide, topical antibiotics or any combination products) between the end of therapy&#xD;
             of isotretinoin within 2 weeks of study enrollment or oral antibiotics of any type&#xD;
             between the end of therapy of isotretinoin within 4 weeks of study enrollment and&#xD;
             throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been previously diagnosed with an endocrinological disorder likely&#xD;
             to cause acne such as genital/adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal tumors or any other hypo&#xD;
             androgenetic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are using any of the systemic medications likely to cause or abate acne&#xD;
             such as oral Dilantin or any other epileptic, Finasteride, Spironolactone or&#xD;
             Flutamine, testosterone or dietary body-building protein powders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any nodulo-cystic lesions at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Used topical corticosteroids on the face or systemic corticosteroids within the past 4&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Are currently using any medication that in the opinion of the investigator may affect&#xD;
             the action or evaluation of the study product or place the subject at undue risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Used abradants, facials, peels containing glycolic or other acids; masks, washes, or&#xD;
             soaps containing BPO, salicylic acid, or sulfacetamide sodium; non-mild facial&#xD;
             cleansers; moisturizers that contain retinol, salicylic acid, or α- or β-hydroxy acids&#xD;
             within the past 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plan to use medications that are reported to exacerbate acne (e.g., mega-doses of&#xD;

             haloperidol, halogens [e.g., iodide and bromide], lithium, hydantoin, and&#xD;
             phenobarbital), because these may impact efficacy assessments. Subjects who plan to&#xD;
             use multivitamins, iron supplements and folate are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had a facial procedure (such as chemical or laser peel, microdermabrasion, blue light&#xD;
             treatment, etc) performed by an esthetician, beautician, physician, nurse, or other&#xD;
             practitioner, within the past 4 weeks or if it is planned to be performed during the&#xD;
             conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known hypersensitivity or have had previous allergic reaction to any of the&#xD;
             active components or excipients of the study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Used any investigational therapy within the past 4 weeks, or currently participating&#xD;
             in another clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are currently abusing drugs or alcohol (drug screening not required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a significant medical history of being immunocompromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have other conditions that, in the judgment of the investigator, would put the subject&#xD;
             at unacceptable risk for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had any major illness within 30 days before the screening examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently are employees of R Vender, an investigator, or contract research&#xD;
             organization (CRO) involved in the study, or an immediate family member (partner,&#xD;
             offspring, parents, siblings or sibling's offspring) of an employee involved in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
