      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of single doses of&#xD;
      compound 1278863A in subjects with renal impairment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compound 1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through&#xD;
      inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs). This compound is&#xD;
      being developed for the treatment of anemia. This study, PHI112843, will be the first&#xD;
      administration of 1278863A to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and/or&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of single oral doses of 50 mg and 150 mg in pre-dialysis subjects with&#xD;
      moderate or severe renal impairment and 150 mg in hemodialysis-dependent subjects. Four to&#xD;
      eight subjects will complete each dose cohort. Multiple blood samples for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and/or pharmacodynamic analyses will be obtained post-dose in each cohort. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed by measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, collection of adverse event&#xD;
      assessments and laboratory safety tests.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A male or female is eligible to enroll and participate in this study if he/she:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  (Part 1) has Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment (equivalent to NKF KDOQI Stage 3&#xD;
                  or 4, not receiving dialysis) as determined by estimated Glomerular Filtration&#xD;
                  Rate (eGFR) calculated by the abbreviated MDRD equation, OR has Normal Renal&#xD;
                  Function determined by creatinine clearance (CLCR) via the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
                  equation, using serum creatinine and demographic data, obtained at Screening.&#xD;
                  Subjects with Normal Renal Function should have no greater than trace blood or&#xD;
                  protein on Screening urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  (Part 2) has severe renal impairment (end-stage renal failure) and has been on&#xD;
                  stable hemodialysis treatment (three times weekly) for 3 months prior to&#xD;
                  Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  otherwise healthy or considered clinically stable with respect to underlying&#xD;
                  renal impairment as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based&#xD;
                  on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
                  laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has clinical laboratory test results that are considered clinically stable in the&#xD;
                  opinion of the Principal Investigator, especially if the clinical abnormality or&#xD;
                  laboratory parameter is deemed associated with the subject's underlying renal&#xD;
                  impairment. A normal subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
                  outside the reference range may be included only if the Investigator and the&#xD;
                  Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk&#xD;
                  factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal&#xD;
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous&#xD;
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is&#xD;
             confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal&#xD;
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods described&#xD;
             in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they&#xD;
             must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the&#xD;
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage&#xD;
             of HRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT&#xD;
             during the study without use of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the&#xD;
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug until completion of the Follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and BMI within the range 17 - 33 kg/m2&#xD;
             (inclusive).&#xD;

          6. AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated&#xD;
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin&#xD;
             &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. These&#xD;
             can be based on single ECG value or average of triplicate values obtained over brief&#xD;
             recording period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;

             interfere with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility include cholecystectomy,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal bypass surgery, partial or total gastrectomy, small bowel resection,&#xD;
             vagotomy, malabsorption, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac sprue.&#xD;
