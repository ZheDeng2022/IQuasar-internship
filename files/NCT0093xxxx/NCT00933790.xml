  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acquired Rifampicin Resistance has emerged as an important issue in the treatment of HIV-TB&#xD;
      patients. It has not been a major problem in HIV-negative individuals treated for TB treated&#xD;
      with standard intermittent regimens. The study would generate data on the efficacy of daily&#xD;
      and thrice weekly regimen of ATT in pulmonary TB patients with HIV in the presence of highly&#xD;
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Not many trials have compared sputum conversion and&#xD;
      adverse drug reaction between daily and intermittent regimens of ATT in HIV positive&#xD;
      patients. This study provides a unique opportunity for comparison of daily and intermittent&#xD;
      therapy for HIV patients with pulmonary TB looking into multiple dimensions of HIV-TB&#xD;
      treatment namely efficacy, drug resistance, toxicity , drug interaction and immune&#xD;
      reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The primary outcome of the study is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of three anti-TB regimens in a) reducing bacteriological failures and b) decreasing&#xD;
      the emergence of Acquired Rifampicin Resistance (ARR). The secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      unfavourable responses (clinical failures, deaths, relapses) as whole, treatment emergent&#xD;
      adverse drug reactions, pharmacokinetic levels of ATT and incidence of immune reconstitution&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV positive patients (regardless of ART status) with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB attending&#xD;
      the TRC clinics at Chennai, Madurai and Vellore will form the study group. Those who fulfill&#xD;
      the clinical inclusion criteria will be evaluated for eligibility to the study after signing&#xD;
      a screening consent form. Patients willing to participate in the study will undergo the&#xD;
      following investigations namely, sputum examination, chest x-ray, liver and renal function&#xD;
      tests. Hematological investigations will include CBC, CD4 and viral load, done periodically&#xD;
      at baseline, end of intensive phase of ATT, at the end of TB treatment and once in 6 months&#xD;
      during follow-up period of 1 year. Patients getting enrolled in Chennai and its subcentres&#xD;
      will also be evaluated for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome through additional&#xD;
      laboratory investigations. If the patients satisfy the inclusion criteria, a house visit will&#xD;
      be done by the social worker to ascertain the facts regarding living condition and&#xD;
      domiciliary stability and if continues to remain suitable , will be enrolled into the study&#xD;
      after a written, signed and dated informed study consent form. All eligible patients,&#xD;
      enrolled into the study, will be randomized to receive one of the three regimens mentioned&#xD;
      below. Patients who are ART na√Øve will be referred to National AIDS Control Organization&#xD;
      (NACO) ART centres for assessment and eligibility for procurement of ART according to&#xD;
      National guidelines Common opportunistic infections that could occur during study period will&#xD;
      be managed according to standard NACO guidelines. Cotrimaxozole DS One tablet once a day will&#xD;
      be given to all patients with CD4 &lt; 250 along with multivitamins, unless contraindicated.&#xD;
      They will be discharged from the study once their 18th month sputum culture is negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimens and Dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen 1. Daily - 2EHRZ7/4HR7 (E 800 mg ,H 300 mg, R 450/600 mg depending on Weight &lt;&#xD;
           60, 600 mg for 60 kg and more, Z 1500 mg daily)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen 2. Part Daily - 2EHRZ7/4HR3 (E 800 mg ,H 300 mg, R 450/600 mg depending on&#xD;
           Weight &lt;60, 600mg for 60 kg and more, Z 1500 mg daily in the intensive phase followed by&#xD;
           H-600 mg ,R-450/600 mg in the continuation phase thrice weekly)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen 3. Intermittent - 2EHRZ3/4HR3 (E 1200mg, H 600 mg, R 450/600 mg depending on&#xD;
           Weight &lt; 60, 600 mg for 60 kg and more, Z 1500 mg given thrice weekly)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification and randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified based on a) baseline CD4 i) of less than 150 and ii) more than&#xD;
      150 and b) sputum smear grading i) of 0 ,1+ and ii) 2+ , 3+ and randomized to receive one of&#xD;
      the three regimens mentioned above, for a period of 6 months, using restricted block scheme.&#xD;
      The treatment assignment list will be generated before the start of trial and sequentially&#xD;
      numbered sealed opaque envelopes, containing the treatment assigned will be prepared&#xD;
      independently in Chennai and Madurai. Assignment of patients to regimens will be done by the&#xD;
      study statistician who has no link with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that a daily and a part daily regimen has a 95% resistance- free survival and an&#xD;
      intermittent regimen has a 80% resistance free survival during the treatment period, taking&#xD;
      into account 20% loss due to death, default and other causes, with a power of 80% and an&#xD;
      error of 5%, the sample size was calculated to be 140 per arm (420 cases totally).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan Both the efficacy analysis and intent to treat analysis will be undertaken. The&#xD;
      primary approach will be intent to treat analysis (ITT) accounting for all patients&#xD;
      randomized to study regimen and considering drop outs, deaths and defaulters as unfavourable&#xD;
      outcomes. However, Primary MDR -TB will be excluded as an unfavourable response from the ITT&#xD;
      analysis despite allocation to study regimen. Efficacy analysis will include only patients&#xD;
      who had consumed at least 80 % of the scheduled therapy of ATT. Patients who die within 15&#xD;
      days of starting ATT, and NON-TB deaths during assessment and treatment will not be&#xD;
      considered for the efficacy analysis of ATT. Patients who have died during treatment and&#xD;
      their cultures grow M.Tb retrospectively will be included as bacteriological failures taking&#xD;
      the first event as the outcome. Kaplan Meier survival curves will be constructed and&#xD;
      comparison will be done using Log-rank test. To identify the important co-variates in&#xD;
      relation to response and toxicity, Cox-regression model will be used. Frailty model will be&#xD;
      used to account for individual heterogeneity.&#xD;
