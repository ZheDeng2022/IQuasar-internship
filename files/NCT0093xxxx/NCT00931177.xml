      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Validity; Objective 2: Reliability; Objective 3: To obtain preliminary data in&#xD;
      determining the effectiveness of the Dehydration Scoring System in predicting resource&#xD;
      utilization and disposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective study of patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with&#xD;
      clinical signs of dehydration. All previously healthy children aged 1 month (mo) up to 16&#xD;
      years of (yo) age with vomiting, diarrhea, or poor oral (PO) intake from presumed&#xD;
      gastroenteritis will be eligible for inclusion after obtaining informed consent and assent if&#xD;
      applicable. Exclusion criteria will include a history of cardiac or renal disease, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (DM), malnutrition or failure to thrive (FTT), and any malabsorptive disorder or&#xD;
      short gut syndrome . Children will further be excluded if they are clinically unstable,&#xD;
      requiring immediate life saving interventions or if no parent or legal guardian is available&#xD;
      for consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon obtaining informed consent, a data sheet will be started to gather study weights,&#xD;
      dehydration scores at specified intervals, patient demographics and key clinical findings, as&#xD;
      well as resource utilization (none, oral rehydration therapy (ORT), intravenous (IV) therapy,&#xD;
      observation status, admission to the hospital). Information regarding whether the patients&#xD;
      have received the rotavirus vaccine and how many doses will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of standard of care, patients will be weighed using either a single infant or&#xD;
      pediatric scale located in triage at presentation to the Pediatric ED (PED) (Time 0) (age&#xD;
      appropriate infant scale versus standing stadiometer in Triage). Infants will be weighed&#xD;
      naked and older children in a hospital gown. Change in weight at discharge or follow up&#xD;
      (f/u), compared to baseline is an adequate measure of dehydration that has been used&#xD;
      standardly in studies of this nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency department nurses will obtain a dehydration score when the patient is transferred&#xD;
      to a treatment room (time 0). Prior to initiation of treatment, and as close to the nurse's&#xD;
      Dehydration Score as is possible, a clinician (Faculty, fellow, nurse practitioner or&#xD;
      physician assistant) will also score the patient as they arrive into the treatment area prior&#xD;
      to initiation of treatment. Clinicians will be masked to the initial Dehydration Score as&#xD;
      scored by the nurse. Subjects will continue to receive Dehydration Scores every hour after&#xD;
      the initiation of treatment until a disposition has been determined (i.e. discharge home or&#xD;
      admit to hospital) (Times T1,2,3â€¦). At discharge, or at time decision to admit has been made,&#xD;
      the children will be weighed on the same scale as initially used. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      return in 1 week (+/- 3 days) for wellness (dehydration) score, repeat weight (same scale),&#xD;
      and further continuation of historical and physical examination findings. Research or&#xD;
      clinical nurse will obtain the final follow-up Dehydration Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: The validity of the scale, in comparison to the gold standard of change in&#xD;
      weight, will be assessed by comparing the ratio of the change in dehydration score (discharge&#xD;
      minus baseline) to the ratio change in weight (discharge minus baseline) for all subjects. A&#xD;
      comparison will also be made between the ratio change in score and ratio change in weight&#xD;
      using the measurements at follow-up. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient will be&#xD;
      estimated for both comparisons. This method of measuring correlation is preferred over&#xD;
      Pearson's correlation coefficient, which is limited to estimating the degree of linearity&#xD;
      between the two tests and not the accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Repeatability of the Dehydration Scale by different raters (nurse and clinician&#xD;
      at baseline) will be tested by obtaining a concordance correlation coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Correlation between Dehydration Score and resource utilization/disposition&#xD;
      outcomes. We will characterize the mean dehydration scores across treatments (i.e. resource&#xD;
      utilization), and roughly identify cut-points (natural or by clinical significance) and&#xD;
      estimate predictive values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: The primary aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the validity of&#xD;
      the dehydration scale compared to the gold standard of change in weight. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the correlation of the two measures will produce a correlation of at least 0.95,&#xD;
      exceeding the 0.75 cut-off to demonstrate an 'excellent' correlation. To detect this&#xD;
      difference at 80% power (alpha=0.05), 54 subjects will be sufficient. Assuming a significant&#xD;
      loss to follow-up at one week (~40-50%), a total of 100 subjects will be targeted for&#xD;
      enrollment to ensure that 54 subjects are available to test the hypothesis of a correlation&#xD;
      between change in score and weight at follow-up. This estimated sample size will further be&#xD;
      sufficient to evaluate interobserver reliability and obtain a concordance correlation&#xD;
      coefficient.&#xD;
