    <textblock>
      This study focuses on new therapies for a challenging disease in pituitary medicine, that of&#xD;
      aggressive pituitary tumors which have limited therapeutic options beyond standard surgical,&#xD;
      radiotherapy, and select medical therapies, each incurring significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, and each not optimally effective. To improve this gap in knowledge, we seek to&#xD;
      translate findings from the laboratory into clinical practice and hone in on therapies&#xD;
      directed at pituitary molecular targets, namely ErbB receptors. We have shown that human&#xD;
      prolactinomas express nuclear EGFR and membranous ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4, and expression&#xD;
      correlates with tumor invasion. Pituitary tumor cell lines transfected with EGFR and ErbB2&#xD;
      translated to downstream effects on prolactin (PRL) gene expression and secretion,as well as&#xD;
      cell proliferation. Animal models implanted with these cell lines developed larger tumors and&#xD;
      PRL elevations. Treatment with ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) led to regression of&#xD;
      tumors xenografted into these animals and attenuated PRL secretion. Primary culture of human&#xD;
      prolactinomas confirmed expression of ErbB receptors and inhibitory effects of TKIs on PRL&#xD;
      secretion and cell proliferation. Based on these exciting preliminary data, the objective of&#xD;
      this new proposal is to conduct a Phase IIa clinical trial as a trenchant test of our&#xD;
      translational hypothesis that tyrosine kinase inhibition constitutes highly effective&#xD;
      targeted biologic therapy for these hitherto refractory pituitary adenomas. Specifically, our&#xD;
      aims are to test the: 1) efficacy of TKI therapy with a clinical trial; 2) threshold level of&#xD;
      tumor receptor expression to achieve TKI clinical response. Nineteen subjects will be treated&#xD;
      with lapatinib for 6 months in combination with their current dopamine agonist therapy, with&#xD;
      monthly measurements of PRL levels and MRI imaging every 3 months to evaluate the primary&#xD;
      endpoints of achieving 40% reduction in tumor size and 50% reduction in PRL and secondary&#xD;
      endpoints of radiologic stabilization and/or reduction and PRL normalization. Mean ErbB&#xD;
      receptor protein expression will be compared between responders to lapatinib and&#xD;
      non-responders by immunohistochemistry in pituitary tumor samples of these subjects collected&#xD;
      from prior surgeries.&#xD;

      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug Lapatinib has been shown to inhibit both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and&#xD;
      erbB2 tyrosine kinases resulting in an effective slowing of disease progression in breast&#xD;
      cancer. It has also been demonstrated that erbB is overexpressed in human pituitary adenomas.&#xD;
      The investigators are therefore assessing tumor size stabilization and pituitary tumor&#xD;
      secretory profiles during the course of a six month therapy of lapatinib. The purpose of this&#xD;
      trial will be to estimate the activity of lapatinib in slowing the growth rate of pituitary&#xD;
      tumors. Lapatinib is an FDA approved drug used to treat breast cancer. However, in this&#xD;
      study, the drug will be used to treat pituitary cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit patients from the Pituitary Center at CSMC who are over the age of 18&#xD;
      that have a recurrent nonfunctioning adenoma after at least one surgical resection as well as&#xD;
      patients with prolactinomas who are resistant to dopamine agonist therapy and patients with&#xD;
      recurrent Cushing's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT'S JOURNEY THROUGH THE RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator (PI) or co-investigator will determine patients' potential&#xD;
      eligibility for the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI or the co-investigator will then approach subjects with recurrent nonfunctioning&#xD;
      adenomas or prolactinomas resistant to dopamine agonist therapy or recurrent Cushing's&#xD;
      disease during a visit in the clinic office and ask if these subjects would be interested in&#xD;
      participating in this study. If the subjects express interest, they will be given the consent&#xD;
      form to review. They will be encouraged to review it with family, friends, and/or other&#xD;
      physicians. The PI, co-investigators, or research nurse will be available for any questions&#xD;
      the subjects might have. If the subjects are still interested, they will be asked to sign and&#xD;
      return the consent form to the office and a study visit will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI, co-investigator, or member of study staff may also attempt to contact current&#xD;
      patients by phone to assess interest in participating in the study. The purpose and overall&#xD;
      structure of the study will be discussed with the possible participant. They will be reminded&#xD;
      that the study is strictly voluntary and that their involvement or disinterest in the study&#xD;
      will not affect their ongoing care. If the patient is interested they will be mailed a&#xD;
      consent to review and will be asked to call the center to schedule an appointment to further&#xD;
      discuss the study if they decide they are interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo 8 visits of the course of the study. Each participant will have&#xD;
      a baseline visit where a medical history will be taken, a physical, visual field test,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), and blood draw will be performed. At this&#xD;
      point lapatinib therapy will begin and the patients will be asked to take the drug daily for&#xD;
      the next six months. Patients will take Lapatinib 1250 mg daily (orally), which is the&#xD;
      standardized dose used to treat breast cancer patients. Visit 2 will be 1 month after the&#xD;
      participant has started lapatinib. At visit 2 all participants will receive a physical exam,&#xD;
      a history will be taken, an ECG will be performed, and a blood draw will occur. Visit 3 will&#xD;
      be 2 months after starting lapatinib. A physical exam and history will be performed along&#xD;
      with an ECG and echocardiogram and blood draw. Visit 4 will be 3 months after starting&#xD;
      lapatinib. A physical, history, blood draw, ECG, visual field test, and a magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) of the pituitary will be performed. Visit 5 will occur 4 months after starting&#xD;
      lapatinib. A physical exam and history along with a blood draw and ECG and echocardiogram&#xD;
      will occur. Visit 6 will be 5 months after starting lapatinib. A physical exam, history, ECG,&#xD;
      and a blood draw will occur. Visit 7 will occur 6 months after the start of lapatinib. A&#xD;
      physical exam, history, blood draw, visual field test, ECG, echocardiogram and MRI of the&#xD;
      pituitary will occur. At this point lapatinib will be discontinued. Visit 8 will occur 1&#xD;
      month after visit 7 and a physical exam, history, blood draw, and ECG and and echocardiogram&#xD;
      will occur.&#xD;
