    <textblock>
      While treating depression, significant numbers respond poorly to anti-depressants; one cause&#xD;
      is vitamin B12 deficiency. The investigators are conducting an open label randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to investigate difference in response to SSRI monotherapy alone versus SSRI&#xD;
      and intramuscular B12 replacement in people with low-normal B12 levels. 300 participants will&#xD;
      be allocated to each arm of intervention at out patient clinics of the department of&#xD;
      Psychiatry at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi Pakistan. Baseline and 3 month&#xD;
      measurement of depression will be on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Urdu version) and&#xD;
      response rates compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin B12 plays an important role in DNA synthesis and neurological function. Its&#xD;
      deficiency is associated with hematological, neurological and psychiatric manifestations of&#xD;
      which the latter include irritability, personality change, depression, dementia and rarely,&#xD;
      psychosis. Recent literature has seen links between this vitamin and depression. High B12&#xD;
      levels in serum are associated with good treatment response, high homocysteine levels are&#xD;
      common in folate / B12 deficiency and in those suffering from depression.&#xD;
      Hyperhomocysteinemia may have direct effects on neurotransmitters implicated in depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized trials have shown folate and other nutritional supplementations are strategies of&#xD;
      atleast significant effect in treating treatment-resistant depression. Folate deficiency has&#xD;
      also been linked with delay in treatment response as well as relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date no trial from Pakistan compares anti-depressant monotherapy with B12 augmentation in&#xD;
      a population showing poor or partial response to first drug trial. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      compare clinical response of SSRI-monotherapy with that of B12-augmentation in a sample of&#xD;
      depressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare reduction in depression of patients with low normal B12 levels on SSRI monotherapy&#xD;
      with patients on a combination of SSRI and Vitamin B12 supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis There will be higher response rate among patients who will be treated with&#xD;
      combined SSRI therapy and B12 supplementation as compared to those who will be treated with&#xD;
      SSRI alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational Definitions Depression: Patients scoring ≥ 16 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating&#xD;
      Scale for Depression-Urdu version (HAM-D) 24, 25 Low B12 level : (&lt;300 pg/ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design open label Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting of the Study Out patient clinics of the department of Psychiatry at Aga Khan&#xD;
      University Hospital, Karachi Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration 12 months after approval of protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation A total of 232 patients equally divided into two groups will achieve&#xD;
      90 percent power, 5 percent level of significance using one sided hypothesis and an&#xD;
      anticipated difference in the response rate of 20 percent in the two groups with 30 percent&#xD;
      response rate among SSRI group and atleast 50% in the combination treatment group.&#xD;
      Considering 15 percent drop out in each group an additional sample of 36 patients equally&#xD;
      divided into two groups will be recruited to make a total required sample of 268 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore sample size required for each arm would be 134.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      268 consecutive patients - who fulfill the inclusion criteria given below - presenting to&#xD;
      physicians at the PAMH Clinic will be recruited after informed consent. Consequently, 134&#xD;
      would be randomized to SSRI-monotherapy group and B12 augmentation group each&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited at outpatient clinic of AKUH from among those who have received a&#xD;
      diagnosis of major depressive disorder by a qualified psychiatrist there. After this they&#xD;
      will be explained the research study in a simple language and will be registered after the&#xD;
      informed consent. At this point a unique ID will be assigned to them which will be in the&#xD;
      form of an alpha numeric code and attached to each of these ID will be a computer number&#xD;
      which is obtained from a number series used for similar trials The research officer then will&#xD;
      administer an Urdu version of the HAM-D scale. A blood sample of each participant will be&#xD;
      drawn by a phlebotomist at Aga Khan University Hospital clinical laboratory. Cold chain will&#xD;
      be maintained throughout. Those who will be fulfilling the eligibility criteria will then be&#xD;
      recruited to the study. After recruitment these numbers will be randomized to the two arms of&#xD;
      the study by the computer itself. The procedure will be performed by a data entry operator&#xD;
      who will have no affiliation with the research team and will be hired on per diem basis for&#xD;
      this purpose only. Final recruitment may take place in the next visit after the B12 levels&#xD;
      are back. The entire process will be monitored by the research officer who will be supervised&#xD;
      by a consultant psychiatrist at AKUH clinic who is also principal investigators. The research&#xD;
      officer as well as the supervisor will be blind to the arm allocation and will know only&#xD;
      codes such as Arms A and B. Participants in the monotherapy arm will only receive the SSRI.&#xD;
      Those in B12 arm will concomitantly be administered B12 intramuscular injectable as 1000 mcg&#xD;
      every week for 06 weeks . HAM-D scoring will be monitored at baseline and 12 weeks after the&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also be blind to the group assignment but will not be blind to the&#xD;
      outcome assessment.The injectables will be picked up by the research officer or the patient&#xD;
      from the main pharmacy AKUH or any designated pharmacy outlet within AKUH campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse effects on oral medications and injections (B12 or placebo) will be monitored and&#xD;
      documented on a progress sheet in patient folder and treated according to the guidelines and&#xD;
      standard of care. In case of an unfortunate rare event such as anaphylactic shock the patient&#xD;
      will be managed according to the AKUH protocol. A crash cart will be available at the clinic&#xD;
      all the time. The registered nurse is always present at the clinic who is ACLS certified&#xD;
      Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) 24, 25 is a 21-item, multiple-choice questionnaire&#xD;
      that screens for severity of depression. Available in several languages, Urdu version has&#xD;
      been translated but not clinically validated25. Therefore a pilot study will be conducted on&#xD;
      10% of sample size in the target population and compared with diagnosis on psychiatric&#xD;
      interview along DSM-IV criteria for depression (gold standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The items comprise of cardinal and biological symptoms of depression in the first 17 items,&#xD;
      with 3 further questions to rule out paranoia and obsessions. A score of ≥ 16 on the first&#xD;
      17-items correlates with clinical depression.&#xD;
