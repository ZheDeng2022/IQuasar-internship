      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic intra-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is proposed when potentially curative therapy&#xD;
      (eg. surgical resection, percutaneous ablation)is no longer possible. Prospective and&#xD;
      non-randomized retrospective studies showed TACE to be capable to increase survival vs&#xD;
      controls. In 2002 the first results of two RCTs were published which had been conducted on&#xD;
      unresectable HCC patients, designed to assess the impact produced by TACE on survival,&#xD;
      demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in TACE treated patients compared to&#xD;
      controls. The same results have been confirmed by a meta-analysis conducted on 14 trials&#xD;
      published in literature. The limitations of TACE are represented however by the difficulties&#xD;
      in obtaining a complete necrosis of the lesion treated and for this reason new embolization&#xD;
      agents are being developed to increase the efficacy of TACE in HCC as the microsphere, in&#xD;
      poly vinyl alcohol and co-acrylic acid that are not reabsorbable and induce permanent&#xD;
      embolization. The first experimental studies using microsphere showed the good tolerability&#xD;
      and the higher rate of tumor necrosis, but no RCTs have been conducted to investigate their&#xD;
      impact on survival. Objectives. The primary aim of this study is to compare 2 years survival&#xD;
      of patients randomized to selective traditional TACE or selective TACE via microspheres&#xD;
      loaded with Doxorubicin. Secondary objectives investigate the time to progression of disease&#xD;
      (radiologic and symptomatic) by radiologic, laboratory tests and the QoL questionnaire&#xD;
      administration. Methods. This is a multicentre, randomized, open-label, active controlled&#xD;
      study in HCC patients treated with standard TACE vs TACE with doxorubicin - loaded&#xD;
      microsphere. The study comprises a selection period, a treatment period and a follow up phase&#xD;
      with a total duration of 2 years from randomization. Expected results. The sample size(alfa&#xD;
      5%, power 80%) is adequate to detect a 20% difference between TACE with microsphere vs&#xD;
      traditional TACE.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent malignancies in man. Liver&#xD;
      transplantation, surgical resection and percutaneous ablation (alcoholization and thermal&#xD;
      ablation) are curative therapies and can be used only in patients presenting with early phase&#xD;
      disease, whereas 50-70% of HCC diagnoses are made when the disease has already reached the&#xD;
      intermediate-advanced phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For HCC for which potentially curative therapy is no longer possible, palliative treatment&#xD;
      has been proposed by hepatic intra-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) consisting of an&#xD;
      infusion of cisplatin or doxorubicin emulsified with lipiodol, followed by a transient flow&#xD;
      blockage achieved by reabsorbable particles (gelatin sponge particles). The rationale for the&#xD;
      intra-arterial administration of chemotherapy agents in association with embolization&#xD;
      material lies in the presence of double hepatic vascularization: hepatocytes are mainly&#xD;
      vascularized by the portal structure (approximately 90%) whereas malignant cells are&#xD;
      vascularized by the arterial structure (approximately 90%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective and non-randomized retrospective studies showed TACE to be capable of increasing&#xD;
      survival (60-88% at one year, 30-60% at 2 years and 18-50% at 3 years) versus controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these encouraging results, none of the first six RCT studies investigating TACE&#xD;
      showed a significant increase of survival but only a decrease in tumor dimension. These&#xD;
      trials however included mainly large tumors, in patients with severe liver disease, and these&#xD;
      conditions may well have masked the benefits offered by TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2002 the first results of two RCTs were published which had been conducted on unresectable&#xD;
      HCC patients, designed to assess the impact producted by TACE on survival, and which&#xD;
      demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in TACE-treated patients compared to&#xD;
      controls: survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 82%, 63%, and 29%, respectively, in the TACE arm&#xD;
      versus 63%, 27%, and 17%, respectively, in the control group of the Llovet study, and&#xD;
      survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 57%, 31%, and 26%, respectively, in the TACE arm versus&#xD;
      32%, 11%, and 3%, respectively, the control group of the study conducted by Lo. Both studies&#xD;
      confirmed that TACE was a safe procedure, with a low complication rate and that incidence of&#xD;
      liver failure had not increased by a significant percentage in the TACE-treated group. A&#xD;
      recent, systematic meta-analysis conducted on 14 trials published in literature,&#xD;
      appropriately chosen to compare effects on survival exerted by TACE compared to the&#xD;
      conservative treatment with tamoxifen confirmed the aforesaid findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The limitations of TACE are represented however by the difficulties in obtaining a complete&#xD;
      necrosis of the lesions treated, and for this reason new embolization agents are being&#xD;
      developed to increase the therapeutic efficacy of chemoembolization in HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such newly developed materials include the increasingly interesting expansible, high&#xD;
      biocompatibility microspheres in poly(vinyl alcohol and co-acrylic acid) with the following&#xD;
      novel features capable of enhancing anticancer effects: 1) they are not reabsorbable, and&#xD;
      induce permanent embolization; 2) being deformable they adapt to the morphology of the&#xD;
      vessels to be embolized, and selectively target cancerous arterial capillaries: 3) they&#xD;
      deliver greater quantities of chemotherapy agent, minimizing systemic effects thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first experimental studies on the use of microspheres in HCC patients showed that such&#xD;
      therapy is well tolerated and causes a higher rate of necrosis compared to standard TACE, but&#xD;
      as of today, no RCTs have been conducted to investigate their impact on survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study design: This is a multicentre, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study in HCC&#xD;
      patients treated with standard chemoembolization versus chemoembolization with&#xD;
      doxorubicin-loaded microspheres. The study comprises a selection phase, a treatment period&#xD;
      and a follow-up period, with a total duration of 2 years from randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening phase laboratory tests and diagnostic imagings (Ultrasound/CAT scan/MRI)&#xD;
      will be performed (as indicated in the inclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study population: The study population will be composed of 214 inpatients presenting with&#xD;
      HCC, 107 per each randomization arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study treatments: Both arms will receive chemotherapy (epirubicin or doxorubicin) via&#xD;
      hepatic intra-arterial delivery + intra-arterial chemoembolization of the study arterial&#xD;
      branches to be treated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: chemoembolization by standard technique: epirubicin (maximum dose of 75 mg) conjugated&#xD;
      with an oil-based contrast medium (Lipiodol) at the maximum dose of 15 ml + gelatin sponge&#xD;
      particles (particles of transient embolization material, required to obstruct the treated&#xD;
      vessel)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: chemoembolization with microspheres: doxorubicin (maximum dose of 75 mg x vials of&#xD;
      microspheres) loaded with non-reabsorbable microspheres (sulfate hydrospheres) at the dose of&#xD;
      2 ml per vial (definitive embolization). The chemotherapy agent is released over a 14-day&#xD;
      period, with a concentration peak in the tumor at 72 hours from treatment, and tumor&#xD;
      concentration which is 100-fold that achieved by traditional intra-arterial injection. Half&#xD;
      life of the drug is about 10 times longer than traditional TACE, with a systemic&#xD;
      concentration of the drug which is 100 times less than that observed with standard TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a rule the procedure is performed once per each HCC lesion treated, since the microspheres&#xD;
      exert definitive chemoembolization action; any repeated treatment on the same nodule is&#xD;
      possible only whem the presence of partial persistence of vascularization is observed during&#xD;
      the imaging assessment during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Assignment to treatment: At visit 1, a unique alphanumeric identification code will be&#xD;
      assigned to eligible patients. Codes which have been assigned to patient who then discontinue&#xD;
      participation cannot be thereafter reassigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of two study&#xD;
      treatments. Patient assignment to treatment is performed based on the randomization list, and&#xD;
      by allocating the first and lowest randomization code available. The randomization list will&#xD;
      be generated by the Pharmacy - Investigational Drug Service - of the coordinating center and&#xD;
      the relevant part thereof will be sent to the investigational sites The information relating&#xD;
      to the randomization list are is strictly confidential and may be accessed only by authorized&#xD;
      persons and the data concerning the study will be entered into the database at the time of&#xD;
      the follow-up visits. An interim assessment of global survival is foreseen to occur once 50%&#xD;
      of patients and the data relating to their first follow-up visit have been included into the&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Discontinuation of treatment: Each patient fully maintains the right to discontinue his/her&#xD;
      participation in the study at any given time; moreover, should it be considered to be of&#xD;
      benefit for his/her health, he/she may be withdrawn from the study by the physicians in&#xD;
      charge of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Visits and assessment: The monthly visits (V1, V2 and V3) may be postponed by 7 days. The&#xD;
      three-monthly visits (V4 and Vn) may be brought forward/postponed by 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Selection visit: Before initiating any study specific procedure, the investigator must&#xD;
      obtain the written informed consent from the patient, Screening evaluations include&#xD;
      laboratory tests, a physical examination, a pregnancy test for women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential. In case results should be available for such exams which were performed within one&#xD;
      month previously they do not have to be repeated. Evaluations will be recorded in the CRF at&#xD;
      the Visit 1 page only if the patient is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Creatinine 2. Bilirubin 3. GPT 4. Albumin 5. Hemoglobin 6. WBC 7. PLT 8. PT&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of the treatment will be assessed at V3 and at V4 and Vn by means of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. visit and completion of the attached questionnaires, or in case the patient cannot come&#xD;
           for the visit, by means of a telephone interview&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the above-listed laboratory tests to assess evaluation of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. abdominal CAT scan or MRi to asses radiological evaluation of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. α-fetoprotein to assess biohumoral levels of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
           SAFETY EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation of safety of the treatment will consist in monitoring and recording adverse&#xD;
           events, serious adverse events, laboratory tests and measurement of vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Information relating to all of the adverse events, those reported spontaneously by the&#xD;
           subject and those identified by the Investigator pursuant to specific questions, as well&#xD;
           as those identified through the physical examination of the patient, laboratory tests or&#xD;
           other, will be collected, recorded on the CRF and followed as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Serious Adverse Events: Information concerning all serious adverse events will be&#xD;
           collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event reporting form. So as to guarantee&#xD;
           patient safety, all serious adverse events must be notified to the Ethics Committee&#xD;
           within 24 hours from the time they have come to the knowledge of the Investigator, by&#xD;
           means of the specific SAE form.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Contact persons:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse events must be reported to the Principal Investigator and notified to the Ethics&#xD;
           Committee Telephone and fax numbers of the contact persons for notification of Serious&#xD;
           Adverse Events and Pregnancies are listed in the 'Investigator Folder provided to each&#xD;
           site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Data management: Personnel appointed by the Investigator must record the information&#xD;
           required by the protocol on the Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data contained in the CRF will be data entered centrally by personnel appointed&#xD;
           thereto by the Clinical Principal Investigator by single data entry and electronic&#xD;
           verification of data. Any text elements (eg, comments) will be verified manually. Data&#xD;
           entries will subsequently be controlled by validation programs and listing controls.&#xD;
           Obvious errors will be corrected directly by data management personnel, other errors or&#xD;
           omissions will instead be recorded on Data Query forms which will be sent to the&#xD;
           Investigators for resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Information relating to concomitant treatments will be codified based on the WHO Drug&#xD;
           Reference List, which makes use of the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)&#xD;
           classification. Concomitant diseases and adverse events will be codified using the ICD9&#xD;
           classification terminology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The database will be closed once it has been confirmed to be complete and accurate. Any&#xD;
           changes made to the data after database lock may be performed solely if agreed to in&#xD;
           writing by the Principal Investigator, the Statistician, the authors of the protocol and&#xD;
           the collaborators appointed thereby to complete CRF and the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Statistical methods: This study intends to assess efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
           chemoembolization with microspheres versus chemoembolization by standard technique. The&#xD;
           data collected will be grouped and summarized against demographic variables, baseline&#xD;
           characteristics and efficacy and safety assessment. Exploratory analyses will be carried&#xD;
           out using descriptive statistics. The data will be presented both on the&#xD;
           &quot;intent-to-treat&quot; population (in other words, all the patients who have completed the&#xD;
           study without any major protocol violations, such as for instance performance of&#xD;
           alternative treatments for hepatocarcinoma or unjustified refusal to continue the study&#xD;
           and undergo monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
           An interim evaluation to assess overall survival will be carried out once 50% of the&#xD;
           patients foreseen have been enrolled and the data relating to the first follow-up visit&#xD;
           have been entered into the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety evaluations will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events, including&#xD;
           all of the serious adverse events. Adverse events will be summarized presenting per each&#xD;
           treatment group the number and percentage of patients who have presented any adverse&#xD;
           event whatever, an adverse event in a specific body system and a specific adverse event.&#xD;
           Any other information collected (i.e., the severity or correlation with the study drug)&#xD;
           will be codified as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Moreover, analytical lists will be drafted illustrating details concerning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients who have discontinued the study and correlated reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients who have discontinued the study due to adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. patients who have experienced serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Characteristics of data sets, treatments and concomitant diseases:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data relating to demographics and baseline characteristics, and regarding efficacy and&#xD;
           safety observations and parameters will be summarized, as will likewise be done for the&#xD;
           main concomitant diseases recorded upon inclusion into the study. Listings will be&#xD;
           created for patients who discontinue the study and will describe the reasons therefore.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Efficacy evaluation: Primary variable The primary efficacy evaluation will be carried&#xD;
           out on the ITT population (intention to treat) comprised of all randomized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary efficacy variable is represented by survival at Month 24 (favorable event).&#xD;
           According the the ITT protocol, mortality by Month 24 and withdrawal from the study will&#xD;
           be considered to be unfavorable events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Frequency of events will be recorded for both treatment groups and the comparison will&#xD;
           be carried out by means of Fisher's exact test. Evaluation will be performed of the&#xD;
           primary endpoint stratified per sex, age (median value), Child-Pugh class (A, B),&#xD;
           alpha-fetoprotein (median values).&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Efficacy evaluation: Secondary variables Secondary efficacy variables will be assessed&#xD;
           both as per ITT (intent to treat population) and PPP (per protocol population)&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary variables will be described using: frequencies, mean values, standard&#xD;
           deviations, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), ranges and interquartile intervals in&#xD;
           accordance with the type of variable taken into consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Continuous secondary variables will be assessed by means of variance analysis (ANOVA)&#xD;
           using designs which are appropriate for the investigational protocol (by repeated&#xD;
           measures for between-subject factors, two-way classification in case of stratified&#xD;
           analyses, etc.) An estimate of effects assessed will also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary ordinal or nominal variables will be analyzed by non-parametric methods&#xD;
           (Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, Fisher, McNemar, chi-squared tests, and by Mantel-Haenszel&#xD;
           linear association).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Finally, univariate and multivariate procedures will be applied by logistic analyses to&#xD;
           assess both the effect of any interactions and to determine independence of significant&#xD;
           factors detected by prior analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical evaluations will be carried out by SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
           Sciences: version 13.0 for Windows). Two-tailed probability value with three significant&#xD;
           digits will be computed; any values below 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
           significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Safety evaluation: The safety analysis will be performed on the &quot;Safety population&quot;,&#xD;
           comprised of all patients included into the study and receiving chemoembolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse events will be summarized indicating number and percentage of patients with all&#xD;
           types of events, classified per body system and per preferred term. The other&#xD;
           information collected (eg. severity, causal correlation) will be listed as well as&#xD;
           patients experiencing serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Moreover, a listing will be created of patients who have experienced adverse events and&#xD;
           who have discontinued the study due to adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory test values will be summarized in appropriate tables showing frequency of&#xD;
           values belong a predefined interval. Values representing relevant abnormalities will be&#xD;
           listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other safety data (eg. electrocardiograms, vital signs and specific examinations) will&#xD;
           be assessed as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Sample size: The study was designed to demonstrate superiority of the effect of&#xD;
           chemoembolization with microspheres versus standard chemoembolization on survival&#xD;
           recorded 24 months after randomization (increase of survival by 20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In particular, a 60% survival rate is expected in the chemoembolization with&#xD;
           microspheres arm versus an expected survival rate of 40% in the group receiving standard&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It has been calculated that to detect a 20% difference between the two types of&#xD;
           treatment, with an 80% power and a 5% significance level,a total number of 214 patients,&#xD;
           107 per treatment arm, must be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample size was calculated by the &quot;Power calculator, UCLA Department of Statistics&quot;&#xD;
           software, applying Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES&#xD;

           consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Archiving of documentation: The Investigator is responsible for archiving and storage&#xD;
           of the essential documents of the study, prior to and throughout study conduction and&#xD;
           after completion or interruption of the study itself, in accordance with and for the&#xD;
           time period established by the provisions of existing applicable laws and by GCP rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data collected on the CRF will be rigorously anonymous and the subject will be&#xD;
           identified solely by a number and his/her initials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Investigator must store the original data of patients (for instance, demographics&#xD;
           and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms etc.) and a copy of the&#xD;
           signed written informed consent. Prior to the initiation of the study, it may be&#xD;
           established that certain data be recorded directly on the CRF, which in this case will&#xD;
           be considered as a source document.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Inspections/Audits: The Principal Investigator or personnel appointed may perform&#xD;
           verifications throughout the study to ensure that the study is being conducted in&#xD;
           accordance with the protocol and with the provisions of existing applicable laws. Also&#xD;
           Regulatory Authorities may conduct inspections on the study (both throughout its&#xD;
           conduction or after completion of the study). Should a Regulatory Authority require an&#xD;
           inspection, the Investigator must promptly notify the Ethics Committee thereof. By&#xD;
           signing the protocol, the Investigator agrees to allows audits to be conducted both by&#xD;
           appointed personnel and inspections by Regulatory Authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Management of the investigational Medical Device: The investigational device&#xD;
           (microspheres) will be provided by the Pharmacy in the marketed packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Investigator must ensure that it is used in conformity with the protocol. The&#xD;
           Investigator and/or the pharmacist or another person competent therefore will be&#xD;
           responsible for the storage of the product in a secure place, with limited access,&#xD;
           maintaining in accordance with the storage conditions shown on the package.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Publication of results: Each formal presentation or publication of the data deriving&#xD;
           from this study must be considered as a publication authored by the Investigator and by&#xD;
           the professionals involved in the spontaneous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Privacy and Confidentiality: Documents pertaining to the study (eg. protocol, CRF and&#xD;
           others) must be stored in a secure place to guarantee maintenance of confidentiality and&#xD;
           privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Study discontinuation: The party proposing the spontaneous study reserve the faculty&#xD;
           to interrupt the study in case, throughout conduction thereof, and based on the results&#xD;
           obtained by the interim analysis, conclusions should be reached not justifying the&#xD;
           continuation of the study itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Contact persons: Telephone and fax numbers of the contact persons (i.e., the party&#xD;
           proposing the spontaneous study and his/her collaborators) are listed in the&#xD;
           'Investigator Folder provided to each site.&#xD;
