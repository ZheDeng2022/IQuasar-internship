      The purpose of this study is to determine if high-dose cyclophosphamide followed by a&#xD;
      maintenance dose of glatiramer acetate is safe in patients with relapsing remitting multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS). The investigators hypothesize that institution of glatiramer acetate&#xD;
      treatment following high-dose cyclophosphamide treatment will extend the period of disease&#xD;
      free activity and further reduce the disability in patients with relapsing remitting multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis. The investigators plan to investigate the properties of glatiramer acetate against&#xD;
      the recurrence of MS disease activity following high dose cyclophosphamide induced cessation&#xD;
      detectable autoimmunity. The investigators hypothesize that glatiramer acetate, given in the&#xD;
      phase of immune reconstitution after high-dose cyclophosphamide, may bias the immune system&#xD;
      to a more tolerated state, thus leading to more stable and potentially permanent remissions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by progressive immune-mediated&#xD;
      destruction of myelin and axons within the CNS. Despite the development, approval and&#xD;
      clinical utilization of several medicines for patients with MS, most patients continue to&#xD;
      accrue progressive disability. High-dose cyclophosphamide is chemotherapy treatment option&#xD;
      for severe, refractory, immune-mediated illnesses such as MS. There is growing evidence that&#xD;
      high dose cyclophosphamide is well tolerated and effective in MS. Our experience with 9&#xD;
      patients who underwent treatment at the Johns Hopkins Hospital yielded impressive results&#xD;
      with a significant 40% reduction in baseline disability and an 81% reduction in MRI&#xD;
      gadolinium enhancing lesions. Five out of 9 patients had recurrence of new brain MRI lesions&#xD;
      during 24 months of follow-up, recurring in 4 patients during the first year of follow-up.&#xD;
      Our findings suggest that high-dose cyclophosphamide holds promise in inducing remission and&#xD;
      reducing disability in relapsing remitting MS however the recurrence of MS disease activity&#xD;
      (evidenced by worsening disability, clinical exacerbations or ongoing MRI evidence of new&#xD;
      lesions) suggests that high-dose cyclophosphamide given as a treatment on its own, is not&#xD;
      sufficient to induce long-term remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glatiramer acetate has been shown to be a more general suppressor of autoimmune disease,&#xD;
      inhibiting the onset of experimental animal models of uveoretinitis, rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      immune rejection of grafts against host and host against graft disease, and inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease. Glatiramer acetate was originally developed based on the observation that it&#xD;
      inhibited the onset of clinical disease in an animal model of multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Glatiramer acetate suppression of EAE was&#xD;
      found to be a general phenomenon not restricted to a particular species, disease type or&#xD;
      encephalitogen used for the induction of EAE. A unique feature of glatiramer acetate is its&#xD;
      promiscuous binding with high affinity to various class II MHC molecules and it potent&#xD;
      induction of Th2 regulatory T cells. Moreover glatiramer acetate has subsequently been shown&#xD;
      to be a more general suppressor of autoimmune disease, inhibiting the onset of experimental&#xD;
      uveoretinitis, immune rejection of grafts against host and host against graft disease, and&#xD;
      experimental inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to investigate the properties of glatiramer acetate against the recurrence of MS&#xD;
      disease activity following high dose cyclophosphamide induced cessation detectable&#xD;
      autoimmunity. This study is a prospective, open-label two-year follow-up study in 12 patients&#xD;
      with relapsing-remitting MS who are unable to tolerate or have failed to optimally respond to&#xD;
      conventional therapy and are at high risk of disease progression and loss of function.&#xD;
      Patients who elect to enter the study will be given a single course of high-dose,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide regimen without transplantation. Patients will then receive 20 mg of&#xD;
      glatiramer acetate subcutaneously 4 to 6 weeks after the last dose of high-dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, to allow the immune system to have time to begin to reconstitute without&#xD;
      glatiramer acetate but still provide sufficient time for glatiramer acetate to vaccinate&#xD;
      against recurrence of MS disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this pilot study will be to determine if high followed by a&#xD;
      maintenance dose of glatiramer acetate is safe in this patient population. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that institution of glatiramer acetate treatment following high-dose cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      treatment will extend the period of disease free activity and further reduce the disability&#xD;
      in patients with relapsing remitting MS.&#xD;
