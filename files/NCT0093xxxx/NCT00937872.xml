    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the absolute bioavailability of SRT2104&#xD;
      as a 250 mg suspension, and to define the intravenous pharmacokinetics of SRT2104.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the potential systemic metabolite burden&#xD;
      of SRT2104, and to provide plasma and urine samples for subsequent metabolite profiling and&#xD;
      identification.&#xD;

      This will be a single centre, combined IV and oral single dose, open-label study in healthy&#xD;
      male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive the following formulations on a single study day:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Regimen A: A single 10 mL oral dose of 250 mg SRT2104 delivered as a suspension&#xD;
           formulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Regimen B: A single intravenous dose of 10 mL containing 100 µg (not more than 250 nCi,&#xD;
           9.25 kBq) Carbon-14 radio-labeled SRT2104 , administered by IV infusion over 15 minutes,&#xD;
           starting 2 hours and 45 minutes after the oral dose.&#xD;
