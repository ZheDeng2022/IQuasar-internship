  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of TTP607 that&#xD;
      can be given to patients with a solid tumor or lymphoma. The safety of TTP607 will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will also do pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of TTP607. PK testing measures the&#xD;
      amount of a drug in the body at different time points.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TTP607 is designed to work by blocking the action of certain enzymes (proteins) in the blood&#xD;
      that are responsible for abnormal growth of cancer cells. This may cause the cancer cells to&#xD;
      eventually die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level Assignment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be enrolled in a group&#xD;
      of 3-6 participants. The dose you receive will be based on when you join this study (on how&#xD;
      many participants have been enrolled before you, and on the safety data that is available at&#xD;
      that time). The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose of TTP607. Each new&#xD;
      group of participants will receive the next highest dose of the study drug, as long as no&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur. This process will continue until the highest tolerable dose&#xD;
      of TTP607 is reached. Once the highest tolerable dose is found, 12 additional participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled and treated at that dose, so that researchers can learn more about the&#xD;
      effects of the study drug on the tumor. Both you and your study doctor will know what dose of&#xD;
      the study drug you are receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive TTP607 by central venous catheter (CVC or&#xD;
      central venous line). There are several types of central venous catheters. Each type of&#xD;
      catheter is a flexible, long, thin tube that is inserted through a vein, under a local&#xD;
      anesthetic, through a small cut in your chest (near your heart). Some chemotherapy drugs are&#xD;
      not suitable to be given into the veins in your hand or arm, so these drugs must be given&#xD;
      into a larger vein. The CVC may also be used for drawing blood samples that are needed&#xD;
      regularly. Using the CVC for these blood draws will lower the need for repeated blood draws&#xD;
      from your arm. TTP607 will be given over 1-4 hours depending on the dose you receive, each&#xD;
      day for 5 days in a row, followed by a 10-day &quot;rest period&quot; (no study drug). This 15 days is&#xD;
      considered 1 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;

      2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, urine will be collected immediately before the infusion and within 3 hours, between&#xD;

      You will continue on this study, as long as the study doctor thinks it is safe to continue,&#xD;
      the cancer does not get worse, and if no intolerable side effects occur. If you continue on&#xD;
      to further cycles, you will be on the same study drug schedule and will have the same&#xD;
      tests/procedures for study visits, though they may be performed less often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn and urine collected for routine tests.&#xD;

&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. TTP607 is not FDA approved or commercially available. At&#xD;
      this time, it is being used for research purposes only. Up to 40 patients will take part in&#xD;
      this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
