      This will be the first clinical trial to include a strategy designed to enhance the function&#xD;
      of autologous progenitor cells by overexpressing eNOS, and the first to use combination gene&#xD;
      and cell therapy for the treatment of cardiac disease.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite the widespread use of pharmacological and/or interventional reperfusion&#xD;
           therapies, recovery of cardiac function in myocardial infarction patients is often&#xD;
           modest or in some cases absent. Unlike classical re-perfusion therapies, which must be&#xD;
           delivered before irreversible cardiac damage has occurred, the use of progenitor cells&#xD;
           could potentially restore functional tissue in regions that otherwise would form only&#xD;
           scar. A number of clinical trials have been performed, mainly using autologous bone&#xD;
           marrow cells, and these suggest a significant albeit modest improvement in cardiac&#xD;
           function post MI. However, a major limitation of autologous cell therapy in patients&#xD;
           with cardiovascular disease is the deleterious influence of age and other cardiac risk&#xD;
           factors on progenitor cell activity, which may limit greatly the potential efficacy of&#xD;
           this promising approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Enhanced Angiogenic Cell Therapy - Acute Myocardial Infarction (ENACT-AMI) trial is&#xD;
           a Canadian, 5-center, phase IIb, double-blind, parallel, randomized placebo controlled&#xD;
           trial assessing the safety and efficacy of cell and gene therapy for patients with&#xD;
           moderate to large anterior STEMI and who have undergone re-vascularization with stent&#xD;
           implantation to the infarct related artery (IRA). The anticipated recruitment target is&#xD;
           100 patients over a two-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consenting participants who qualify during the screening process, will undergo&#xD;
           apheresis. Randomization, through a web-based system will take place immediately after&#xD;
           successful apheresis. The cell collection samples will be sent to a cell manufacturing&#xD;
           facility for manufacturing according to the treatment allocation of: a)Placebo&#xD;
           (Plasma-Lyte A &amp; 25% autologous plasma), b)EPCs or c)EPCs transfected with human&#xD;
           endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 5-7 days later, the patient will receive the randomized treatment&#xD;
           allocation via intracoronary injection into the IRA. Participants will remain in&#xD;
           hospital overnight for continuous cardiac monitoring. The first post-delivery visit will&#xD;
           take place the following morning before hospital discharge. Subsequent study visits will&#xD;
           be clinic visits at 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months after study treatment. Subsequently, a&#xD;
           registry to collect long-term safety information from telephone contacts will continue&#xD;
           annually for 10 years. During the registry period, participants will be allowed to&#xD;
           volunteer for enrolment in other clinical trials.&#xD;
