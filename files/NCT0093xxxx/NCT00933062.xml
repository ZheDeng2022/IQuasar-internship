  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and tolerability&#xD;
      of SRT2104 following administration of single and multiple oral doses (once a day for seven&#xD;
      days) at a single dose level (2.0 g/day) to healthy male volunteers in the fed state.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, clinical study of SRT2104 administered orally; a&#xD;
      randomized, inpatient/outpatient study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      SRT2104 in healthy male volunteers. Ten (10) male subjects, aged 18-60, who fulfil the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will receive either a&#xD;
      dose of 2.0 g SRT2104 (administered as eight 250 mg capsules) or placebo on eight occasions&#xD;
      during the study; once as a single dose (study day 1) during Treatment Period 1, and once per&#xD;
      day for seven consecutive days (study days 15 to 21) during Treatment Period 2. Every&#xD;
      administration of SRT2104 will be in the fed state (i.e. within 30 minutes following the&#xD;
      start of consumption of a standard meal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to sign the informed consent form at the screening visit. If eligible&#xD;
      and willing to participate, subjects will enter into the study. Subjects will be required to&#xD;
      attend the research unit on eight separate occasions during the study, in addition to the&#xD;
      screening visit. Treatment Period 1 requires the subject to attend the unit for two&#xD;
      consecutive overnight stays (Day -1 and Day 1), after which subjects will be discharged from&#xD;
      the unit on Day 2 (following the 24 hr post-dose PK blood sample). Subjects will then be&#xD;
      required to return to the unit for PK blood samples to be obtained on Day 3 (48 hr&#xD;
      post-dose), Day 4 (72 hr post-dose) and Day 8 (168 hr post-dose). Following a washout period&#xD;
      of seven days, subjects will be required to attend the unit for Treatment Period 2, which&#xD;
      will involve eight consecutive overnight stays (Days 14 to 21), after which subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged from the unit on Day 22 (following the 24 hr post-dose PK blood sample). Subjects&#xD;
      will then be required to return to the unit for PK blood samples to be obtained on Day 23 (48&#xD;
      hr post-dose), Day 24 (72 hr post-dose) and Day 28 (168 hr post-dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomised 8:2 (active:placebo) to receive one of the following two&#xD;
      treatments for the duration of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. 2.0 g SRT2104 administered as eight 250 mg hard gelatin capsules B. Eight placebo capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
      Water will be restricted from 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour post-dose. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive SRT2104 within 30 minutes following the start of consumption of a standardized&#xD;
      non-high-fat meal (approximately 650 kcal with approximately 30% of calories derived from&#xD;
      fat). A light lunch will be provided 4 hours post-dose, an evening meal approximately 8 hours&#xD;
      post dose and a snack approximately 12 hours post dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the study on Day 28 after the 168 h PK sample has been&#xD;
      obtained, all required safety assessments have been performed, and the subject has been&#xD;
      confirmed clinically stable by the investigator/identified sub-investigator.&#xD;
