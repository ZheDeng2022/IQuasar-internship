    <textblock>
      The Lung HIV goal is to facilitate the data and specimen collection efforts of eight&#xD;
      individual HIV and pulmonary studies that operate under the direction of the NHLBI. The Lung&#xD;
      HIV study will build on existing studies to facilitate the start-up of new projects to&#xD;
      further the understanding of the relationship between pulmonary disease and HIV infection.&#xD;
      There is only one clinical trial being performed in this network at Ohio State University and&#xD;
      it will be reported here.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Men and women at the AIDS Clinical Trials Unit(ACTU) will be eligible to participate if&#xD;
        they meet four criteria: (a) 18 years of age and older; and (b) diagnosis of HIV; and (c)&#xD;
        self-reported smoking on a daily basis; and (d) provide informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons who meet one or more of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: (a)&#xD;
        persons with active psychosis or impaired mental status as judged by the clinic staff and&#xD;
        confirmed with a Mini-Mental Status Exam); (b) unable to understand spoken English; (c) age&#xD;
        less than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rationale: Persons with cognitive impairment may participate in the study if they are able&#xD;
        to provide consent and answer questionnaire questions. No reason is identified to exclude&#xD;
        persons with this characteristic. No special risks are posed to cognitively impaired&#xD;
        persons who are able to provide consent. Persons who have active psychoses or impaired&#xD;
        mental status as judged by the clinic staff and confirmed with a Mini-Mental Status Exam&#xD;
        are not able to provide informed written consent and are unlikely to benefit from the&#xD;
        treatment. These persons will be referred to appropriate mental health services and invited&#xD;
        to participate when their mental status has improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons who are unable to understand spoken English would not be able to complete the&#xD;
        assessments or benefit from the treatments. Less than 1% of the clinic population will be&#xD;
        excluded on this basis. However, persons excluded from the study on this basis will be&#xD;
        referred for standard smoking cessation treatment delivered in their native tongue. These&#xD;
        community resources may be identified through the Ohio State University Nursing Center for&#xD;
        Tobacco Intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Younger adolescents (&lt;18 years) will not be invited to participate in the study because we&#xD;
        believe that they require treatments that are qualitatively different from those designed&#xD;
        for older adolescents and adults. The treatments that will be evaluated in the proposed&#xD;
        research are well suited to older adolescents and adults, but not developmentally tailored&#xD;
        to younger adolescents. Less than 1% of the clinic population will be excluded on this&#xD;
        basis. Most HIV+ children living in Columbus, Ohio receive HIV medical care through the&#xD;
        F.A.C.E.S. outpatient clinic at Columbus Children's Hospital. Standard, age appropriate,&#xD;
        smoking cessation treatment is available through the Health and Wellness Center at Columbus&#xD;
        Children's Hospital. In the unlikely circumstance that a child &lt;18 years of age wishes to&#xD;
        participate in the proposed study, s/he will be referred to Health and Wellness Center at&#xD;
        Children's Hospital for treatment or the Ohio State University Nursing Center for Tobacco&#xD;
        Intervention for age appropriate smoking cessation community resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women may not be included as subjects. While smoking during pregnancy is an&#xD;
        important modifiable cause of poor pregnancy outcomes, little information is available on&#xD;
        the safety or efficacy of varenicline. Therefore, participants who are pregnant will be&#xD;
        excluded as subjects. Also, women who are breast-feeding will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other persons who are unable to use varenicline will be allowed to participate in the study&#xD;
        but will not receive the varenicline component of treatment. A history and physical&#xD;
        examination will be conducted as a component of the baseline evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        People that have kidney problems or undergo kidney dialysis will not take the study drug,&#xD;
        but will be given the option to take nicotine replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All persons excluded from the study will have the opportunity to receive smoking cessation&#xD;
        treatment. We will provide referrals for treatment as clinically indicated.&#xD;
