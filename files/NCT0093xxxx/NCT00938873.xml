  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a group psycho-educational treatment designed&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of recurrent depression by integrating mindfulness based meditation&#xD;
      practices with cognitive therapy techniques. MBCT comprises eight weekly two-hour group&#xD;
      sessions. Additionally, participants are required to commit to one hour per day of between&#xD;
      sessions meditative homework assignments six days per week. Existing quantitative research&#xD;
      suggest that MBCT is an effective intervention for preventing depressive relapse in patients&#xD;
      with three or more episodes of depression (Teasdale et al.2000, Ma &amp; Teasdale, 2004). The&#xD;
      focus of qualitative research has been on evaluating the acceptability of MBCT for various&#xD;
      clinical populations; participants' accounts have been positive indicating MBCT may be a&#xD;
      potential therapeutic tool for treating older adults (Graham &amp; Senthinathan, 2007), psychosis&#xD;
      (Abba, Chadwick, &amp; Stevenson, 2008), Parkinson's disease (Fitzpatrick, Simpson, &amp; Smith,&#xD;
      2010) as well as acute depression (Mason &amp; Hargreaves, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of undertaking meditative mindfulness practice in the context of MBCT have been&#xD;
      linked to changes in metacognitive processes. Two distinct multi-level information processing&#xD;
      frameworks dealing with how thoughts are processed from a metacognitive perspective have been&#xD;
      proposed: The Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS; Teasdale, 1999a, 1999b) and the Self&#xD;
      Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF; Wells, 2000) theory. The ICS framework forms a&#xD;
      rationale for meditative aspects of the MBCT programme. The S-REF model differs from the ICS&#xD;
      theory in its conceptualisation of the object or 'being' mode of metacognitive processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular daily practice of mindfulness meditation has been regarded as among the most&#xD;
      essential aspects of mindfulness programmes (Kabat-Zinn, 1990; Mason &amp; Hargreaves, 2001).&#xD;
      Existing studies, with their focus on effectiveness or acceptability of MBCT as an&#xD;
      intervention, have thus far excluded an important aspect of the course involving the&#xD;
      experience of meditative homework assignments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to&#xD;
      explore subjective accounts of the meaning of carrying out meditative homework assignments in&#xD;
      the context of a National Health Service (NHS) run MBCT course. The research questions&#xD;
      focused on the impact of meditative homework on thought processes as well as an exploration&#xD;
      of barriers and facilitating factors from a participant's perspective.Six individual in-depth&#xD;
      interviews were conducted with participants all of whom had completed the full MBCT&#xD;
      programme. Interpretive phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used as the methodology for&#xD;
      analysing interview transcripts. Data analysis began with a detailed examination of one case&#xD;
      until a thorough analysis was completed after which subsequent cases were analysed. Finally a&#xD;
      cross case analysis was carried out where individual themes were interrogated for&#xD;
      similarities and differences (Smith, et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two master themes were presented: 'The relationship of meditative homework to metacognitive&#xD;
      experience' and 'Motivating and discouraging factors for engagement in meditative practice'.&#xD;
      Results reveal a transformation in metacognitive processes as a result of undertaking&#xD;
      meditative homework. The subjective experience of metacognitive processes is examined in the&#xD;
      context of existing psychological theories including the ICS (Teasdale, 1999a, 1999b) as well&#xD;
      as the S-REF (Wells, 2000) theory involving metacognitions. A model for perceived&#xD;
      facilitating factors and difficulties experienced in carrying out meditative homework is&#xD;
      constructed based on the Integrated Theoretical Foundations Model for CBT homework assignment&#xD;
      (Kazantzis, et al., 2005). The model explores participants' motivation in three stages of the&#xD;
      homework process: firstly during assignment of the meditative homework task, secondly in&#xD;
      completing the planned task and finally carrying out review of the task in question.&#xD;
      Implications of the present study are discussed in relation to psychological literature,&#xD;
      homework assignment and the practise of MBCT.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be 18 to 65 years of age and recruited through an NHS Trust offering&#xD;
             MBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At present I am uncertain of the exact inclusion and exclusion criteria as the&#xD;
             relevant NHS trust is yet to be determined, so the guidelines recommended by Teasdale&#xD;
             et al., (2000) and Ma and Teasdale (2004) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  These authors suggest that MBCT has no significant effect on reducing the relapse&#xD;
             rates of depression in patients with â‰¤ 2 episodes of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Therefore the present study will use participants who have experienced more than three&#xD;
             episodes of depression as judged by the relevant NHS Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No restrictions are placed in terms of participants' use of antidepressant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria consists of disorders where the participant would have difficulties&#xD;
             understanding and/or applying mindfulness techniques, including current alcohol or&#xD;
             substance dependence, borderline personality disorder, organic mental disorder or&#xD;
             pervasive developmental delay, schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,&#xD;
             schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise&#xD;
             specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential participants engaging in yoga or Buddhist meditation more than twice a week&#xD;
             are excluded as these practices significantly overlap with the MBCT program.&#xD;
