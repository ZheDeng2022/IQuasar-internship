  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is widely accepted as the best index of kidney function in&#xD;
      health and disease, and accurate values are required for optimal clinical decision making and&#xD;
      in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical trials. Current recommended methods for&#xD;
      measuring GFR are expensive, cumbersome to administer and assay and requires urine collection&#xD;
      and administration of radioactive materials. The purpose of this study is to evaluate two&#xD;
      non-radioactive markers (iohexol and gadolinium) compared to urinary clearance of inulin and&#xD;
      iothalamate. The investigators hypothesize that plasma clearance of non-radioactive markers&#xD;
      will be unbiased compared to a gold standard and more precise than currently used urinary&#xD;
      clearance methods.&#xD;

      General description: The overall study procedure requires assessment of eligibility and&#xD;
      safety for inclusion in the study through a) the screening questionnaire; b) medical history,&#xD;
      which will be derived from subject and combined with a review of his/her medical record after&#xD;
      signing the consent; and c) interview, physical examination and laboratory tests from&#xD;
      screening visit if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening questionnaire: All subjects, whether they are interviewed during a clinic visit or&#xD;
      call in response to fliers, will be given the pre-screening questionnaire. This will be given&#xD;
      to people who voluntarily express interest in the study. Participants who do not disclose any&#xD;
      conditions that would exclude them from participating will be invited to a health screening&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health screening visit: The purpose of the pre-study health screening is to perform a more&#xD;
      detailed assessment than is provided in the screening questionnaire to determine if potential&#xD;
      subjects are eligible to participate in the study. A member of the research team will first&#xD;
      read the consent form with the subject, describe the health screening and study visits, and&#xD;
      answer any questions that the subject has regarding the nature of the study and/or study&#xD;
      procedures. The screening visit will consist of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reading and signing the study consent. The subject will be given a copy of the consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of information on demographics and current and past health history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ascertain participants medical history through participant interview and a review of&#xD;
           his/her medical record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical exam, which will include measuring and recording vital signs (temperature,&#xD;
           blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate), height, weight (if not documented in&#xD;
           medical record in past 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of a blood sample for laboratory testing, if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-menopausal women of child-bearing potential we will undergo a serum pregnancy test,&#xD;
           using a small amount of blood from the sample collected above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ascertainment of current and recent past medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject is a patient at Tufts Medical Center, a research team member may access the&#xD;
      potential participant's medical record after the subject has signed the consent form to&#xD;
      further screen for potential exclusion criteria, ascertain laboratory test results that are&#xD;
      necessary for determining eligibility, and confirm the medical history provided by the&#xD;
      potential participant and medication list. If the participant is not a patient at Tufts&#xD;
      Medical Center, then the research team member will obtain permission to obtain the&#xD;
      participant's medical record from his/her physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For non-pregnant women of childbearing age (pre-menopausal) who are sexually active, use of&#xD;
      an acceptable birth control method will be required for participation. They will be requested&#xD;
      to sign a statement of compliance prior to participating in the study stating that they are&#xD;
      employing one of the below-listed forms of contraception between the screening and study&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  condoms with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diaphragm with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  injectable contraceptives (Depoprovera)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  transdermal contraceptives (Ortho-Evra and Nuvaring)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  permanent sterilization (i.e. tubal ligation, vasectomy, essure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  abstinence from sexual activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oral contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study visit occurs 3 weeks or more after the health screening, the female subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a second, urine-based pregnancy test on the morning of the study visit. In&#xD;
      addition, healthy women will be required to continue employing an accepted birth control&#xD;
      method and not attempt to become pregnant for at least one month following completion of the&#xD;
      final study visit. Women with CKD will be requested to continue employing an accepted birth&#xD;
      control method for at least two months following completion of the final study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a potential subject is taking trimethoprim containing medications or cimetidine, the study&#xD;
      physician will discuss with the attending physician whether it is safe for the person to stop&#xD;
      these medications for one week prior to the study. If not, then the person will be excluded&#xD;
      from participation. If a potential subject is taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents&#xD;
      or medications that block the renin-angiotensin system, the study physician will discuss with&#xD;
      the potential participant and the attending physician whether maintenance of stable dose of&#xD;
      these medications is possible. If a change in the subject's medication regimen is required&#xD;
      immediately prior to the study visit, the subject will be rescheduled for a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility will be determined by the principal investigator or other physician&#xD;
      co-investigators based on the medical history obtained from the participant, and their&#xD;
      medical records and the results of the laboratory test that were included in the medical&#xD;
      record or obtained during the health screening visit). Eligible subjects will be contacted to&#xD;
      see if they remain interested in participating in the study. A study visit date will then be&#xD;
      scheduled. All subjects will receive a stipend for the health screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening prior to at-home dosing of KI The main concern when subjects are asked to take KI&#xD;
      on the morning prior to the study visit is the possibility that the patient is allergic to&#xD;
      iodine and will thus have a reaction to the KI in the unobserved environment at home. The&#xD;
      research team will identify subjects with known allergies in advance by screening the&#xD;
      subjects' medical records (if available) and through the health-history interview conducted&#xD;
      via telephone by the study coordinator. Subjects who are not sure if they have an iodine&#xD;
      allergy because they have not eaten shellfish or have never received contrast dye and,&#xD;
      therefore, cannot say with sureness that they are not allergic will be excluded from&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplying the KI tablet to the subject prior to the study visit The KI tablet will be&#xD;
      supplied to the study participant from 2 days to approximately 2 weeks prior to the study&#xD;
      visit. The tablet and the instruction sheet will be mailed to the subject or supplied during&#xD;
      the health screening visit at the Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC); however,&#xD;
      if the subject is a patient at the KBPC and has an appointment with their physician within&#xD;
      approximately 2 weeks of the study visit, a member of the research team may provide the KI&#xD;
      tablet and instruction sheet at the clinic visit. Otherwise, all subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      provide their mailing address during the phone interview to ensure that the tablet is sent to&#xD;
      the correct address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per the IosatTM package insert, the tablet should be stored in a dry place at room&#xD;
      temperature and out of direct sunlight. Subjects will also be instructed to keep the tablet&#xD;
      in a place where someone else cannot accidentally consume it (i.e., a child, spouse, etc).&#xD;
      These storage techniques will be conveyed to the subject in the included instructions. The&#xD;
      tablets are available individually wrapped in foil blister packs to protect them from the&#xD;
      effects of UV light, which can damage the KI. To further decrease the likelihood of damage to&#xD;
      the tablet due to improper storage or handling, all tablets will be packaged in a secondary&#xD;
      pill bottle with child-safe caps by the Tufts Medical Center pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to take the KI tablet on the morning of the day before the study&#xD;
      visit between 6:00 AM and 10:00 AM. Instructions with the tablet will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An additional warning, in bold typeface, instructing the subject to not take the tablet&#xD;
           if they even suspect that they might have an iodine allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proper administration. Per the package insert, the tablet can be consumed with water,&#xD;
           low fat milk, low fat chocolate milk, or orange juice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms of an allergic reaction and steps to take in the event that the subject&#xD;
           experiences a reaction (per the IosatTM package insert).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to listing the emergency phone number '911' on the package, the contact numbers&#xD;
      of Dr. Stevens (PI) and the study coordinator will be included in the event that the subject&#xD;
      has any questions or concerns. On the morning of the study visit, the research staff will ask&#xD;
      the subject to give verbal confirmation that they have taken the KI dose and record the&#xD;
      approximate time at which the subject took it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects taking medications that interfere with creatinine, who can safely cease taking the&#xD;
      medication, as described in the exclusion criteria, will be reminded to stop these&#xD;
      medications 1 week prior to the study visit at this time. In addition, a member of the&#xD;
      research team will contact the subject 2-3 days prior to the visit date to ensure that the&#xD;
      subject is clear on all directions and has no questions or concerns. During this call, the&#xD;
      subject will be reminded to take the KI tablet at the specified time. When possible, the&#xD;
      study personnel will also call the subject at approximately 9:00 AM on the morning of the day&#xD;
      before the study visit to ensure that the subject took the tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-diabetic subjects will be requested to fast overnight and to avoid changes in&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or medications that block the renin-angiotensin&#xD;
      system. Subjects with diabetes will be asked to eat a light breakfast the morning of the&#xD;
      study visit. Subjects will be asked to maintain adequate oral hydration and to ingest two to&#xD;
      three glasses of non-caffeinated beverages prior to arrival to facilitate the collection of a&#xD;
      baseline urine collection and an additional two to five glasses upon arrival at the CTRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival on the morning of the study visit, the nursing staff will ask the study subject&#xD;
      to provide verbal confirmation that they took the KI pill and will document and record on the&#xD;
      study flow sheet the approximate time that the subject took the tablet. If the pill was not&#xD;
      taken within the allowed time range of 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM, the subject will not be able to&#xD;
      participate in the study visit. A research team member will obtain informed consent from the&#xD;
      participant and a copy of the consent will be given to the subject. The nursing staff will&#xD;
      measure and record the subject's height, weight, blood pressure, temperature, pulse rate,&#xD;
      respiration rate; confirm that the subject has not experienced any changes in&#xD;
      physical/psychological health since the screening; and collect a baseline urine sample. As&#xD;
      outlined above, if three weeks or more has elapsed since the health screening, women of&#xD;
      childbearing age will be administered a urine pregnancy test, prior to the insertion of the&#xD;
      IV lines, using an aliquot of the baseline urine sample. The test kits used will be purchased&#xD;
      from a local pharmacy by the site principal investigator or her delegate and provided to the&#xD;
      CTRC staff. Nursing will interpret the results of the test and the principal investigator&#xD;
      will verify a negative result prior to initiation of the GFR measurement. If the test yields&#xD;
      a positive result, the study visit will be immediately terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with diabetes will be requested to bring their own testing devices. The CTRC has&#xD;
      their own testing devices if the subject forgets to bring his or her own. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to check their blood sugar upon arrival at the CTRC. If they are unable to perform the&#xD;
      measurement, the nurses will do so. The study physician will be informed of low (less 100&#xD;
      mg/dl) or high (greater than 200) blood sugars. Otherwise, the participant will follow their&#xD;
      normal routine for checking blood sugar. For example, if they check after each meal, then&#xD;
      they will be asked to do so. If they only check once a day, then they will not be asked to&#xD;
      check again. Participants will be fed breakfast and lunch and therefore there is no concern&#xD;
      for hypoglycemia over the course of the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A saline lock and intravenous line will be inserted at two different sites and two drops of&#xD;
      saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) will be administered at least 30 minutes and no&#xD;
      more than six hours prior to the administration of 125I-iothalamate to prevent uptake by the&#xD;
      thyroid. Baseline laboratory tests will include serum creatinine, cystatin C, blood urea&#xD;
      nitrogen (BUN), C-reactive protein (CRP), electrolytes and albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The markers to be administered will be prepared by a pharmacist at the Tufts Medical Center&#xD;
      Pharmacy. The pharmacist will prepare the markers such that they can be administered directly&#xD;
      by the nurse. That is, the correct dose will be placed in a syringe that can be administered&#xD;
      directly to the participant. A member of the research team will obtain the drugs and bring&#xD;
      them to the CTRC for administration by the nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collection of the baseline blood sample and a separate sample for tissue banking&#xD;
      (optional), 50 mg Inulin/kg will be administered by bolus IV, followed by a sustaining dose&#xD;
      of 18.8 mg/square area/min. Approximately 30 minutes later, 35 µCuries of 125I-iothalamate&#xD;
      will be injected subcutaneously to allow for a 60 minute equilibrium time. After a further 30&#xD;
      minutes, 5 ml of Iohexol (Omnipaque 300, 300mg/mL of organic iodine) and 10 uL/kg of Gd-DTPA&#xD;
      will be administered via a bolus IV injection through the same IV line as inulin. Iohexol&#xD;
      will be given first over 1 minute, followed by saline flush of the intravenous line, followed&#xD;
      by Gd-DTPA over one minute. Subjects with an eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, as determined from&#xD;
      their medical record or the serum creatinine measurement from the health screening, will not&#xD;
      receive Gd-DTPA. The syringes used to administer the iohexol and Gd-DTPA will be weighed to&#xD;
      the nearest tenth gram on the same scale before and after injection. Nurses at the CTRC will&#xD;
      monitor the participant at the time of the administration and throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for plasma clearance measurements will be obtained from the second IV line,&#xD;
      which will also remain in place throughout the course of the study visit. To maintain the&#xD;
      patency of the IV access for the purpose of the serial blood collections, normal saline will&#xD;
      be administered at a rate of approximately 20-30 c.c. per hour from a 500 c.c. bag of normal&#xD;
      saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of inulin will be considered time 0. Following the iohexol administration,&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken at approximately 10, 30, 120, and 240 minutes from the second&#xD;
      intravenous line. For participants with estimated GFR less than 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2, as&#xD;
      determined from the screening visit or the subject's medical record, a sample will be drawn&#xD;
      at 360 minutes. The exact time of the sample will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 180-minute timed void, all voluntary voids will be collected but the volume of&#xD;
      oral fluid intake will match the urine output (i.e. water loading to stop). The nursing staff&#xD;
      will continue to monitor fluid balance. For all urine samples, a bladder scan will be&#xD;
      conducted immediately before and immediately after the subject urinates to assess the&#xD;
      completeness of bladder emptying. Following the equilibration period for inulin (90 minutes)&#xD;
      and 125I-iothalamate (60 minutes), four timed urinary clearance periods of at least 30&#xD;
      minutes will begin. Blood samples for urinary clearance measurements will be taken following&#xD;
      each bladder emptying. Blood samples for plasma clearance measurements will be taken at&#xD;
      approximately 10, 30, 120, 150, and 240 min. For patients with estimated GFR &lt;30 mL/min per&#xD;
      1.73 m2, an additional blood sample will be collected at 360 min. Subjects are free to move&#xD;
      around during the GFR test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be fed a breakfast consisting of a standardized protein content following&#xD;
      collection of the 30 minute blood sample and a lunch of similar protein content. Subjects&#xD;
      with diabetes will be given a meal that is consistent with their treatment regimen and asked&#xD;
      to administer their medications and check their blood sugar levels during the course of the&#xD;
      study visit as they would normally do, in the manner prescribed by their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, both intravenous lines will be removed. Subjects will remain&#xD;
      at the CTRC for at least 30 minutes following removal of the IV lines. During that time,&#xD;
      nursing staff will re-measure and record the subject's vital signs (height, weight, blood&#xD;
      pressure, temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate). Upon successful completion of a study&#xD;
      visit, subjects will receive a stipend&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo repeat study visits with a target time of one month between visits. The&#xD;
      second study visit will proceed in an identical manner with the exception that urinary&#xD;
      clearance of inulin will only be measured in a subset of the study participants during the&#xD;
      second visit.&#xD;
