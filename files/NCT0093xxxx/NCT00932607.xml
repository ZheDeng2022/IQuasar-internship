      Objective of the study is to show, on an exploratory basis, that treatment with SUBLIVAC&#xD;
      Birch is also effective compared to treatment with Staloral Birch by means of reduction in&#xD;
      allergic symptoms during nasal provocation in subjects suffering from IgE mediated allergic&#xD;
      complaints triggered by birch pollen.&#xD;

    <description>Start with 1 drop daily of SUBLIVAC Birch and increase by 1 drop daily, until the maintenance dose of 5 drops is reached. This maintenance dose should then be taken daily. Or 1 puff of Staloral Birch 10 I.R./ml on day one, 2 puffs on day two and increase by 2 puffs until at day six 10 puffs are reached. At day seven 1 puff of Staloral Birch 300 I.R./ml is taken, at day eight 2 puffs and day nine 4 puffs. From then on 4 puffs daily are taken.&#xD;
Route of administration: Sublingual application. Drops (for SUBLIVAC Birch) or puffs (for Staloral Birch) are to be held underneath the tongue and then will be swallowed.&#xD;
