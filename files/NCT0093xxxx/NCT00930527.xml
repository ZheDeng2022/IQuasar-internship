  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no data regarding the use of supplements to alleviate the musculoskeletal pain and&#xD;
      stiffness inducted by the use of aromatase inhibitors. This study is designated to test the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of omega 3 fatty acid supplementation to alleviate musculoskeletal pain&#xD;
      in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      There are no data regarding the use of these supplements in other types of musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pain and discomfort, namely AI induced joint pain and joint stiffness. Given the lack of&#xD;
      effective treatments for AI induced joint pain/ stiffness and the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      omega 3 fatty acid for musculoskeletal pain, it is therefore reasonable to test the efficacy&#xD;
      of these dietary supplements in a population of postmenopausal breast cancer patients who&#xD;
      experience joint pain related to aromatase inhibitors. Since women with hormone receptor&#xD;
      positive breast cancer require long term hormonal therapy, an important objective is&#xD;
      minimizing long term side effects to enhance patient compliance and improve quality of life.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;21 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal status defined as cessation of menses for &gt;1 year or FSH &gt;20 mIU/mL or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stage I, II or III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, without&#xD;
             metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking a third-generation aromatase inhibitor for at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical symptoms of knee and/or hand joint pain and/or stiffness for at least 3&#xD;
             months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing musculoskeletal pain/stiffness in hand and/or knee joints (50 or higher on the&#xD;
             100 point global assessment VAS) that started or increased since initiating aromatase&#xD;
             inhibitor therapy, and has been present for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to refrain from use of omega-3-fatty acid from sources outside of&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If taking bisphosphonates, on a stable dose for at least 1 month and tolerating the&#xD;
             dose. Patients must agree to refrain from initiating bisphosphonate use during the&#xD;
             course of the study, therefore it is recommended that routine bone density testing be&#xD;
             performed prior to enrollment or after completing trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of omega-3-fatty acid within the past three (3) months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent medical/arthritic disease that could confound or interfere with evaluation&#xD;
             of pain or efficacy including: Inflammatory arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
             systemic lupus, spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica),&#xD;
             gout, episodes of acute monarticular arthritis clinically consistent with pseudogout,&#xD;
             Paget's disease affecting the study joint, a history of septic arthritis or avascular&#xD;
             necrosis or intra-articular fracture of the study joint, Wilson's disease,&#xD;
             hemochromatosis, alkaptonuria, or primary osteochondromatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;

             not an exclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bone fracture or surgery of the afflicted knees and/or hands within 6&#xD;

                  Randomization Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;

             at a stable dosage for at least 1 month. In addition, it should be anticipated that&#xD;
             the dose of the concomitant medication will be stable during the entire treatment&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical study with an investigational agent within the last&#xD;
             4 weeks.&#xD;
