      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      increasing oral doses of TMC435350 after single and repeated dosing, followed by an open&#xD;
      label repeated dosing session in 6 HCV genotype1 infected patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of TMC435350 after single and multiple oral doses taken by&#xD;
      healthy non-Hepatitis C Virus infected (non-HCV) participants, followed by an open label&#xD;
      repeated doses taken by 6 HCV-genotype 1 infected participants (non-placebo controlled). The&#xD;
      single dose escalation part of the trial will consist of 6 sessions (Sessions Ia to VIa) and&#xD;
      will include 2 panels of 9 healthy non-HCV infected participants each (Panels 1 and 2). The&#xD;
      dose of the test drug will be consecutively escalated. Doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400&#xD;
      mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg of TMC435350 or placebo will be administered as a single oral&#xD;
      administration alternating over the 2 panels. In each session, 6 participants will receive&#xD;
      active treatment and 3 participants will receive placebo after a breakfast. The treatment&#xD;
      schedule will ensure that over 3 sessions each particpant will receive active treatment twice&#xD;
      and placebo once. There is a washout period of at least 10 days between consecutive TMC435350&#xD;
      or placebo dosings within each panel. Participants of Panel 1 will have an additional session&#xD;
      to investigate food effect: a single dose of TMC435350 will be tested in fasted conditions&#xD;
      (Session VIIa). Food effect will be investigated for the 200 mg dose in Panel 1, unless the&#xD;
      the available concentration of the drug in the blood and safety data from previous sessions&#xD;
      prove unnecessary. Multiple dosing will be started when Sessions Ia (single dose of 50 mg),&#xD;
      IIa (single dose of 100 mg) and IIIa (single dose of 200 mg) are found to be safe and&#xD;
      tolerable. The multiple dose escalation part of the trial will consist of 4 consecutive&#xD;
      sessions (Sessions Ib to IVb) in 4 panels of 9 healthy non-HCV infected participants each&#xD;
      (Panels 3, 4, 5 and 6). In each session, 6 participants will receive active treatment and 3&#xD;
      participants will receive placebo. TMC435350 or placebo will be administered during 5&#xD;
      consecutive days. As a potential food effect is not yet known, administration will be after a&#xD;
      meal. Treatment is anticipated to be twice daily with doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 400&#xD;
      mg. The available concentration of the drug in the blood will be determined up to 72 hours&#xD;
      after the first dose, in case a single dose of TMC435350 is given (in Sessions Ia to VIIa&#xD;
      and, if performed, Session VIIIa). In case of multiple dosing (in Sessions Ib to IVb), full&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profiles of TMC435350 will be determined for the first dosage interval (e.g.&#xD;
      up to 24 hours after the first dose for a b.i.d. regimen) and up to 72 hours after the last&#xD;
      dose. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated continuously and documented (safety report),&#xD;
      with 24-hours interim PK data after the last dose, before stepping up to the next dose and&#xD;
      between each session. After completion of the healthy participant sessions, an open label&#xD;
      session (Ic) in HCV genotype 1 infected participant will be added. The trial population&#xD;
      (Panel 7) will include 6 male or female, non-responder HCV-genotype 1 infected participants&#xD;
      with an HCV viral load of at least 50000 IU/mL. These participants will be treated as Panel 7&#xD;
      with follow-up visits, after the 5 day dosing period. One dose regimen will be selected which&#xD;
      was shown to be safe in healthy participants and as close as possible to a maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose, which will be administered for 5 days. In addition to drug safety and PK parameters,&#xD;
      viral loads will be determined in plasma.&#xD;
