    <textblock>
      The objective of this NIH-specific substudy is immunologic monitoring of cytokine and immune&#xD;
      cell responses in subjects undergoing treatment with AIN457 (human monoclonal anti-human&#xD;
      interleukin-17A) for moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Recent data suggests that&#xD;
      interleukin-17 (IL-17) is an important mediator of inflammation in certain animal models of&#xD;
      Crohn's disease, and treatment aimed at blocking the IL-23-IL-17 axis can ameliorate the&#xD;
      inflammatory changes. In addition, elevated expression of IL-l7 has been found in the gut&#xD;
      tissue of patients with active Crohn's disease. This substudy will measure changes in&#xD;
      cytokine production, relevant RNA expression, and immune cell populations (in the periphery&#xD;
      and lamina propria) for correlation with clinical outcomes in order to explore the mechanisms&#xD;
      of therapeutic response.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease with major symptoms such as diarrhea&#xD;
           and abdominal pain when the disease is in an active stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIN457 is a protein developed by NOVARTIS that is used to stop the action of&#xD;
           Interleukin-17 (IL-17), a protein made by the body that contributes to many different&#xD;
           kinds of inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease. AIN457 is being developed for&#xD;
           the potential treatment of various inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
           psoriasis, but has not been tested for suitability in people with Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main objective of the NIH substudy is to obtain additional blood and gut biopsy&#xD;
           tissue for monitoring biochemical changes in immune variables in response to study drug&#xD;
           or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main objective of the main multicenter study (sponsored by NOVARTIS) is to determine&#xD;
           whether AIN457 is safe and effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease, and if&#xD;
           effective, how long the effect will remain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Important eligibility criteria to consider for patients to be enrolled in the AIN457 trial&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male or female; 18-75 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of Crohn's disease for at least 3 months prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate to severe active Crohn's disease at baseline, defined as: CDAI greater than or&#xD;
           equal to 220 and less than or equal to 450&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active disease despite prior treatment with stable dose of corticosteroids for 2 weeks,&#xD;
           or immunosuppressant for at least 3 months (e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with symptoms associated with active bowel stricturing disease and pre-stenotic&#xD;
           dilation on radiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fistulizing disease if complicated by sepsis and/or untreated abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with multiple bowel surgeries and clinically important short bowel syndrome&#xD;
           defined as an inability to maintain caloric intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior therapy with rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receiving corticosteroids dose equivalent to a &gt; 40mg dose of prednisone per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects demonstrating clinical improvement due to other Crohn's therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with active or history of clinically significant cardiac abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the NIH substudy, additional blood will be drawn and a colonoscopy will be performed&#xD;
           before the first infusion and after the second infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The multicenter study plans to enroll seventy-two (72) subjects with moderate to severe&#xD;
           active Crohn's disease that is not controlled by corticosteroids, immunosuppressant&#xD;
           (e.g. methotrexate or purine metabolites) or anti-inflammatory treatment (e.g. 5-ASA).&#xD;
           At baseline visit, if the eligibility of the subject is confirmed, the subject will be&#xD;
           randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either AIN457 or placebo administered as a 2 hours&#xD;
           intravenous infusion. A total of two infusions will be given on day 1 and day 22&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After infusions there will be a follow-up period of up to 18 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once this study is completed, an extension study will be conducted that will offer&#xD;
           access to AIN457. Patients who complete the current study may be eligible to enter the&#xD;
           extension study and receive therapy with AIN457.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  History of in the preceding 3 months, significant and persistent arrhythmias such&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 2 times the ULN, total&#xD;
                  bilirubin should be differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting&#xD;
                  bilirubin. In any case, serum bilirubin should not exceed the value of 1.6 mg/dL&#xD;
                  (27 micromol/L).&#xD;

             infection or medical condition that may require treatment or therapeutic intervention&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subjects with:&#xD;
