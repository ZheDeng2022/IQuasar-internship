  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African American women living in the rural South are twice as likely as Caucasian women to&#xD;
      develop cervical cancer and die of invasive cervical cancer at a higher rate than any other&#xD;
      racial/ethnic group in the US (1). Reasons for low HPV vaccination rates among rural African&#xD;
      Americans are not well understood. HPV vaccination compliance is likely influenced by&#xD;
      barriers to health care access, misinformation regarding vaccinations, religious beliefs&#xD;
      related to sexual health and behaviors, and mistrust of the medical community (2, 3). Because&#xD;
      the vaccination of minors requires primary caregiver consent, vaccination commitment and&#xD;
      compliance is strongly influenced by family beliefs and communication regarding health and&#xD;
      sexuality. To date, little research has examined the cultural, familial, and intrapersonal&#xD;
      influences on HPV vaccination compliance among rural African American women. This study will&#xD;
      address these gaps in the literature and provide data needed to develop effective&#xD;
      interventions and health promotion materials to encourage HPV vaccination among rural African&#xD;
      American women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a pool of approximately 800 families who are participating in ongoing longitudinal&#xD;
      research through the Center for Family Research at the University of Georgia, the&#xD;
      investigators will recruit 200 rural female African American youth aged 13-17 who have not&#xD;
      received the HPV vaccine and their primary caregivers (n=200) into an observational,&#xD;
      prospective study on vaccination commitment and compliance. The investigators hypotheses are&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sociocultural factors that rural African Americans experience, including discrimination,&#xD;
           previous health care experience, religious beliefs, and community norms regarding HPV&#xD;
           vaccination and adolescent sexual behavior, will forecast primary caregivers' HPV&#xD;
           vaccination commitment and compliance for their daughters. The investigators also&#xD;
           predict that primary caregivers' HPV-related knowledge and attitudes will mediate this&#xD;
           association.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sociocultural factors will influence sexual health-related family communication and&#xD;
           interaction, primary caregivers' and youths' HPV-related attitudes, and HPV vaccination&#xD;
           commitment and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Primary caregivers' attitudes, youths' attitudes, and family health communication will&#xD;
           contribute to youths' and caregivers' vaccination commitment and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Youths' sexual behavior will influence their attitudes, family health communication, and&#xD;
           vaccination commitment and compliance.&#xD;
