    <textblock>
      It is apparent that the head of a preterm infant should not be left uncovered, however it&#xD;
      remains unclear whether covering the head of a preterm baby with plastic wrapping is&#xD;
      effective in preventing heat loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a prospective, randomised, controlled trial in very preterm infants to evaluate&#xD;
      if a polyethylene cap prevents heat loss after delivery better than polyethylene occlusive&#xD;
      wrapping and conventional drying. Furthermore, we assessed body temperature 1 hour after&#xD;
      admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) to evaluate whether the polyethylene cap&#xD;
      prevents postnatal heat loss.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary outcome measure was axillary temperature taken on admission to the NICU&#xD;
      (immediately after cap and wrap removal) and again 1 hour later. Axillary temperature was&#xD;
      measured using a digital thermometer (Terumo Digital Clinical Thermometer C202, Terumo&#xD;
      Corporation, Tokio, Japan). The occurrence of hypothermia, defined as axillary temperature&#xD;
      less then 36.4Â°C, on NICU admission was also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes included mortality prior to hospital discharge, presence of major brain&#xD;
      injury (sonographic evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation,&#xD;
      parenchymal hemorrhagic infarction, or periventricular leukomalacia), tracheal intubation at&#xD;
      birth, Apgar scores, delivery to admission time, blood gas analysis and serum glucose&#xD;
      concentration on NICU admission.&#xD;
