    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm study. Key eligibility criteria include (1) newly diagnosed, diffuse&#xD;
      large B-cell or follicular cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; (2) negative test for hepatitis B&#xD;
      surface antigen (HBsAg) and positive for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc); (3)&#xD;
      adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney function. All eligible patients will receive&#xD;
      rituximab-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy&#xD;
      according to current treatment guidelines. The primary endpoint of this study is the&#xD;
      incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, defined by a greater than 10-fold&#xD;
      increase, compared with previous nadir levels, of HBV DNA during rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy&#xD;
      and within 1 year after completion of the last course of rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Patients who have HBV reactivation during the study period will receive free entecavir&#xD;
      treatment, one of the standard treatment for chronic hepatitis B, for 48 weeks. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include the incidence of hepatitis flare, defined as a greater than 3 fold increase&#xD;
      of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level that exceeded 100 IU/L, and the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the T1408 study we enrolled patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma who were HBsAg (-) and&#xD;
      anti-HBc (+) and were to receive rituximab-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,&#xD;
      prednisolone)-based chemotherapy. Key findings of this study included (1) HBV reactivation,&#xD;
      defined as a greater than 10-fold increase in HBV DNA compared with previous nadir levels,&#xD;
      occurred to 10-20% of patients, depending on the sensitivity of the HBV DNA tests; (2) no&#xD;
      HBV-related death with the prompt anti-viral therapy upon HBV reactivation; (3) patients with&#xD;
      HBV reactivation were associated with poorer progression-free survival and overall survival;&#xD;
      (4) serological breakthrough (i.e., re-appearance of HBsAg) is an important predictor of&#xD;
      HBV-related hepatitis flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this amendment we will enroll more patients to clarify the above findings: (1) the&#xD;
      association between HBV reactivation and survival; (2) diagnostic value of quantitative HBsAg&#xD;
      and anti HBc tests on HBV reactivation; (3) whether host factors (DNA polymorphism) may help&#xD;
      predict HBV reactivation. A larger patient cohort is needed to identify (1) baseline features&#xD;
      that may help predict HBV reactivation, and (2) on-treatment features that may help timely&#xD;
      anti-viral therapy.&#xD;

      Treatment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A typical course of rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      rituximab 375 mg/m2 i.v., day 1, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 i.v., day 1, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2&#xD;
      i.v., day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (maximal 2 mg) i.v., day 1, prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day&#xD;
      p.o., day 1 to day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically the treatment will be repeated every 3 weeks. If the patients cannot recover from&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced toxicity at the schedule time of the next course of treatment,&#xD;
      modification of chemotherapy dosage or delay of chemotherapy administration will be done&#xD;
      according to local treatment standard and will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of component therapy or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of individual investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auxiliary medication, such as anti-emetics, will be given according to local treatment&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Database Management Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standard module for description of standard operation procedures for data processing to&#xD;
           ensure quality and validity of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Presentation of Efficacy and safety Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of HBV reactivation, defined by&#xD;
           a greater than 10-fold increase, compared with previous nadir levels, of HBV DNA, during&#xD;
           rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy and within 1 year after the last course of rituximab-CHOP&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Secondary endpoints: Incidence of hepatitis , defined as a greater than 3 fold&#xD;
           increase of serum ALT level that exceeded 100 IU/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Incidence of severe hepatitis, defined as a hepatitis flare with an increase of ALT to&#xD;
           more than 10 fold of ULN or bilirubin to more than 1.5 fold of ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Association between HBV reactivation and serological breakthrough (i.e., re-appearance&#xD;
           of HBsAg) during follow-up Association between HBV reactivation and levels of anti-HBc&#xD;
           antibodies during follow-up Association between HBV reactivation and HLA germline&#xD;
           polymorphism (HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1) / IL28B genotype of the&#xD;
           patients Progression-free survival and overall survival for patients who receive&#xD;
           rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypotheses and Sample Size Determination&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is estimated that in Taiwan the incidence of 'resolved' HBV infection in the general&#xD;
           population is about 50%. A recent survey of HbsAg(-)blood donors indicated that 7% of&#xD;
           the donors had detectable HBV DNA in serum. The incidence of diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Taiwan is 700-800 new patients/year (Taiwan Cancer Registry,&#xD;
           http://crs.cph.ntu.edu.tw). We plan to enroll 150 patients in three years (50 new&#xD;
           patients every year).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. General Statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Randomization and stratification&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a single-arm study. No randomization will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Analysis population&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will enroll NHL patients with evidence of 'resolved' HBV infection. Eligible&#xD;
           subjects must be negative for serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and positive for at&#xD;
           least one of the following in the serum: anti-core antigen (anti-HBc), anti-surface&#xD;
           antigen (anti-HBs), or HBV DNA. Patients who receive at least 1 dose of rituximab-CHOP&#xD;
           chemotherapy will be enrolled in to the intent-to-treat population and safety&#xD;
           population. Patients who complete at least 1 course of rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy will&#xD;
           be enrolled into the per-protocol analysis. The primary and secondary endpoints&#xD;
           described in Section 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 will be included in the per-protocol analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Dropout&#xD;
&#xD;
           Taking into account 10% dropout rate, we need to enter 62 patients per year to the trial&#xD;
           so that we may finish accrual of patients within 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before the first course of rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy, the baseline characteristics for&#xD;
           each patient will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5 Multicenter study&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will be conducted by all participating medical centers to the Lymphoma&#xD;
           Disease Committee (14 centers in total). Since the rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy is the&#xD;
           standard first-line treatment for patients with diffuse large B-cell NHL and follicular&#xD;
           cell NHL, no center interaction on treatment is expected in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.6 Adjustment for multiple testing&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adjustment because of multiple testing is not needed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.7 Subgroup analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pre-specified subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint (HBV reactivation rate) will be&#xD;
           done in the following sub-groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. baseline HBV DNA (+) vs. HBV DNA (-);&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. baseline alanine transaminase (ALT) normal vs. abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.8 Patient Listings&#xD;
&#xD;
           Individual patient listings should be also provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Interim analysis and data monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
           No interim analysis is planned for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Final Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the final statistical analysis, this section should state the specific statistical&#xD;
      procedures described in item 6 of this section in the analysis of every primary and secondary&#xD;
      efficacy and safety endpoint.&#xD;
