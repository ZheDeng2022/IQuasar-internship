      The study compare the standard treatment with nephrectomy + sunitinib to treatment with&#xD;
      sunitinib alone without nephrectomy. This study will be the first trial on this competitive&#xD;
      context&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The 2 previous studies on the impact of nephrectomy (EORTC, SWOG) in metastatic renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma have justified recommendation to initial nephrectomy for patients presenting with&#xD;
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. But these studies were performed at the time of&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is Evaluation of the importance of nephrectomy in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib (AA) Arm A : Nephrectomy followed by Sunitinib&#xD;
      Arm B : Sunitinib alone Sunitinib will be administrated orally daily for 4 weeks followed by&#xD;
      a 2 week rest( schedule 4/2), 6 weeks are considered as a cycle The starting dose will be 50&#xD;
      mg daily with provision for dose reduction based on tolerability Patient will be treated&#xD;
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurrence or withdraw.&#xD;
