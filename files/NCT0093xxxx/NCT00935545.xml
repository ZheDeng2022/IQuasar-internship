  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm study evaluating a multi-peptide (tumor-associated&#xD;
      antigens)/Montanide vaccine in patients &lt; 21 years of age with recurrent or refractory CNS&#xD;
      tumors. The study primarily evaluates the safety of this regimen. Secondarily, immunogenicity&#xD;
      and anti-tumor effects will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to evaluate the safety of subcutaneous injections of tumor associated&#xD;
      antigens (TAA) mixed with Montanide ISA-51VG in patients with recurrent or refractory brain&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are to evaluate cellular immune responses induced in patients after&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of TAA mixed with Montanide ISA-51VG and to document tumor response in&#xD;
      patients with measurable disease or time to progression in patients without measurable&#xD;
      disease following subcutaneous injection of TAA mixed with Montanide ISA-51VG.&#xD;

    <description>Montanide is an oil-based immunoadjuvant similar to Incomplete FreundÂ´s Adjuvant, which is commonly used in combination with peptide vaccines. Although its precise mode of action is not known, it acts to enhance the immune response to vaccination. It has a depot effect that depending on the type of emulsion will release the antigen slowly from the injection site.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with primary central nervous system tumors recurrent or refractory to&#xD;
             standard therapy. Patients with recurrent tumors other than refractory anaplastic&#xD;
             astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme or medulloblastoma must have failed all available&#xD;
             second line therapies considered to be standard of care prior to inclusion in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with tumor histologies which have previously been shown to express at least&#xD;
             one of the tumor associated antigens (TRP2, gp100, EphA2 or Her2) are eligible.&#xD;
             Patients whose tumors are shown to express at least one of these antigens are also&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be HLA A*0201 positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age &lt; 21 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must weigh &gt; 15kg due to the amount of blood required for immune function&#xD;
             studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Lansky performance status or Karnofsky performance status &gt; 50. Patients who are&#xD;
             unable to walk because of paralysis but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered&#xD;
             ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.&#xD;

             Hematologic: WBC &gt; 1000/mm3 Absolute lymphocyte count &gt; 500 Hemoglobin &gt; 9 gm/dl (may&#xD;
             be transfused to achieve adequate hemoglobin level) Platelet count &gt; 50,000/mm3 INR&#xD;

&#xD;
             Hepatic: AST/ALT &lt; 2 x the upper limit of institutional normal Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. History of immunodeficiency disease (such as HIV) or autoimmune disease except&#xD;

             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
