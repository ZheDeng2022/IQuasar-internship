    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of physical therapy for treatment of anterior disc displacement without&#xD;
      reduction of temporomandibular disorders has not been well defined. This study compared the&#xD;
      treatment method with conservative splint therapy. Fifty two subjects were assigned at random&#xD;
      to either of two treatment groups: one is a splint treatment group, and the other is a joint&#xD;
      mobilization self exercise group. Each treatment was evaluated using four outcome variables:&#xD;
      (i) maximum mouth opening range without and (ii) with pain, (iii) present pain intensity, and&#xD;
      (iv) limitation of daily activities. All outcome variables were significantly improved after&#xD;
      eight-week of treatment in the exercise group. Meanwhile, the splint treatment improved three&#xD;
      variables, other than &quot;mouth opening with pain&quot;; however, the degree of improvement was less&#xD;
      than that seen in the exercise group. This result demonstrates that the joint mobilization&#xD;
      self exercise improves jaw function and relieves pain as compared to the splint treatment.&#xD;
