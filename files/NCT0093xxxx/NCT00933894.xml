  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of steady-state telaprevir (TVR) 750&#xD;
      mg q8h (3 times a day, every 8 hours) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of escitalopram 10&#xD;
      mg q.d. (once a day), and vice versa. Steady state is a term which means that the drug has&#xD;
      been given long enough so that the plasma concentrations will remain the same with each&#xD;
      subsequent dose. TVR is being investigated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      (HCV) infection. Pharmacokinetics (pk) means how the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream,&#xD;
      distributed in the body and eliminated from the body.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Telaprevir is being investigated for treatment of chronic HCV infection, in combination with&#xD;
      Peg-IFN (pegylated interferon) and RBV (ribavirin). Peg-IFN plus RBV are currently an&#xD;
      accepted methode for treating HCV. Treatment with Peg-IFN plus RBV for HCV infection is&#xD;
      associated with a high rate of depression. The results of this study will provide dosing&#xD;
      recommendations for coadministration of Telaprevir (TVR) and escitalopram in HCV-infected&#xD;
      patients. This is a Phase I, open-label (both participant and investigator know the name of&#xD;
      the medication), randomized (study medication assigned by chance), crossover trial in 16&#xD;
      healthy participants to investigate the pharmacokinetic interaction between escitalopram and&#xD;
      TVR, both at steady state. Steady state is a term which means that the drug has been given&#xD;
      long enough so that the plasma concentrations will remain the same with each subsequent dose.&#xD;
      The participants will receive two treatments (treatment A-B or treatment B-A) in a randomized&#xD;
      order. In Treatment A, participants will receive escitalopram 10 mg once daily (q.d.) for 7&#xD;
      days. In Treatment B, participants will receive TVR 750 mg every 8 hours (q8h) for 14 days,&#xD;
      with coadministration of escitalopram 10 mg q.d. from Day 8 to Day 14. There will be a&#xD;
      washout period (a period where no treatment will be taken in view of having all the&#xD;
      medication eliminated from the body before starting a new treatment) of at least 14 days&#xD;
      between last intake of study medication in one session and first intake of study medication&#xD;
      in the subsequent session. All study medication will be taken with food. Escitalopram will be&#xD;
      taken once daily in the morning. During coadministration of TVR and escitalopram, the first&#xD;
      dose of TVR should be taken together with escitalopram in the morning. Pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profiles of the two compounds will be measured through blood samples taken at regular&#xD;
      intervals during the study and safety and tolerability will be assessed during the study&#xD;
      period and in follow-up. Safety and tolerability evaluations will be recorded at regular&#xD;
      intervals throughout the trial period. Blood and urine samples, electrocardiogram (ECG) and&#xD;
      vital signs (blood pressure and hart rate) will be taken at screening, before medication&#xD;
      intake on days 1 and 7 in each session and on day 14 in treatment B and at the 2 follow up&#xD;
      visits at 5-7 and 30-32 days after last dose of drug in the last session. A physical&#xD;
      examination will be performed at screening, on day before first medication intake in each&#xD;
      session and during the 2 follow up visits. Participants in Treatment A will receive oral&#xD;
      escitalopram 10 mg once daily for 7 days and in Treatment B participants will receive TVR 750&#xD;
      mg q8h from Day 1 to Day 14, with coadministration of escitalopram 10 mg q.d. from Day 8 to&#xD;
      Day 14.&#xD;
