  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a result of our previous NCRN study (ABC-02) cisplatin and gemcitabine (CisGem) is likely&#xD;
      to become the international standard of care for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer&#xD;
      (submitted: ASCO 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, ABC-03, will determine whether the addition of cediranib(an oral Vascular&#xD;
      Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor inhibitor) to CisGem will improve the time to disease&#xD;
      progression in this patient group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there is currently no standard chemotherapy for patients with advanced biliary tract&#xD;
      cancers (ABC) the UK ABC-02 study (the largest study by far in this patient group, n=410) is&#xD;
      likely to define CisGem as the global standard of care for this disease based on a&#xD;
      significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared to gemcitabine&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a pivotal stimulus of physiologic and pathologic&#xD;
      angiogenesis, including the sustained neo-vascularisation required to support solid tumour&#xD;
      growth. Human biliary tract carcinoma cells have higher expression of VEGF both in cell lines&#xD;
      and tissues (detected in 75.6% of 33 resected clinical specimens) and this is associated with&#xD;
      significantly higher levels of microvessel density and the presence of intrahepatic&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cediranib is a highly potent inhibitor of VEGF receptor 2 tyrosine kinase and VEGF-induced&#xD;
      signalling in endothelial cells. It has been safely combined with a CisGem regimen in lung&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims This trial aims to evaluate the effect on progression-free survival of cediranib in&#xD;
      combination with CisGem chemotherapy compared to CisGem and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of study Consenting patients with ABC (inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic) will receive CisGem chemotherapy and either cediranib (experimental arm) or&#xD;
      placebo (standard arm) orally. Treatment will continue until disease progression&#xD;
      (chemotherapy will stop at 24 weeks) with tumour reassessment by CT/MRI scans at 12-weekly&#xD;
      intervals. All patients will be followed up for survival analysis.&#xD;

          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases or laboratory finding that in&#xD;
