  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial which evaluates&#xD;
      the efficacy of preoperative smoking counseling and varenicline (a medication approved by&#xD;
      Health Canada and FDA for quitting smoking) to provide long term smoking cessation (i.e.,&#xD;
      abstinence for at least one year) in surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is as follows: &quot;A significant percentage of surgical patients will be&#xD;
      receptive to smoking cessation interventions in the pre-admission clinic and will refrain&#xD;
      from smoking at 24 and 52 weeks after starting the treatment.&quot; The secondary hypothesis is as&#xD;
      follows: &quot;Patients who receive interventions but do not quit smoking will have reduced number&#xD;
      of cigarettes consumed/day or improved their readiness to quit smoking at 24 and 52 weeks&#xD;
      after starting the treatment.&quot;&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Objective of this study is to introduce a practically feasible multifaceted intervention&#xD;
      in the preadmission clinic to help reduce smoking in preoperative surgical patients. We aim&#xD;
      to study the effectiveness of such a program in promoting positive change in smoking behavior&#xD;
      among patients before surgery. The forced abstinence enforced on patients during hospital&#xD;
      stay for their surgery can also be used to help smokers remain tobacco free long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention program for this study will be primarily based on the smoking cessation&#xD;
      guidelines endorsed by the Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of&#xD;
      Toronto. The study research staffs (including the research coordinator) will be trained in&#xD;
      accordance with these guidelines and the reading material provided will also be based on the&#xD;
      same guidelines. The counseling skills of the coordinator will be reviewed every 3 months to&#xD;
      ensure minimal variability. The coordinator will also be involved in regular meetings to&#xD;
      address difficult situations and scenarios. They will also be provided checklists for all&#xD;
      interventions to ensure that all components are covered uniformly for each patient. For each&#xD;
      patient, the research staff who interviews the patient at the beginning will be the same&#xD;
      during the whole treatment and follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions in Preadmission:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and personal chrematistics of the patients including age, sex, average number of&#xD;
      cigarette smoked per day will be recorded. Patients will then receive a questionnaire based&#xD;
      on Prochaska and DiClemente's Stages of Change Model to determine whether they were&#xD;
      precontemplating, contemplating, preparing for or actively engaged in smoking cessation. In&#xD;
      order to have the baseline smoking status, urinary cotinine and expired-air carbon monoxide&#xD;
      (COE) will be measured in all patients at the preadmission clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive two 15 minute face to face standard counseling sessions by the&#xD;
      research coordinator. First counseling will be done in preadmission. Counseling will include&#xD;
      provision of advice to quit smoking and obtaining information regarding smoking behavior and&#xD;
      skill building supplemented with standard printed materials. The patients will be informed of&#xD;
      benefits of even short term abstinence before surgery. The target quit date (TQD) for all&#xD;
      patients will be set up as 24 hours before surgery as surgical patients are routinely&#xD;
      required to be abstinent at the time of surgery. The patients will be instructed to initiate&#xD;
      the medication (or placebo) exactly one week before TQD. The whole treatment period is 12&#xD;
      weeks which includes 1- week titration as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 1 - 3: 0.5 mg once daily (1 table each day) Days 4 - 7: 0.5 mg twice daily (1 in the&#xD;
      morning and 1 in the evening) Days 8 - 12 weeks 1.0 mg twice daily (1 in the morning and 1 in&#xD;
      the evening)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the varenicline group will be prescribed varenicline for 12 weeks. Patients in&#xD;
      the placebo group will be prescribed placebo (lactose, identical to medication pills in&#xD;
      appearance) for the same period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients at the preadmission clinic will receive two bottles of the medication (or&#xD;
      placebo): One containing 17 X 0.5 mg tabs (i.e. 11 tabs plus 6 extra tablets for a 3-day&#xD;
      window period) for the first week of titration; the other one containing 66 X 1.0 mg tabs (28&#xD;
      days X 2 tablets = 56 tablets plus10 for a 5-day window period) for the next 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. We will call the patients one week before TQD to remind them to start the&#xD;
      treatment. In case of delayed or cancelled surgeries, TQD will not change and the patient&#xD;
      will continue the treatment according to the above mentioned schedule. The patients will be&#xD;
      asked to return the first medication bottle with the remaining pills on the day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been rare post-marketing reports of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms with&#xD;
      varenicline, including depressed mood, agitation, hostility, changes in behavior, suicidal&#xD;
      ideation and suicide, as well as worsening of pre-existing psychiatric illness (previously&#xD;
      diagnosed or not). It is not known whether these events are occurring at a rate and severity&#xD;
      which is different from the background rate for smoking cessation in the general population,&#xD;
      or in the psychiatric population (treated or untreated), or different from the rates for&#xD;
      other drugs in the class of smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients and/or their families will be alerted about the need to monitor for the&#xD;
      medication side effects including any neuropsychiatric symptoms. Since the beginning of the&#xD;
      treatment and during each in-hospital visit or follow up phone calls, patients will be asked&#xD;
      about changes in their behavior or thoughts. Patients will be instructed to stop taking the&#xD;
      medication (or placebo) and contact their healthcare provider and the research coordinator&#xD;
      immediately if they have or if their families observe depressed mood, agitation, hostility or&#xD;
      changes in behavior, that are not typical for the patient, or if the patient has suicidal&#xD;
      ideation or suicidal behavior. These patients will be unblinded, withdrawn from the study,&#xD;
      and recorded as cases with serious adverse events (SAE). They will be followed up for at&#xD;
      least 28 days after the stop of the treatments for monitoring any more complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention during hospital admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, the patients will take one pill of 1.0 mg medication (or matched&#xD;
      placebo) before surgery. They will resume taking the medication as soon as possible after&#xD;
      surgery according to the treatment schedule. At 24 hour after surgery or discharge time (for&#xD;
      day-surgery patients), i.e. the postoperative visit, patients will receive the rest of&#xD;
      medications for the whole treatment period, i.e. two bottles of the medication (or placebo)&#xD;
      each one containing 66 X 1.0 mg tabs (28 days X 2 tablets = 56 tablets plus10 for a 5-day&#xD;
      window) for the rest of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any interruption in the treatment which might happen due to patient surgical conditions (e.g.&#xD;
      patients having abdominal surgeries, etc.) will be recorded for taking into account in the&#xD;
      final sub-analysis. The second counseling session will be at discharge for day-surgery&#xD;
      patients or at 24 hrs after other surgeries. Participants will be visited by the study&#xD;
      coordinator in the hospital to review smoking status and to encourage future abstinence. The&#xD;
      self-reported preoperative abstinence will then be verified by measurement of expired carbon&#xD;
      monoxide (COE) and urinary cotinine in all patients. Patients will receive counseling with&#xD;
      special emphasis on the skills associated with relapse prevention and remaining abstinent&#xD;
      during second week as research suggests that abstinence during that time period is highly&#xD;
      predictive of success (Kenford et al 1994) and promotes surgical healing (Warner et al 2004).&#xD;
      Patients will also be informed of benefits of long-term cessation and will be encouraged to&#xD;
      continue pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow up and telephone counseling after discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will also be provided with telephone counseling. For the first 4&#xD;
      weeks after starting treatment, the patients will receive weekly phone calls and then at the&#xD;
      end of 8 weeks. The purpose of these calls will be to report smoking status and to help&#xD;
      encourage continued and long-term abstinence. Patients then will be asked to come to the&#xD;
      hospital for a visit at the end of their treatment period, i.e. 12 weeks after the treatment&#xD;
      started. They will be compensated for the traveling and parking cost and required to bring&#xD;
      the bottles including the remaining pills. In this visit, patients will be asked about their&#xD;
      smoking status and their stage of change using Prochaska and DiClemente's model or no. of&#xD;
      cigarette smoked/ day for those who have not quit smoking. In addition, the self-reported&#xD;
      abstinence will then be verified by measurement of expired carbon monoxide (COE) and urinary&#xD;
      cotinine in all patients. For the rest of follow-up period, i.e. until the end of week 52&#xD;
      after treatment, patients will receive phone calls every 4 weeks to encourage continued and&#xD;
      long-term abstinence. The smoking status, stage of change and no. of cigarette smoked/ day&#xD;
      will also be reported at 24- and 52- week follow-up phone calls. To verify self-reports of&#xD;
      abstinence, we will also mail the NicAlert urine cotinine strips (Accutest) at 24 and 52&#xD;
      weeks after treatment to the patients along with instructions of how to do the test. Patients&#xD;
      will be asked by telephone calls to do the test and to return the strips using prepaid return&#xD;
      envelops including a small plastic pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for 52 weeks after starting the treatment. Participants in both&#xD;
      groups will receive a follow up visit by the study coordinator or a research assistant during&#xD;
      their hospital stay i.e., at discharge for day surgery patients or at 24 hrs after their&#xD;
      surgery. Patients in both groups will receive weekly follow up calls during the first 4 weeks&#xD;
      and then at the end of 8 week after starting the treatment. At the end of treatment period,&#xD;
      i.e. 12 weeks patients will come be visited in the hospital. For the rest of follow-up&#xD;
      period, i.e. until the end of week 52, patients will receive phone calls for every 4 weeks to&#xD;
      help support abstinence and to report smoking status. Focus will be on the second week&#xD;
      following start of abstinence as it has been shown that abstinence of smoking at 2 wks after&#xD;
      a cessation attempt is highly predictive of success. The self reports of smoking status at&#xD;
      24- and 52-week follow-up will be verified by measuring COE and urine cotinine.&#xD;
