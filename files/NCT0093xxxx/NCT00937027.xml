    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and pharmacokinetic properties (the&#xD;
      absorption, distribution and excretion) of two preparations of aminopterin (0.25 mg tablets&#xD;
      and 1.0 mg tablets) following oral administration by subjects with moderate to severe&#xD;
      psoriasis.&#xD;
