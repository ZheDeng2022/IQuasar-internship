      The primary purpose of the trial is to examine the effect of the combination of social skills&#xD;
      training, parental training and standard treatment versus standard treatment in ADHD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose is to examine differences in the effect of the treatment in relation to&#xD;
      the different competences of attachment: secure attachment: unsecure dismissing, unsecure&#xD;
      preoccupied or disorganized attachment and in the categories; emotional openness, balance of&#xD;
      positivity / negativity to attachment figure/s, idealisation of attachment figure/s,&#xD;
      dismissal and/or derogation of attachment, the ability of conflict resolution,&#xD;
      disorganisation and coherence of the narrative description.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary purpose of the trial is to examine differences in the effect of the treatment in&#xD;
      relation to the degree of parents symptoms of ADHD.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many children with ADHD have, beside the main symptoms hyperactivity, impulsivity and a lack&#xD;
      of ability to maintain attention, difficulties with social interaction. This is a burden in&#xD;
      the childrens relationship towards parents, peers and teachers and thereby influencing their&#xD;
      performances in school. Many children with ADHD find great help in receiving medical&#xD;
      treatment, which has a good effect on the children's problems with hyperactivity, impulsivity&#xD;
      and lacking attention. However, social interaction problems will probably not be set right&#xD;
      due to medication alone. Several studies have shown that social skills training can help&#xD;
      children with ADHD in their social interactions. It is also an interesting issue to further&#xD;
      investigate treatment effect in relation to the ADHD-children's attachment competences, as&#xD;
      one must assume that differences in attachment competences may influence the children's&#xD;
      relationship and social interaction problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social skills training will consist of 8 weeks of group treatment with weekly sessions of one&#xD;
      and a half hours and includes role play, exercises and games as well as home work which will&#xD;
      include the parents. At the same time the parents are participating in parental training&#xD;
      groups,that will focus on supporting the children's social training. Both the children and&#xD;
      the parental groups are lead by two group therapists. The intervention will be additional to&#xD;
      the received standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment consists of medical treatment, briefing, consulting and supporting&#xD;
      conversations with a focus on securing compliance to the treatments´ and on aiding children&#xD;
      and their families with the difficulties arising with the children's illness. Furthermore the&#xD;
      parents participate in parental groups three times during the 8 weeks in which the experiment&#xD;
      takes place. This group lasts 2 hours and is managed by two nurses who are attached to the&#xD;
      ADHD- treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in the age of 8-12 years with a diagnosis of ADHD are randomised to either the&#xD;
      combination standard treatment, social skills training with parental training or to standard&#xD;
      treatment. The sample size calculation shows that 52 patients must be included in the trial&#xD;
      to show a 4 point difference in the primary outcome. The examinations of the children will&#xD;
      take place at the baseline and after three and six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is significant difference between the clinical effect of the combination social&#xD;
           skills training, parental training and standard treatment versus standard treatment 3&#xD;
           and 6 months after the beginning of the treatment in relation to the children's social&#xD;
           competences.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measures: sub index 'Social Problems' from Conners CBRS and the sub index 'Peer&#xD;
           Relations' from Conners 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is significant difference between the clinical effect of the combination social&#xD;
           skills training, parental training and standard treatment versus standard treatment 3&#xD;
           and 6 months after the beginning of the treatment in relation to&#xD;
           hyperactivity/impulsivity problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measured by: sub index 'Hyperactivity/Impulsivity' from Conners 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There is significant difference between the clinical effect of the combination social&#xD;
           skills training, parental training and standard treatment versus standard treatment 3&#xD;
           and 6 months after the beginning of the treatment in relation to the amount of&#xD;
           children's aggressive behaviour and the children's emotional distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measures: sub indexes from Conners CBRS: 'Aggressive Behaviour' and 'Emotional&#xD;
           distress'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There is significant difference between the clinical effect of the combination social&#xD;
           skills training, parental training and standard treatment versus standard treatment 3&#xD;
           and 6 months after the beginning of the treatment in relation to the childrens academic&#xD;
           performance and executive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measures: sub indexes 'Academic Difficulties' from Conners CBRS and 'Executive&#xD;
           Functioning' from Conners 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. There is significant difference between the clinical effect of the combination social&#xD;
           skills training, parental training and standard treatment versus standard treatment 3&#xD;
           and 6 months after the beginning of the treatment in relation to the children's social&#xD;
           competences and symptoms of ADHD in relation to the different competences of attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measured by: CAI- Children Attachment Interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. There is significant difference between experimental and standard treatment 6 months&#xD;
           after start of treatment, as reflected in positive changes in the childrens attachment&#xD;
           skills or an improvement in the categories; emotional openness, balance of positivity /&#xD;
           negativity to attachment figure/s, idealisation of attachment figure/s, dismissal and/or&#xD;
           derogation of attachment, the ability of conflict resolution, disorganisation and&#xD;
           coherence of the narrative description.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measured by: CAI- Children Attachment Interview&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. There is significant difference between the clinical effect of the combination social&#xD;
           skills training, parental training and standard treatment versus standard treatment 3&#xD;
           and 6 months after the beginning of the treatment in relation to the children's social&#xD;
           competences and symptoms of ADHD in relation to the parent's amount of ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured by: ASRS Symptom Checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no significant difference between the clinical effect of the combination social&#xD;
           skills training, parental training and standard treatment versus standard treatment 3&#xD;
           and 6 months after the beginning of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no difference in the effect in one or the other treatment if the children's&#xD;
           different forms of attachment styles are considered&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no difference in the effect in one or the other treatment if the children's&#xD;
           parents ADHD symptoms are considered There is no difference 6 month after the beginning&#xD;
           of the treatment in the effect in one or the other treatment if the childrens attachment&#xD;
           skills or the undercategories are considered 6 month after the beginning of the&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
