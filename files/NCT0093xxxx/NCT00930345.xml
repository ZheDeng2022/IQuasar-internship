      The aim of this study is to identify and/or validate biomarkers and imaging markers to&#xD;
      predict and monitor the activity of a new class of therapeutic agents called antiangiogenics&#xD;
      for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Suntinib, approved for this&#xD;
      indication, will be administred before and after nephrectomy and biomarkers sampling and&#xD;
      imaging will be operated to monitor the activity and identify prognostic factors in mRCC.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Sunitinib, SUTENT, is a promising multi-target TKI in the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma after cytokine failure. In previous phase II studies, ORR is 40% and TTP&#xD;
      = 8,7 months. A phase III randomized trial of Sunitinib versus interferon alpha as first-line&#xD;
      therapy for patients with mRCC showed a significantly longer PFS in the Sunitinib group (11&#xD;
      months) than in the interferon group (5 months), hazard ratio of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.54,&#xD;
      p &lt; 0.001). Initial approval in second line treatment of mRCC was extended to first line&#xD;
      therapy on 11-01-2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms of action involved in the therapeutic effects of antiangiogenic compounds are not&#xD;
      fully elucidated. As of today, there are no validated biomarkers or imaging markers to&#xD;
      predict and monitor the activity of this type of compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent findings in the field of cancer biology, tumor angiogenesis, immunology and imaging&#xD;
      provide several biomarker candidates that can be assessed in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASIC RESEARCH Biomarkers It seems interesting to measure the different biological markers&#xD;
      that could be modulated by this antiangiogenic therapeutic. Some of them are known as&#xD;
      prognostic factors in the metastatic renal carcinoma, others are directly linked to the&#xD;
      mechanism of action of Sunitinib. Due to the biopsy prior to treatment initiation and&#xD;
      nephrectomy after treatment initiation, it will be possible to evaluate biomarkers&#xD;
      modification and to assess the potential link with the tumour response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VHL gene alterations (mutations, deletions, and hypermethylations) are observed at high&#xD;
      frequencies of up to 80% in cases of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. The molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in angiogenesis in the presence of such genetic alterations are not yet&#xD;
      well known. The functions of the pVHL/aHIF/VEGF/angiogenesis pathway will be investigated in&#xD;
      all the renal cell carcinoma obtained from the biopsy and nephrectomy. Molecular markers&#xD;
      defined by VHL status, expression and proteomic profiling may be helpful in predicting the&#xD;
      responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib is a potent inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of several receptors:&#xD;
      VEGFR-2, the main receptor responsible for mediating the proangiogenic effects of vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), expressed by vascular endothelial cells; PDGFR, the&#xD;
      receptor for the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), expressed in pericytes which serve as&#xD;
      structural supporting cells for endothelial cells. Consistent with its biochemical activity,&#xD;
      Sunitinib inhibits the in vitro mitogenic response of human umbilical vein endothelial cells&#xD;
      (HUVECs) stimulated by VEGF or bFGF (basic fibrosblast growth factor), another proangiogenic&#xD;
      factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF gene polymorphisms In physiologic and pathologic conditions, important variations in&#xD;
      VEGF blood levels have been reported to correlate with constitutional VEGF-A gene&#xD;
      polymorphisms located in intronic regions. Moreover, VEGF-A polymorphisms have been described&#xD;
      as predisposition and prognostic factors in several human malignancies such as bladder,&#xD;
      breast, melanoma, prostate and head and neck carcinomas. Hence, it is interesting to see&#xD;
      whether these polymorphisms could affect tumor and clinical presentation and correlate with&#xD;
      VEGF-levels and response to antiangiogenic treatment with sunitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunology Tumor angiogenesis can impact immune response in renal cell carcinoma patients. A&#xD;
      naturally occurring CD4+ T cell subset, regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells, has emerged as the&#xD;
      dominant T cell population governing peripheral self- tolerance by inhibiting effector T&#xD;
      cell. The ability of anti-angiogenic therapy to block VEGF may allow better maturation of&#xD;
      dendritic cells and a reduction of the number of regulatory CD4+CD25+T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project will be to test whether the administration of Sunitinib modulates the&#xD;
      concentrations of regulatory CD4+CD25+T cells, and if a correlation between the immunology&#xD;
      parameters and the response can be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Radiological evaluation of tumor response is also challenging with anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      drugs. Criteria based solely on size may be inadequate for evaluation of anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      therapy efficacy. The unbridled expansion of tumor vessels leads to development of abnormal&#xD;
      vessels, with distinct microvascular characteristics: high perfusion (blood flow), and porous&#xD;
      walls leaking molecules into the interstitium (permeability).&#xD;
&#xD;
      New imaging techniques as dynamic contrast-enhanced CT are being developed to quantify and&#xD;
      characterize these unique properties, and may be used as markers of response to angiogenesis&#xD;
      inhibitors. Imaging assays of angiogenic status therefore offer the potential to clinically&#xD;
      measure anti angiogenic effects of drugs on the tumor vessels themselves, effects that may&#xD;
      not be reflected in changing tumor dimensions. These effects may be detectable hours or days&#xD;
      from time of treatment initiation, rather than in weeks or months needed typically to detect&#xD;
      a change in tumor size. Exploration of local tumor vascular architecture can help to&#xD;
      understand mechanism of action of Sunitinib. This vasculature seems to be of poor&#xD;
      functionality and tumor vascularization cannot be adequately assessed only by global index&#xD;
      such as global tumor blood flow. In addition, exploration of renal tumor vascularization with&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced US will be performed to compare blood flow determined by CT and US.&#xD;
