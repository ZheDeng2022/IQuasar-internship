  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the combination of mammography and CE-MRI will improve the surgeon and&#xD;
      radiologist's ability to define extent of disease prior to surgical resection, improve the&#xD;
      odds of obtaining clear surgical margins, and increase the efficacy of IORT delivered&#xD;
      immediately after initial surgical resection. In this investigation, we will determine&#xD;
      whether or not patients deemed eligible for 'immediate&quot; IORT based on mammography and CE-MRI&#xD;
      can be successfully treated without the need for re-excision or additional radiotherapy due&#xD;
      to inadequate surgical margins.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with biopsy-proven DCIS, mammographic and CE-MRI evidence of DCIS measuring&#xD;
             great then equal to 4cm, and a desire to receive breast conserving therapy, will be&#xD;
             considered for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient history, physical examination findings, and demographics (sex, age, height,&#xD;
             weight, bra size, etc.) will be performed and documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Initial Registration (all patients cohorts):&#xD;
&#xD;
        All cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent and HIPAA documents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female sex&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age great then equal to 40 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Localized ductal carcinoma in situ&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically and/or histologically negative axillary lymph nodes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No imaging or clinical findings suggestive of invasive carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort 1 (Immediate IORT group)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Localized DCIS measuring less then equal to 4 cm on preoperative imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 2 (Delayed IORT group)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Localized DCIS measuring less then equal to4 cm or less on surgical pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Delayed IORT could be performed for the explicit purpose of administering IORT or&#xD;
             performed following re-excision of a previously operated breast to achieve clear&#xD;
             surgical margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This cohort includes patients who were excluded from immediate IORT based on&#xD;
             pre-operative imaging suggesting ineligibility for immediate IORT, but who are&#xD;
             subsequently found to meet histological criteria (localized DCIS less then equal to 4&#xD;
             cm and no invasive cancer) for IORT based on surgical pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unifocal microinvasive (T1mic or invasive focus less then equal to 1mm in maximal&#xD;
             diameter) is allowed following initial WLE if surgical pathology margins were less&#xD;
             then equal to2 mm for both the invasive and non-invasive components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Delayed IORT must be performed within 3 months of initial WLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 3 Subjects who received IORT at the time of initial WLE but whose surgical&#xD;
             pathology showed them to be unsuitable candidates for IORT alone on the basis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DCIS measuring greater than 5 cm on surgical pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  T1a (less than 1 mm) or larger invasive carcinoma associated with extensive DCIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical margins width less than1 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age less than 40&#xD;
&#xD;

             pre-operative imaging or core biopsy of the breast or axillary nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DCIS that is multicentric in the ipsilateral breast. Multicentricity will be defined&#xD;
             at 2 or more lesions separated by more than 3 cm in the same breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-epithelial breast malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DCIS associated with diffuse suspicious or indeterminate microcalcifications&#xD;

             rash, inclusion-body myositis, or amyloidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
