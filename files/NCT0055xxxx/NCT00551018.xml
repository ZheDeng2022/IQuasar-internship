  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vicriviroc (vye-kri-VYE-rock) is an investigational drug (not yet approved by Government&#xD;
      Regulatory Authorities for commercial use) that belongs to a new class of drugs, called CCR5&#xD;
      receptor blockers. This group of drugs blocks one of the ways HIV enters T-cells (the cells&#xD;
      that fight infection). Previous smaller studies in HIV treatment-experienced patients, have&#xD;
      shown that vicriviroc is safe and effective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      virologic efficacy of vicriviroc combined with ritonavir-boosted Reyataz® in HIV-infected&#xD;
      treatment-naïve subjects.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of&#xD;
      vicriviroc maleate in treatment-naïve subjects infected with CCR5-tropic HIV. The study will&#xD;
      compare the virologic benefit of vicriviroc combined with ritonavir-boosted Reyataz to a&#xD;
      control group receiving Truvada plus ritonavir-boosted Reyataz. Interim analyses will be&#xD;
      performed when the first cohort of 80 subjects have completed 24 weeks and 48 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. The second cohort of 120 subjects will be enrolled after the first interim&#xD;
      analysis; a third interim analysis will be performed when subjects in this second cohort have&#xD;
      completed 24 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when all 200&#xD;
      subjects from both stages have completed 48 weeks of treatment or discontinued. The final&#xD;
      analysis will be performed at Week 96, when all 200 subjects have completed 96 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment or discontinued. If vicriviroc is shown to provide benefit at the studied dose,&#xD;
      study participants in the vicriviroc arm who complete 96 weeks of treatment may continue in a&#xD;
      protocol extension, where they will be offered vicriviroc free of charge until the drug is&#xD;
      commercially available in their location or until the sponsor terminates the clinical&#xD;
      development of vicriviroc.&#xD;
