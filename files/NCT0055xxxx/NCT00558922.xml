    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multicenter, phase 1-2 study. Following determination of the&#xD;
      recommended AEG35156 dose in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in the initial Phase&#xD;
      1 part of this study, additional patients will be enrolled in the Phase 2 part of the study&#xD;
      to assess the activity of the combination in advanced non small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apoptotic induction in cancer cells is a sought after therapeutic goal. Most successful&#xD;
      anticancer agents activate apoptosis pathways in the cancers they treat. Apoptotic pathways&#xD;
      in cells appear to converge on a single family of enzymes, the caspases, which are proteases&#xD;
      that dismantle the cell in an orderly, non-inflammatory fashion, resulting in cell death. The&#xD;
      X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis (XIAP) is the only known cellular inhibitor of caspases, its&#xD;
      over expression thereby blocking the principal means of apoptosis. A wide range of evidence&#xD;
      indicates that cellular overexpression of members of the IAP family is a fundamental means by&#xD;
      which many cancer cells evade death, even in the presence of strong extrinsic (death&#xD;
      receptor-mediated) and intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) apoptotic cues. The inhibition of&#xD;
      cellular XIAP activity, specifically in cancer cells under stress and primed for apoptosis by&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents, is viewed as a powerful means of tipping the balance towards cell&#xD;
      death. In particular, XIAP down regulation has been shown to enhance taxane cytotoxicity&#xD;
      preclinically. AEG35156 is a second generation antisense which targets XIAP mRNA to lower&#xD;
      XIAP levels and the apoptotic threshold of cancer cells, enhancing their sensitivity to&#xD;
      intrinsic death and chemotherapy. AEG35156 may thus enhance the anticancer activity of&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer&#xD;
