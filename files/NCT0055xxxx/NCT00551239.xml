      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and pixantrone, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving&#xD;
      fludarabine together with rituximab is more effective with or without pixantrone in treating&#xD;
      indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying fludarabine and rituximab to compare how&#xD;
      well they work with or without pixantrone in treating patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
           indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with fludarabine phosphate and rituximab with vs&#xD;
           without pixantrone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the overall objective response rate (complete response [CR], unconfirmed&#xD;
           complete response [CRu], and partial response [PR]) in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the CR and CRu rate in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the duration of response and time to progression in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the overall survival and disease-specific survival of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the safety (including cardiac safety) and tolerability of these regimens in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by Follicular Lymphoma&#xD;
      International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score (0 or 1 vs ≥ 2), number of prior treatments (1&#xD;
      or 2 vs &gt; 2), and prior anti-CD20 regimen (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (control): Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1 and fludarabine phosphate IV on&#xD;
           days 2-4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses* in the absence of&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive rituximab and fludarabine phosphate as in arm I. Patients also&#xD;
           receive pixantrone IV on day 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses* in&#xD;
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Only patients achieving complete response, unconfirmed complete response, or partial&#xD;
      response after 4 courses receive courses 5 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.&#xD;
