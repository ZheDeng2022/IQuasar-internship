  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if standardizing fluid intake in a clinic setting&#xD;
      will reduce variability of individual voiding parameters and potentially serve as a way to&#xD;
      limit patient exposure in the initial assessment of efficacy of compounds being developed for&#xD;
      Overactive Bladder.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants will be females who are 18 years of age or older, with&#xD;
             Overactive Bladder as evidenced by daily episodes of urgency without incontinence,&#xD;
             which may be associated with frequency or nocturia but without bladder pain. At&#xD;
             screening, eligible patients must report frequency, defined as at least 8 micturitions&#xD;
             per 24 hour period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients must have signed the informed consent and must meet all inclusion&#xD;
             and exclusion criteria as determined during the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any abnormality identified on the screening examination or any other medical condition&#xD;
             or circumstance making the patient unsuitable for participation in the study based on&#xD;
             the Investigator's and Medical Monitor's assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindication to Detrol LA or other anti-muscarinic medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to consume 10 cc/kg of fluid within 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular alcohol consumption averaging ³7 drinks/week for women (1 drink = 100mL of&#xD;
             wine or 285mL of beer or 30mL of hard liquor)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive urine drug or alcohol at screening at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Average blood pressure measurements systolic ≥140 or diastolic ≥90 at screening at&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTcB value ≥ 450 msec at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus or hypertension, as evidenced by a change in&#xD;
             medication within the 2 months prior to initiation of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of urinary retention or gastric retention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of narrow-angle glaucoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of QT prolongation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known reduction in hepatic or renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant Use of loop diuretics (eg. Furosemide)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of a medication that is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmic medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is unable and/or unwilling to adhere to Lifestyle Guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of child bearing potential, a positive serum β-hCG at screening or pre-dose,&#xD;
             or an unwillingness to agree to adequate contraception from the time of screening&#xD;
             until the completion of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive for hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen or HIV at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of urinary tract infection within 4 weeks of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-void residual of &gt;150 mL (bladder ultrasound).&#xD;
