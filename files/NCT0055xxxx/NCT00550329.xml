             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate&#xD;
             measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests). Subjects below the age of 21&#xD;
             years must have consent from either a parent or guardian in countries having this&#xD;
             requirement.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits, treatment plan,&#xD;
             laboratory tests and other study procedures.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or&#xD;

          3. A positive urine drug screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14&#xD;
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer&#xD;

             study medication.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Sitting blood pressure ?140 mm Hg systolic or ?90 mm Hg diastolic on a single&#xD;
             measurement [confirmed by a single repeat, if necessary] following at least 5 minutes&#xD;
             of rest at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential who are unwilling or&#xD;
             unable to use an acceptable method of non-hormonal contraception as outlined in this&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, vitamins and dietary supplements within&#xD;
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication. Herbal supplements and hormonal methods of contraception (including oral&#xD;
             and transdermal contraceptives, injectable progesterone, progestin subdermal implants,&#xD;
             progesterone-releasing IUDs, postcoital contraceptive methods) and hormone replacement&#xD;
             therapy must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
             Depo-Proveraï¿½ must be discontinued at least 6 months prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication. As an exception, acetaminophen may be used at doses of ?1g/day. Other&#xD;
             exceptions may be granted by a qualified member of Pfizer study management.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines described in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
