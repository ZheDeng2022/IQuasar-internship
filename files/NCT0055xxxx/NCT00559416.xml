  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some HIV-infected individuals have a white blood cell marker known as HLA-B*57 that appears&#xD;
      to help control the progress of the disease; however, not all who have the HLA-B*57 marker&#xD;
      are able to control the infection. This study will examine the effects of giving white blood&#xD;
      cells with HLA-B*57 from an individual who controls HIV infection to an individual who cannot&#xD;
      control HIV infection, as a form of HIV treatment. All candidates will be screened with a&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both donor and recipient volunteers must be HIV-positive individuals 18 years of age or older&#xD;
      who have the HLA-B*57 marker and are receiving care. Donor candidates must have positive HIV&#xD;
      antibody tests for at least seven years with a recent CD4 cell count greater than 400&#xD;
      cells/mm?, HIV viral load less than 50 copies/mL, and no previous HIV viral load greater than&#xD;
      1,000 copies/mL. Recipient candidates must have positive HIV antibody tests with a recent CD4&#xD;
      cell count less than 400 cells/mm? and HIV viral load greater than 10,000 copies/mL, and must&#xD;
      have failed at least two prior combination antiretroviral regimes and are willing to receive&#xD;
      or resume combination antiretroviral therapy. Donor volunteers will be excluded if they have&#xD;
      taken certain antiretrovirals drugs, have a medical history of cancer or of other blood-borne&#xD;
      illnesses, or have other medical conditions that might interfere with the study. Recipient&#xD;
      volunteers will be excluded if they have a medical history of malignant cancer or other&#xD;
      medical conditions that might possibly interfere with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will undergo apheresis to separate white blood cells from circulating blood before the&#xD;
      red blood cells and plasma are returned to the bloodstream. The procedure will take up to&#xD;
      five hours, and donors will be required to return for additional tests. Donors may be asked&#xD;
      to return for further white blood cell donations, a maximum of six procedures per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will undergo apheresis to obtain stem cells for possible use in the study, and&#xD;
      will be admitted to an NIH Clinical Center inpatient unit to receive an infusion of white&#xD;
      blood cells and undergo a series of blood tests both before and after the infusion. The&#xD;
      infusion process will take two hours. After being discharged, recipients will be asked to&#xD;
      return to the Clinical Center for monitoring and follow-up tests, and may receive further&#xD;
      infusions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Improvements in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)&#xD;
      treatments in the United States have made the disease in many cases a chronic illness.&#xD;
      However, many individuals have failed multiple lines of standard therapy, and thus,&#xD;
      development of new modes of salvage treatment is crucial. Restriction of viral replication,&#xD;
      mediated by CD8+ cells, appears to play an important role in control of HIV replication. A&#xD;
      subset of individuals, many of whom possess human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*57 exhibit&#xD;
      restriction of HIV type 1 viral replication to less than 50 copies/mL, presumably by a&#xD;
      mechanism that is CD8+ T-cell mediated, and become elite long-term non-progressors (LTNP),&#xD;
      who have no evidence of progressive immunodeficiency and no development of opportunistic&#xD;
      complications during many years of follow-up. Other individuals, including those with&#xD;
      HLA-B*57 show no evidence of control of HIV replication, and without antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      will develop progressive immunodeficiency and HIV-related opportunistic complications. In&#xD;
      this exploratory study, we are investigating a novel cell transfer strategy: up to 3 patients&#xD;
      with HIV infection have failed at least 2 standard regimens of antiretroviral therapy, have a&#xD;
      CD4+ count under 200 cells/mm (3), and a plasma HIV viral load of greater than 10,000&#xD;
      copies/mL, will be administered 10 (10) peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained by&#xD;
      lymphapheresis from an &quot;elite&quot; LTNP matched to the recipient on at least one HLA-B allele. Up&#xD;
      to 70 patients may be enrolled for screening to identify 3 donors and 3 recipients. Up to 3&#xD;
      infusions may be administered per patient, with each infusion occurring no more frequently&#xD;
      than every 3 months. The primary endpoints will be the safety of the infusions and the&#xD;
      survival of donor cells in the recipient. Changes in the recipient s CD4+ and CD8+ cell&#xD;
      number, other immune parameters, and plasma HIV viral load will also be monitored closely for&#xD;
      evidence of anti-HIV activity.&#xD;
