  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice of the chronic renal insufficiency arrived&#xD;
      at its final stage. Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant treatment used for the prevention of&#xD;
      episodes of acute rejection. Tacrolimus is characterized by a narrow therapeutic index and&#xD;
      important interindividual variations of its pharmacokinetic characteristics. Proteins CYP3A4&#xD;
      and CYP3A5 are responsible of intestinal and hepatic metabolism of Tacrolimus. Various&#xD;
      polymorphisms for CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 were described and several retrospective studies&#xD;
      suggested an association between a genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5 and the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters of Tacrolimus. In particular, we showed that the presence of an allele CYP3A5*1&#xD;
      was associated to the use of more important amounts of Tacrolimus to obtain the desired blood&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a national, multicentric, prospective, opened, randomized on two arms of&#xD;
      treatment. 280 receivers of a renal transplant in 12 centres will be included. The genotyping&#xD;
      of gene CYP3A5 will be carried out in the 6 days following transplantation. During the first&#xD;
      week, the patients will be treated by basiliximab, MMF and corticosteroids. They will be&#xD;
      randomized (central randomization) in D6 to receive either Tacrolimus at 0.2 mg/kg/d, or at a&#xD;
      dosage adapted to their genotype. After determination of the first residual blood&#xD;
      concentration of Tacrolimus realized after six oral intakes, the daily amounts of Tacrolimus&#xD;
      could be modified if necessary to reach the desired blood concentrations. The total duration&#xD;
      of the study for a patient is 3 months after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the adaptation, according to the&#xD;
      genotype of the CYP3A5 of the patient, of the first amount of Tacrolimus on the first&#xD;
      residual blood concentration of Tacrolimus, keeping in mind the aim of the individualization&#xD;
      of dosage schedule by pharmacogenetic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal criterion : Comparison, between the two groups, of the percentage of patients for&#xD;
      whom the first blood concentration of Tacrolimus evaluated 3 days (D10) after the first&#xD;
      administration of Tacrolimus ranges between 10 and 15 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics will be carried out in intention to treat. The principal criterion will be&#xD;
      analyzed by the test of chi-2.&#xD;

&#xD;
      TREATMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Tacrolimus In the two arms of treatment Tacrolimus will be given at D7 post transplantation&#xD;
      according to the group of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dosage schedule of Tacrolimus will be different according to the group of&#xD;
      randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: 0,10 mg/kg 2 times per day for all the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  0,125 mg/kg 2 times per day (CYP3A5 *1/*1 or *1/*3)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  0,075 mg/kg 2 times per day (CYP3A5*3/*3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first residual blood concentration (C0) of Tacrolimus will be evaluated after 6&#xD;
      administrations of PrografÂ®, at D10. The dosage schedule of Tacrolimus will then be adapted&#xD;
      freely according to the therapeutic pharmacological follow-up of Tacrolimus specified in the&#xD;
      protocol, that is to say 10 to 15 ng/ml, whatever the group of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basiliximab All the patients will receive two injections of basiliximab per intravenous&#xD;
           way (first injection before transplantation and second injection at D4),20 Mg by intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Corticotherapy in decreasing amount as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  D0: 500 Mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  D1: 125 Mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  D2 - D15: 20 Mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  D16 - M1: 15 Mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  M1 - M3: 10 Mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MMF The MMF will be given 3 gr. per day during the first 15 days, then 2 G per day&#xD;
           adapted according to the clinical and biological tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study the following treatments will not be authorized :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immunosuppressants other than those proposed; ciclosporin, sirolimus, azathioprine,&#xD;
           plasmatic exchanges; intravenous immunoglobulins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastric bandages [gastric protections (inhibitors of the H+ pump) are authorized].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatments presenting an interaction with P-glycoprotein or cytochromes P450 3A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any drug not having a marketing authorization. All the concomitant drugs taken by the&#xD;
           patient during this study must be written in the CRF as all the drugs the patient would&#xD;
           have taken in the 7 days before transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of this test will be done at the end of the inclusion on all the patients&#xD;
      according to the principle of Intention To Treat Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients being able to be excluded from this analysis will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients not having taken no amount of the evaluated drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients without data collected after the randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis per-protocol will be carried out. From this analysis could be excluded in an&#xD;
      additional way to the preceding analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  declared patients not compliants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients who left the study for another reason that the inefficiency of the treatment or&#xD;
           an undesirable event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients having taken during the study one or more prohibited treatments which can&#xD;
           influence the effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTIC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of the necessary number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One defines as a success: The event &quot;blood concentration of Tacrolimus is between 10 and 15&#xD;
      ng/ml after 6 administrations per bone&quot; One defines as a failure: The event &quot;blood&#xD;
      concentration of Tacrolimus is not between 10 and 15 ng/ml after 6 administrations per bone&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The awaited percentage of event is 40% in group A (dosage schedule of Tacrolimus according to&#xD;
      recommendations: 0,20/kg/d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is made the assumption that the adaptation of the dosage schedule of Tacrolimus according&#xD;
      to genetics will increase the success rate to 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By setting an alpha risk = 5%, a beta risk = 10%, in bilateral formulation, by balancing the&#xD;
      randomization (1/1), it are necessary to include 140 subjects by group to show an absolute&#xD;
      difference of 20% of success between the 2 groups, that is to say 1 year of inclusion and 1&#xD;
      year and 3 months of study.&#xD;
