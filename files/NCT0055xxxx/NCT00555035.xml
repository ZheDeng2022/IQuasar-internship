        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as judged by a responsible physician with no clinically significant&#xD;
             abnormality identified on the medical or laboratory evaluation, including 12-lead ECG.&#xD;
             A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference&#xD;
             range for this age group may be included only if the Investigator considers that the&#xD;
             finding will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the&#xD;
             study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is ≥18 and ≤55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),&#xD;
             including any female who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has had a hysterectomy or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has had a bilateral oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has had a bilateral tubal ligation or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is post-menopausal (a demonstration of total cessation of menses for ≥ 1 year&#xD;
                  from the date of screening visit). A follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level&#xD;
                  will be performed to confirm a post-menopausal state. For this study FSH levels ≥&#xD;
                  40mIU/mL are consistent with menopause. If a subject is on estrogen replacement&#xD;
                  and menopausal status is questionable, estrogen replacement should be&#xD;
                  discontinued for 2 weeks and then the subject rescreened, as estrogen replacement&#xD;
                  can suppress FSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male is eligible to enter and participate in the study if he is surgically sterile&#xD;
             OR if he either agrees to abstain from sexual intercourse with a female partner or&#xD;
             agrees to use a condom/spermicide, in addition to having his female partner use&#xD;
             another form of contraception, such as an intrauterine device (IUD), occlusive cap&#xD;
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault cap) with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable&#xD;
             progesterone, subdermal implants, female condom, contraceptive patch, or contraceptive&#xD;
             vaginal ring, or has had a tubal ligation or hysterectomy. These criteria must be&#xD;
             followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 14 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg (110 lbs.) for men and ≥ 45 kg (99 lbs.) for women and body mass&#xD;
             index (BMI) between 18.5-29.9 kg/m2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject prior to&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions&#xD;
             and protocol-stated restrictions and is likely to complete the study as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;

             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of&#xD;
             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History/evidence of symptomatic or asymptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary&#xD;
             artery bypass grafting surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or&#xD;
             any clinically significant cardiac disease.&#xD;

             drinks/week for men (1 drink (12 g alcohol) = 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 12 ounces&#xD;
             (360 ml) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits) within 6 months&#xD;

             months of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug and/or alcohol screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling to refrain from the use of illicit drugs and adhere to other protocol-stated&#xD;
             restrictions while participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has received an investigational drug or participated in any other research&#xD;
             trial within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect&#xD;
             of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in the study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500 mL&#xD;

             physician responsible, contraindicates their participation. In addition, if heparin is&#xD;
             used during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or&#xD;
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.&#xD;

             and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort and iron supplements) within 7 days&#xD;
             (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator and sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures&#xD;
             or compromise subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, or&#xD;
