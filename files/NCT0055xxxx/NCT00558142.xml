  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of people receive radiographic contrast material for investigations like CT and&#xD;
      coronary angiography. While considered safe in healthy patients, it can cause acute renal&#xD;
      impairment. This is termed radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN) and is generally defined&#xD;
      as an increase in serum creatinine over baseline of more than 25% or 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 μmol/l)&#xD;
      within 48 hrs. RCIN occurs in less than 2% of patients with normal renal function but is more&#xD;
      common in patients with pre-existing renal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of RCIN is unclear. Possible mechanisms involve 1) reduced renal blood&#xD;
      flow leading to acute tubular necrosis and 2) direct renal tubular injury by oxygen free&#xD;
      radicals. Current prevention strategies focus on increasing renal blood flow and reducing&#xD;
      oxidative stress. Patients at risk of RCIN currently receive fluids, a low dose of contrast,&#xD;
      and variable and unproven doses of acetylcysteine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence for acetylcysteine administration is unclear. A RCIN consensus working group&#xD;
      reported in the American Journal of Cardiology in September 2006 that &quot;N-acetylcysteine is&#xD;
      not consistently effective in reducing the risk for contrast-induced nephropathy&quot;. The&#xD;
      perception of a benefit from acetylcysteine administration that is unproven has disadvantages&#xD;
      as some clinicians report giving larger amounts of radio-contrast to patients who have&#xD;
      received acetylcysteine since they believe that it prevents RCIN. There is a need to&#xD;
      determine how acetylcysteine might prevent RCIN and to identify the appropriate dose and&#xD;
      route of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since acetylcysteine is a vasodilator as well as an antioxidant, it may work in two distinct&#xD;
      ways, by preventing reduction in renal blood flow (RBF) or contrast-induced oxidative damage.&#xD;
      Previous studies have used changes in serum creatinine. In addition to being an insensitive&#xD;
      marker of altered renal function, if contrast causes renal vasoconstriction and&#xD;
      acetylcysteine vasodilatation, changes in serum creatinine will not be the ideal marker of&#xD;
      effect. Finally the optimum dose and route of acetylcysteine administration is unclear, as&#xD;
      illustrated by studies using a variety of doses and routes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study the mechanism of effects of acetylcysteine on healthy and diseased&#xD;
      kidneys, both unstressed and stressed by radiocontrast administration. We hypothesise that&#xD;
      acetylcysteine may exert a renoprotective effect in RCIN by a renal vasodilatation and/or&#xD;
      antioxidant mechanism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will test the hypothesis that acetylcysteine exerts a renoprotective effect&#xD;
      in RCIN by an antioxidant and/or renal vasodilator mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will take a structured 4-part approach, using randomised controlled cross-over studies to&#xD;
      assess the effect of acetylcysteine on renal function in both normal and diseased kidneys,&#xD;
      and then the effect of contrast on normal kidneys, with and without acetylcysteine treatment.&#xD;
      We will also perform a parallel-group randomised controlled trial of angiography on CKD&#xD;
      patients with and without acetylcysteine treatment. The four groups will be studied&#xD;
      simultaneously. As per the decision of the MHRA, this study is a phase IV trial of an&#xD;
      authorized medication rather than a phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed simultaneously in four groups of participants, studying:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. healthy volunteers receiving acetylcysteine PO, acetylcysteine IV, or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. volunteers with stage III CKD receiving acetylcysteine PO, acetylcysteine IV, or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. healthy volunteers receiving radiographic contrast plus acetylcysteine PO,&#xD;
           acetylcysteine IV, or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. patients with stage III CKD receiving radiographic contrast for elective coronary&#xD;
           angiography plus acetylcysteine PO, acetylcysteine IV, or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility at the Royal&#xD;
      Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE). Volunteers will be paid £120 to cover travelling and other&#xD;
      expenses for each study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDIES 1 AND 2 These studies will assess the effect of acetylcysteine alone in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers or in volunteers with stage III CKD. Volunteers will be randomised to a three-way,&#xD;
      cross-over, double-blind comparison of matched placebo with oral and intravenous regimens of&#xD;
      acetylcysteine. The primary outcome will be change in RBF (measured as para-aminohippuric&#xD;
      acid [PAH] clearance). In addition, GFR (measured as inulin clearance), tubular function&#xD;
      (fractional excretion of potassium and sodium), oxidative balance (total oxidative capacity,&#xD;
      plasma and urinary isoprostanes), and plasma and urinary endothelin-1 will be assayed. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of acetylcysteine will be measured to compare IV and PO regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be randomised to receive on three occasions, separated by at least two weeks,&#xD;
      one of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) placebo capsules PO, plus an IV infusion acetylcysteine in normal saline. B)&#xD;
      acetylcysteine capsules PO, plus an infusion of normal saline. C) placebo capsules PO, plus&#xD;
      an infusion of normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE JUSTIFICATION There are currently no data to guide choice of an optimum oral or IV&#xD;
      acetylcysteine regimen. This study will assess the effects of an IV and an oral dose of&#xD;
      acetylcysteine (IV 200mg/kg; PO 68.6 mg/kg) that are very similar to those currently used in&#xD;
      clinical practice. The oral dose is expected to produce a plasma concentration much lower&#xD;
      than the IV dose; however, it is believed that a first pass effect after oral administration&#xD;
      may increase conversion in the liver of acetylcysteine into cysteine and then glutathione,&#xD;
      increasing the efficacy of an oral dose. The first clinical trials in RCIN used an arbitrary&#xD;
      low dose oral regimen of acetylcysteine - 600mg twice a day (BD) for 2 days, starting the day&#xD;
      before dye administration (total dose 2.4 g, 34.3 mg/kg in a 70kg patient). Recent studies&#xD;
      have used higher total doses of up to 1500mg BD for 2 days (total dose 6 g, 85.7 mg/kg in a&#xD;
      70kg patient). IV regimens have also been assessed since they have been proposed to be&#xD;
      effective when started on the same day as the dye administration, rather than the day before.&#xD;
      The first trial used a dose similar to that used for early treatment of paracetamol-induced&#xD;
      hepatotoxicity - 150 mg/kg over 30 min, then 50mg/kg over 4 hrs (total dose 200 mg/kg) - and&#xD;
      reported less nephropathy. Other studies used lower doses (eg. 500 mg over 15 mins [7.1 mg/kg&#xD;
      in 70 kg patient] or 1000 mg twice, before and after the procedure, [28.5 mg/kg in 70kg&#xD;
      patient]) and did not find any benefit. Overall, the choice of acetylcysteine regimen for&#xD;
      previous studies seems to have been based on ease and prior practice in paracetamol poisoning&#xD;
      rather than knowledge of acetylcysteine's effects on the kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have chosen a revised IV high dose regimen derived from PK data published by Dr L Prescott&#xD;
      after Monte Carlo simulations (Dr R Thanacoody, Consultant Clinical Pharmacologist, Edinburgh&#xD;
      Royal infirmary, unpublished) for 2 reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the RCT that showed benefit with IV acetylcysteine used a high dose regimen similar to&#xD;
           that used for paracetamol poisoning (150 mg/kg over 30 min, then 50 mg/kg over 4 hrs).&#xD;
           The subsequent negative studies used much lower doses, suggesting that IV acetylcysteine&#xD;
           may need to be given in high doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the high peak plasma concentration that results from the rapid initial infusion of&#xD;
           acetylcysteine for paracetamol poisoning produces nausea in about 40% of patients and&#xD;
           anaphylactoid reactions in about 20%. Although these reactions are routine and normally&#xD;
           easily treated, it is important to reduce the rate of such reactions in study&#xD;
           participants. The revised regimen provides a similar amount of acetylcysteine but&#xD;
           administers it more evenly across 7 hours, producing a lower peak acetylcysteine&#xD;
           concentration and a lower likelihood of nausea and anaphylactoid reactions (Dr R&#xD;
           Thanacoody, unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of oral acetylcysteine regimen is necessarily arbitrary. We will use 1200 mg since&#xD;
      there is some evidence that it is more effective than the more usually administered 600 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY 3 This study will assess the effect of acetylcysteine on renal function in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers receiving a single IV 100ml dose of Visipaque 320 (iodixanol, equivalent to 320 mg&#xD;
      iodine/ml), an iso-osmolar non-ionic radio-contrast agent, via a peripheral cannula. We chose&#xD;
      this dose because 100 mls are routinely used in the Royal Infirmary for coronary angiography&#xD;
      in CKD patients (Radiology Dept, personal communication). Larger doses of up to 400 ml are&#xD;
      then used if an angioplasty is subsequently required. Such doses fall within the doses&#xD;
      recommended in the summary of product characteristics, Martindale, and the literature. The&#xD;
      safety profile of such doses in healthy adults is excellent; in patients with CKD, iodixanol&#xD;
      is at least as safe as other contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be randomised in this study to a three-way, cross-over, double-blind&#xD;
      comparison of placebo with oral and intravenous regimens of acetylcysteine. They will not&#xD;
      receive coronary angiography, just the intravenous contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study healthy volunteers in order to identify the effects of NAC and contrast on&#xD;
      healthy kidneys. This will provide baseline data for interpreting the studies in CKD&#xD;
      patients. In addition, while healthy patients rarely get RCIN after contrast administration,&#xD;
      the currently used marker of RCIN (raised serum creatinine) is a crude measure of renal&#xD;
      dysfunction - since GFR will only fall after renal RBF has been substantially reduced for a&#xD;
      significant period of time. It is likely that small sub-clinical changes will occur in&#xD;
      healthy patients that will help determine how contrast and NAC affect the kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY 4 This study will assess the effect of acetylcysteine on renal function in stable stage&#xD;
      III CKD patients receiving 100 ml of iodixanol during routine coronary angiography. Recruited&#xD;
      patients will not receive multiple angiographies so study 4 will not be a crossover&#xD;
      comparison but a randomised controlled study of oral acetylcysteine vs. IV acetylcysteine vs.&#xD;
      placebo. Results from studies 1-3 will inform the analysis and interpretation of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS OF RENAL FUNCTION Most previous RCTs have measured changes in serum creatinine&#xD;
      concentration rather than any direct measures of renal failure. Serum creatinine&#xD;
      concentration can provide information on GFR. However, it is not accurate since it is&#xD;
      affected by diet, aging and muscle mass. Furthermore, acetylcysteine also lowers serum&#xD;
      creatinine concentration itself, suggesting that the lower creatinine noted in the RCTs may&#xD;
      not actually reflect improved renal function. GFR is the best marker of global renal&#xD;
      function. It can be directly measured using the 51Cr-EDTA method but this is a complicated&#xD;
      technique. We will use an alternative method by measuring plasma clearance of inulin. Serum&#xD;
      cystatin C concentration may be a better marker of GFR than creatinine. Cystatin C is a small&#xD;
      cysteine protease that is secreted at a fixed rate by all nucleated cells and is not affected&#xD;
      by diet or muscle mass. In RCIN, serum cystatin concentration peaks and normalises more&#xD;
      rapidly than creatinine. We will measure cystatin C in these patients to assess whether it&#xD;
      would be a better marker of GFR in future RCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in renal blood flow after acetylcysteine and/or contrast administration will be&#xD;
      assessed by measuring plasma PAH clearance. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent endogenous&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor and increased urinary ET-1 has been associated with the development of RCIN.&#xD;
      Changes in renal ET-1 production will be measured following acetylcysteine and/or contrast by&#xD;
      measuring ET-1 concentrations in plasma and urine and calculating its fractional excretion.&#xD;
      Renal tubular function will be assessed by measuring the kidney's fractional excretion of&#xD;
      sodium and potassium. Reductions in fractional excretion of these ions will supply&#xD;
      information on renal perfusion and tubular function, and have been noted previously in RCIN.&#xD;
      We will also measure urine levels of proteins released from damaged tubular cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since acetylcysteine should alter oxidative state, we will measure the oxidative balance&#xD;
      through assays for plasma and urinary isoprostanes, plasma N-acetylcysteine, peripheral blood&#xD;
      cell glutathione, and total antioxidant capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMINISTRATION OF ORAL ACETYLCYSTEINE/PLACEBO Participants will receive 3 blister packs of&#xD;
      acetylcysteine or placebo capsules and be asked to take the appropriate capsules at 08.00 and&#xD;
      20.00 on the day before the study day (Day 1; Day 2 being the day spent in the CRF). They&#xD;
      will also be asked to drink an extra 500ml of water to ensure adequate hydration. Hard&#xD;
      capsules containing acetylcysteine 600 mg or matched placebo (Lactose PhEur 600 mg) will be&#xD;
      prepared by Tayside Pharmaceuticals, Dundee, and packaged in patient packs of 8 capsules. The&#xD;
      capsules will be delivered to the hospital pharmacy and supplied to participants according to&#xD;
      the randomized allocation order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF DRUGS Inulin and PAH will be administered through a 20G venous&#xD;
      cannula inserted into the forearm. Inulin and PAH will be infused at a constant infusion rate&#xD;
      throughout the 8 hour study period. Acetylcysteine/placebo will be administered through a&#xD;
      second 20G venous cannula inserted into the same forearm. We will use the intravenous&#xD;
      acetylcysteine preparation currently used in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (Parvolex, UCB&#xD;
      Pharma Limited). Placebo will be sodium chloride solution for infusion. Active or placebo&#xD;
      infusions will be prepared by the Clinical Research Facility on each study day according to&#xD;
      the randomized allocation order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VENOUS BLOOD SAMPLING Blood samples will be obtained via a 17G venous cannula inserted into&#xD;
      the other forearm. Samples will be taken hourly on 10 occasions from -1h (beginning of the&#xD;
      inulin/PAH infusion) to 8h; a total of 120 mls will be taken. Blood will also be sampled at&#xD;
      24h (09.00 on day 3) and 72h 09.00 on day 5); 24 ml at each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      URINE SAMPLING 40ml urine samples will be taken after voiding every two hours, from 0h to 8h&#xD;
      on day 1, and again at 24h (09.00 on day 3) and 72h (09.00 on day 5). Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to void urine on waking on days 3 and 5. At the end of each study, the venous cannulae&#xD;
      will be removed and haemostasis confirmed. Subjects will be provided with toast and a warm&#xD;
      beverage and observed for 30 minutes before leaving the unit.&#xD;
