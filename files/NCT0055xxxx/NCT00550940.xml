      This study aims to Investigate characteristics and prevalence of emotion/behavior problems in&#xD;
      child and adolescents with epilepsy; to identify the associated factors and their effects on&#xD;
      these children/adolescents; and to examine their attention by using Conners' Continuous&#xD;
      Performance Test (CPT).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Child and adolescents with epilepsy often have comorbid conditions such as emotion/behavior&#xD;
      problems and attention deficit, which usually result in great impact on their individual&#xD;
      functioning and their family. Neurological factors (e.g. central neural system disease,&#xD;
      mental retardation, and epilepsy factors), demographic factors (low socioeconomic, age,&#xD;
      gender), family factors, child's attitude to epilepsy, parental psychopathology and their&#xD;
      attitude may associate with the presentation of behavior and attention in child and&#xD;
      adolescents with epilepsy. In addition, these risk factors may affect via some pathways.&#xD;
      Previous studies were conducted mainly in Caucasians, and few researches were conducted in&#xD;
      Chinese population. Furthermore, previous studies demonstrated inconsistent findings&#xD;
      regarding the related risk factors for epilepsy. Therefore, it is important to conduct a&#xD;
      study investigating systematically the potential risk factors for epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional and hospital -based study. The participants include 80 child and&#xD;
      adolescents who are 6 to 18 years old and 80 control subjects. The instruments include the&#xD;
      Chinese version of Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36),&#xD;
      Child Attitude Toward Illness Scale (CATIS), the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham, version IV&#xD;
      (SNAP-IV), Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), Family APGAR, Chinese Health Questionnaire&#xD;
      (CHQ-12), impact of childhood illness scale, drug compliance scale. We will also collect&#xD;
      related information from chart record, and then analyze for emotion/behavior presentation and&#xD;
      to identify the risk factors for epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that this study will reach the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to understand the characteristics and prevalence of emotion/behavior problems and&#xD;
           attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome in child and adolescents with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate significant risk factors and the possible pathogenic pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to refer child and parents who have emotion problems&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to combine research and service across departments (departments of neurology and&#xD;
           psychiatry )&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to improve worldwide understanding of epilepsy by the results of this study&#xD;
