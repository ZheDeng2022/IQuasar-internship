    <textblock>
      The reason for doing this research is to understand why different people show different&#xD;
      responses when they smell an odor called androstadienone. Androstadienone is a chemical found&#xD;
      in male sweat. Other studies have shown that smelling this chemical can cause people to&#xD;
      experience sweating, changes in skin temperature, and changes in a stress hormone call&#xD;
      cortisol. These responses, which are called &quot;physiological effects,&quot; are stronger in some&#xD;
      people than in others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are interested in finding out whether these individual differences are genetic, that is&#xD;
      caused by differences in our genes. Humans have about 1000 genes for odorant receptors. These&#xD;
      are the molecules that bind and detect odor molecules in our nose and allow us to respond to&#xD;
      so many different odors. It has been shown that some of these genes exist in two forms: a&#xD;
      functional one and one that has been mutated and is therefore no longer functional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We think that people who do not respond to a specific odor may carry the non-functional form&#xD;
      of the gene for the receptor that detects the odor molecule. To test this idea we want to&#xD;
      find people who respond strongly to a specific smell, and compare their odorant receptor&#xD;
      genes with those of people who respond weakly to the odor.&#xD;

      The study consists of five visits. The first visit is a screening visit at which the&#xD;
      eligibility of the subject is determined and a blood sample is taken. At this visit, the&#xD;
      subject is also given ovulation test strips and instructions to perform urine-based ovulation&#xD;
      self-tests at home for a period of several days following the onset of menstruation. The&#xD;
      subject is instructed to test her urine at home until an LH surge is detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the subject ovulates and is available for a visit she will come to the Rockefeller&#xD;
      University Hospital within one day of detecting an LH surge for the first of four Test&#xD;
      Sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four Test Sessions are identical with the exception that the subject is exposed to a&#xD;
      different odor stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be measuring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. skin temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. sweating, as measured by skin conductance&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. salivary cortisol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. mood&#xD;
