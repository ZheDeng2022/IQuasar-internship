      This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects of oregovomab and to see how well&#xD;
      it works with or without cyclophosphamide in treating patients with stage III or stage IV&#xD;
      ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that responded&#xD;
      to second-line chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, such as oregovomab, can block tumor&#xD;
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others&#xD;
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether oregovomab is more effective when given together with or without cyclophosphamide in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube&#xD;
      cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the nonspecific humoral immune response, as measured by human anti-murine&#xD;
      antibodies (HAMA), in patients with stage III or IV ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or&#xD;
      primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma treated with consolidation therapy comprising adjuvant&#xD;
      oregovomab with vs without cyclophosphamide after achieving a complete clinical response to&#xD;
      second-line taxane/platinum-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the magnitude of the immune responses in these patients at approximately 14&#xD;
      weeks after the initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events, as assessed by NCI CTCAE&#xD;
      v3.0, in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the specific humoral immune response, as measured by HAMA and&#xD;
      anti-idiotype antibodies, in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the treatment emergent cellular immune response, by measuring the delayed-type&#xD;
      hypersensitivity response to the anergy panel and to oregovomab as compared to baseline, in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the duration of each patient's first progression-free interval after&#xD;
      primary chemotherapy and second progression-free interval after another regimen of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin testing with oregovomab and&#xD;
      a standard anergy panel (i.e., mumps, Candida, and tetanus toxoid) on day 0 (at baseline) and&#xD;
      at week 14. The skin test response is measured 48 hours later. Patients receive&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide IV on day 6 and oregovomab IV over 20 minutes on day 9 or 10. Patients then&#xD;
      receive oregovomab alone at weeks 6 and 10 and then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years (10&#xD;
      doses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo DTH skin testing and receive oregovomab as in arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are obtained from patients at baseline and at weeks 14 and 38 for immunologic&#xD;
      correlative studies. Samples are examined to determine CA-125 levels and human anti-murine&#xD;
      antibody (HAMA) and anti-idiotype antibody levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then&#xD;
      every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
