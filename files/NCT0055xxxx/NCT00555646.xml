      This is an open label, single center, controlled study with each subject's two treatment&#xD;
      plaque areas assigned by the investigator 1:1 to (a) PH-10 with ambient light exposure and&#xD;
      (b) PH-10 with 544 nm LED light illumination at 10 J/cm2. A third plaque area will receive no&#xD;
      treatment and serve as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with at least three distinct, stable study plaque areas will receive the&#xD;
      experimental therapy to two treatment plaque areas twice a week (2-5 days apart) for the&#xD;
      lesser of 12 weeks or until remission is observed in the treatment plaque areas. If remission&#xD;
      is observed in a treatment plaque area then treatment of that area will be discontinued and&#xD;
      the area assessed weekly. A third plaque area (control plaque area) will receive no drug or&#xD;
      light treatment and serve as an internal control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy will be assessed 12 weeks after initial PH-10 treatment. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for a total of 16 weeks to allow assessment of Durability of Response of treated&#xD;
      lesions and comprehensive follow-up of adverse events.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in at least three distinct plaque areas,&#xD;
             each separated by at least a 2.5-cm band of normal skin. Study plaque areas, each&#xD;
             covering a contiguous area up to 15 x 35 cm in size, should have a minimum plaque size&#xD;
             of 2 cm2. All study plaque areas must be on the trunk or extremities (excluding palms,&#xD;
             soles, scalp, and facial or intertriginous sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fitzpatrick skin type I-VI.&#xD;
&#xD;

             nursing an infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received PUVA or UVB light therapy or systemic antipsoriatic therapy&#xD;
             within 4 weeks of study treatment (two weeks for methotrexate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received topical antipsoriatic therapy (including corticosteroids,&#xD;
             tar, anthralin, or Vitamin D analogs) to the study plaque areas within 2 weeks of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received any photosensitizing or phototoxic drug within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received any approved biologic drug therapy for psoriasis within 3&#xD;
             months or 5 half-lives of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical research study within 4 weeks of study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus or xeroderma&#xD;
