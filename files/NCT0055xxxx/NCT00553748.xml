      This is a ten subject, phase 1 study. The purpose of the Phase 1 study is to demonstrate drug&#xD;
      safety in a target group of subjects with high grade brain cancer. This population represents&#xD;
      a potential clinical population that may benefit from this PET imaging tracer. The study will&#xD;
      also begin collection of baseline imaging data and allow us to gain information to improve&#xD;
      design and conduct of future trials.&#xD;

      This is a ten subject, phase 1 study. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate drug safety&#xD;
      in a group with high grade brain tumors and to evaluate cell proliferation with F-18 FLT. FLT&#xD;
      is known to clear out of normal brain and detect brain tumor. This population represents a&#xD;
      potential clinical population that may benefit from this PET imaging tracer. This information&#xD;
      will help improve the design and conduct of future F-18 FLT clinical trials.&#xD;
