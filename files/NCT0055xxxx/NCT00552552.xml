      The objective of this study is to develop a structured and evidence-based self-management&#xD;
      program to cope with cancer-related fatigue and to assess the efficacy of the intervention in&#xD;
      cancer survivors.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and its impact on patients quality of life has been an&#xD;
      increasing subject of research. However, in Germany exists a lack of evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions consistent with the multidimensional character of fatigue. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to develop and evaluate a self-management program for disease-free cancer&#xD;
      patients to cope with CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on evidence extracted from a literature review a curriculum for the self-management&#xD;
      program was elaborated. The curriculum is currently being reviewed and validated by an expert&#xD;
      group of oncologists, psycho-oncologists, nurses, social workers, physical therapists, health&#xD;
      scientists, and patients. The modules will be pretested with a small number of patients,&#xD;
      discussed in terms of feasibility and acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of the program a randomised controlled trial will be conducted: 300&#xD;
      patients will be allocated to an intervention or a waiting control group. Data will be&#xD;
      collected before randomisation, after intervention, and after a follow-up of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      As essential subjects for the curriculum were identified:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical background and causes of CRF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical activity and moderate exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  restructuring daily schedules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  energy conservation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stress-management and relaxation strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  coping with negative emotions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  integrating the new knowledge into every day life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program aims at impacting on health-related self-efficacy by the training of problem&#xD;
      solving, goal setting, and cognitive techniques as knowledge transfer hasn't proved&#xD;
      sufficient to achieve changes in behaviour. According to this we developed a curriculum&#xD;
      wherein detailed information for every module concerning objectives, background, didactic&#xD;
      methods and materials are provided. Based on the curriculum train-the-trainer seminars are&#xD;
      held in order to educate on moderation techniques, group dynamics, and clinical background of&#xD;
      CRF. The program will be administered by qualified health professionals in groups of eight&#xD;
      patients. It includes six weekly sessions 90 minutes each dealing with the topics listed&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the pre-test are currently being analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the fact that there are no comparable self-management programs for cancer survivors&#xD;
      with fatigue the development of the curriculum has been complex. Therefore the critical&#xD;
      appraisal by the experts was an important step to validate the program: their contributions&#xD;
      have been integrated into the curriculum. The experts appreciated the program as filling in a&#xD;
      gap of outpatient cancer care.&#xD;
