  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several recent reports support the efficacy of once every-other-week epoetinum administration&#xD;
      in the maintenance phase of the anaemia treatment in predialysis, haemodialysis and in&#xD;
      peritoneal dialysis CKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are studies suggesting that in HD patients receiving SC short-acting ESA&#xD;
      therapy, ESA efficacy decreases when the dosing is extended from thrice-weekly to once-weekly&#xD;
      administration. When every-2-week administration of long-acting ESAs is extended to every 4&#xD;
      weeks, efficacy either remains stable or decreases incrementally. The GAIN trial (Gain&#xD;
      effectiveness in Anemia treatment with NeoRecormon®) was designed to compare anemia&#xD;
      management with epoetin beta, epoetin alpha or darbepoetin alpha in HD patients. An interim&#xD;
      analysis of data from 1005 stable HD patients suggested that switching to epoetin beta from&#xD;
      either epoetin alpha or darbepoetin alpha resulted in improved efficacy and a 20% dose&#xD;
      reduction in SC epoetin beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare two schedules of anaemia treatment in HD patients using&#xD;
      two different erythropoietic stimulating agents (epoetinum beta vs darbepoetinum) with&#xD;
      respect to the efficacy in anaemia correction and to the haemoglobin (Hb) level stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter (2 centers), prospective, open-label, parallel, controlled trial of&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently available ESAs include epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, and darbepoetin. Epoetin alfa&#xD;
      and beta have been designed to resemble closely the endogenous molecule and have similar&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics. They are considered &quot;short-acting&quot; in comparison to darbepoetin, a&#xD;
      second-generation molecule with a prolonged half-life, which is considered &quot;long-acting.&quot;&#xD;
      European and American Best Practice Guidelines (EBPG) recommend preferential subcutaneous&#xD;
      (SC) twice- to thrice-weekly epoetin administration. There is a great deal of evidence that&#xD;
      once-weekly SC administration of epoetin beta to be equally efficient and well tolerated in&#xD;
      HD patients, even in those requiring high weekly epoetin doses. Several recent reports&#xD;
      support the efficacy of once every-other-week epoetinum administration in the maintenance&#xD;
      phase of the anaemia treatment in predialysis, haemodialysis and in peritoneal dialysis CKD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are studies suggesting that in HD patients receiving SC short-acting ESA&#xD;
      therapy, ESA efficacy decreases when the dosing is extended from thrice-weekly to once-weekly&#xD;
      administration. When every-2-week administration of long-acting ESAs is extended to every 4&#xD;
      weeks, efficacy either remains stable or decreases incrementally . The GAIN trial (Gain&#xD;
      effectiveness in Anemia treatment with NeoRecormon®) was designed to compare anemia&#xD;
      management with epoetin beta, epoetin alpha or darbepoetin alpha in HD patients. An interim&#xD;
      analysis of data from 1005 stable HD patients suggested that switching to epoetin beta from&#xD;
      either epoetin alpha or darbepoetin alpha resulted in improved efficacy and a 20% dose&#xD;
      reduction in SC epoetin beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare two schedules of anaemia treatment in HD patients using&#xD;
      two different erythropoietic stimulating agents (epoetinum beta vs darbepoetinum) with&#xD;
      respect to the efficacy in anaemia correction and to the haemoglobin (Hb) level stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed according to the Guidelines for studies testing the equivalence of&#xD;
      different treatment regimens , and will be conducted with the provisions of the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki and Tokio as amended in Venice (1983).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter (2 centers), prospective, open-label, parallel, controlled trial of&#xD;
      therapy equivalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total observation period is of 80 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The baseline phase (pre-therapeutic intervention) - 12 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first study phase of therapeutical intervention - 48 weeks: each the two groups of&#xD;
           patients will receive anaemia treatment according to the Romanian Best Practice&#xD;
           Guidelines either with epoetinum beta or with darbepoetinum;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second study phase of therapeutical intervention - 24 weeks: the patients from the&#xD;
           epoetinum beta group will be switched to darbepoetinum. The anaemia treatment will&#xD;
           continue according to the Romanian Best Practice Guidelines, using the recommended&#xD;
           conversion factor of 200 (Romanian Best Practice Guidelines, NKF-DOQI 2006, Revised&#xD;
           EBPG).&#xD;
&#xD;
           300 haemodialyzed patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
