  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of each of the rabeprazole treatment&#xD;
      regimens on nocturnal heartburn symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is limited data regarding the estimate of patients who experience nocturnal symptoms&#xD;
      despite adequate daytime heartburn control, the incidence and severity of nocturnal heartburn&#xD;
      episodes after a minimum of 4 weeks of acid suppressive therapy with a Proton-pump inhibitor&#xD;
      (PPI) or Histamine -2-receptor antagonist (H2RA), and the effect of instituting rabeprazole&#xD;
      therapy after failure to control nocturnal heartburn symptoms with other acid suppressive&#xD;
      therapy. This is a multicentre, randomised (study medication is assigned by chance),&#xD;
      controlled, parallel-group, open-label study in GERD patients. Patients will be screened and&#xD;
      enter a 2-week run-in phase to document heartburn symptoms while on their current therapy,&#xD;
      during which they will complete a daily diary of symptoms and antacid use. Patients who have&#xD;
      troublesome nocturnal heartburn episodes, but adequate daytime heartburn symptom control (as&#xD;
      defined) will enter an 8-week treatment phase where they are randomised to one of the&#xD;
      rabeprazole regimens: 20mg once daily in the evening (dose administered 30minutes prior to&#xD;
      the evening meal; &quot;QPM&quot; regimen), 10mg twice daily (dose administered 30minutes prior to the&#xD;
      morning and evening meals; &quot;BID/twice daily&quot; regimen) or 20mg once daily in the morning (dose&#xD;
      administered 30minutes prior to the morning meal; &quot;QAM/every morning&quot; regimen), plus antacids&#xD;
      as required. The study hypothesis is that after failure to control night-time heartburn&#xD;
      symptoms with other acid suppressive therapy, instituting rabeprazole will have a beneficial&#xD;
      effect. Safety assessments include: physical examination and pregnancy test at screening,&#xD;
      vital signs and weight at randomization and final visit, adverse event and concomitant&#xD;
      medication reporting at every visit. Rabeprazole 20mg once daily in the evening: one&#xD;
      rabeprazole 20mg tablet daily in the evening, 30-60 minutes before dinner for 56 days OR&#xD;
      Rabeprazole 10mg twice daily: one rabeprazole 10mg tablet in the morning, 30-60 minutes&#xD;
      before breakfast, and one rabeprazole 10mg tablet 30-60 minutes before dinner for 56 days. OR&#xD;
      Rabeprazole 20mg once daily in the morning: one rabeprazole 20mg tablet daily in the morning,&#xD;
      30-60 minutes before breakfast for 56 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had a minimum three-month history of symptomatic GERD, with&#xD;
             heartburn as the predominant symptom, and must report nocturnal heartburn symptoms&#xD;
             (i.e., heartburn symptoms experienced during the night-time period, between 2200 and&#xD;
             0600h)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must currently be taking a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) or histamine-2&#xD;
             receptor antagonist (H2RA) at least four weeks prior to study admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to read, write and understand the language of the HRQOL and&#xD;
             productivity assessment instruments (PAGI-SYM, PAGI-QOL, WPAI-GH) i.e., English or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have been at least 80% compliant with their current acid suppressive&#xD;

             during the run-in period (i.e. &lt;=3 &quot;missing&quot; nocturnal heartburn ratings during the&#xD;
