      The Purpose of this study is to examine the effect of using the Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint®&#xD;
      System on patients diagnosed with CTS in a randomized, controlled, cross-over study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy of treating Carpal tunnel Syndrome with the Dynasplint®&#xD;
      Systems device as compared to a non-treatment control group utilizing a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, cross-over study design. The dependant variables in this study are each patient's&#xD;
      score on a Levine-Katz disability and pain scale test, and the change in nerve conduction of&#xD;
      the median nerve that was tested upon diagnosis. The independent variables will include three&#xD;
      different patient groups separated by randomization. The first group of subjects (selected&#xD;
      randomly) will be fit with a therapeutic, functional Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® versus the&#xD;
      second, control patients will not be treated with dynamic splinting for the first sixty (60)&#xD;
      days. After the initial sixty (60) days, the original control patients will be fit with a&#xD;
      functional Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® system and this will allow examiner to evaluate for&#xD;
      further variance between subject groups, allowing the third group to be a Cross-Over group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The METHODS for this multi-centered study include recruiting patients from multiple hand&#xD;
      surgeons and neurologists and these patients will have been diagnosed with following the&#xD;
      physicians' physical examination and a nerve conduction test of the median nerve. The&#xD;
      subjects then will be briefed on this study and sign an informed consent as required by the&#xD;
      IRB before participating. Subjects who do consent will then be given the Levine-Katz&#xD;
      disability and pain scale test, and prior to being fit with the Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint®&#xD;
      Subjects will be taught how to use a Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® properly and after being fit&#xD;
      with the Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® each subject will be required to complete a weekly report&#xD;
      showing compliance to the wearing and treatment schedule, and they must attend regular,&#xD;
      monthly examinations by the referring physician. After the initial sixty (60) days in the&#xD;
      study each subject will repeat the three lead conduction test of the median nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects at this point will be fit with the Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® systems&#xD;
      becoming Cross-Over subjects and their final nerve conduction test will be administered after&#xD;
      they have worn the Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® system for sixty (60) days. Upon discharge from&#xD;
      this study all subjects will also retake the Levine-Katz disability and pain scale test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty (80) SUBJECTS will be recruited following diagnosis of CTS (using nerve conduction&#xD;
      testing of the median nerve for differential diagnosis) and group assignment will be&#xD;
      determined through randomization following each patient's completion of the informed consent&#xD;
      required by the IRB. All patients randomly selected to start in the experimental group will&#xD;
      be fit with functional Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® and the control group subjects will not be&#xD;
      fit until after sixty (60) days. When they are ultimately fit, they will then be categorized&#xD;
      as &quot;Cross-Over&quot; subjects to measure continued variance between all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DURATION for patients enrolled in this study will be sixty (60) days for the experimental&#xD;
      subjects and the control subjects will spend their first sixty (60) days as a control role&#xD;
      without treatment. However, following sixty days the initial control subjects but then they&#xD;
      will be refit with a functional Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® as a &quot;Cross-Over&quot; subject for an&#xD;
      additional sixty (60) days, which makes the control subjects duration in this study 120 days.&#xD;
