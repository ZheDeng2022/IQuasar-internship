      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain releases signals to mark rewards for certain behavior. Some medications for&#xD;
      Parkinson disease (PD) can cause some patients to engage in compulsive behavior, possibly&#xD;
      because the medications affect this reward system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), researchers can study brain activity when&#xD;
      an individual receives a reward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how the brains of people with PD behave when rewarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn whether two common Parkinson medications (levodopa and pramipexole) change this&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare reward signals in the brains of healthy volunteers with reward signals in the&#xD;
      brains of people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women between 50 and 80 years of age and men between 45 and 80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into healthy volunteers and volunteers who have mild to moderate&#xD;
      PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescreening will consist of a neurological examination and a series of questions about&#xD;
      gambling habits and drug and alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in a TMS study involving a computer game simulation of a slot machine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the simulation, participants will receive TMS to establish a baseline response&#xD;
           rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the simulation, participants will play a game in which they will receive real&#xD;
           money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS will be administered to each patient under three different conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMS administered when patients have not taken any Parkinson medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMS administered after patients have taken levodopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMS administered after patients have taken pramipexole....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The role of mesencephalic dopamine neurons in reward processing has been established in&#xD;
      primates using electrophysiological techniques and in humans using functional neuroimaging.&#xD;
      Their role is thought to be dual: i) they show sustained activity with the expectation of a&#xD;
      future reward and ii) a phasic response after reward. Animal data indicate that these&#xD;
      neurons, located in the midbrain areas A8-10, behave as a single functional unit when&#xD;
      activated. They have rich projections to both the prefrontal and motor cortices where they&#xD;
      synapse on interneurons and cortical pyramidal cells, producing primarily inhibition. Though&#xD;
      their function is not fully understood, these projections clearly play an important role in&#xD;
      motivation and learning. We have recently developed a pair of paradigms to detect a reward&#xD;
      related signal in the primary motor cortex, where transcranial magnetic stimulation can be&#xD;
      used to measure brief events. So far, we have tested healthy volunteers; we now intend to&#xD;
      study Parkinson disease (PD) patients in order to help clarify the role of dopamine in effect&#xD;
      of reward. The Parkinson patients will be tested both on and off levodopa/carbidopa and&#xD;
      dopamine agonist medications. Our hypothesis is that the dopamine reward related signal will&#xD;
      alter level of evocable inhibition in primary motor cortex. Using a behavioral paradigm that&#xD;
      deliver intermittent reward, we aim to demonstrate, in treated and untreated PD patients a&#xD;
      difference in the amount of cortical inhibition, i) when reward is expected compared to when&#xD;
      reward is not expected and ii) after rewarded compared to unrewarded trials. We also aim to&#xD;
      demonstrate a difference between their response and that of healthy controls.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEALTHY SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Age 45-70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mild-moderate disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-2).&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-menopausal status in women: Preliminary data in healthy, cycling women suggests&#xD;
             that the variation in paired-pulse inhibition caused by the menstrual cycle may&#xD;
             obscure the change in the response induced by the behavioral task.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant neurological or psychiatric history other than PD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to DA agonists within a month of study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of habitual gambling, defined as either visiting casinos more than once per&#xD;
             month or playing cards for money more than once per week or gambling over the internet&#xD;
             more than once per month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Habitual consumption of more than two drinks a day, marijuana more than once a week or&#xD;
             any other illicit drug use within the last three months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant abnormality on neurological examination other than PD related signs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metal in the cranial cavity or eye, pacemaker, implanted pumps or stimulators&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of non-PD related medications affecting the DA system, such as phenothiazine&#xD;
             antihistamines (promethazine), antiemetics or decongestants in the last month&#xD;
