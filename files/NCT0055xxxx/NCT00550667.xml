      This study aims to establish the psychometric properties of the Adult ADHD Quality of Life&#xD;
      Scale (AAQoL) and to validate the diagnosis of adult ADHD by ADHD symptoms, other clinical&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms, neuropsychological functioning, social/family/occupational functioning,&#xD;
      and intervention effect.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common (5-10%) childhood-onset&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disorder worldwide among children and adolescents with 50- 60% persistence&#xD;
      to adulthood (3-4%). Western studies have revealed a wide range of family/social/occupational&#xD;
      impairment and neurocognitive deficits in adults with ADHD. However, there is limited data on&#xD;
      the treatment effect for adults with ADHD worldwide and there is lack of information about&#xD;
      adult ADHD in Taiwan. In view of this, it is warranted to conduct a study on the clinical,&#xD;
      functional, and neurocognitive aspects of adult ADHD in Taiwanese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two parts: (1) a community survey among 1000 adults to establish the&#xD;
      validity of AAQoL; and (2) a case-control study with a sample of 60 adults, aged 18-50, with&#xD;
      DSM-IV ADHD and 60 healthy controls matching for the age and sex structure of the ADHD group.&#xD;
      The instruments include a standard psychiatric diagnostic interviews using (K-SADS-E),&#xD;
      self-administered rating scales for assessing psychopathology (ASRI), ADHD symptoms (ASRS,&#xD;
      CGI-ADHD-S,), social and family functions (AAQoL, SDS, Moos dyadic assessment, family APGAR,&#xD;
      GDS) and neuropsychological assessment (WAIS-III, CANTAB). The ADHD group will be reassessed&#xD;
      for symptom severity and neuropsychological functioning 2-3 months (ranging from 8 to 12&#xD;
      weeks) after the first assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that this study will provide the primitive data on the symptomatology,&#xD;
      neuropsychological functions, quality of life, and social/family function of adult patients&#xD;
      with ADHD, will evaluate the treatment response of medication or psychosocial intervention in&#xD;
      the aspects of symptomatology, neuropsychological functions, quality of life, and family&#xD;
      function; and young psychiatric researchers will learn to conduct standardized psychiatric&#xD;
      interview and neuropsychological tests, and to collect data, conduct statistical analysis,&#xD;
      and prepare the manuscript. Our findings should have clinical implication in assessing and&#xD;
      treating adult patients with ADHD and provide the preliminary data for future brain imaging,&#xD;
      neurocognitive, and interventional studies on adult ADHD.&#xD;
