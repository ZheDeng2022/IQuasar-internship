      he purpose of this study is to test whether a medication, called mifepristone (commonly known&#xD;
      as the ³Morning-After-Pill²), can help to prevent emotional problems after someone has&#xD;
      survived a traumatic experience. We are studying this medication for the treatment of&#xD;
      Post-traumatic Stress disorder (PTSD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is an emotional illness that can develop in people after they have experienced a&#xD;
      traumatic event. It involves symptoms such as poor sleep, nightmares about the trauma,&#xD;
      unwanted daytime memories of the trauma (flashbacks), jumpiness, and trouble looking forward&#xD;
      to things in the future. Once people develop PTSD, the symptoms tend to last a very long&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are testing the idea that mifepristone, which blocks the effect of the hormones&#xD;
      progesterone and cortisol, will help treat PTSD. Progesterone is a hormone made in the bodies&#xD;
      of both men and women and its main role is in regulating the menstrual cycle and in&#xD;
      pregnancy. Cortisol is also a hormone made in the body of both men and women and helps the&#xD;
      body respond to stress. Cortisol also has a role in making emotional memories more intense&#xD;
      than other memories. We are testing whether blocking the effect of cortisol with mifepristone&#xD;
      as you recall your trauma may be able to decrease the intensity of your traumatic memories.&#xD;
      This medication will not completely block out your memories of the traumatic experience but&#xD;
      may decrease how much your thoughts are drawn back to the memory of the traumatic event.&#xD;
