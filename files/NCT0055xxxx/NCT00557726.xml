      This protocol is being established to cover the evaluation of patients with inflammatory&#xD;
      and/or infectious diseases which are not covered under previously existing protocols. The&#xD;
      purpose of such a protocol is that frequently patients are referred to us with either&#xD;
      diagnosed or undiagnosed illnesses which would be of interest to our teaching program or&#xD;
      which would serve as a source of patients to subsequently be entered into established,&#xD;
      ongoing protocol studies. Such patients will be admitted to the protocol and handled&#xD;
      according to accepted medical practice of diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
