  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle fractures are common injuries that are being operated routinely. In order to restore&#xD;
      the long term function and prevent arthritis of the ankle the broken fragments should be put&#xD;
      in place precisely. Inadequate reduction can result in pain and long term disability.&#xD;
      Recently, based on MRI studies and clinical studies, a significant number of ankle fractures&#xD;
      are apparently fixed with less than optimal results. We suggest that the use of a new device&#xD;
      that enables better three dimensional imaging will improve the quality of operations&#xD;
      performed for ankle fractures.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with unstable ankle fractures (as classified by the AO as 44B 44C by Lauge&#xD;
             Hansen PER4 or SER4) amenable to open reduction and internal fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with syndesmotic rupture as evident from the injury films or during clinical&#xD;
             testing in the OR be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Intraoperative testing will include both a cotton Test and a stress view obtained&#xD;
             after bimalleolar fixation has been attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A positive syndesmotic injury will be defined by the criteria of Pettrone et al as&#xD;
             follows: a tib/fib clear space &gt;5mm or tib/fib overlap of &lt;10mm (on the AP view), or a&#xD;
             tib/fib overlap of &lt;1mm on the mortise view.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with a pilon fracture (i.e. plafond fractures AO type 43B and C) will be&#xD;
             excluded even if associated with a fibula fracture and syndesmosis disruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with contraindications to operative treatment and diabetics&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women of childbearing age will be excluded if they present with a positive pre-op Beta&#xD;
             HCG test or if they refuse a B HCG test.&#xD;
