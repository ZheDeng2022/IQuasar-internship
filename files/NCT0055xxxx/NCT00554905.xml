      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate whether combined RFA and TACE&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local ablation is a safe and effective therapy for patients who cannot undergo resection, or&#xD;
      as a bridge to transplantation. Of the various percutaneous local ablative therapies,&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has attracted the greatest interest because of its&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety for small HCC ≤ 5.0cm, with a 3-year survival rate of 62% to 68%, a&#xD;
      low treatment morbidity of 0% to 12%, and a low treatment mortality of 0% to 1%. Prospective&#xD;
      randomized trials have shown RFA to be better than percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) in&#xD;
      producing a higher rate of complete tumor necrosis with fewer numbers of treatment sessions&#xD;
      and better survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the complete tumor necrosis rate for tumors larger than 5cm is less favorable,&#xD;
      and the local recurrence rate can be as high as 20% even in small HCC less than 3.5cm. The&#xD;
      high local recurrence rate may be due to residual cancer cells not killed by RFA or adjacent&#xD;
      microscopic satellite tumor nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is proved to be an effective and palliative&#xD;
      therapy for unresectable HCC. And some studies showed that combined TACE and RFA may produce&#xD;
      superior tumor control than RFA alone and reduce local recurrence rate. In a study by&#xD;
      Yamakado et al., 64 patients with 92 tumors underwent RFA within two weeks after TACE. The&#xD;
      intrahepatic recurrence rates were 15% at 1 year and 43% at 2years, the 1, and 2, year&#xD;
      overall survivals were 100% and 93%, respectively. These results appeared favorable, but&#xD;
      there has not a prospective randomized controlled study to compare RFA combine with TACE&#xD;
      versus RFA alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the purpose of our study was to prospectively evaluate whether combined RFA and TACE&#xD;
      (RFA-TACE) result in better survival outcomes than RFA alone in patients with HCC.&#xD;
