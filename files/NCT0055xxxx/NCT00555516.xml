      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EW02 is a polysaccharide-enriched crude extract from black soybean (BS). BS has been used&#xD;
      extensively by the Chinese as food or traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years. It&#xD;
      has been used as monotherapy to treat Diabetes, menorrhagia and leukorrhea. In combination&#xD;
      with others, BS has been used to treat chemotherapy-induced leukopenia on more than 300 pts.&#xD;
      The daily doses were 15g bid to 50g tid for 21 days. Side effects were generally mild,&#xD;
      including epigastric discomfort, numbness, insomnia, and dry mouth. Recently BS was found to&#xD;
      promote myelopoiesis and inhibit tumor growth through immunomodulation. In vitro assays&#xD;
      showed BS-PS can stimulate production of cytokines and increase blood progenitors. In vivo&#xD;
      studies also demonstrated that BS-PS can reduce neutropenia in mice received 5-FU by&#xD;
      stimulating myeloid colony formation. We hypothesize that EW02 can reduce neutropenia in&#xD;
      cancer patients who receive chemotherapy without side effects.&#xD;

      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel, pilot study of oral EW02&#xD;
      in combination with chemotherapy, versus placebo in combination with chemotherapy in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients as the primary phase (Cycle 1). The chemotherapy regimen is restricted to one&#xD;
      of the following regimens: Doxorubicin + Cyclophosphamide (AC), or Doxorubicin+&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide+5-FU (CAF) under standardized dosage. The WBC recovery time is similar&#xD;
      between these two chemotherapy regimens due to the facts that doxorubicin and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide are overlapped and their dose in CAF is reduced. The principle investigator&#xD;
      has clinical experiences that the neutropenia nadir and severity caused by these two regimens&#xD;
      are almost the same. Nevertheless, pre-stratification by chemotherapy regimen (stratum AC&#xD;
      versus stratum CAF) at randomization will be implemented so that equal sample size of two&#xD;
      study products will be allocated under each stratum. It will involve 60 outpatients for&#xD;
      breast cancer, who have previously demonstrated a fall unto 1,000 to 3,000/mm3 in WBC count,&#xD;
      or unto 500 to 1,500/mm3 in ANC count, on Day 8 or Day 15, whilst on Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase (Cycle 2): EW02 at 700mg tid daily versus placebo group are given at the&#xD;
      beginning of Cycle 2 for 15 consecutive days. 60 subjects will be randomized 2:1 to two&#xD;
      groups in pre-stratified permuted blocks of six with four subjects assigned to Group 1 (EW02)&#xD;
      while two subjects assigned to Group 2 (Placebo). Group 1 will receive EW02 for 15&#xD;
      consecutive days during the second cycle and Group 2 will receive 15 consecutive days of&#xD;
      Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extension phase (Cycle 3): is designed to collect additional safety data and to ensure&#xD;
      all the participants will have the opportunity to receive study drug. Thus, both groups will&#xD;
      receive EW02 at 700mg tid/day for 15 consecutive days.&#xD;
