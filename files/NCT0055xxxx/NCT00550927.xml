      RATIONALE: Enzastaurin may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth&#xD;
      in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find&#xD;
      cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Enzastaurin and&#xD;
      bevacizumab may also stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer.&#xD;
      Giving enzastaurin together with bevacizumab may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of enzastaurin and&#xD;
      bevacizumab in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the recommended phase II doses of enzastaurin hydrochloride and bevacizumab&#xD;
           that may be safely administered to patients with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
           malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the toxicities of enzastaurin hydrochloride and bevacizumab in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the antitumor activity of enzastaurin hydrochloride and bevacizumab in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of enzastaurin hydrochloride and bevacizumab in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess GSK3β as a biomarker relevant to enzastaurin hydrochloride and its correlation&#xD;
           with clinical outcome in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of enzastaurin hydrochloride and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral enzastaurin hydrochloride once, twice, or three times daily on days&#xD;
      1-21 or days 1-28 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 or days 1 and 15. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 21 or 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically during study for pharmacokinetic evaluation. Samples&#xD;
      are also analyzed for biomarker (GSK3β) by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) registered this trial with Eli Lilly as sponsor. NCI did not&#xD;
      update the record. In June 2012, NCI transferred the trial to Lilly's clinicaltrials.gov&#xD;
      account and Lilly updated the record with the trial status and trial completion dates. This&#xD;
      trial is not an applicable trial under Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007&#xD;
      (FDAAA).&#xD;
