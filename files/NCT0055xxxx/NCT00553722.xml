      It is well known that Aldosterone (aldo) can cause hypertension (HBP). Since aldo is known to&#xD;
      cause the kidney to retain sodium (Na) and Na retention is known to cause HBP, it has been&#xD;
      thought that the mechanism by which aldo causes HBP is by Na retention. Recent studies have&#xD;
      suggested that aldo has many effects in addition to its ability to cause the kidney to retain&#xD;
      Na. To test the hypothesis that aldo can cause HBP in a manner which does not involve Na&#xD;
      retention, we plan, in this protocol, to give Eplerenone, a specific aldo antagonist, to&#xD;
      patients on dialysis who have HBP. A positive effect of Eplerenone to lower HBP in these&#xD;
      patients would support this hypothesis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Shortly after the structure of aldosterone (aldo) was determined (1) in 1952, its&#xD;
      effect on the kidney to cause sodium (Na) retention and potassium (K) and hydrogen ion (H)&#xD;
      excretion were characterized (2,3). Although the ability of aldo to effect many transporting&#xD;
      epithelia is now well known, it is this effect on the kidney to retain sodium which is felt&#xD;
      to play an important role in Na retention to cause edema and, in some settings, hypertension&#xD;
      (HBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aldo was shown by Edelman (4) to bind to a specific receptor and then be transported into the&#xD;
      nucleus of aldo responsive cells and subsequently lead to the production of aldo-induced&#xD;
      proteins. The first aldo receptor antagonist )ARA(, spironolactone, has been used clinically&#xD;
      for over 30 years in the management of edema and in the past few years a new agent&#xD;
      Eplerenone, which is structurally similar to spironolactone, but without the side effect of&#xD;
      gynecomastia, has come into clinical use in the USA and in Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of HBP is usually directed at the cause of the HBP if it is known, for example,&#xD;
      removal of tumors releasing catecholamines and correcting renal artery stenosis. If HBP is&#xD;
      due to primary aldosteronism, then surgical removal of the tumor, or use of an ARA is usually&#xD;
      effective (5,6). When the cause of the HBP is not known, traditionally called essential&#xD;
      hypertension, therapy today frequently involves drugs that interfere with the RAS (7), but&#xD;
      until recently the addition of an ARA was not usually included. Recently studies by Epstein&#xD;
      and others (8,9) have shown that the addition of an ARA to the drug management of what has&#xD;
      been considered essential HPB can further reduce HBP by over 10 mmHg, thus suggesting that&#xD;
      the addition of an ARA to the routine tools available to treat HBP is important. Although the&#xD;
      mechanism by which this addition of an ARA lowers HBP is not clear, the obvious suggestion is&#xD;
      that by blocking the effect of aldo on the kidney to reabsorb Na there is an increased&#xD;
      excretion of Na which is responsible for the lowering of HBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), at the time they start dialysis HBP is&#xD;
      common and has been attributed to volume overload or an active RAS (10). Early in the history&#xD;
      of hemodialysis the potential for the RAS to be involved in causing HBP was unclear, but&#xD;
      studies with saralasin (11,12), a competitive angiotensin II antagonist, clearly showed that&#xD;
      in dialysis patients with elevated plasma renin levels the renin was involved in causing HBP&#xD;
      by leading to the generation of angiotensin II. Although a number of other mechanisms apart&#xD;
      from volume and angiotensin II have been considered, there is little evidence today that any,&#xD;
      including aldo, play a regular role in causing HBP in the dialysis setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the possibility that aldosterone may contribute to the HBP of patients on&#xD;
      dialysis, independent of an effect on sodium excretion (since such patients excrete little&#xD;
      urine), this protocol is designed to test this possibility by administering an ARA to&#xD;
      patients on chronic dialysis with HBP. A positive result would strongly suggest that there is&#xD;
      an effect to lower HBP independent of sodium excretion. Such a result would be indicative of&#xD;
      a non-Na mechanism for ARA to lower HBP in dialysis patients, but would also suggest the&#xD;
      possibility of ARA acting by a non-Na mechanism in lowering HBP in essential HBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is hyperkalemia a concern in this protocol? Although there is evidence that aldo can&#xD;
      facilitate potassium excretion, even in patients with renal failure (13) by increasing GI&#xD;
      excretion, there have been several studies recently which demonstrate that spironolactone&#xD;
      (14,15) or Eplerenone (16) can be given to renal failure/ dialysis patients without the&#xD;
      development of hyperkalemia. Thus, it seems that these ARAs can be given to patients with&#xD;
      chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis, without hyperkalemia routinely&#xD;
      developing. Nevertheless, in this protocol, plasma potassium will be regularly measured to&#xD;
      minimize the development of hyperkalemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A very small study addressed this question using Spironolactone (14). Since it has been shown&#xD;
      that Eplerenone does not cause gynecomastia in men, and many of our dialysis patients are&#xD;
      men, we will use this drug, rather than Spironolactone, in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational and Aims The role of aldo to cause HBP by a Na retaining mechanism is well&#xD;
      described. Since recent studies suggest that aldo may have other mechanisms of action, this&#xD;
      protocol will address the possibility that aldo can cause HBP by a non-Na retaining&#xD;
      mechanism. This will be done by giving an ARA, Eplerenone, to patients with HBP on dialysis.&#xD;
      In these patients the kidney plays no role in Na regulation. Thus, if BP falls with&#xD;
      Eplerenone, these observations would strongly support the hypothesis than aldo can cause HBP&#xD;
      by a non-Na retaining mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods We will select study participants from adult hemodialysis patients treated thrice&#xD;
      weekly at Shaare Zedek Medical Center Dialysis Unit. Men and women will qualify for the study&#xD;
      if they were on hemodialysis therapy for more than 3 months, have an average predialysis&#xD;
      plasma potassium concentration less than 5.6 mEq/L at the time of enrollment and have nil or&#xD;
      minimal urine output (&lt;500 mL/24 h). All participating women of childbearing age will have a&#xD;
      negative pregnancy test result before entering into the study. Additional exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will include a known allergy to Spironolactone or Eplerenone; any acute illness; hypotension,&#xD;
      defined as a predialysis systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg; severe hypertension&#xD;
      (predialysis systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm Hg);&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure; inability to give informed consent; and noncompliance. The&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board of Shaare Zedek Medical Center will be asked to give approval to&#xD;
      the study protocol. All participants will give written-informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan on enrolling 27 patients in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, crossover study. At study start, participants will be administered either&#xD;
      Eplerenone, 25 mg, or a placebo tablet orally twice daily for 4 weeks. This 4-week period&#xD;
      will be followed by a 3-week washout period. After the washout period, patients will cross&#xD;
      over in their treatment arms for 4 more weeks. Patients administered Eplerenone for the first&#xD;
      4 weeks will be given placebo for the last 4 weeks, and vice versa. All patients will serve&#xD;
      as their own controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive outpatient hemodialysis 3 times a week using B. Braun CE0123&#xD;
      machines (B. Braun, D-34212 Meisungen, Germany). All patients will use B. Braun polysulfone&#xD;
      membranes. To control for the effects of volume on blood pressure and the RAS, we plan to&#xD;
      keep target postdialysis weight (dry weight) constant for each patient during the study.&#xD;
      Dialysate sodium concentrations will be held constant at 140 mEq/L for all patients,&#xD;
      dialysate potassium concentrations will be maintained at 2 mEq/L thru the study. We do not&#xD;
      plan to impose additional dietary potassium restrictions beyond the usual recommendations for&#xD;
      patients with ESRD treated with hemodialysis. We plan to make no changes to dialysate&#xD;
      potassium concentrations or antihypertensive regimens. Because of a mandate not to alter the&#xD;
      antihypertensive regimen, target weight, and dialysis potassium bath during the study, we&#xD;
      will exclude patients with hypotension, severe hypertension, and hyperkalemia. To evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of Eplerenone independent of its diuretic action, we plan to include only oliguric&#xD;
      or anuric patients (urine output &lt;500 mL/24 h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to determine predialysis and postdialysis weights, interdialytic weight gains&#xD;
      (IDWGs), and systolic and diastolic blood pressures for each patient by calculating an&#xD;
      average of 3 measurements obtained during 1 week before the administration of any study&#xD;
      medication (baseline), during each week of placebo and Eplerenone treatment, and during the&#xD;
      last week of the washout period. At the beginning and end of each treatment period, we plan&#xD;
      to measure predialysis and postdialysis plasma potassium and aldosterone levels, renin&#xD;
      activity (PRA), and, on a nondialysis day, 24-hour urine excretion of sodium, potassium, and&#xD;
      creatinine. We plan to monitor predialysis plasma potassium concentrations weekly in all&#xD;
      subjects. Predialysis blood samples will be obtained after cannulation of the vascular access&#xD;
      before the start of the dialysis session. We plan to obtain postdialysis blood samples from a&#xD;
      predialyzer blood sample port at the end of the hemodialysis session after slowing the blood&#xD;
      pump to 50 to 100 mL/min. Shaare Zedek Medical Center Laboratory will perform all laboratory&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Results will be presented as mean ± SD. To compare clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters, Student t-test will be used for paired samples. Linear regression and&#xD;
      correlation will be used to assess the relationship between 2 variables. Stepwise regression&#xD;
      will be used to identify predictors of a single variable. P less than 0.05 will be used to&#xD;
      define statistical significance. We will perform all statistical analyses using standard&#xD;
      software packages.&#xD;
