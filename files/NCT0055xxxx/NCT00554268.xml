    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of PBI-05204 that&#xD;
      can be given to patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will also look at how&#xD;
      PBI-05204 is processed by the body, how it leaves the body, how it affects the body, and if&#xD;
      it is affecting certain proteins in the cancer cells.&#xD;

      The Study Drug PBI-05204, made from the oleander plant, is designed to prevent the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by affecting proteins that lead to cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can begin receiving the study drug, you will have &quot;screening tests&quot; to help the&#xD;
      doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. The following tests will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure,&#xD;
           heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate), height, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (performance status evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG -- a test that measures the electrical activity&#xD;
           of the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may have an echocardiogram (a picture of your heart using sound waves), if&#xD;
           applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to&#xD;
           check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 2 teaspoons) or&#xD;
           urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the amount of PBI-05204 that you&#xD;
      take will be based on how many participants have been enrolled before you, and on the safety&#xD;
      information that is available. There may be up to 6 participants enrolled in each group. The&#xD;
      first group of participants enrolled on this study will receive PBI-05204 at the lowest dose&#xD;
      level. If no intolerable side effects are experienced, the next group of participants will&#xD;
      take a higher dose level. This process will continue until researchers find the highest dose&#xD;
      of PBI-05204 that can be given without intolerable side effects occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on which group you are enrolled in, you will take the PBI-05204 capsules by mouth&#xD;
      every day at the same time or twice a day (every 12 hours). Your Doctor will tell you which&#xD;
      schedule you are on. You will take the drug on Days 1-21. On Days 22-28 you will take no&#xD;
      study drug. Each 28 days is called a &quot;study cycle&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Predose Visit, 1-7 days before Day 1 of Cycle 1 you will have the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and&#xD;
           weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have your heart rate monitored by a Holter monitor. A Holter monitor is a&#xD;
           machine that continuously records the heart's rhythms. Electrodes (small conducting&#xD;
           patches) are stuck onto your chest and attached to a small recording monitor. You carry&#xD;
           the Holter monitor in a pocket or in a small pouch worn around your neck or waist. The&#xD;
           monitor is battery operated. After 24 hours, you return the monitor to the study doctor.&#xD;
           The study doctor will look at the records and see if there have been any irregular heart&#xD;
           rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children will have a blood (about 2 teaspoons) or urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be collected for pharmacodynamic (PD) testing before you&#xD;

           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your&#xD;
      vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of every 2 cycles beginning with Cycle 4 (Cycles 4, 6, 8, and so on) blood (about&#xD;
      3-4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will have a CT or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the expansion group, blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be&#xD;
      collected for PK testing before you take the daily dose of the study drug and then 1, 2, 4,&#xD;
      6, 8 and 24 hours later on Day 1 of Cycle 1. On Days 8, 15 and 21 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2&#xD;

      the study drug and then 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the expansion group, you will also have two mandatory tumor biopsies&#xD;
      collected within 1- 7 days before you take your daily dose of the study drug and once during&#xD;
      Days 15-21 of Cycle 1. To collect the biopsy, your doctor will insert a needle into the tumor&#xD;
      and withdraw a small piece of the tumor. The tumor tissue will be studied to look at special&#xD;
      &quot;markers&quot; in the tumor that may help researchers predict who may benefit from the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on study until the disease gets worse, you decide to come off study, your&#xD;
      doctor decides it is in your best interest to come off the study, you have intolerable side&#xD;
      effects, or the sponsor closes the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you decided to leave the study early you must tell the study doctor in writing and return&#xD;
      any unused study drug. You must complete the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off-study, you will have an end-of-study visit within 30 days after the last&#xD;
      dose of PBI-05204. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have your heart rate monitored by a Holter monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT/MRI scan to assess your tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children must have a blood (about 2 teaspoons) or urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you complete the end-of-study visit, your study doctor will continue to contact you or&#xD;
      your family doctor for a minimum of 30 days. You may be contacted by a phone call (less than&#xD;
      5 minutes), and you will be asked about your general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. PBI-05204 is not FDA approved or commercially available. At&#xD;
      this time, PBI-05204 is only being used in research. Up to 52 patients will take part in this&#xD;
      study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
