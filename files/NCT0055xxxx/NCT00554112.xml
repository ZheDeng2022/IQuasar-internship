      This VA CDA-2 proposal will test in detail if lifestyle intervention with aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training improves the body's production of insulin in older people at risk to develop&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in the&#xD;
      older population. Aging is associated with insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion,&#xD;
      with greater defects in older people with IGT. Beta-cell dysfunction is critical in the&#xD;
      progression from normal glucose to tolerance to IGT and to diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), lifestyle intervention with diet and exercise&#xD;
      training significantly lowered the rate of progression from IGT to diabetes, and was&#xD;
      particularly effective in older people. The mechanisms of lifestyle changes to prevent&#xD;
      diabetes and the effects on beta-cell function remain unclear. Exercise is well-known to&#xD;
      increase insulin sensitivity, although exercise effects on beta-cell function have not been&#xD;
      specifically assessed. In a pilot study supported by local VA funds, one week of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise training improved insulin sensitivity as expected, but also improved beta-cell&#xD;
      function in sedentary older people with IGT, with no change in body weight/composition,&#xD;
      fasting glucose or lipid/inflammatory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on my current VA RCDA project and the pilot study results, this VA CDA-2 proposal will&#xD;
      test in detail the novel overall hypothesis that lifestyle intervention with aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training leads to improved beta-cell function in human age-related glucose intolerance. The&#xD;
      potential mechanisms of the age-associated decline in beta-cell function and whereby exercise&#xD;
      training may improve beta-cell function will also be explored. Beta-cell function will be&#xD;
      examined in relation to expected improvements in insulin sensitivity, and the effects of&#xD;
      exercise will be isolated with weight maintenance and nutritional balance. The time course of&#xD;
      exercise effects over three months, the acute and chronic effects of exercise training on&#xD;
      beta-cell function, the effects of high vs. low intensity exercise training, and different&#xD;
      important components of beta-cell function will be examined. The interaction between exercise&#xD;
      training effects on beta-cell function in older people with IGT and potential mediators&#xD;
      including free fatty acids (FFA)/FFA composition, intraabdominal fat, adipocytokines, and&#xD;
      incretin hormones will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the striking effectiveness of the DPP lifestyle intervention to prevent diabetes&#xD;
      in older people with IGT, the decline in beta-cell function with even normal human aging, and&#xD;
      the importance of beta-cell dysfunction in the progression to diabetes, it is of great&#xD;
      interest to further define the potential, novel metabolic effects of exercise training on&#xD;
      beta-cell function, particularly in the aging population. This project may provide initial&#xD;
      steps to further determine the mechanisms whereby lifestyle changes prevent diabetes. This&#xD;
      would provide critical information needed to translate research findings into clinical&#xD;
      practice in order to prevent diabetes in the aging veteran population.&#xD;
