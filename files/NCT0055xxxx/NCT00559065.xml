  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the risks of workplace exposure to benzene, a substance known to lead&#xD;
      to cancer of the blood and possibly of the lungs. It is used widely in industries and is a&#xD;
      contaminant in the environment. Researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the China&#xD;
      Center for Disease Control (formerly Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine) had done&#xD;
      previous studies of workers in manufacturing industries in China of people who worked at&#xD;
      least 1 day from 1972 to 1987 in 12 cities in that country. Data were collected of&#xD;
      approximately 75,000 workers exposed to benzene and 35,000 who were not, with the purpose of&#xD;
      investigating the relationship between benzene exposure and cancer risk. For workers exposed&#xD;
      to benzene, there was a significant risk of cancer affecting the blood cells and a 1.8-fold&#xD;
      excess of lung cancer among them. This study will expand those findings and also identify the&#xD;
      effects of benzene amounts and whether there is a genetic tendency for benzene poisoning.&#xD;
      About 3,860 benzene-exposed workers from the 12 cities will be interviewed. Next-of-kin of&#xD;
      deceased workers, and a subcohort (additional grouping) of participants will serve as a&#xD;
      control group in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have worked at places where there was exposure to benzene will have a brief&#xD;
      physical exam and samples of cells from a mouth rinse and samples from blood will be&#xD;
      collected to study the genetic influence on developing blood diseases from workplace&#xD;
      exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants or next-of-kin, for deceased, will be given a questionnaire about their work&#xD;
      history, use of cigarettes and hair dyes, medications they take, and family history of&#xD;
      cancer. Interviews of about 40 minutes long will be conducted at participants homes or&#xD;
      workplaces, at a time convenient to them, and the interviews will be audiotaped.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Benzene is a known leukemogen and may cause lymphoma as well, but its ability to , cause&#xD;
      these conditions below 10 parts per million (ppm) in air are unclear. It is currently&#xD;
      regulated in the United States at 1 ppm as an 8-hour time-weighted average and at a 5 ppm&#xD;
      short-term exposure level for 15 minutes. There is a critical need to assess risks related to&#xD;
      benzene exposure under 10 ppm because it is widely used industrially and a ubiquitous&#xD;
      contaminant in the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM),&#xD;
      whose name was recently changed to the China Center for Disease Control (CDC) previously&#xD;
      established a cohort of 75,000 workers exposed to benzene in 12 cities in China and 35,000&#xD;
      unexposed comparison workers, to investigate the relationship between benzene exposure and&#xD;
      cancer risk, from 1972 to 1987. We followed up each worker using factory records and reported&#xD;
      results suggesting that benzene exposure under 10 ppm may be associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of acute non-lymphocytic cancer and could also be associated with increased risk of lymphoma&#xD;
      and lung cancer. We have now laid the groundwork for a further epidemiologic investigation in&#xD;
      China to evaluate health risks from lower levels of benzene exposure, particularly as present&#xD;
      in the factories during the 1990s. The cohort was followed up through 1999, and through this&#xD;
      effort we have identified 3260 subjects for study, including cases (HLD malignancies, n= 161;&#xD;
      benzene poisoning, n= 1040; lung cancer, n= 560) and 1500 subjects in a cohort sub-sample to&#xD;
      be used as the comparison group. In addition, we have identified a series of cases with&#xD;
      benzene poisoning and controls from the same factories outside of the cohort (n = 600).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to contact next-of-kin of deceased subjects (essentially all cancer cases and some&#xD;
      members of the sub-cohort are deceased), for questionnaire-based evaluation of benzene and&#xD;
      other exposures, and to contact living subjects (primarily the benzene poisoning cases and&#xD;
      the sub-cohort sample) for collection of questionnaires and biologic samples. The&#xD;
      questionnaires (formatted for direct interview of living subjects or for next-of-kin) will&#xD;
      collect information on potential confounders needed in the analysis of benzene's effects and&#xD;
      information on work experience outside of the study cohort factories. The biologic sample&#xD;
      collection (13 ml blood and buccal cell rinse) will provide material primarily for study of&#xD;
      genetic polymorphisms potentially associated with benzene metabolism and disease status. The&#xD;
      polymorphisms being studied are relatively common in the Chinese population and may be&#xD;
      associated with a relatively modest increase in risk (1.5 to 2-fold). Written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from all next-of-kin and all live study subjects. We will attempt to&#xD;
      enroll 3,860 study subjects or next-of-kin. The study will be carried out with Drs. Gui-Lan&#xD;
      Li and Song-Nian Yin and colleagues from the China CDC, Beijing, China.&#xD;

        From a cohort of 74,827 benzene-exposed and 35,804 unexposed workers employed (Bullet) one&#xD;
        month in several industries and followed up during 1972-99, we identified a case-cohort&#xD;
        population that included incident and deceased cases with hematopoietic malignancies&#xD;
        diagnosed during those same years among exposed and unexposed workers and a 1,500 worker&#xD;
        subcohort (1,100 exposed, 400 unexposed). The subcohort was selected by stratified random&#xD;
        sampling (by sex, exposure status, and age at start of follow-up) from 106,641 of the&#xD;
        cohort members. Other outcomes to be evaluated include incident cases with benzene&#xD;
        hematotoxicity and deaths from lung cancer.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study subjects are Chinese. Gender is not an important consideration as a risk factor&#xD;
        in benzene-exposed workers. Subjects will be recruited by on - site collaborators in each&#xD;
        of the 12 study cities. Participation is voluntary. Subjects may withdra from the study at&#xD;
        any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Based on the available data, no cases (an , thus no controls) will be less than 18 years of&#xD;
        age. Any subject under 18 would be excluded from the study. Otherwise, no exclusions of&#xD;
        potential study subjects are planned.&#xD;
