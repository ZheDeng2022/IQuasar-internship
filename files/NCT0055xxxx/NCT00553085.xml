      Project summary Anxiety disorders (AD's) in childhood are common and may cause great&#xD;
      suffering.Childhood AD's may persist into adulthood and knowledge of important risk factors&#xD;
      for development and maintenance of these disorders is essential.The development of AD's is&#xD;
      due to a complex interaction between biological and environmental factors.This study will&#xD;
      examine the relationship between AD's and two biological risk factors:1.Neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      delays/disorders (NDD'S) in motor and cognitive function and 2.Temperament/personality.To&#xD;
      date a few studies have consistently found that motor impairment is associated with childhood&#xD;
      anxiety and predicts persistent anxiety in adolescence.The association between AD's and NDD's&#xD;
      in cognitive functions such as language and attention is far less studied. In contrast, there&#xD;
      is a huge research literature on temperament as a risk factor for AD's.The temperamental&#xD;
      trait &quot;behavioural inhibition&quot; has been shown to be particularly associated with&#xD;
      AD's.However, very few studies have examined the interplay between NDD's, temperament and&#xD;
      anxiety.The study is a clinical case-control study of children aged 7-13 years with AD's&#xD;
      referred to three different out-patient clinics.The participants will be assessed by&#xD;
      diagnostic interviews, neuropsychological tests and temperament/personality&#xD;
      instruments.Comparison groups are:1.children with ADHD (to compare AD's with another mental&#xD;
      disorder related to NDD's) and 2.Non-referred children without a mental disorder. Follow-up&#xD;
      at 6 months,1 and 5 years.A pilot study at two of the three out-patient clinics to be&#xD;
      included,showed a sufficient sample size.Anticipated implications of the study include&#xD;
      increased knowledge of biological risk factors and of latent neurological brain correlates,as&#xD;
      well as treatment implications.Children with NDD's are often met with demands they cannot&#xD;
      cope with due to their neurodevelopmental immaturity.To adjust the demands to the child's&#xD;
      actual level of functioning is important.&#xD;
