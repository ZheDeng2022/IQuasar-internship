  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of acute cholecystitis includes limited oral intake, antibiotics and early or&#xD;
      delayed surgery. To date there are no randomized trials proving the benefit of antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to prospectively and randomly compare between patients that are&#xD;
      admitted for acute cholecystitis and treated with or without antibiotics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholelithiasis and inflammatory biliary tract disease constitute a major health problem in&#xD;
      western countries. Acute cholecystitis is the third major cause of emergency admission to a&#xD;
      surgical ward and its incidence increases with increasing age. Acute cholecystitis is defined&#xD;
      as acute inflammation of the gallbladder which is commonly caused by gallstones which are&#xD;
      impacted in the cystic duct. The treatment of acute cholecystitis varies between different&#xD;
      medical centers around the world. In some hospitals, mainly in the US, the most common&#xD;
      treatment is early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 72 hours from the onset of symptoms /&#xD;
      admission. However, in the UK and many other centers in Europe the treatment of acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis is conservative (NPO, IV fluids and antibiotics) and laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy is delayed. The reasons for delayed surgery differ between institutions and&#xD;
      include the assumption of decreased complications, surgeon and OR availability and schedule,&#xD;
      costs, and hospital policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent metanalysis proved similar safety and efficacy of early and delayed laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy. The conversion rate, length of operation and complication rate (overall&#xD;
      complication rate, intra-abdominal collection, bile leak, and CBD injury) were also&#xD;
      comparable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Mount Scopus patients with acute cholecystitis&#xD;
      are treated conservatively followed by delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Over the years&#xD;
      this approach proved to carry relatively low rate of complications, mainly bile duct injuries&#xD;
      &lt;1%, without interruption to the busy OR schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless to the lack of evidence based guidelines for the treatment of acute cholecystitis&#xD;
      the traditional triad of NPO, IV fluids and antibiotics was adopted at our institution&#xD;
      vis-Ã -vis the higher complication and conversion rate for early cholecystectomy. The&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment is associated with side effects, costs and most important unavoidable&#xD;
      development of bacterial drug resistance. However, to date there are no randomized trials&#xD;
      proving the superiority of either one of these methods.&#xD;
