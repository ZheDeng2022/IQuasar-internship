      The main objectives of this protocol are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of ANAM-PD in detecting cognitive status in&#xD;
           patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and healthy controls (HC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate the specific individual domains of the ANAM-PD cognitive battery by&#xD;
           comparisons to available standardized cognitive evaluation scales administered to the&#xD;
           patients with Parkinson disease with and healthy control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the reliability of the ANAM-PD battery of tests by comparing repeated&#xD;
           administrations of the ANAM-PD battery on a sub-set of subjects with Parkinson disease&#xD;
           and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To characterize cholinergic neurotransmission through imaging the vesicular&#xD;
           acetylcholine transporter binding with 123Iodobenzovesamicol (IBVM) and SPECT in PD&#xD;
           patients and healthy controls.&#xD;

      General Design and Methods The overall goal of this proposal is to validate ANAM-PD as an&#xD;
      assessment tool for cognitive status in PD. We propose a comprehensive strategy to evaluate&#xD;
      the sensitivity and specificity of ANAM-PD in detecting cognitive changes in patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of PD (n=50) and healthy controls (n=25). The specific testing domains of the&#xD;
      ANAM-PD battery will be validated against standardized neuropsychological testing, described&#xD;
      in detail below. The reliability of the ANAM-PD battery will be evaluated through a&#xD;
      test-retest procedure in a subset of 50 subjects (25 PD and 25 HC). This strategy will enable&#xD;
      us to evaluate the individual domains of the ANAM-PD computerized cognitive test and&#xD;
      establish a battery as a standard test to efficiently measure cognitive changes in PD. We&#xD;
      also propose to explore functional neuroimaging of the cholinergic system using [123I] IBVM&#xD;
      and SPECT, a marker of vesicular acetylcholine transporter and a measure of the integrity of&#xD;
      the cholinergic neuronal system. Identifying and validating ANAM-PD as an efficient tool for&#xD;
      assessing cognitive changes in PD and exploring the cholinergic transporter system in PD&#xD;
      through functional neuroimaging could predict sub-sets of PD patients 'at risk' for&#xD;
      developing dementia and help elucidate the neurochemistry related to cognitive decline in PD&#xD;
