  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two groups of patients with prostate cancer will be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: patients whose cancer has worsened or spread after being on hormonal therapy and has&#xD;
      not had any chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: patients who have a rising PSA after surgery or radiotherapy for the prostate and do&#xD;
      not have any spread to the bones or other organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive Phenoxodiol (PXD) 400 mg every 8 hours daily for 28 consecutive days (1&#xD;
      cycle). Treatment outcome will be evaluated after three cycles (12 weeks) of PXD treatment&#xD;
      (immediately prior to cycle 4). Patients with progression of disease will be taken off study.&#xD;
      Responding and stable disease patients will remain on study for a total of 12&#xD;
      cycles(approximately 12 months).&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
             prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with castrate and non-castrate levels of testosterone are eligible as defined&#xD;
             below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with castrate level of testosterone (Group A- androgen independent disease)&#xD;
             need to meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressive disease based on any one of the following&#xD;
&#xD;
             a) a rise in PSA, b) transaxial imaging, or c) radionuclide bone scan. Patients whose&#xD;
             sole manifestation of progression is an increase in disease related symptoms are not&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. PSA - a minimum of 3 consecutive rising levels, with an interval of &gt; 1 week&#xD;
                  between each determination. The last determination must have a minimal value of &gt;&#xD;
                  4 ng/ml and be determined within two weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Measurable Disease: Patient showing new or progressive soft tissue masses on CT&#xD;
                  or MRI scans are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Radionuclide bone scan: New metastatic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/ml, determined within two weeks prior to starting treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maintaining castrate status: Patients who have not undergone surgical orchiectomy&#xD;
             should continue on medical therapies [i.e. gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs&#xD;
             (GnRH analogs) to maintain castrate levels of serum testosterone. Patients who are&#xD;
             receiving an anti-androgen as part of their first-line hormonal therapy must have&#xD;
             shown progression of disease off of the anti-androgen prior to enrollment. Patients&#xD;
             must discontinue Megestrol Acetate (MEGACE) and show progression of disease off of&#xD;
             this medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy except for adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapy given &gt; than 3 years&#xD;
             prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than one prior course of palliative radiotherapy. No prior radioisotope&#xD;
             therapy with Strontium-89 or Samarium.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Four weeks since major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed an informed consent document stating that they understand&#xD;
             the investigational nature of the proposed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Required Initial Laboratory Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WBC &gt; 3,000/µl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ANC &gt; 1,500/µl&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  SGOT (AST) &lt; 2.5 x upper limits of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  SGPT (AST) &lt; 2.5 x upper limits of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PSA &gt; 4.0 ng/ml (if no measurable disease for Group B) &gt; 4.0 ng/ml for Group A&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PT within normal limits(*)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PTT within normal limits(*)&#xD;
&#xD;
        (*)unless patients are already anti-coagulated for other reasons (i.e. atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
        etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and for additional 1&#xD;
             months after finishing Phenoxodiol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt;3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may continue on a daily Multi-Vitamin and Calcium supplements but all other&#xD;
             herbal, alternative and food supplements (i.e. PC-Spes, Saw Palmetto, St John Wort,&#xD;
             etc.) must be discontinued before registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bisphosphonate therapy for bone metastases is allowed; however, treatment must be&#xD;
             initiated prior to the first dose of PXD. Prophylactic use of bisphosphonates in&#xD;
             patients without bone disease, except for the treatment of osteoporosis, and&#xD;
             initiation of bisphosphonates during study treatment is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure&#xD;
             (New York Heart Association Class III or IV), active angina pectoris or recent&#xD;
             myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months) are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior history of hemorrhagic or thrombotic cerebral vascular accident,&#xD;
             deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within the past 6 months are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancers are not to be registered. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently&#xD;
             active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy and are now considered (by their&#xD;
             physician) to be at less than 30% risk for relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with Phenoxodiol. Appropriate studies will be undertaken&#xD;
             in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
