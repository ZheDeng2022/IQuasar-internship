  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the administration, safety and immunologic&#xD;
      effectiveness of an experimental vaccine for colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination, usually administered by a traditional intradermal&#xD;
      route, is a new treatment option for cancer patients. While the previous DC-based vaccination&#xD;
      trials have shown the safety of this approach and its ability to induce objective clinical&#xD;
      responses, the overall efficacy of DC-based vaccines is still disappointing (Rosenberg et&#xD;
      al., 2004). We hypothesize that the two likely causes of such limited clinical activity are:&#xD;
      A) suboptimal type of DCs used as a vaccine and B) suboptimal modes of use of such vaccines&#xD;
      that do not allow the vaccinated patients to fully benefit from DC biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a pilot evaluation of the therapeutic vaccination with DC1s loaded with&#xD;
      autologous tumor material, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that have been&#xD;
      resected to no or minimal evidence of disease.The proposed evaluation of the novel&#xD;
      intralymphatic route of DC-based vaccination will allow us to administer the vaccine in a way&#xD;
      that is more physiologic with respect to the kinetics of antigen appearance to the lymph&#xD;
      nodes and is feasible to be performed in repetitive fashion, without damaging local lymph&#xD;
      nodes.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer with minimal&#xD;
             evidence of disease or resectable metastases (to include extra-hepatic metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of metastatic tumor material, from hepatic metastasis and additional&#xD;
             sites, that can be resected under sterile conditions for autologous vaccine&#xD;
             preparation (not all tumors harvested will be of sufficient quantity or quality to&#xD;
             make vaccine, therefore some subjects may not receive vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No chemotherapy, radiotherapy, major surgery, or biologic therapy for their malignancy&#xD;
             in the 4 weeks prior to the vaccine administration and must have recovered from all&#xD;
             side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An ECOG performance standard of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hepatic function as evidenced by bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL and a PT &lt; 2 seconds&#xD;
