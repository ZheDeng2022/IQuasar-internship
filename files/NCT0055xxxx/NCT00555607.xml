    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to study pathogenetic mechanisms in severe asthma and compare those&#xD;
      mechanisms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in order to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that severe asthma and COPD develop into similar chronic degenerative changes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BIOAIR project focuses on the sub-group of asthma patients that suffer from severe or&#xD;
      difficult-to-control asthma, and who have frequent asthma exacerbations ('attacks'). This&#xD;
      sub-group of asthma patients consists of around 10% of all asthma patients, but accounts for&#xD;
      more than half of the total community costs for asthma. It is as yet unknown why these&#xD;
      patients are so much more severely ill compared to the majority of asthma patients that have&#xD;
      controlled disease. No adequate treatment has yet been established. The BIOAIR study was&#xD;
      initiated in order to find out more about the mechanisms underlying severe asthma. Since some&#xD;
      of the changes that occur in severe asthma are similar to patients with chronic obstructive&#xD;
      lung disease (COPD), a group of COPD patients was included and will be studied as well. A&#xD;
      group with controlled mild-to-moderate asthma was included for comparative reasons.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. The patient has a history of malignancy, is known to be positive for HIV, or other&#xD;
             states that are considered to interfere with study conduct or scientific&#xD;
             interpretations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient cannot read or comprehend written material, or is in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, for other reasons unlikely to understand and follow the study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient is mentally or legally incapacitated preventing informed consent from&#xD;
             being obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusions because of pulmonary disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient is unable to perform acceptable spirometry, peak flow measurements and/or&#xD;
             complete diary cards in a satisfactory way during the period between visit 1 and visit&#xD;
             3B (optimisation period and prednisolone/placebo trial). If the patient is unable to&#xD;
             use the electronic Peak Flow meters/Diary cards, it is acceptable to use an ordinary&#xD;
             mechanical meter (e.g. Mini-Wright) together with a paper version of the diary card.&#xD;
             Patients that are unable to use the mechanical meter and paper diary card during the&#xD;
             period between visit 1 and 3B cannot enter the follow-up year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has, in addition to asthma or COPD, any other pulmonary disorder that&#xD;
             according to the investigator would interfere with the study procedures or scientific&#xD;
             evaluation (e.g. tuberculosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient suffers from chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure as indicated by an&#xD;
             elevated pCO2 (&gt;47 mm Hg or 6,25 kPa). In case of doubt this should be confirmed with&#xD;
             pulse oximetry or blood gas sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusions because of medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has received immunosuppressants other than corticosteroids (i.e.,&#xD;
             methotrexate, gold, troleandomycin, cyclosporin or any other experimental&#xD;
             anti-inflammatory drug) within three months of study entry.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Specific exclusion criterion for patients with COPD (group 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient has a history of asthma confirmed by a specialist in pulmonary medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specific exclusion criteria for bronchoscopy (all groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has had a severe exacerbation of asthma requiring high doses of oral&#xD;
             steroids during the last three (3) months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has had a severe exacerbation of COPD requiring intensive outpatient&#xD;
