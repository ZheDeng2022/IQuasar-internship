  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a validated target for the treatment of&#xD;
      cancer, and agents targeting EGFR such as erlotinib (Tarceva®) are approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      treatment of various solid tumors. AV-412 is a novel inhibitor of the EGFR-tyrosine kinase,&#xD;
      with added activity against Her2 and other oncogenic kinases. Based on evidence of&#xD;
      preclinical activity in various solid tumors, AV-412 is being developed as a possible novel&#xD;
      treatment for cancer in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of AV-412, and&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose of AV-412 when administered orally three times weekly.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation trial, and all subjects will receive oral AV-412&#xD;
      administered three times weekly or once weekly for 4 weeks (1 cycle) to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of AV-412. Treatment duration will be a minimum of 2 consecutive dosing cycles&#xD;
      (8 weeks), if tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon completion of the 2 cycles, subjects with documented stable disease or an objective&#xD;
           response may continue to receive therapy at the same dose and schedule previously&#xD;
           utilized, as long as tolerability is acceptable, for up to 1 year. Treatment beyond 1&#xD;
           year from the time of enrollment will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis between the&#xD;
           sponsor and investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects experiencing unacceptable toxicities or with documented disease progression&#xD;
           will be discontinued from further participation in the study Accrual to next cohort will&#xD;
           occur only after acceptable tolerance has been demonstrated throughout Cycle 1, and only&#xD;
           after consultation with medical monitor.&#xD;
