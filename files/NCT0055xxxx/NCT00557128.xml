  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, single-dose, period-balanced, three-period crossover study&#xD;
      conducted in healthy subjects designed to evaluate whether the absorption of the FDC&#xD;
      formulation is affected by the ingestion of a high fat meal or is altered when taken in a&#xD;
      fasted state.&#xD;
