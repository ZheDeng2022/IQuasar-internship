      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if there is an association between the endocrine and&#xD;
      ultrasonographic markers of ovarian reserve and the IVF outcome and to determine which&#xD;
      markers contribute to the prediction of poor response in IVF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most frustrating problem in IVF today is that of poor ovarian response. There is&#xD;
      an amount of woman undergoing infertility treatment, who respond poorly to the usual&#xD;
      gonatotrophin stimulation protocol applied. The ovarian response, which is the number of&#xD;
      antral follicles and oocytes which are developed in the ovary after stimulation, is&#xD;
      correlated directly with the ovarian reserve. As ovarian reserve is defined the existent&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative supply of follicles which are found in the ovaries and&#xD;
      potentially can be developed in dominant and therefore it is closely associated with&#xD;
      reproductive potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a plethora of criteria used to characterize the poor response. The number of&#xD;
      developed follicles or the number of oocytes retrieved after a standard dose ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation protocol, are two of the most substantial criteria for the definition of poor&#xD;
      ovarian reserve. Satisfying response after ovulation induction is considered the retrieval of&#xD;
      5-14 oocytes per patient, whereas poor response is considered the retrieval of 4 or less&#xD;
      oocytes. Using the standard doses, however, a number of patients will exhibit inappropriate&#xD;
      ovarian responses. Exaggerated response leads to increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation&#xD;
      syndrome, while on the other hand, inadequate ovarian response is associated with increased&#xD;
      number of IVF cancellations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past two decades, a substantial amount of research has been carried out in order&#xD;
      to improve our knowledge on ovarian response predictors. Age has often guided infertility&#xD;
      treatment choices, since a woman's chronological age is the single most important factor in&#xD;
      predicting a couple's reproductive potential, as it is generally acknowledged that&#xD;
      reproductive ageing is related to both quantitative and qualitative reduction of the&#xD;
      primordial follicle pool. However, age alone is of limited value and so it cannot predict the&#xD;
      response to infertility treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of ovarian reserve tests have been designed in order to determine ovarian reserve&#xD;
      and have been evaluated for their ability to predict the outcome of IVF. Many of these tests&#xD;
      have become part of the routine diagnostic procedure for infertile patients who undergo&#xD;
      assisted reproductive techniques. These ovarian reserve tests include the measurement of&#xD;
      specific endocrine markers in combination with the study of some ultra-sonographic&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal FSH was the first widely used endocrine marker of ovarian reserve that had better&#xD;
      potential than age for predicting decreased ovarian function and today it is established that&#xD;
      patients with elevated basal FSH levels have lowered success rates after IVF. At present,&#xD;
      several other markers of ovarian reserve are advocated, such as basal estradiol levels, basal&#xD;
      LH levels, early follicular phase serum inhibin B concentration and anti-mullerian hormone&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, several ovarian ultrasonographic parameters are studied as markers for ovarian&#xD;
      resposiveness. The antral follicle count, the ovarian volume and the ovarian stromal blood&#xD;
      flow appeared to be indicative of poor response in assisted reproduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate if there is an association between the&#xD;
      endocrine and ultrasonographic markers of ovarian reserve and the IVF outcome and to&#xD;
      determine which markers contribute to the prediction of poor response in IVF.&#xD;
