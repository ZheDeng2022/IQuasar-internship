  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to test the safety of acadesine in patients with B-CLL and see&#xD;
      what effects it has on patients and their leukaemia. The study also aims to examine the way&#xD;
      acadesine is processed by the body. The study will look at the effects of acadesine in the&#xD;
      body and the concentration of the drug and its main by-product (ZMP) in the blood to&#xD;
      determine the dose and the frequency of dosing that is likely to be the most effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, escalating dose and number of doses study that will involve&#xD;
      up to 30-40 patients with B-CLL. A patient who fails to reach their final assessment visit&#xD;
      due to reasons other than the occurrence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) may be replaced.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be enrolled into Part I or Part II of the study in cohorts of three&#xD;
      patients. There will be a requirement to stagger Day 1 dosing between all patients in each&#xD;
      cohort by a minimum of 48 hours. In the first part of the study (Part I) patients will&#xD;
      receive a single dose of acadesine on Day 1. In the second part of the study (Part II),&#xD;
      patients will receive up to 5 doses of treatment over a period of up to 20 days starting on&#xD;
      Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part I of the study, the starting dose will be 50 mg/kg given as a 4 hour iv infusion on&#xD;
      Day 1 only. Patients will continue to be assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics for up to three weeks after dosing (to Day 22). The decision to escalate to&#xD;
      the next dose in a separate cohort of patients will be based on the assessment of safety,&#xD;
      including any DLTs, pharmacokinetic modelling (PKM) of exposure to ZMP and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      response data, where available, by an independent Data Monitoring Board (DMB). A DLT is&#xD;
      defined as a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, which may be local to the injection site or systemic,&#xD;
      which is observed within 21 days of dosing and is considered to be related to study drug. The&#xD;
      dose will not be escalated if PKM indicates that the exposure to ZMP has reached a plateau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will continue with each new cohort in accordance with the rules described in&#xD;
      the following table. The dose below that at which dose escalation is stopped will be&#xD;
      considered the Optimal Biological Dose (OBD) and this dose will be the starting dose used in&#xD;
      Part II of the study which will assess repeat dosing with acadesine. The OBD will be reviewed&#xD;
      by the DMB prior to the start of Part II of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a DLT is noted in a given cohort in Part I, the following dose escalation rules will be&#xD;
      followed to ascertain the maximum administered dose (MAD). In the unlikely event that a DLT&#xD;
      is seen in ≥ 2 patients at the starting dose used in Part I, the study may be resumed with a&#xD;
      lower dose if there is adequate evidence of the desired pharmacodynamic effect, ie a&#xD;
      reduction in B-cell count, at the starting dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation in Part I of the study shall follow a modified Fibonacci dose escalation&#xD;
      design, with 100% dose escalations allowed until a Grade 2 toxicity that is considered&#xD;
      related to treatment is confirmed (as defined by the NCI CTCAE v3.0). If this occurs, future&#xD;
      escalations shall then be incremental (67%, 50%, 40%, 33%, etc), until the MAD is confirmed.&#xD;
      Intermediate dose levels may be evaluated if indicated by the acquired safety or PK data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part I of the study, blood samples for PK analysis (for both acadesine and its metabolite&#xD;
      ZMP) will be taken pre-dose and 0, 30, 60 minutes, 2, 6, 20, 72, 96, and 168 hours, 14 and 21&#xD;
      days post-dose in all cohorts. Predictive modelling of repeat dose pharmacokinetics will be&#xD;
      carried out and used in conjunction with the safety and pharmacodynamic data to predict a&#xD;
      suitable multiple dose regimen in Part II of the clinical study, where up to 5 doses will be&#xD;
      administered at regular intervals over a period of up to 20 days. The Part II dosing decision&#xD;
      will be based on a review of the data by the DMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part II one additional acadesine dose will be administered for each successive new cohort&#xD;
      enrolled. The decision to add an additional dose in a separate cohort of patients will be&#xD;
      based on assessment of safety, including any DLTs, PKM of exposure to ZMP, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic response data, where available, by the DMB. Blood samples for PK analysis in&#xD;
      Part II of the study will be taken pre-dose and at 0, 30, 60 minutes, 2, 6, 20, 72, 96, and&#xD;
      168 hours post-dose on the first and last day of dosing and also at pre-dose and 0 minutes&#xD;
      post-dose for any interim doses. Samples will also be taken 14 and 21 days after completion&#xD;
      of the last dose for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in Part I, patients in Part II will continue to be followed up for 21 days after their&#xD;
      last dose of acadesine. If 1 out of the 3 patients experiences a DLT, a further 3 patients&#xD;
      will be recruited to the cohort. If ≥ 2 patients out of the 6 experience a DLT, dosing will&#xD;
      be stopped for this cohort and further cohorts of patients may be enrolled to receive up to 5&#xD;
      administrations of acadesine at a lower dose (or intermediate dose) over a 20 day period,&#xD;
      based on safety, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data. The decision to continue at a&#xD;
      lower dose will be based on a review by the DMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling times for pharmacokinetic assessments may be altered during the study based on the&#xD;
      data collected in order to fully define the pharmacokinetic profile of acadesine and ZMP. The&#xD;
      total volume of blood required for these assessments will not increase.&#xD;
