      We will study the effect of taking eltroxin at different time, i.e. fasting or postprandial&#xD;
      periods. We will also study the effect of levothyroxin treatment in Chinese people&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE - Current treatment of benign thyroid is oral levothyroxin by suppression of&#xD;
      thyrotropin secretion and so that tumor growth. Although current consensus is taking thyroxin&#xD;
      one hour before meal because the PH value of gastrointestinal tract will affect drug&#xD;
      absorption, some patient suffered from epigastric discomfort when taking thyroxin with empty&#xD;
      stomach, and wish to take it postprandial. However, there is no direct evidence showing if&#xD;
      taking thyroxin at different time point significantly affects treatment outcome. Besides, the&#xD;
      response to thyroxin therapy differs among people. The purposes of this study are to evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical significance of different time points of thyroxine intake and to search factors&#xD;
      relating to thyroxin response of benign thyroid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We will include patients who have benign thyroid tumors&#xD;
      diagnosed with fine needle aspiration cytology and have normal thyroid function into our&#xD;
      study. After informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned into two groups. Patients&#xD;
      in the first group will take thyroxin one hour before breakfast until thyrotropin level&#xD;
      stabilized between 0.5 and 1.0 mU/L for 3 months. Then thyroxin will be discontinued.&#xD;
      Patients will restart thyroxin therapy three months later but after breakfast. Patients in&#xD;
      another group will take thyroxin postprandial, discontinue thyroxin and then one hour before&#xD;
      breakfast. Questionnaire interviews about diet and life style, blood samples and fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration cytology samples will be obtained. Changes of thyroid nodules will be evaluated&#xD;
      with thyroid echo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTIC ANALYSIS - Descriptive data will be described as means and SDs for continuous&#xD;
      variables, and analysis of variance and Chi-square tests were used for assessing the&#xD;
      significances. A p-value below 0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
