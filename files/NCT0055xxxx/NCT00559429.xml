      The primary objective of the study is to determine a recommended phase II dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate preliminary incidence and duration of clinical benefits as determined by&#xD;
           improvements of pain, PSA decline and bone scan changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the toxicity profile of the escalating doses of Docetaxel in combination&#xD;
           with Samarium 153 in patients with advanced, hormone refractory prostate cancer&#xD;
           metastatic to the bone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer remains the leading cancer diagnosed in men in the USA. It is estimated that&#xD;
      232,090 new cases will be diagnosed in 2003, which account for about 30% of all cancer cases&#xD;
      diagnosed in men.(1) Prostate cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer death in men&#xD;
      (after lung cancer) in the US with estimated 28,900 men dying of prostate cancer in 2003.&#xD;
      Although 79% of men will present with early stage disease (i.e., local or regional) at the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis, a substantial number of men will present with metastatic disease. (2)&#xD;
      Unfortunately many of the patients who present with local disease and are treated with local&#xD;
      therapy will eventually experience disease recurrence. Initial treatment for patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer in advanced stages has been through androgen deprivation. Approximately 85%&#xD;
      of men will have an objective response to hormonal therapy initially but eventually these&#xD;
      patients will develop progressive and eventually fatal disease. Treatment options for&#xD;
      patients with HRPC include systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy and /or palliation of symptoms&#xD;
      (especially pain) (3). Single agent and combination chemotherapy regimens have been&#xD;
      associated objective response rates ranging from 40-70% in patients with HRPC (4). No&#xD;
      survival advantage has been shown with any treatment in phase III studies. More effective&#xD;
      systemic therapies are needed if we are to have an impact on the morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      caused by the disease. (5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A newer bone targeted approach is the combination of radioisotopes with chemotherapy. In&#xD;
      addition to its inherent systemic benefits chemotherapeutic agents can also act as&#xD;
      radiosensitizers when combined with radiopharmaceutical. Preliminary clinical experience with&#xD;
      the combination of radiopharmaceuticals and systemic chemotherapy indicate that this approach&#xD;
      is feasible tolerable and potentially effective. In a randomized phase II trial metastatic&#xD;
      HRPC patients were treated with chemotherapy: Ketoconazole and Doxorubicin alternating with&#xD;
      Vinblastine and Estramustine (KAVE regimen). Seventy-two patients who were stable or&#xD;
      responded after 2-3 cycles were randomized to receive a consolidation treatment with&#xD;
      additional 6 weekly doxorubicin treatments with a single dose of 89Sr or weekly doxorubicin&#xD;
      alone. Patients receiving the combined consolidation treatment had a significantly longer&#xD;
      time to progression and survival (27.7 vs.16.8 months. P=0.0014).(20)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel clearly represents the most active single agent for the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The radiosensitizing properties of Docetaxel are well documented in&#xD;
      preclinical and clinical experiments. The most likely underlying mechanism is a G2M block in&#xD;
      the cell cycle induced by docetaxel and this will result in cycling cells at the most&#xD;
      radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides a palliative role, current clinical and preclinical data suggest that a bone targeted&#xD;
      approach may represent a potentially useful component of the overall therapeutic approach for&#xD;
      metastatic prostate cancer. Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials suggest that&#xD;
      bisphosphonates and endothelin A antagonists may delay the progression of prostate cancer in&#xD;
      bone. These clinical observations of relatively large trials have provided impetus for the&#xD;
      design of large definitive studies to evaluate the role of various bone targeted approaches&#xD;
      for the treatment of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The currently proposed trial represents a preliminary evaluation of the safety of the&#xD;
      docetaxel +153 Sm combination. This study may also provide important preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      information with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination regimen was designed to explore clinically the possible interactions between&#xD;
      docetaxel and samarium-153-EDTMP. The block in the G2/M phase following the administration of&#xD;
      docetaxel results in the accumulation of cells in the most radiosensitive phase of the cell&#xD;
      cycle. Pre-clinical data suggest that this is likely to occur 24-48hrs post administration of&#xD;
      docetaxel. This is followed 24 hours later by the administration of the radiopharmaceutical&#xD;
      which has a short physical half life of 46.3 hours. The bone uptake of the complexed sm153-&#xD;
      EDTMP molecule will be effectively taken up at the bone metastatic site within this time&#xD;
      interval. To target cells repopulating the cell cycle following the initial block+ cell kill&#xD;
      in the mitotic phase, we planned a Q3 week x 2 administration of docetaxel on Day 1 and Day&#xD;
      22. Following a 8 week of rest (weeks 5 -12), treatment is repeated for a maximum of 2 cycles&#xD;
      or until the development of dose-limiting toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samarium is given in 12 week intervals. Docetaxel is a radiosensitizer that has shown&#xD;
      activity in prostate cancer given to patients on both Q3 week and Q week schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a personal communication from Dr. Theodore DeWeese's (Johns Hopkins Hospital&#xD;
      Radiation Oncologist) preclinical data suggests that 24 hours after a dose of docetaxel,&#xD;
      there is a maximum G2M arrest. This represents the rationale for the bolus dose of docetaxel&#xD;
      for the combined schedule.&#xD;
