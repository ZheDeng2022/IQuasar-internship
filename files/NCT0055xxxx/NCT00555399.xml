      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if vorinostat when given with&#xD;
      isotretinoin and temozolomide can help to control glioblastoma or gliosarcoma. The safety of&#xD;
      these drug combinations will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 3 groups. If you are on of the first 30 participants in the&#xD;
      study, you will be randomly assigned to a group. If you are enrolled after the first 30&#xD;
      participants, you will be more likely to be enrolled in the group that is showing better&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will take vorinostat and isotretinoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will take isotretinoin and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 3, you will take vorinostat, isotretinoin and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take vorinostat by mouth once a day during Days 1-7 and Days 15-21 of each cycle.&#xD;
      You should take vorinostat by mouth in the morning, at about the same time each day.&#xD;
      Vorinostat capsules should be swallowed whole and should not be opened. If a capsule is&#xD;
      damaged or broken, spills of powder from vorinostat capsules should be cleaned up carefully.&#xD;
      If you come in contact with the powder, you should wash your hands thoroughly. If the spill&#xD;
      is on a surface, the area must be washed at least 3 times with rubbing alcohol, followed by&#xD;
      water. Vorinostat capsules should be stored at room temperature (59°-86°F [15°-30°C]) in a&#xD;
      dry area. You should take vorinostat with food, but not a high fat meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also take isotretinoin by mouth 2 times a day on Days 1-21 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take temozolomide by mouth once a day on Days 1-7 and Days 15-21 of each cycle. You&#xD;
      should take temozolomide by mouth at bedtime, at about the same time each day. You should&#xD;
      swallow the temozolomide capsules whole, one right after the other, without chewing them.&#xD;
      They should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours after eating) with 1 cup (about 8&#xD;
      ounces) of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you vomit while taking vorinostat, isotretinoin and/or temozolomide, you should not &quot;make&#xD;
      up&quot; the dose. You should wait until the next scheduled dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 2 of every cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ° Blood (about 1 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 4 of Cycles 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check how well your&#xD;
           blood clots,.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1/2 teaspoon) pregnancy&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 4 of Cycle 2 and then every other cycle after that (Cycles 4, 6, 8, and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. This routine blood draw&#xD;
           will also include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check how well your blood clots, your&#xD;
           pancreas function and the amount of fats in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a brain MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time during the study, extra tests may be performed if the doctor thinks they are&#xD;
      needed for your safety. The study doctor will tell you more about any extra tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may take the study drug(s) for up to 1 year. You may continue to receive the study&#xD;
      drug(s) beyond 1 year if your doctor decides that it is in your best interest. You will be&#xD;
      taken off study early if the disease gets worse or you have intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your last dose of the study drug, every 2 months after that, you may be called and&#xD;
      asked how you are feeling. This phone call should take about 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you stop the study drugs because of intolerable side effects, you will visit the clinic&#xD;
      every 2 months, unless the disease gets worse. At these visits, You will have a physical&#xD;
      exam, including a neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. This routine blood draw&#xD;
           will also include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check how well your blood clots, your&#xD;
           pancreas function and the amount of fats in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a brain MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Isotretinoin, temozolomide, and vorinostat are FDA approved&#xD;
      drugs and commercially available. The use of these drugs in this combination is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 135 patients will take part in this study. Up to 30 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with histologically proven supratentorial WHO grade IV glioma (glioblastoma&#xD;
             or gliosarcoma) will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by&#xD;
             MRI scan and should have failed radiation therapy. The scan done prior to study entry&#xD;
             documenting progression will be reviewed by the treating physician to document changes&#xD;
             in tumor dimension to confirm recurrence. Patients with prior therapy that included&#xD;
             interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of true&#xD;
             progressive disease rather than radiation necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. (2. continued) Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy,&#xD;
             Gliadel wafers or stereotactic radiosurgical procedures must have confirmation of true&#xD;
             progressive disease rather than radiation necrosis. Such confirmation may be using&#xD;
             advanced imaging studies (e.g. PET scans, diffusion-perfusion MRI, SPECT etc) or if&#xD;
             available, surgical sampling and histological confirmation (surgery is not required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients may have had up to 2 prior relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. All patients must sign an IRB approved informed consent indicating their awareness of&#xD;
             the investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization&#xD;
             for the release of their protected health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The baseline on-study MRI should be performed within 14 days (+ 3 working days) prior&#xD;
             to registration and on a steroid dosage that has been stable or decreasing for at&#xD;
             least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and the&#xD;
             initiation of therapy (or at that time), a new baseline MRI is required. The same type&#xD;
             of scan, i.e., MRI, must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor&#xD;
             measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be&#xD;
             eligible as long as they have recovered from the effects of surgery. Evaluable or&#xD;
             measurable disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for&#xD;
             eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual measurable disease&#xD;
             post-operatively, a MRI should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate&#xD;
             post-operative period or 4-6 weeks post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must be 18 years old or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status equal or greater than 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy to &lt; grade 2 non&#xD;
             hematological or grade 2 or lesser hematological toxicity per CTC ver 4 (except deep&#xD;
             vein thrombosis): 4 weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy and/or at least two weeks from&#xD;
             vincristine, 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine administration, and&#xD;
             1 week for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, cis-retinoic acid, etc.&#xD;
             (radiosensitizer does not count). Patients who receive anticancer agents for&#xD;
             non-therapeutic purposes unrelated to this study&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. (10. continued) (such as presurgically for obtaining pharmacology data for the agent)&#xD;
             will be eligible to enter the study provided they have recovered from the toxic&#xD;
             effects of the agent if any. Any questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic&#xD;
             agents should be directed to the Study Chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC = or &gt; 1,500/mm^3 and platelet&#xD;
             count of = or &gt; 100,000/mm^3), adequate liver function (SGPT = or &lt; 3 times upper&#xD;
             limit of normal and alkaline phosphatase = or &lt; 2 times upper limit of normal,&#xD;
             bilirubin = or &lt;1.5 mg/dl), adequate renal function (BUN and creatinine = or &lt;1.5&#xD;
             times upper limit of normal) and normal serum amylase and lipase prior to starting&#xD;
             therapy. Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides are not a contraindication to study&#xD;
             enrollment, but should be managed as clinically appropriate by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients must be willing and able to comply with the FDA mandated iPLEDGE program for&#xD;
             treatment with isotretinoin (cRA). Patients must sign specific informed consents for&#xD;
             treatment with cRA, as mandated by iPLEDGE guidelines. Women of childbearing potential&#xD;
             must not be pregnant, must not be breast-feeding and must practice adequate&#xD;
             contraception during and one month after participation in the study. Male and Female&#xD;
             patients on treatment with vorinostat must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception for the duration of the study, and for 30 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Prior treatment with dose dense regimens of temozolomide is not allowed (e.g, 7 days&#xD;
             on/7 days off, 21 day/28 day and daily low dose continuous dosing). However, prior&#xD;
             treatment with standard day 1-5 dosing in the adjuvant setting and low dose daily&#xD;
             dosing as part of chemoradiation therapy are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Prior treatment with isotretinoin is allowed because the trial is based on the&#xD;
             hypothesis that HDAC inhibition will potentially overcome resistance to retinoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or bladder), unless in complete remission and off of&#xD;
             all therapy for that disease for a minimum of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must not have: a) active infection; b) disease that will obscure toxicity or&#xD;
             dangerously alter drug metabolism, especially liver disease; c) serious intercurrent&#xD;
             medical illness; d) prior treatment with HDAC inhibitors. However, patients who have&#xD;
             received anticancer agents for non-therapeutic purposes (for eg., as part of a&#xD;
             pharmacology study without therapeutic intent) will remain eligible for enrollment&#xD;
             into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior treatment with bevacizumab is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients receiving valproic acid (VPA), an anticonvulsant drug with HDAC inhibitor&#xD;
             properties, will be excluded, unless they are switched to an alternative agent prior&#xD;
             to treatment initiation. No wash out period is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients on previous treatment with carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a known allergy to any component of vorinostat, or a known allergy to&#xD;
             temozolomide and/or isotretinoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient must be able to tolerate the procedures required in this study including&#xD;
             periodic blood sampling, study related assessments, and management at the treating&#xD;
             institution for the duration of the study. Inability to comply with protocol or study&#xD;
             procedures (for example, an inability to swallow tablets) will be an exclusion&#xD;
             criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients receiving treatment with other antiepileptic medications will not be&#xD;
             excluded. Vorinostat is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4). However,&#xD;
             vorinostat may potentially suppress CYP 3A4 activity. Therefore, patients should&#xD;
             preferably be treated with non-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic medications to avoid any&#xD;
             potential interactions with vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. (8. continued) However, the use of non-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic medications is&#xD;
             not mandatory. If enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs are used, monitoring of drug&#xD;
             levels should be considered, as considered clinically appropriate by the treating&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
