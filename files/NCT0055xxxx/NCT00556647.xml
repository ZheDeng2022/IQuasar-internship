      Patients who are admitted to the outpatient pulmonology department by a general practitioner&#xD;
      or specialist with a chest X-ray suspicious for lung cancer with an age between 18 and 80&#xD;
      years are suitable for participation. The X-ray and referral are studied by a chest physician&#xD;
      (by phone or fax ). Selected patients are invited to enter the study after answering a&#xD;
      questionnaire by phone (p. 31). The questionnaire screens patients' interest, co-morbidity&#xD;
      and medication use. Informed consent forms, patient information forms and a time table for&#xD;
      the diagnostic day are provided by mail or E-mail in cases where time gets short. Waiting&#xD;
      time to enter the study will be no longer than one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hundred patients will be recruited by means of informed consent. Patients will be admitted at&#xD;
      the pulmonary ward for the study day and will be accompanied by nurses. All patients will get&#xD;
      PET-CT scanning in the morning of the study day. Depending on the location of lesions seen on&#xD;
      PET-CT, further invasive diagnostic procedures will be planned for the afternoon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediastinal and adjacent structures will be analysed with EUS-FNA. Mediastinal staging will&#xD;
      be done with bronchoscopy alone for central located tumors, peripherally located lesions will&#xD;
      be analysed with EUS-FNA or bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of patients in which this diagnostic track leads to a diagnosis and tumor&#xD;
      stage in one day will be determined. The number of tests and diagnostic procedures needed to&#xD;
      obtain a diagnosis, including tumor stage (especially final stage NSCLC) and function tests,&#xD;
      will be compared with a historical matched study group. This historical study group is chosen&#xD;
      from an era before the availability of integrated PET-CT and ultrasound guided endoscopic&#xD;
      tools and meets the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the patients in this study. The&#xD;
      timelines from initial chest X-ray to diagnostic day to informing the patient to start of&#xD;
      treatment will be determined. These figures will be compared with the historical study group.&#xD;

      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have to pass different diagnostic phases in their analysis of a chest X-ray&#xD;
      suspicious for lung cancer. Long waiting times with uncertainty about the outcome are a waste&#xD;
      of time and unacceptable for the patient. Hospital visits as a consequence of this are a&#xD;
      financial burden. Important reasons for physicians to shorten diagnostic tumor analysis.&#xD;
      Shortening and intensifying the diagnostic track by combining diagnostic and staging&#xD;
      procedures would preclude unnecessary tests and procedures, lowering the total hospital costs&#xD;
      per patient and may lead to more satisfaction for patient and physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET-CT is the most important imaging tool for lung cancer analysis and better than CT or&#xD;
      FDG-PET alone, but not optimal for determination of tumour invasion in mediastinal or other&#xD;
      adjacent structures. MRI is more suitable for this purpose, but is limited available. EUS-FNA&#xD;
      (carinal lymph nodes), eventually in combination with CT or FDG-PET and EBUS-TBNA (right&#xD;
      mediastinal lymph nodes), superior to TBNA alone, are novel imaging techniques with a high&#xD;
      accuracy. Bronchoscopy provides information on tumour type and resectability of centrally but&#xD;
      not peripherally located tumours. Mediastinal staging can be performed by adding TBNA to&#xD;
      bronchoscopy with high accuracy. PET-CT, as a superior imaging mode, could direct for the&#xD;
      best subsequent endoscopic technique for obtaining a tissue diagnosis as well as leading to a&#xD;
      more comprehensive staging of patients with suspected lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      False negative findings could be caused by sampling errors or false interpretations by the&#xD;
      cytopathologist of specimens with tumour cell poverty. A more sensitive immune histochemical&#xD;
      analysis could modify EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to study feasibility of a fast one-day diagnostic track including PET-CT and subsequent&#xD;
           diagnostic/ staging investigation depending on PET-CT findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the percentage of patients in which the one-day track is sufficient for diagnosis and&#xD;
           staging needing no more further investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the time-spans needed for diagnosis (including staging and function tests) of the&#xD;
           patients in comparison to a historical study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the amount of investigations needed to obtain the diagnosis compared with a historical&#xD;
           study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the effect of immuno-histochemical analysis on the sensitivity of data of diagnostic&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Prospective, open, single center, study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are admitted to the outpatient pulmonology department by a general practitioner&#xD;
      or specialist with a chest X-ray suspicious for lung cancer with an age between 18 and 80&#xD;
      years are suitable for participation. The X-ray and referral are studied by a chest physician&#xD;
      (by phone or fax ). Selected patients are invited to enter the study after answering a&#xD;
      questionnaire by phone ( p. 31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire screens patients' interest, co-morbidity and medication use. Informed&#xD;
      consent forms, patient information forms and a time table for the diagnostic day are provided&#xD;
      by mail or E-mail in cases where time gets short. Waiting time to enter the study will be no&#xD;
      longer than one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hundred patients will be recruited by means of informed consent. In a narrow logistic scheme&#xD;
      the study subjects will undergo a diagnostic work up to a maximum of 3 patients per study day&#xD;
      (p. 32). Patients will be admitted at the pulmonary ward for the study day and will be&#xD;
      accompanied by nurses. All patients will get PET-CT scanning in the morning of the study day.&#xD;
      Depending on the location of lesions seen on PET-CT, further invasive diagnostic procedures&#xD;
      will be planned for the afternoon, according to a scheme outlined on page 33. In the&#xD;
      meanwhile, routine blood tests, EKG and pulmonary function tests are done. The invasive&#xD;
      diagnostic procedure to be chosen, has to provide ideally a diagnosis and stage at one time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediastinal and adjacent structures will be analysed with EUS-FNA or EBUS-TBNA. EBUS-TBNA&#xD;
      will be used for right mediastinal lymph nodes. Carinal lymph nodes are biopsied with&#xD;
      EUS-FNA. Mediastinal staging will be done with bronchoscopy alone for central located tumors,&#xD;
      peripherally located lesions will be analysed with EUS-FNA or bronchoscopy in combination&#xD;
      with EBUS-TBNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When enough material is available, cytologic specimen will be stored in cell casts fixed in&#xD;
      agar. In case of negative biopsies, surgical verification follows. When this verification&#xD;
      proves that cytologic biopsies were false negative, immune histochemical analysis on the agar&#xD;
      imbedded material will be done retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When patients are recovered from their diagnostic procedure, they will leave the hospital&#xD;
      with an appointment for a visit one week later to be informed about their diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment. Additive appointments will be made on a term as short as possible and necessary&#xD;
      when extra diagnostic tests are needed like MRI, exercise tests, perfusion tests or&#xD;
      evaluation by other consultants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of patients in which this diagnostic track leads to a diagnosis and tumor&#xD;
      stage in one day will be determined. The number of tests and diagnostic procedures needed to&#xD;
      obtain a diagnosis, including tumor stage (especially final stage NSCLC) and function tests,&#xD;
      will be compared with a historical matched study group. This historical study group is chosen&#xD;
      from an era before the availability of integrated PET-CT and ultrasound guided endoscopic&#xD;
      tools and meets the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the patients in this study. The&#xD;
      timelines from initial chest X-ray to diagnostic day to informing the patient to start of&#xD;
      treatment will be determined. These figures will be compared with the historical study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, patients will be asked to fill in a patient satisfaction questionnaire concerning&#xD;
      the one-day diagnostic program track, the informative visit and after an eventual successive&#xD;
      treatment start (p. 31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hundred patients with suspicion of lung cancer on X ray with an age between 18-85 years&#xD;
      admitted to the pulmonologist by their general practitioner or specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-day diagnostic track using PET-CT eventually with bronchoscopy, EUS-FNA , EBUS-TBNA and&#xD;
      ultrasound guided transcutaneous biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of patients that will have a definitive diagnosis and final stage NSCLC in one&#xD;
           day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time between chest X-ray with suspicion on lung cancer and the first visit to the&#xD;
           outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Time between the first outpatient clinical contact and informing patient about definite&#xD;
           diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time from the definite diagnosis until the initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secundary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of patients able to have all diagnostic tests in one-day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of tests and procedures that have been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient satisfaction with the one-day procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sensitivity of EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA when immunohistochemical analysis is added to&#xD;
           investigate false negative procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no different adverse effects due to the diagnostic program. Patients in the one-day&#xD;
      diagnostic track will undergo the same diagnostic interventions as patients outside the&#xD;
      study. The risk of bleeding and infection due to the EUS and EBUS procedures must be&#xD;
      mentioned, although patients would be undergo these biopsies even if they would not&#xD;
      participate to this trial; there is no 'additive risk'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden is that the whole diagnostic program could lead to psychological distress because&#xD;
      of the several investigations within a relatively short period. Patients with claustrophobia&#xD;
      might be anxious during the PET-CT. The expected benefits are a patient satisfaction due to&#xD;
      short diagnostic timeframes, lesser diagnostic procedures and faster decision making in&#xD;
      therapeutic options.&#xD;
