      In populations with high prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), malnutrition&#xD;
      (PEM) may influence incident rates of TB. PEM and specific micronutrient deficiencies&#xD;
      compromise cell mediated immunity (CMI) and increase susceptibility to, or severity of&#xD;
      infections. Vitamin A supplementation significantly reduces all-cause child mortality. The&#xD;
      mechanism of the benefits of supplementation on clinical outcomes is largely unknown, but is&#xD;
      likely to be related to an influence on the immune system. Vitamin A supplementation promotes&#xD;
      lymphogenesis and induces a higher proportion of CD4 naïve T-cells in children. Most cases of&#xD;
      LTBI that progress to active disease are vitamin A deficient. Vitamin A deficiency is common&#xD;
      in most TB endemic countries. At the MRC, 32% of TBCC contacts were vitamin A deficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to test the hypotheses: that supplementation with vitamin A will&#xD;
      affect the magnitude and quality of immune responses to mycobacterial antigens and&#xD;
      progression to clinical disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health problem. Approximately a third of the&#xD;
      world's populations are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 95% of cases occur in&#xD;
      developing countries. This enormous pool of latently infected individuals is expected to pose&#xD;
      a major obstacle for TB control in highly endemic countries and globally. In high income, low&#xD;
      TB burden countries, targeted testing of TB case contacts and treatment for latent TB&#xD;
      infection (LTBI) is practised as a component of TB control strategies. However, this is not&#xD;
      practised in high burden, low-income countries. New evidence from mathematical modelling&#xD;
      suggests that, to meet millennium development goals, interventions against M. tuberculosis&#xD;
      infection will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children are at increased risk of rapid progression to active disease (usually within a year&#xD;
      for infants). , Malnutrition has been identified as a major risk factor for progression to TB&#xD;
      because of its profound effect on cellular immune function- the key host defence against TB.&#xD;
      There are 2 types of risk associated with malnutrition: acquisition of infection and risk of&#xD;
      infection progressing to disease. Therefore, in populations with high prevalence of latent TB&#xD;
      infection, co-prevalent malnutrition may influence TB incidence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin A supplementation has been clearly shown to reduce all-cause child mortality in&#xD;
      developing countries. Vitamin A given at recommended doses has a profound effect on improving&#xD;
      outcomes in measles and overall childhood mortality and morbidity. The mechanism for this has&#xD;
      been attributed to its modulation of immune responses in addition to correcting underlying&#xD;
      deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In TB patients, it is nearly impossible to determine nutritional status before disease and&#xD;
      thus determine whether malnutrition led to TB or TB led to malnutrition. However, some&#xD;
      studies have established a link between vitamin A deficiency and susceptibility to&#xD;
      respiratory infections and progression from latent to active TB disease. Preschool children&#xD;
      with symptomatic vitamin A deficiency have been found to have respiratory disease at twice&#xD;
      the rate in non-deficient children, irrespective of anthropometric status. Getz et al found&#xD;
      81% of persons in a cohort with LTBI that had low levels of vitamin A developed disease&#xD;
      compared to 30% of those with normal levels. We had previously observed a 32% prevalence of&#xD;
      vitamin A deficiency in a subset of Tuberculosis case contact study contacts with latent TB&#xD;
      (unpublished data). The mechanism of the benefits of vitamin A on clinical outcomes&#xD;
      especially as related to measles is largely unknown and on tuberculosis is yet to be proven.&#xD;
      However, it is likely to be related to an influence on the immune system.In experimental and&#xD;
      animal models, vitamin A promotes differentiation and cytokine secretion by macrophages and&#xD;
      may down regulate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines e.g. TNF-alpha and IL-6. in&#xD;
      children. Vitamin A supplementation has been reported to promote lymphogenesis and induce a&#xD;
      higher proportion of CD4 naïve T-cells (CD4+ CD45RA). In addition, the quality of T-cell&#xD;
      function may also be affected by Vitamin A.There are data indicating that IFN-gamma&#xD;
      production is decreased in vitamin A deficient children while optimal in normal children.&#xD;
      Immune responses of PBMCs from non-deficient children stimulated with specific antigens were&#xD;
      biased towards more of IFN-gamma, and less of IL-10 and IL-4. This cytokine profile is&#xD;
      reminiscent of decreased Treg differentiation and/or Th1-type immune response induced by&#xD;
      vitamin A, which is required for protection against an intracellular pathogen such as M.tb.&#xD;
      Indeed, data from our previous studies suggest that initial decrease in Treg induction in&#xD;
      contacts of TB cases was associated with protection against progression to TB disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge we are unaware of any trial of vitamin A for modulation of&#xD;
      immune responses associated with progression to active disease in children with latent TB. We&#xD;
      will conduct a parallel group comparison of a dose of 200,000 IU Vitamin A supplementation or&#xD;
      placebo in latently infected children aged 5-14 years to evaluate qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative modulation of T-cell responses and clinical disease progression.&#xD;
