      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scope of the Problem: VTE is the third most common cardiovascular disease (heart attack and&#xD;
      stroke are more common) but is the most preventable medical problem among patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with other illnesses. DVT often causes chronic venous insufficiency, a&#xD;
      potentially disabling and painful condition that lowers the quality of life. Acute PE may&#xD;
      cause death or disabling chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. After discharge from&#xD;
      a short-term hospital stay, one study reported that the incidence of DVT was 48 per 100,000&#xD;
      and the incidence of PE (with or without DVT) was 23 per 100,000.9 In addition, the incidence&#xD;
      of VTE increases dramatically with age.10-11 Clinical manifestations of DVT often include&#xD;
      swelling, pain, and extremity discoloration and may lead to PE. Manifestations of PE may&#xD;
      include dyspnea, pleuritic pain, cough, and hemoptysis or may be asymptomatic.12-13 The&#xD;
      28-day mortality rate for a first VTE event is alarmingly high, approximately 11%.14 In&#xD;
      addition, 3-month mortality rates for PE have been reported as high as 17%.15 However,&#xD;
      appropriate prophylaxis-using anticoagulants, mechanical measures, or both anticoagulants&#xD;
      plus mechanical measures-can prevent most episodes of VTE16. For example, mechanical measures&#xD;
      as simple as &quot;low tech&quot; and inexpensive graduated compression stockings can reduce VTE&#xD;
      rates.16a, 16b, 16c&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burden to Patients: VTE is associated with complications including recurrence of DVT or PE,&#xD;
      chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, death, or the subsequent development of&#xD;
      post-thrombotic syndrome. The risk of VTE recurrence is greatest within 6-12 months after the&#xD;
      first event and continues for at least 10 years,17 and is a risk factor for death after PE.18&#xD;
      The post-thrombotic syndrome can have devastating effects on the patients' quality of life&#xD;
      and is associated with venous hypertension that may cause pain, edema, skin changes, varicose&#xD;
      veins, and skin ulcers. Valve dysfunction, which can lead to venous hypertension, is most&#xD;
      often caused by a previous DVT.19 The cumulative incidence of the development of&#xD;
      postthrombotic syndrome after a VTE event is high: 17% at one year, 23% at 2 years, and 29%&#xD;
      at 8 years, with 30% of these cases classified as severe.20&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burden to Society: Direct medical costs to the United States health care system related to&#xD;
      VTE events and complications approximate at least $600 million annually. Bullano and&#xD;
      colleagues21 estimate that managed care plans pay a median of $3,131 per incident DVT, $6,424&#xD;
      per incident PE, and $12,200 for a DVT plus PE combination event. A 2004 registry of 5,451&#xD;
      patients with ultrasound-confirmed DVT at 183 institutions in the United States revealed that&#xD;
      DVT led to hospitalization in 80% of those diagnosed as outpatients. Those initially&#xD;
      diagnosed with DVT as inpatients remained hospitalized for a median of 12 days.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of computerized healthcare delivery systems:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) is growing and is currently utilized in&#xD;
      about 10% of U.S. Hospitals.22 When linked with clinical decision support, it provides a&#xD;
      unique and important tool to improve ordering decisions, thereby reducing medication errors,&#xD;
      transcribing errors, decreasing the frequency of adverse drug events, and increasing&#xD;
      compliance with evidence-based clinical guidelines.23 This leads to overall improved patient&#xD;
      care. There is growing recognition of the importance and utility of CPOE technology, and&#xD;
      currently, there is a concerted effort nation-wide to implement it in all hospitals and&#xD;
      private practices. CPOE programs provide an excellent platform to increase the implementation&#xD;
      of clinical practice guidelines, thereby changing physician behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Brigham and Women's Hospital, we have developed an electronic alert system, which is&#xD;
      integrated with the CPOE system but functions independently. We have created risk score&#xD;
      criteria by which the system determines the risk of DVT or PE for a particular patient. All&#xD;
      the information needed to accomplish this risk assessment is stored in the computer system,&#xD;
      allowing the process to run in an automated fashion. The system according to present criteria&#xD;
      determines whether to generate an alert. To do this, the system checks for the existence of&#xD;
      current orders for prophylaxis, using the Brigham and Women's Hospital CPOE system. The&#xD;
      presence of medication class orders for anticoagulants or general care orders for mechanical&#xD;
      prophylaxis prevents the computer from issuing an alert. We will enhance this computerized&#xD;
      system to produce a series of alerts that provide more information related to prescription or&#xD;
      omission of thromboprophylaxis. We aim to test this new system in our proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Brigham and Women's Hospital, we also leverage the use of the multiple outpatient&#xD;
      electronic medical records and inpatient CPOE systems to facilitate the process of medication&#xD;
      reconciliation before, during, and after the hospital stay. This system aggregates medication&#xD;
      data from electronic medical records (EMR) and CPOE systems so that clinicians can&#xD;
      efficiently generate an accurate pre-admission medication list. Information collected with&#xD;
      the use of this application subsequently supports the writing of admission and discharge&#xD;
      orders by physicians, performance of admission assessment by nurses, and reconciliation of&#xD;
      inpatient orders by pharmacists. Medication histories are thus seamlessly transferred during&#xD;
      transition of care from inpatient admission to discharge to home, rehabilitation, or skilled&#xD;
      nursing facilities. This efficient system will allow us to carefully document the use or&#xD;
      omission of thromboprophylaxis orders. Furthermore, for 90 day follow-up, we will be able to&#xD;
      track thromboprophylaxis prescriptions after hospital discharge by using a combination of the&#xD;
      Brigham and Women's Hospital's pharmacy's electronic outpatient prescription reconciliation&#xD;
      program and Partners' internally developed EMR, the Longitudinal Medical Record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Longitudinal Medical Record is used by our outpatient clinics to record clinical visit&#xD;
      information such as history, notes, problems, medications, and allergies, and provides&#xD;
      inpatient and outpatient test results, including imaging tests and laboratory blood tests,&#xD;
      from 7 Partners-affiliated institutions: Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Newton Wellesley Hospital, North Shore Medical&#xD;
      Center, Faulkner Hospital, and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. The Longitudinal Medical&#xD;
      Record is especially useful for following patients who might undergo evaluation for a new&#xD;
      problem, such as sudden onset of shortness of breath, at a suburban hospital such as Newton&#xD;
      Wellesley Hospital, after a prior hospitalization at Brigham and Women's Hospital for&#xD;
      treatment of a complicated medical illness with a high risk of VTE. In our 2005 randomized&#xD;
      trial of electronic alerts for VTE prophylaxis,8 we relied upon the Longitudinal Medical&#xD;
      Record to achieve 94% follow-up at 90 days of all patients enrolled at Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 2000 and 2004, we developed a computer generated alert system for VTE prophylaxis and&#xD;
      tested it in a large randomized controlled trial at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The system&#xD;
      was linked to the patient database, identifying patients at high risk for VTE (defined as â‰¥ 4&#xD;
      score points and shown in Table 1) who were not receiving prophylaxis. High-risk patients not&#xD;
      receiving VTE prophylaxis were randomized to an intervention group in which their physicians&#xD;
      received an electronic alert or a control group in which physicians were not alerted.&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group experienced a 41% reduction in the incidence of&#xD;
      symptomatic VTE events within 90 days, without an increase in the risk of major or minor&#xD;
      bleeding. However, prophylactic measures were prescribed for only 33.5% of the patients in&#xD;
      the intervention group. For the remaining patients (66.5%), we were surprised that physicians&#xD;
      declined to implement the suggested intervention, initiation of VTE prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is still considerable scope for electronic methodology and technology to increase&#xD;
      prophylaxis rates and reduce the rates of VTE. Therefore, we will focus these new study&#xD;
      initiatives on improving our current methods and strategies to further reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of our proposed studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our projects will address several gaps in our understanding of the issues related to&#xD;
      implementation of VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized patients. We aim to identify subgroups in&#xD;
      the hospitalized population that are at especially high risk for VTE. An improved and novel&#xD;
      automated electronic alerting system will facilitate this identification. Our new alert&#xD;
      system will be much more rigorous than our prior protocol. The new alert will have three&#xD;
      sequential screens rather than the single alert screen that we had in the prior version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This computerized system will identify hospitalized patients at high risk for VTE and will&#xD;
      analyze their records to determine whether they have received thromboprophylaxis orders. If&#xD;
      the system identifies any high-risk patient who does not have orders for thromboprophylaxis,&#xD;
      then a series of prompts will be issued to the ordering physician. The physician whose&#xD;
      patient is at risk for VTE will be requested to institute prophylaxis. If the automated&#xD;
      request is not followed, a series of alerts will query reasons for withholding preventive&#xD;
      measures. Further prompts will lead to centralized computer-generated ordering of graduated&#xD;
      compression stockings, unless the physician opts out and unselects this order. Important&#xD;
      elements in the alerts include an up-to-date selection of pharmacological agents, doses based&#xD;
      on renal clearance, and the documentation of reasons for withholding prophylaxis by the&#xD;
      ordering physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will follow all high-risk patients whose physicians received an alert. We will determine&#xD;
      whether within 90 days, the patient has developed symptomatic DVT or PE. The Longitudinal&#xD;
      Medical Record will facilitate follow-up after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the use of this novel alert system, we will identify patients at high risk for VTE,&#xD;
      maximize the implementation of VTE prophylaxis, learn the rationale for physicians'&#xD;
      withholding anticoagulant or mechanical prophylaxis in some high-risk patients, and test&#xD;
      whether this novel electronic intervention reduces clinically important episodes of PE and&#xD;
      DVT. The success of this program will provide a useful model for dissemination of VTE&#xD;
      preventive strategies nationwide and worldwide.&#xD;
