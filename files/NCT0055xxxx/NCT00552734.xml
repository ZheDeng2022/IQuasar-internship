    <textblock>
      140 subjects will be enrolled into the clinical study and randomized into the Control Group&#xD;
      or the Experimental Group by block randomization. The subjects must meet all inclusion and&#xD;
      none of the exclusion criteria. Each subject will have 7 clinic visits and 3 phone visits.&#xD;
      The Baseline Visit will consist of a complete history, vitals, a physical examination and&#xD;
      completion of the consent and screening process. All clinic visits, except for the Baseline&#xD;
      Visit will include meter/PDA download. In addition, meter education will be provided to all&#xD;
      subjects, and PDA education will be provided to the Experimental group at the Baseline Visit&#xD;
      and 2-Week Visit as needed to ensure subject understanding. The phone visits will consist of&#xD;
      a history including any changes in insulin dose, and any hypoglycemic events, hyperglycemic&#xD;
      events, or other adverse events that have occurred since the last clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint in this study was to show a reduction in A1c of at least 0.4% or higher&#xD;
      in the insulin guidance software group at 6 months and/or 1 year.&#xD;

      Research Design and Methods A total of 123 adult subjects with type 1 diabetes with a&#xD;
      baseline A1c of 7.5-11% were enrolled in the study at the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood&#xD;
      Diabetes at the University of Colorado at Denver Health Sciences Center. Two patients screen&#xD;
      failed (entry criteria not met) before randomization, leaving 60 subjects randomized to the&#xD;
      control group and 61 subjects randomized to the experimental group (Advisor). Subjects were&#xD;
      randomized based on lottery system using sealed envelopes. All patients had baseline blood&#xD;
      work which included a complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), creatnine&#xD;
      kinase (CK) and an A1c. The mean A1c at baseline was 8.54 ±0.11 in the control group and 8.42&#xD;
      ±0.11 in the experimental group (p=0.4265).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomized on a 1:1 basis to either the experimental or control group. All&#xD;
      subjects in the experimental group received the same training for insulin guidance software&#xD;
      program for personal data assistant (PDA). All subjects were given a glucose meter and an&#xD;
      unlimited supply of test strips for self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Women who were&#xD;
      pregnant or planning to become pregnant were excluded from participation in the study as were&#xD;
      patients on insulin pumps, those taking glucocorticoid therapy, and those diagnosed with&#xD;
      cancer, liver disease, anemia or hepatitis. Patients who exercised more than five days a&#xD;
      week, or often traveled internationally were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB). All&#xD;
      subjects signed an informed consent form before being enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits All subjects were asked to attend 7 in clinic visits (baseline, 2 week, 6 week, 3&#xD;
      month, 6 month, 9 month and 12 month) and participate in 3 telephone visits (4.5month,&#xD;
      7.5month, 9.5 month) throughout the course of the study. Data for blood glucose values,&#xD;
      testing frequency, hyperglycemic excursions, hypoglycemic events (all, nocturnal, and&#xD;
      severe), insulin dose, weight and BMI, hospitalizations, emergency room visits and illnesses&#xD;
      were recorded at each in clinic visit. All subjects completed a patient satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire and the experimental group also completed an Advisor questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of their routine clinical care, any additional phone visits were equally encouraged&#xD;
      in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advisor Insulin Guidance Software (Figure 1a) Subjects randomized to the experimental group&#xD;
      received a PDA loaded with the insulin guidance software. At baseline (visit 1), a healthcare&#xD;
      provider and/or certified diabetes educator (CDE) reviewed the features of the software on&#xD;
      the PDA and loaded a subject specific insulin dosing algorithm into the software based on the&#xD;
      physician's recommendations. The software program allowed the healthcare provider to enter&#xD;
      demographic data such as age, height and weight which could potentially affect the insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity factor already programmed into the device. The program advised basal, bolus and&#xD;
      correction insulin dosages based on individual patients' prescriptions in addition to being&#xD;
      alerted for SMBG testing. Subjects in the experimental group were also asked to input their&#xD;
      blood glucose values into the PDA via the touch screen. Subjects then received a recommended&#xD;
      insulin dose based on their prescription which was programmed by the healthcare provider. The&#xD;
      patients were asked to either agree with the recommended insulin dose or disagree, and&#xD;
      manually enter the insulin dose they took for a given event. All the data from the glucose&#xD;
      meters and the PDAs were downloaded at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose Target Ranges Glucose values were captured in one of the following categories to&#xD;
      assess target glycemia and pie charts were created. Within Target Range (WTR) glucose values&#xD;
      were those between 70-150mg/dL (3.89 to 8.33 mmol/L) (20). Below Target Range (BTR) glucose&#xD;
      values were defined as ≤ 69mg/dL (3.83 mmol/L) and Above Target Range (ATR) glucose values&#xD;
      were those values above 150mg/dL (8.33 mmol/L). These glucose levels were chosen based on our&#xD;
      previous research on SMBG downloads (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia was defined as glucose values ≤ 59mg/dL (3.27mmol/L). Severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemia was defined as subjects needing assistance as previously described by DCCT&#xD;
      Research Group (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A1c and Other Lab Measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      The A1c values were measured by the DCA 2000® Analyzer, distributed by Bayer Corporation&#xD;
      (Elkhart, IN). The DCA 2000® A1c assay gives accurate and precise results over a range of&#xD;
      total hemoglobin from 7 to 24 g/dL. All subjects had hemoglobin concentrations well within&#xD;
      these values. Normal A1c values are 3.4 to 6.2 % (18). The CBC (Beckman Coulter LH750,&#xD;
      Beckman Coulter, Hialeah, FL), CMP (AU-5200 Olympus Japan Co Ltd, Tokyo) and CK (Olympus&#xD;
      AU-800; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) were performed by Quest Diagnostics, Denver, Colorado.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Chi Square tests of independence were used to&#xD;
      compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively, at baseline. Chi Square test of&#xD;
      independence was used to compare the number of discontinued subjects between the two groups.&#xD;
      Mixed model repeated measures analysis with an unstructured covariance structure and&#xD;
      pre-planned contrasts were used to compare the experimental and control groups on A1c,&#xD;
      percent of glucose readings within, above, and below target, percent of total hypoglycemic&#xD;
      events, basal insulin dose, weight, and BMI. Paired t-tests were used to test the within&#xD;
      group change in weight from baseline to 12 months among those who completed all 12 months.&#xD;
      Fisher's Exact test was used to compare the number of patients achieving target values&#xD;
      between groups at each time point. Poisson regression was used to compare the frequency of&#xD;
      severe hypoglycemic events between the two groups. Data are presented as least squares mean ±&#xD;
      SE unless otherwise noted. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1. Results were considered&#xD;
      significant at p &lt; 0.05 using a two-sided alpha.&#xD;
