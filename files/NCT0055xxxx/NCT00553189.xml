      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PARP is an enzyme that is involved in the repair of damage to DNA. Levels of the enzyme&#xD;
           are higher in tumor cells than in normal cells, and may play a part in resistance to&#xD;
           cancer chemotherapy and radiation therapy. ABT-888 is an experimental drug that inhibits&#xD;
           PARP and may help to increase the effectiveness of cancer treatments designed to damage&#xD;
           DNA in cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Topotecan is a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating certain&#xD;
           cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This dose escalation study will test the two drugs at successively higher doses in small&#xD;
           groups of patients until the highest safe dose is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the safety of the combination of ABT-888 and Topotecan (TPT) and determine the&#xD;
           highest dose of each drug that can be safely given to humans. This is the maximum&#xD;
           tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn how the combination of ABT-888 and TPT works in humans and how the body handles&#xD;
           the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the side effects of the combination of ABT-888 and TPT at the tested doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients with solid tumors, lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia whose disease has&#xD;
      progressed following standard therapy or for whom standard treatments are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABT-888 and TPT are given in 21-day treatment cycles. At the start of the study, TPT is&#xD;
           infused through a vein over 30 minutes about a week before cycle 1 starts. Starting on&#xD;
           day 1 of cycle 1, ABT-888 is given by mouth twice a day for 7 days. TPT is given through&#xD;
           a vein daily for 4 days starting on day 2. After the last dose of ABT-888 day 7, no more&#xD;
           treatment is given for the rest of the 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the remaining cycles, ABT-888 is given twice a day by mouth on days 1 to 7 of each&#xD;
           cycle, and TPT is given through a vein daily on days 1 to 5 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first three to six patients enrolled in the study take the smallest study dose of&#xD;
           the drugs. If they do not develop significant adverse side effects, successive small&#xD;
           groups of patients take the drug at increasingly higher doses until the MTD is reached.&#xD;
           Additional patients enrolled receive the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have periodic clinic visits for their TPT infusions and for tests and&#xD;
           examinations. Evaluations include measurement of vital signs, physical examinations,&#xD;
           blood and urine tests, electrocardiograms and CT or other imaging tests, such as&#xD;
           ultrasound or MRI. Tumor biopsies may be requested to study the effects of the drugs on&#xD;
           the...&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PARP family of enzymes is characterized by the ability to poly (ADP-ribosyl)ate&#xD;
           protein substrates. PARP-1 and PARP-2 play a critical role in the maintenance of genomic&#xD;
           stability by regulating a variety of DNA repair mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poly (ADP-ribosylated) PARP-1 has been shown to block the formation of topo 1-DNA&#xD;
           cleavage and accelerate the removal of camptothecin-stabilized topo 1-DNA complexes.&#xD;
           PARP-1 inhibition may therefore prevent efficient repair of DNA damage induced by&#xD;
           topoisomerase 1 inhibitors. ABT-888 is an oral PARP inhibitor and topotecan is a&#xD;
           topoisomerase I inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the safety and tolerability of the combination of ABT-888 with topotecan&#xD;
           hydrochloride in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of ABT-888 with topotecan&#xD;
           hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of each agent alone and in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effects of the study treatment on the level of PARP inhibition and DNA&#xD;
           damage in PBMCs and tumor samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically documented solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies (lymphoma&#xD;
           and CLL) whose disease has progressed following standard therapy or who have no&#xD;
           acceptable standard treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No major surgery, radiation or chemotherapy within four weeks prior to study enrollment,&#xD;
           and recovered from toxicities of prior therapies to at least eligibility levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 1, dose levels -1 to 7 and 1B: Topotecan (TPT) will be administered intravenously&#xD;
           over 30 minutes as a single dose on days 1-5. Starting on day 2, ABT-888 will be&#xD;
           administered orally twice a day on a q12 hour schedule for 4 days (D2-5). Following the&#xD;
           completion of study drug administration on day 5, no further treatment will be&#xD;
           administered for the rest of this 21-day cycle. Growth factors will be administered&#xD;
           prophylactically starting Cycle 1 to patients on dose level 1B only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 2 and beyond, dose levels -1 to 7 and 1B: ABT-888 will be administered twice a day&#xD;
           on a q12 hour schedule orally on days 1-5. TPT will be given IV daily from days 1-5, in&#xD;
           a 21-day cycle. Growth factors will be administered prophylactically to patients on dose&#xD;
           level 1B only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All cycles, dose levels -2 and 1A to 5A: ABT-888 will be administered on day 1 only for&#xD;
           dose levels -2 and 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A. For dose level 5A, ABT-888 will be administered&#xD;
           on days 1 and 2 of each cycle. TPT will be given IV daily from days 1-5, in a 21-day&#xD;
           cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation will proceed as outlined below. Once maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is&#xD;
           established, 6 additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD to further define the&#xD;
           dose and evaluate PD studies at this dose level.&#xD;

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with histologically documented solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies&#xD;
             (lymphoma and CLL) who are refractory to standard therapy or who have no acceptable&#xD;
             standard treatment options. Patients with lymphoid malignancies will be eligible if&#xD;
             their disease has progressed following standard therapy and if stem cell&#xD;
             transplantation is not indicated or has been refused.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any prior therapy must have been completed greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment on protocol and the participant must have recovered to eligibility levels&#xD;
             (CTCAE Grade less than or equal to 1) from prior toxicity. Prior radiation or surgery&#xD;
             should have been completed greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to study enrollment&#xD;
             and all associated toxicities resolved to eligibility levels. Patients must be greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a&#xD;
             Phase 0 study, and should have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of ABT-888 in patients less than 18 years of age,&#xD;
             children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future pediatric Phase&#xD;
             I combination trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60&#xD;
             percent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;

&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine&#xD;
             levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The effects of ABT-888 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because topotecan hydrochloride used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation, and for 30 days after completion of study. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
             Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any investigational agent&#xD;
             administered as part of a Phase 0 study, and should have recovered to eligibility&#xD;
             levels from any toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who have been administered ABT-888 as part of a single or limited dosing&#xD;
             study, such as a Phase 0 study, should not be excluded from participating in this&#xD;
             study solely because of receiving prior ABT-888.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who have received prior TPT should not be excluded solely because of&#xD;
             receiving prior TPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, prolonged QTc interval (greater than msec), or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
