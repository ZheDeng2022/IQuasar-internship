      The objective of this study is to evaluate the topical E-DO in patients with Chronic Hand&#xD;
      Dermatitis (fu kuei shou).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hand dermatitis, also called fu kuei shou, is a skin condition in which the hands develop a&#xD;
      rash and become red, dry, cracked, and inflamed. This is a very common occuring in about 10%&#xD;
      of women and 4% of men. The condition can eventually cause pain on contact with even simple&#xD;
      solutions such as water. Hand dermatitis is particularly common in industries involving&#xD;
      cleaning, catering, metalwork, hairdressing, healthcare and mechanical work, and is often&#xD;
      difficult to be treated effectively. Some patients develop varying levels of disability due&#xD;
      to lack of acceptable effective treatments and may be forced to change occupations in order&#xD;
      to achieve relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary treatment for hand dermatitis is typically topical corticosteroids, especially when&#xD;
      the offending agent(s) cannot be identified or avoided. However, patients may eventually&#xD;
      develop tachyphylaxis to the anti-inflammatory activity of mid-potency or high-potency&#xD;
      topical corticosteroids and patients with severe, chronic involvement may often be less&#xD;
      likely to respond. Potential topical alternatives to corticosteroids include psoralen plus&#xD;
      ultraviolet (PUVA), but the phototherapies are inconvenient because multiple clinical visits&#xD;
      are required and hand phototherapy units may not be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moisturizers have been found to help restore the skin barrier providing a protective layer on&#xD;
      surface of the skin to trap water and prevent the penetration of irritants and allergens. An&#xD;
      emollient cream is superior in trapping the moisture within the skin. Emollients may form a&#xD;
      covering film, which acts as a barrier for chemicals from the exterior and which restricts&#xD;
      the loss of water and other essential substances from the interior. E-DO gel is a potential&#xD;
      agent for revitalizing our skin cells so that regain their moisture retention capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-DO has known significant improvements in wound healing and the inhibition of Staphylococcus&#xD;
      aureus and Propionibacterium acnes. This pilot research trial will investigate the effect of&#xD;
      topical E-DO for patients with hand dermatitis.&#xD;
