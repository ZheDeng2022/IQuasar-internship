  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare 2 different methods for checking lymph&#xD;
      glands (in the middle of the chest) for cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective study is to determine the staging accuracy of endobronchial&#xD;
      ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes compared to the&#xD;
      'gold standard', mediastinoscopy, in patients with clinical Stage IIIA non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive&#xD;
      value, and accuracy of EBUS-FNA and mediastinoscopy in identifying mediastinal nodal&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate quantitative and qualitative differences regarding sampling of mediastinal nodes&#xD;
      (number and location of nodes biopsied, number and location of positive nodes, extracapsular&#xD;
      extension, ability to biopsy contralateral nodes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the frequency of change of planned therapeutic management resulting from outcome&#xD;
      of EBUS-FNA and mediastinoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine procedure related complications. To perform analysis of cost between EBUS-FNA&#xD;
      and mediastinoscopy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current procedure used to check for cancer cells in the lungs is a small operation at the&#xD;
      base of the neck (mediastinoscopy) to get samples of the lymph glands. These samples are then&#xD;
      looked at under the microscope to see if they contain cancer cells. A procedure has been&#xD;
      developed that may allow doctors to get samples of lymph glands without having to perform an&#xD;
      operation. This is called endobronchial ultrasound or &quot;EBUS&quot;. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the 2 procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, your insurance provider will be contacted. In order&#xD;
      for you to take part in this study, your insurance provider must agree to pay for both the&#xD;
      EBUS and mediastinoscopy procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your insurance provider agrees to pay for both procedures, you will be scheduled for the&#xD;
      EBUS and a mediastinoscopy. The procedures will not be scheduled on the same day. You will&#xD;
      first have the EBUS. You will receive general anesthesia and a small flexible scope will be&#xD;
      passed down your windpipe. Samples of your lymph gland tissue will then be collected through&#xD;
      a tiny needle that is passed through the scope. This will be performed as an out patient&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a tumor is found on the opposite side of your chest from another tumor by the EBUS, a&#xD;
      mediastinoscopy will not be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a tumor is not found on the opposite side of your chest from another tumor by the EBUS,&#xD;
      you will then have a mediastinoscopy. This is also an outpatient procedure that will involve&#xD;
      a small (2 cm) cut at the base of the neck, just above the breast bone. Your doctor will then&#xD;
      pass a special scope with a camera into your chest (below the breast bone). This will allow&#xD;
      your doctor to see the lymph glands around your windpipe and get samples of them. This will&#xD;
      also be performed under general anesthesia and you will be able to leave the hospital shortly&#xD;
      after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on whether or not the lymph glands have cancer in them, your doctor will then&#xD;
      recommend the best therapy for the tumor to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The EBUS is FDA approved. The mediastinoscopy is considered&#xD;
      standard of care. The comparison of the 2 procedures is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 patients will be take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
