      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy before a peripheral stem cell transplant stops the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. Giving colony-stimulating&#xD;
      factors, such as G-CSF, and certain chemotherapy drugs, helps stem cells move from the bone&#xD;
      marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. More chemotherapy is then given to&#xD;
      prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the&#xD;
      patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of topotecan when&#xD;
      given together with cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, melphalan, and cisplatin, followed by an&#xD;
      autologous peripheral stem cell transplant in treating patients with stage III, stage IV, or&#xD;
      recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous infusion intravenous&#xD;
           topotecan hydrochloride when administered with intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin and&#xD;
           intravenous melphalan in patients with stage III, stage IV, or recurrent ovarian&#xD;
           epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the toxicities of each dose studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of topotecan hydrochloride when administered at the&#xD;
           maximum tolerated dose and cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm the pharmacokinetic advantage of high-dose IP cisplatin and IP paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain tissue at the time of peritoneal catheter placement in order to evaluate the&#xD;
           molecular determinants of apoptosis (including p53 status, p21 gene expression, bcl-2&#xD;
           gene expression, and bcl-2/bax ratio) and the extent of apoptosis by the TdT assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the molecular determinants of DNA damage and repair, including expression&#xD;
           levels of ERCC1 and MDR1, and HER2/neu expression by immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of topotecan hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo surgical placement of an intraperitoneal (IP) catheter. Tumor biopsies are&#xD;
      obtained during surgery for laboratory analysis of molecular determinants of apoptosis&#xD;
      (including p53 status, p21 gene expression, bcl-2 gene expression, bcl-2/bax ratio) and&#xD;
      molecular determinants of DNA damage and repair (including expression levels of ERCC1 and&#xD;
      MDR1, and HER2/neu expression by immunohistochemistry). The extent of apoptosis is also&#xD;
      assessed using the TdT assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Course 1: Patients receive paclitaxel IP on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV on day 2, and&#xD;
           filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 3 and continuing until apheresis&#xD;
           is completed. Patients undergo apheresis until ≥ 2.5 X 10^6 CD34-positive cells/kg are&#xD;
           collected. Two weeks later, patients proceed to course 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Course 2: Patients receive cisplatin IP and melphalan IV on days -11 and -4 and&#xD;
           topotecan hydrochloride by continuous infusion over 120 hours on days -10 to -6.&#xD;
           Patients receive 25% of their peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) on day -3 and G-CSF IV&#xD;
           beginning on day -3 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients receive their&#xD;
           remaining PBSCs on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo daily blood sample collection during topotecan hydrochloride administration&#xD;
      for pharmacokinetic studies. Patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride undergo additional blood sample collections for pharmacokinetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
