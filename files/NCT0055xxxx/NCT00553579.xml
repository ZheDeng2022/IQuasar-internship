      The benefits of artificial tears to relieve dry eye symptoms include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
      stabilizing the tear film layer, fluid supplement action, improving visual acuity, and&#xD;
      comfort. Studies have found a relationship between some of these benefits. For example,&#xD;
      stabilization of the tear film is important not only to increase the tear break up time&#xD;
      (TBUT), but is key in improving and maintaining visual acuity. These studies have alluded to&#xD;
      the fact that there may or may not be a relationship between residence time and visual&#xD;
      performance. Viscosity is one reason behind the uncertainty. Some solutions contain polymers&#xD;
      which influence the ocular surface when contacted. This can impact residence time and&#xD;
      ultimately visual performance. No prior research has explored the direct relationship between&#xD;
      residence time and visual performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residence time refers to the duration at which the artificial tear resides on the eye.&#xD;
      Methods have been developed to assess residence time by admixing fluorescent tracers to the&#xD;
      solution and then measuring the amount of fluorescence over time. The caveat to methods using&#xD;
      certain tracers has lead to uncertainty in elimination measurements due to corneal&#xD;
      penetration or differing molecular weights (MW) from the active vehicle ingredient in the&#xD;
      solution. For example, low-MW tracers can be eliminated at a different rate than higher-MW&#xD;
      polymers. In addition, the low-MW tracers may be able to penetrate the corneal epithelium&#xD;
      giving a false pre-corneal residence time. Meadows, Paugh, Joshi, and Mordaunt addressed this&#xD;
      issue by developing a technique using a polymer which did not penetrate the cornea and had&#xD;
      the same MW as the active ingredient in the solution FITC-dextran. Based on the assumption&#xD;
      that similar weights are eliminated at the same rate, this technique has shown to be more&#xD;
      economic, manageable, and amendable than previous procedures measuring residence time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any ophthalmic drop has the potential to impact visual acuity upon instillation due to the&#xD;
      effect it has on the tear layer components. Studies have observed that taking artificial&#xD;
      tears continuously over time tends to stabilize the tear layer thus minimizing the immediate&#xD;
      drop in contrast sensitivity upon instillation. Measuring the visual effect of artificial&#xD;
      tears, using contrast sensitivity as a measure, provides valuable information about the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of artificial tears that are meant to stabilize the tear film, thus&#xD;
      improving visual acuity in dry eye patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But what about the patient? There is a difference between residence time and retention of&#xD;
      effect- which is often what matters the most for patients. Retention of effect refers to the&#xD;
      beneficial effect of the drop. Currently there is no real measure of retention of effect.&#xD;
      Doctors can assess the tear film objectively, but there have been no strong correlations&#xD;
      between subjective dry symptoms and tear film stability. A possible reason for the lack of&#xD;
      correlation may be due to the fact that subjectivity is difficult to quantify. However,&#xD;
      scales like the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) have been&#xD;
      established in an attempt to quantify subjective experiences such as visual quality. We will&#xD;
      be using the NRS to gauge the comfort of the drop upon the initial application to get a&#xD;
      general idea of the comfort the drop provides to the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there have been several studies done on residence time and visual effect of&#xD;
      ophthalmic formulations separately, there is no current research correlating these two&#xD;
      aspects of therapeutic efficacy. This study will be the first to concurrently investigate&#xD;
      residence time (using FITC-dextran) and visual effect of an ophthalmic formulation.&#xD;

        The subjects for this investigation will be sourced from an existing, secure dry eye&#xD;
        subject database. These subjects will have been screened for dry eye using a consistent&#xD;
        protocol (Diagnostic monograph, J. Paugh, January 2007). Subjects who have taken part in a&#xD;
        prior study undergoing this same eligibility visit protocol within the past 18 months will&#xD;
        not be required to repeat the visit.&#xD;
