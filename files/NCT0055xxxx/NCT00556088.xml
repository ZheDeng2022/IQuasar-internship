    <textblock>
      This phase I protocol will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of LBH589&#xD;
      and paclitaxel/carboplatin. The combination of LBH589, paclitaxel/carboplatin, and&#xD;
      bevacizumab will also be evaluated for tolerability and preliminary antitumor activity in a&#xD;
      subset of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Part I Phase I dose escalation trial. LBH589 will be administered orally on Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday each week (twice weekly). Paclitaxel and carboplatin will be administered intravenously every 21 days.&#xD;
Part II LBH589, paclitaxel, and carboplatin dosing will be determined in the first phase of this study (Phase I). The drug dosages to be administered will be reduced one level from the determined Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). In addition, bevacizumab 15 mg/kg will be added to the second portion of this trial.</description>
