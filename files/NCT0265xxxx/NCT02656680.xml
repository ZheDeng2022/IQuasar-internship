  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a pilot randomized trial of 160 obese participants, investigators will test the&#xD;
      feasibility of a behavioral weight loss program delivered entirely via Facebook. We will&#xD;
      recruit in 2 separate waves of 80 participants each. Participants will be randomized to: 1) a&#xD;
      condition with study participants only or 2) to a condition they will be able to invite their&#xD;
      friends into (wave 1) or one in which the study team keeps recruitment open to allow&#xD;
      enrollment through week 8 (wave 2). All participants will receive behavioral counseling via&#xD;
      the private Facebook group from the coaches who are present on the network daily.&#xD;
      Participants will track their diet and exercise via a free commercial mobile app.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the research plan is to test ways to leverage mobile technologies and&#xD;
      social media to increase the impact, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and dissemination&#xD;
      potential of lifestyle interventions that reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Mobile&#xD;
      technology and social media have the potential to reduce the intensity of traditional&#xD;
      prevention interventions and enhance outcome by delivering behavioral strategies&#xD;
      in-the-moment and by connecting patients other patients to generate better communication and&#xD;
      a social support system for lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes a behavioral weight loss program delivered entirely via on online social&#xD;
      network. The weight loss intervention is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an&#xD;
      evidence-based weight loss program focused on lifestyle changes. The goals for the&#xD;
      intervention are 175 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and an overall weight&#xD;
      loss of 7%. Each participant will get an individualized calorie goal that would facilitate a&#xD;
      1-2 lbs. weight loss weekly. Participants will be connected to one another via Facebook and&#xD;
      receive behavioral counseling via posts from coaches who are present on the network daily.&#xD;
      Participants will track their diet and exercise via a free commercial mobile app.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to either a Facebook group allowing the invite of friends (wave&#xD;
      1), a Facebook group with open enrollment through week 8 (wave 2) or a Facebook group&#xD;
      including only study participants. If they are assigned to the group including their friends,&#xD;
      they have the opportunity to invite their friends to participate in the weight loss group if&#xD;
      they are interested in losing weight as well. They will not have a limit as to how many&#xD;
      friends they can invite. The friends that are invited will not undergo the same procedures as&#xD;
      the FB+friends study participants, but we will provide them with a factsheet and collect&#xD;
      minimal information from them. If they are assigned to the group with open enrollment through&#xD;
      week 8, additional people will be recruited into that group. Those participants being&#xD;
      enrolled between week 1-8 will undergo the same procedures as others besides randomization.&#xD;
      The goal of both of these studies is to explore how to build the size of online weight loss&#xD;
      groups in such a way that increases participant engagement. Feasibility outcomes include&#xD;
      engagement (frequency of posts, likes, and comments and number of completed days of tracking&#xD;
      posted) retention, acceptability, and weight loss. Post intervention focus groups will gather&#xD;
      feedback on the program.&#xD;

      <pre_assignment_details>At the start of the 16-week trial, we randomized participants (n=80) to two groups: 'FB+Friends' (n=40) or 'FB Only' (n=40). For the first 8 weeks of the trial, we continued to add new participants (n=54) into the 'FB+Friends' group. Our total enrollment (n=134) includes these 54 post-randomized participants.

          <description>FB+Friends is a Facebook-delivered weight loss intervention. The study team will keep recruitment open for this condition to allow enrollment through week 8.&#xD;
Participants will receive a weight loss intervention delivered in an online context. The online coaches will post daily content, respond to questions, address concerns, and encourage engagement. The weight loss intervention is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based weight loss program focused on lifestyle changes. The goals for the intervention are 175 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and an overall weight loss of 7%. Each participant will get an individualized calorie goal that would facilitate a 1-2 lbs. weight loss weekly. Participants will also be encouraged to use an app such as MyFitnessPal to track daily diet. For this arm, the study team will keep recruitment open for this condition to allow enrollment of new participants through week 8.</description>
