  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to identify subgroups of patients with type 2 diabetes that&#xD;
      respond well or poorly to particular drugs based on particular clinical characteristics such&#xD;
      as their weight or kidney function, to enable better targeting of treatment for a particular&#xD;
      individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test 2 hypotheses of drug response supported by routine clinical and trial&#xD;
      data. 600 patients with type 2 diabetes who have suboptimal glycaemic control on dual oral&#xD;
      therapy will be recruited to a randomised double-blind crossover study of a DPP4 inhibitor,&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitor and thiazolidinedione. Each patient will take each study drug in addition to&#xD;
      their existing treatment for four months at a time. At the end of each treatment the&#xD;
      patient's glucose control will be measured and information about their experience of the drug&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase 4 randomised double-blind crossover study of a DPP4 inhibitor, SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitor and thiazolidinedione as third line therapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes who&#xD;
      have suboptimal glycaemic control on dual therapy with metformin and a sulphonylurea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      600 patients aged 30-80 who have been on stable doses of 2 classes of therapy (not including&#xD;
      the trial IMPs or GLP1-agonist) for at least 3 months with HbA1c &gt;58mmol/mol (7.5%) will&#xD;
      receive three double-blinded third-line non-injectable therapies. On recruitment into the&#xD;
      study participants will have underlying pathophysiology assessed in a mixed-meal tolerance&#xD;
      test (MMTT) and samples will be collected for baseline analysis and storage for future&#xD;
      biomarker analysis and discovery. Participants will then receive 16 weeks of each&#xD;
      over-encapsulated blinded therapy in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each treatment period, fasting blood will be taken to measure glycaemic&#xD;
      response (HbA1c), fasting glucose and insulin concentrations trough drug levels and to&#xD;
      confirm continued eligibility. Weight, blood pressure and. data about patient experience will&#xD;
      also be collected including perceived side effects, preparedness to remain on therapy,&#xD;
      psychological health and health related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, patient treatment preference will be recorded after feeding back to&#xD;
      the patient for each of the 3 therapies their HbA1c, weight change, frequency of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemias, any patient reported side effects and the patient's verdict on each therapy&#xD;
      will be recorded. Each participant will be asked which treatments they would take long term&#xD;
      and the reason for their preference.&#xD;

    <description>Outcome measure will test hypothesis that patients with insulin resistance, characterised clinically by a raised BMI (&gt;30 kg/m2), compared to non-obese patients, will:&#xD;
Respond well to pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione that works as an insulin sensitiser.&#xD;
Respond less well to sitagliptin, a DPP4i, which works through stimulating endogenous insulin secretion post-prandially.</description>

    <description>Outcome measure will test hypothesis that patients with modestly reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR 60-90 mls/min/1.73m2), compared to those with eGFR &gt;90 mls/min/1.73m2, will:&#xD;
Respond poorly to canagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, which works through inhibiting the active reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule, as the reduced eGFR will reduce the glucose-lowering efficacy.&#xD;
Respond well to sitagliptin, a DPP4i that is renally cleared, as the reduced eGFR will increase plasma DPP4i concentrations.</description>
