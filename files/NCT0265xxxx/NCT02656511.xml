  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and provide immediate antiretroviral therapy to a&#xD;
      cohort of HIV-infected individuals with very early HIV infection (estimated date of infection&#xD;
      within the last 90 days). The primary aim of the study is to evaluate whether initiation of&#xD;
      dolutegravir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir during acute/early HIV infection leads to&#xD;
      protection of CD4+ T cells and other immune cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue&#xD;
      from infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although ART decreases HIV-associated mortality, it does not appear to completely restore&#xD;
      immune health, for reasons that remain unclear. In addition, while HIV prevention approaches&#xD;
      have led to significant successes in decreasing the incidence of new HIV infection over the&#xD;
      past few years, the epidemic continues to grow both locally and globally. While complete&#xD;
      eradication may not currently be feasible, a &quot;functional cure&quot; in which patients are able to&#xD;
      indefinitely maintain undetectable viral loads in the absence of therapy may be an attainable&#xD;
      immediate goal. Studying patients with early HIV infection and immediate ART will provide a&#xD;
      unique opportunity to investigate the pathophysiology of the earliest stages of HIV infection&#xD;
      and may help identify the virologic/immunologic predictors of a functional cure.&#xD;
