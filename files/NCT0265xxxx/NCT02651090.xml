      Patients with renal failure or other reason for contraindication for contrast enhanced&#xD;
      computed tomography (CECT) or contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) with&#xD;
      suspected liver pathology will be evaluated with Sonazoid enhanced Ultrasound&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with a diagnosis of cancer or high probability of cancer (any primary) who have&#xD;
      contraindications for a contrast enhanced Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Image&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in this study. Patients will be both male and female and be &gt;18&#xD;
      years old. Contraindications for computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      would include, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Creatinine clearance of &lt;60 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Allergy to iodinated contrast or gadolinium based contrast agents&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. History of adverse event with CT or MRI contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 patients will be enrolled over a two year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical justification for sample size Assuming that a non-enhanced CT will detect and&#xD;
      characterize metastatic disease correctly 60% of the time (2) and that Contrast enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound (CEUS) will detect and characterize metastatic disease correctly 90% of the time&#xD;
      (3,4), there will be a 100% chance of a significant difference at a one-sided 0.05&#xD;
      significance level using the Fisher Exact Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT and MRI Patient will receive the non-contrast CT or MRI that would be ordered as routine&#xD;
      stating or follow-up of the patient. At a minimum 5mm contiguous axial slices will be&#xD;
      obtained with CT and T1-weighted, T2-weighted, in-phase and out of phase imaging will be&#xD;
      performed on MRI with a minimum slice thickness of 5mm. Each lesion noted within the liver&#xD;
      will be measured in two dimensions and recorded. The lesion will be classified on a scale of&#xD;
      1 - 5 regarding the probability of benignity or malignancy of the lesion. If a diagnosis can&#xD;
      be made the diagnosis will be documented The location of the lesion will be documented on a&#xD;
      Couinaud diagram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CEUS-Contrast specific software optimized for Sonazoid will be used or both vascular and&#xD;
      Kupffer phase imaging. The focus will be set below the lesion of interest for vascular phase&#xD;
      imaging and at 4-8 cm for the left lobe and 8-10 cm for the right lobe for Kupffer phase&#xD;
      imaging. The lesion of interest was imaged from 15 seconds before injection to 1 minute after&#xD;
      injection (vascular phase imaging). No further scanning will be performed until the Kupffer&#xD;
      phase imaging, which will begun 10 minutes after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive the following ultrasound imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard B-mode and color-Doppler imaging. Elastography may be added at PI's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 20g IV will be placed in an antecubital vein&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Low MI scan will be used in the vascular phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. An intermediate MI scan will be used after at least a 10 minute delay to perform the&#xD;
           Kupffer scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If a lesion is identified on the Kupffer scan which is not characterized by the without&#xD;
           exam the patient will have a complete evaluation of the vascular phase a second&#xD;
           injection may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each lesion noted within the liver will be measured in two dimensions and recorded. The&#xD;
      lesion will be classified on a scale of 1 - 5 regarding the probability of benignity or&#xD;
      malignancy of the lesion. If a diagnosis can be made the diagnosis will be documented. The&#xD;
      location of the lesion will be documented on a Couinaud Diagram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard will be either&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. characteristic enhancement pattern (hemangioma, benign)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. lesion biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. growth of the lesion over a 6 month period of time (malignant)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of characterization efficacy the McNemar test will be used to compare the&#xD;
      rates of correct diagnosis for lesions on unenhanced ultrasound, CEUS and unenhanced CT or&#xD;
      MRI. For assessment of detection efficacy, Wilcoxon's signed rank test will be used to&#xD;
      compare the lesion detection rates obtained with unenhanced ultrasound, CEUS, and unenhanced&#xD;
      CT or MRI. For all tests, p&lt;0.05 will be considered a statistically significant difference.&#xD;
