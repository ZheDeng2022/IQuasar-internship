  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive two weeks of treatment (prefrontal high-frequency and bilateral&#xD;
      low-frequency rTMS vs. prefrontal high-frequency and bilateral high-frequency rTMS). After&#xD;
      two weeks of treatment they can decide if they want to quit the treatment or if they want to&#xD;
      proceed with the treatment for another two weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the phantom auditory perception of sound in the absence of an external or&#xD;
      internal acoustic stimulus. It is a frequent problem which can interfere significantly with&#xD;
      the ability to lead a normal life. Tinnitus has been shown to be generated in the brain, as a&#xD;
      result of functional reorganization of auditory and non-auditory neural pathways.&#xD;
      Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the&#xD;
      temporoparietal areas has been investigated for the treatment of tinnitus based on the&#xD;
      rationale to reduce increased activity of the auditory system. Furthermore, high-frequency&#xD;
      stimulation of the left frontal cortex was added to this standard treatment based on rTMS&#xD;
      studies in affective disorders and the association of tinnitus distress with depressivity.&#xD;
      Thus, high-frequency stimulation of the left prefrontal cortex and low-frequency stimulation&#xD;
      of bilateral temporoparietal cortex was introduced as new treatment scheme in chronic&#xD;
      tinnitus (multisite standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there is also evidence that high-frequency stimulation of the temporoparietal&#xD;
      cortex is effective in chronic tinnitus. Furthermore, standard treatment in chronic tinnitus&#xD;
      is two weeks (ten treatment days) which is shorter than the standard in rTMS in affective&#xD;
      disorders. Thus, the aim of the present trial is to investigate the influence of&#xD;
      high-frequency stimulation of the temporoparietal cortex and of increasing the number of&#xD;
      treatment days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive two weeks of treatment (prefrontal high-frequency and bilateral&#xD;
      low-frequency rTMS vs. prefrontal high-frequency and bilateral high-frequency rTMS). After&#xD;
      two weeks of treatment they can decide if they want to quit the treatment or if they want to&#xD;
      proceed with the treatment for another two weeks.&#xD;
