  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the in vivo kinematics and range of motion of a&#xD;
      single-surgeon clinical series of TKA performed with a fixed-bearing cruciate retaining total&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty that has a roll-back mechanism and compare it with the kinematic of the&#xD;
      normal healthy knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be evaluated by fluoroscopic examination during weight bearing activities&#xD;
      (lounging, kneeling and stairs climbing).&#xD;

             received a Physica KR implant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients achieving a ROM ≥ 100° at 6 week follow-up in the Physica KR clinical trial&#xD;
             (K-06 Study protocol 30/10/2013 v 1.0);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients affected by primary or secondary OA before surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with an appropriate intial fixation and stability of the knee prosthesis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with undamaged and functional collateral and posterior cruciate ligaments (no&#xD;
             ligamentous imbalance or pain);&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who understand the requirements of the study and are willing and able to&#xD;
             comply with activities required for fluoroscopic examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have signed the Ethics Committee approved study-specific Informed Consent&#xD;
             Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with a ROM &lt; 100° at 6-week follow-up in Physica KR clinical trial (K-06-&#xD;
             Study protocol 30/10/2013 v 1.0);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with malalignment or axial malrotation of the knee prosthesis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who had or have planned a surgery on their uninvolved knee within a year;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Muscular insufficiency or absence of muscoligamentous supporting structures required&#xD;
             for adequate soft tissue balance;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease&#xD;
             that may adversely affect gait and compromise functional recovery and evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability&#xD;
             to assess the performance of the device;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any psychiatric illness that would prevent comprehension of the details and nature of&#xD;
             the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participation in any experimental drug/device study within the 6 months prior to the&#xD;
