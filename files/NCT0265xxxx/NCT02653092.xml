  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity plays an adverse role at every stage of conception and pregnancy and mounting&#xD;
      evidence implicates relative hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and reduced menstrual cycle&#xD;
      hormone secretion as likely contributors to the subfertility phenotype and possible&#xD;
      contributors to complications of pregnancy and the developmental origin of adult diseases&#xD;
      such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This study will be the first comprehensive&#xD;
      investigation to tie together the patterns of hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia and&#xD;
      inflammation, characteristic of obesity and obesity-caused relative hypogonadotropic&#xD;
      hypogonadotropism and its potential adverse reproductive outcomes. The investigators findings&#xD;
      will be used to inform a subsequent clinical intervention to optimize reproductive outcomes&#xD;
      for obese women and their offspring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before any of the well-known adverse effects in pregnancy2,3, obesity causes a relatively&#xD;
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadal phenotype. Reduced LH, FSH, estradiol (E2) and progesterone&#xD;
      secretion are well documented during the menstrual cycles of obese women compared to normal&#xD;
      weight women (NWW).4,5. Decreased gonadotropin secretion associated with obesity is related&#xD;
      to reduced pituitary sensitivity to GnRH6. This reduction in pituitary sensitivity suggests&#xD;
      mediation by circulating factors such as cytokines, insulin, or other pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      signals known to be elevated in obesity. We have recently discovered that the combination of&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia and circulating free fatty acids (FFAs), but neither agent alone, can&#xD;
      acutely decrease gonadotropin secretion in NWW as well as men, establishing a direct causal&#xD;
      linkage for the central hypothesis of this proposal: that chronic pituitary suppression&#xD;
      partially mediates obesity related subfertility. Our working model is that the combination of&#xD;
      excess, possibly pro-inflammatory (omega-6) circulating FFAs and insulin resistance&#xD;
      associated with obesity, cause decreased pituitary sensitivity to GnRH, with a resulting&#xD;
      relative sex steroid deficit that further exacerbates the obese phenotype. We have named this&#xD;
      phenotype the reprometabolic syndrome. We propose to examine the interrelationships among&#xD;
      obesity, reproductive dysfunction and metabolic dysfunction in a mechanistic fashion. We will&#xD;
      induce the hypogonadotropic hypogonadal phenotype of obesity in NWW, who will be primed with&#xD;
      a high-fat diet (HFD) designed to increase circulating FFAs and produce short-term insulin&#xD;
      resistance and higher insulin levels.1,7-11 Before and after priming, we will test the&#xD;
      additive effects of lipid excess, insulin, and inflammation on the reproductive and metabolic&#xD;
      axes.&#xD;

          -  No use of reproductive hormones within 3 months of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone levels at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of regular menstrual cycles every 25-35 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of a reliable method of contraception (female or male partner sterilization; intra&#xD;
             uterine device (IUD); abstinence; diaphragm)&#xD;

          -  Normal hemoglobin A1c&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening hemoglobin &gt;11gm/dl&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with a baseline dietary assessment indicative of &gt;35% daily calorie consumption&#xD;
             from fat (as calculated based upon initial screening survey) will be excluded, as the&#xD;
             impact of increasing their dietary fat intake may be minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with fasting triglycerides &gt;300mg/dl at screening will be excluded, as they&#xD;
             might be at risk for acute elevation of triglycerides and even pancreatitis if placed&#xD;
             on a high fat diet&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with the protocol. Individuals who travel frequently, or who eat&#xD;
             most of their meals outside of their home will be excluded, as it will be difficult to&#xD;
             impossible for them to comply with the diet, to pick up the food cartons, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because high proportions of dairy fat will be needed to attain 48% calories from fat&#xD;
             in the diet, vegans and lactose intolerant individuals will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant will be excluded.&#xD;
