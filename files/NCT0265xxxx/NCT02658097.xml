    <textblock>
      This study looks at patients with advanced lung cancer. Participants in this study will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups. The first group will have radiation plus a drug (pembrolizumab).&#xD;
      The second group will have only the drug (pembrolizumab). Tumors of participants will be&#xD;
      measured to see if the addition of radiation changes the growth of the tumor compared to the&#xD;
      drug alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 randomized two arm phase II trial of pembrolizumab alone or sequentially&#xD;
      following focal radiation to one of the target lesions, in previously treated patients with&#xD;
      stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The primary goal of this trial is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of focal radiation (RT) to an index lesion as a way of enhancing the anti-tumor&#xD;
      immune response to pembrolizumab to that of pembrolizumab alone. The primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint is overall RECIST-defined response outside the radiation field. To accomplish this&#xD;
      goal 66 patients will be randomized 2:1 (stratified by histology (squamous versus&#xD;
      non-squamous) and refractory versus non-refractory disease) to radiation plus pembrolizumab&#xD;
      or pembrolizumab only, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine the tumor responses outside the radiation field (abscopal&#xD;
      effect) after radiation followed by pembrolizumab in metastatic NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the progression-free and overall survival in patients with NSCLC receiving&#xD;
           pembrolizumab, who receive Single Fraction Radiation Therapy (SFRT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of SFRT and pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine potential predictive biomarkers in tumor samples and peripheral blood in&#xD;
           patients treated with pembrolizumab and SFRT&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the local control of SFRT in the radiated lesion, when SFRT is given with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the induction of a T-cell response in patients with metastatic NSCLC treated&#xD;
           with radiation and the effect of radiation&#xD;
