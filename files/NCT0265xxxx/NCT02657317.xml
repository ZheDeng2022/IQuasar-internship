  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of an interdisciplinary pain management program for U.S. military&#xD;
      veterans who served during the post-9/11 combat eras (e.g., Operations Iraqi Freedom [OIF],&#xD;
      Enduring Freedom [OEF], New Dawn [OND]) presenting with chronic musculoskeletal pain related&#xD;
      to military service with comorbid depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]&#xD;
      symptoms and/or mild traumatic brain injury. This study will test the efficacy of an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary pain program compared to treatment as usual in the Veterans Health&#xD;
      Administration on pain-related disability, opioid medication use, and pain coping.&#xD;

      Study Title&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing Efficacy of a Functional Restoration-Based Complementary and Alternative&#xD;
      Medicine Pain Management Program in a Combat Injured Veterans Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Assess the efficacy of the Functional Orthopedic Rehab Treatment-Amended (FORT-A)&#xD;
      Program for improved pain management outcomes in (N=130) polymorbid OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) using a 1:1 randomized clinical trial comparing FORT-A to&#xD;
      standard Veterans Affairs (VA) care. We will determine the improvement in pain management&#xD;
      outcomes attributable to a fully integrated and manualized interdisciplinary pain program&#xD;
      (FORT-A) compared to standard VA care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Assess the efficacy of FORT-A for decreasing the rate of opioid recidivism (using any&#xD;
      opioid for 3 or more days in any 30-day period) compared to standard VA care in a sample of&#xD;
      OEF/OIF/OND polymorbid Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain (CMP) Veterans discharged off of opioid&#xD;
      medication in VA care since the start of the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI). Unlike the&#xD;
      original FORT trial, this research will formally and prospectively track opioid medication&#xD;
      use among polymorbid Veterans to sensitively detect changes in chronic opioid therapy&#xD;
      attributable to FORT-A versus VA treatment as usual. FORT-A is expected to produce a&#xD;
      significantly lower rate of opioid recidivism by imparting numerous strategies to supplant&#xD;
      opioid medication as a pain management strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY AIM 3: The investigators will assess other psychosocial pain coping constructs&#xD;
      twice a week and analyze latent changes in FORT-A and VA-treated Veterans to ascertain their&#xD;
      role as pain management mediators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a 1:1 block randomized clinical trial comparing the FORT-A program to treatment&#xD;
      as usual for polytrauma OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with prior persistent opioid use and chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain who are eligible for treatment through the South Texas Veterans Health&#xD;
      Care System (STVHCS). All participants will be offered Physical Therapy services before&#xD;
      enrollment and will be enrolled in the study after completing or denying Physical Therapy (up&#xD;
      to 12 sessions as recommended by a Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center [PRC] Physical Medicine &amp;&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Physician or other VA medical provider). If they have already completed&#xD;
      Physical Therapy (PT) before study enrollment, they will not need to do so again. Also, if&#xD;
      the Veteran qualifies but refuses VA Physical Therapy, he or she will still be eligible to&#xD;
      enroll in this study and will not be asked to complete PT first. Veterans randomized to VA&#xD;
      care (treatment as usual) will then meet with PRC and other VA medical providers per usual&#xD;
      standards of care (described below). Those randomized to FORT-A will complete the&#xD;
      standardized FORT-A Program (described in detail below). All participants will complete a&#xD;
      standardized battery of assessments at pre-treatment (Week 0), post-treatment (Week 4/5),&#xD;
      6-month follow-up (Week 30/31) and 12-month follow-up (Week 56/57).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FORT-A: An amended version of the military Functional Orthopedic Rehabilitation Treatment&#xD;
      (FORT) program. For FORT-A, Cognitive and Behavioral Therapy (CBT) components of FORT were&#xD;
      diminished and replaced with mindfulness and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)&#xD;
      components. Individual FORT treatment sessions have been altered in FORT-A to focus on PTSD&#xD;
      symptom management using an abbreviated, manualized Prolonged Exposure treatment. FORT-A&#xD;
      includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 sessions (90-minutes each) of manualized group pain management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 sessions (90-minutes each) of group-based functional restoration Physical Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 sessions (75 minutes each) of individual psychotherapy for pain and PTSD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 sessions (30 minutes each) of biofeedback for pain management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly interdisciplinary case staffings&#xD;
&#xD;
      VA and PRC Care: The STVHCS PRC is the only self-contained Polytrauma Rehab Center in the&#xD;
      VA's nationwide Polytrauma System of Care. The PRC is an interdisciplinary treatment center&#xD;
      including: interdisciplinary assessment and treatment, case management, mental health&#xD;
      support, physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&amp;R), physical therapy, speech therapy,&#xD;
      prosthetists/orthotists, and other integrated specialty services. Though individual treatment&#xD;
      plans may vary, most PRC Veterans will complete a course of Physical Therapy and be followed&#xD;
      by a PM&amp;R physician for pain and other symptom management. Pain management with PM&amp;R may&#xD;
      include medications, injections, and other palliative medical interventions. The PM&amp;R&#xD;
      physicians may also make recommendations about physical function, health behaviors, and&#xD;
      mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured at pre-treatment, post-treatment, 6-month follow-up and one-year&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Consistent with NIH Task Force recommendations, &quot;chronic&quot; CMP has been a problem for&#xD;
             the Veteran for at least half the days in the last 3 months and was acquired or&#xD;
             exacerbated as part of active duty U.S. military service in the Operations Iraqi&#xD;
             Freedom (OIF), Enduring Freedom (OEF), or New Dawn (OND) war eras.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. CMP presents in the context of comorbid psychiatric symptoms of posttraumatic stress&#xD;
             disorder (PTSD; based on a score of 25 or more on the PTSD Checklist-Version 5) and/or&#xD;
             depression (based on a score of 10 or more on the Beck Depression Inventory-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Demonstrate prior &quot;chronic&quot; opioid use (defined as using opioid medication for 20 out&#xD;
             of every 30 days over three or more months) and discharged off of persistent opioid&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. The Veteran will be eligible to be a PRC patient (i.e., have multiple trauma related&#xD;
             physical and psychological injuries; VA, 2013) and be eligible for Physical Therapy&#xD;
