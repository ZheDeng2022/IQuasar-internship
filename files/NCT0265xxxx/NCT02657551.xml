    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for thyroid&#xD;
      cancer. A targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to&#xD;
      identify and attack specific types of cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The name of the study intervention involved in this study is regorafenib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved regorafenib as a treatment for&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer and locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Regorafenib has not been approved for treatment against&#xD;
      thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regorafenib is an oral anti-tumor agent that blocks activity of a specific kind of protein&#xD;
      involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes such as tumor formation and&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
