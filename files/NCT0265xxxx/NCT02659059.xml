    <textblock>
      The purpose of part 1 of this study is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) in&#xD;
      stage IV NSCLC subjects treated with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab as first line&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of part 2 of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of nivolumab&#xD;
      and ipilimumab combined with a short course of chemotherapy in first line stage IV NSCLC.&#xD;
