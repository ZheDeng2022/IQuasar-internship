        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer after prior intravesical BCG&#xD;
             therapy meeting all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically documented diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma confirmed by the&#xD;
             Department of Pathology at MSKCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of activating FGFR3 mutation or gene fusion on an assay performed in a&#xD;
             CLIA-certified laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of high-grade, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of high-grade, stage pTa NMIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior intravesical therapy with at least one induction course of BCG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multiple papillary lesions with at least one amenable to marker tumor study (≤1 cm,&#xD;
             non-invasive; or could be partially resected to leave a non-invasive lesion ≤1 cm) OR&#xD;
             solitary papillary lesion amenable to marker tumor study (≤1 cm, non-invasive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be willing to consent to MSKCC protocol 12-245 (&quot;Tumor Genomic Profiling&#xD;
             in Patients Evaluated for Targeted Cancer Therapy&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, and&#xD;
             laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status of ≥80.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recovery from adverse events of previous systemic anti-cancer therapies to baseline or&#xD;
             grade 1, except for:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stable neuropathy of ≤ grade 2 due to prior cancer therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception during&#xD;
             dosing and for 3 months following the discontinuation of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before study treatment. In case of&#xD;
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed&#xD;
             by follow-up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects the&#xD;
             vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b, a+c, or b+c):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other&#xD;
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%);&#xD;
                  for example, hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Oral contraceptives (OC), injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as the&#xD;
        sole method of contraception because BGJ398 has not been characterized with respect to the&#xD;
        potential to interfere with PK and/or the effectiveness of OCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a woman is of non-childbearing potential, she must either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Be post-menopausal as defined by 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea&#xD;
                  with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor&#xD;
                  symptoms), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal&#xD;
                  ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman must be confirmed by follow-up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for&#xD;
             three months after the last dose of the study drug. They should not father a child&#xD;
             during this period. Men who have undergone vasectomy are also required to use a condom&#xD;
             during intercourse to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinical suspicion of active CIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
