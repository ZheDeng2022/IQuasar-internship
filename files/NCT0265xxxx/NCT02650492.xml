    <textblock>
      Thermotherapy is a technology aiming at destroying tissue, for example tumor tissue.&#xD;
      Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherpy (imILT) is a specific form of&#xD;
      thermotherapy, which, in addition to destroying tumor tissue, has been optimized to cause a&#xD;
      tumor specific immunologic response. In laboratory animals the imILT method has also been&#xD;
      shown to induce a so called abscopal effect. This means that when one tumor is treated with&#xD;
      imILT other, untreated, tumors also decrease in size. The immunologic response has previously&#xD;
      been characterized in breast cancer patients after receiving imILT treatment , and presumed&#xD;
      abscopal effects induced by imILT have also been described in a malignant melanoma patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the functionality and safety of the imILT&#xD;
      treatment method in patients diagnosed with malignant melanoma. The inflammatory process,&#xD;
      following on the treatment, will also be described in order to provide a more in depth&#xD;
      knowledge of the treatment for this indication. The purpose is also to evaluate efficiency&#xD;
      when it comes to local tumor destruction as well as understanding of the subsequent&#xD;
      immunological effects. Since immunologically based treatment of malignant melanoma is under&#xD;
      intense review with so called &quot;immune checkpoint inhibitors&quot; this trial will also provide&#xD;
      valuable information on how imILT, in the future, could be combined with these new and, for&#xD;
      some patients, very effective treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment method has successfully been used for treatment of patients with breast cancer&#xD;
      and malignant melanoma . Treatment of breast cancer patients caused an increase of cytotoxic&#xD;
      T lymphocytes in the treated tumor, as well as activated dendritic cells at the tumor border.&#xD;
      Regulatory T lymphocytes decreased in the regional lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is explorative, prospective, open and non-randomized. Five malignant melanoma&#xD;
      patients stage III - IV will be treated in this trial, which is estimated to be carried out&#xD;
      during a time period of 12 months.&#xD;
