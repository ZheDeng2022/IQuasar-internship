    <textblock>
      IgM-enriched immunoglobulins (IgGAM; Pentaglobin ® ) are new therapy for sepsis and septic&#xD;
      shock since they support immune system especially in case of &quot; immunoparalysis&quot; . However&#xD;
      IgGAM isn't commonly prescribed, few centres use it as routine in severe infections and there&#xD;
      aren't any guidelines to determine how and when to use them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcirculatory dysfunction is a crucial aspect in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced organ&#xD;
      dysfunction, resulting in hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia. Unpublished clinical data suggest&#xD;
      a beneficial effect of IgGAM at microvascular level proved with near infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      and Vascular occlusion test (VOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a double blind phase II prospective randomised controlled trial that will&#xD;
      include patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital &quot;Ospedali&#xD;
      Riuniti&quot; of Ancona, after no more than 24 hours from development of severe sepsis or septic&#xD;
      shoc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two groups (treaties and controls): patients in group of the&#xD;
      treaties will be submitted to infusion of IgGAM conjugate (Pentaglobin ®) at dosage of 250&#xD;
      mg/kg IV (5 mL/kg) per day (rate of 0.4 mL/kg/h), for 72 hours. The controls will receive&#xD;
      equal amount of physiological NaCl solution (0.9%) as placebo. Neither the patient nor the&#xD;
      staff nurses and MD will be aware of the group and of the treatment applied. IgGAM solutions&#xD;
      or NaCl 0.9% will be provided by the hospital pharmacy in similar bags. The remaining&#xD;
      treatments will not be changed in any way and will be at the discretion of the doctor who's&#xD;
      in charge of the patient. All patients of the two groups will receive the optimal therapy for&#xD;
      their conditions, according to good medical clinical practice (GMP), with appropriate&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy, vasoactive and infusional therapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a complex set of signs and symptoms caused by Systemic Inflammatory Response&#xD;
      Syndrome (SIRS) to an infection. Sepsis-related mortality is directly proportional to the&#xD;
      severity of organ dysfunction, and can be up to 80% in the case of septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the pro-inflammatory response to this insult, tissues can be damaged far away from the&#xD;
      primary site of infection. Concurrently with pro-inflammatory cytokines, the immune system&#xD;
      produces anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10, which exert a compensatory antagonist&#xD;
      response. The imbalance toward the anti-inflammatory one can conduce to &quot;immuno-paralysis&quot;&#xD;
      that undermines the defense of the organism against infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibodies play a crucial role in fighting infections; low levels of protective antibodies&#xD;
      are directly related to worst outcome. In consideration to that, polyvalent immunoglobulins&#xD;
      (Ig) represent a potential therapeutic support for modulation of immune response and of&#xD;
      inflammation in sepsis and septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They contain a broad spectrum of antibodies direct against a wide variety of bacterial&#xD;
      antigens (all three classes normally found in human plasma - IgG and IgM and IgGAM&#xD;
      conjugate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to antibody activity and antigen neutralization, benefits of Ig may include:&#xD;
      inactivation of bacterial toxins (endotoxin and exotoxins); increased clearance of&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide; stimulation of leukocytes and their bactericidal activity through&#xD;
      mechanism of opsonization; reduction in the activity of the classical pathway of the&#xD;
      complement; modulation of cytokine production by blood mononuclear cells; synergistic&#xD;
      activity with antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analysis of main studies produced so far have shown that the Ig support, in particular&#xD;
      the IgM-enriched ones, are associated with improved survival of patient with severe sepsis;&#xD;
      these are promising results but the quality of the studies doesn't allow yet to have strong&#xD;
      evidence in favour of their use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IgM-enriched immunoglobulins (IgGAM) proved to be most effective and are currently in the&#xD;
      formulary and usable in case of severe infections (Pentaglobin ®). However, they are not&#xD;
      commonly prescribed, and there aren't any guidelines to determine how and when to use them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unpublished clinical data suggest a beneficial effect even at microvascular level by&#xD;
      application of the method of near infrared spectroscopy with vascular occlusion tests on&#xD;
      level of tenar eminence of the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcirculatory dysfunction (endothelial damage and glycocalyx, increased permeability and&#xD;
      tissue edema, leukocyte adhesion, pro-coagulating agent, reduction of deformability of red&#xD;
      blood cells) is a crucial aspect in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction,&#xD;
      resulting in hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia. Persistent microvascular perfusion&#xD;
      abnormalities have been associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients with septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In consideration to that, a therapy that can prove to act on the microcirculation by&#xD;
      restoring tissue perfusion would represent a promising pathophysiological approach to the&#xD;
      patient in septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods This is a double blind phase II prospective randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
      It will include patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital&#xD;
      &quot;Ospedali Riuniti&quot; of Ancona, after no more than 24 hours from development of severe sepsis&#xD;
      or septic shock (diagnosis according to the criteria established by the Consensus Conference&#xD;
      of 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients younger than 18 years old, pregnant women, patients with severe sepsis/septic shock&#xD;
      for more than 24 hours, chronic renal failure, terminal state with a life expectancy of less&#xD;
      than 24 hours, contraindications to treatment with IgGAM, lack of informed consent will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When inclusion criteria present and there aren't any exclusion criteria for this trials&#xD;
      written informed consent will be taken by patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical data will be collected by the investigator (age, weight, sex, acute&#xD;
      and chronic diseases present at inclusion, GCS, APACHE II, SAPS II, arterial blood gases,&#xD;
      SOFA score, lab data such as Hb, WBC, hepatic and renal function, blood sugar, Procalcitonin&#xD;
      ) Patients will be randomized into two groups (treaties and controls): patients in Group of&#xD;
      the treaties will be submitted to infusion of IgGAM conjugate (Pentaglobin ®) at dosage of&#xD;
      250 mg/kg IV (5 mL/kg) per day (rate of 0.4 mL/kg/h), for 72 hours. The controls will receive&#xD;
      equal amount of physiological NaCl solution (0.9%) as placebo. Neither the patient nor the&#xD;
      staff nurses and MD will be aware of the group and of the treatment applied (double blind&#xD;
      trial). IgGAM solutions or NaCl 0.9% are provided by the hospital pharmacy in similar bags.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients of the two groups will receive the optimal therapy for their conditions,&#xD;
      according to good medical clinical practice (GMP), with appropriate antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
      vasoactive and infusional therapy.All treatments except from Pentaglobin/placebo will not be&#xD;
      changed and will be at the discretion of the doctor who's in charge of the patient.At the&#xD;
      time of inclusion, the following data will be collected: gender, age, anthropometric&#xD;
      parameters, ICU admission diagnosis, known or suspected infection, results of microbiological&#xD;
      tests. Prior to initiating therapy (T0), after 24 hours (T24) and at the end of therapy with&#xD;
      IgGAM conjugate sublingual microcirculation will be evaluated by &quot;Incident Dark Field Imaging&#xD;
      (Medical imaging, Cytocam, IDF Braedius, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and tissue oxygenation&#xD;
      by using &quot;Near Infrared Spectroscopy technique &quot; (NIRS, InSpectra ™ Model 650; Hutchinson&#xD;
      Technology Inc., Hutchinson, MN, USA). Both techniques are commonly used in our clinical&#xD;
      practice and include CE mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time points temperature and hemodynamic parameters (mean arterial pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate; cardiac index, global end-diastolic volume, extravascular Lung water when&#xD;
      monitored) will be collected, together with arterial and venous blood gas and lab data,&#xD;
      diuresis and water balance, GCS. Concomitant treatments are noted. Data regarding the&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay in intensive care and the outcome will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size has been assessed on the basis of the primary objective of the study, based&#xD;
      on a significantly higher PVD in the Group of patients treated with IgGAM compared with&#xD;
      controls at 72 hours after starting treatment. Assuming an average difference between the two&#xD;
      groups at 72hrs of 4 mm/mm2 with a SD of 3, nine patients per group would be sufficient with&#xD;
      an α error of 0.05 and a power of 80%. In total 20 patients will be included (10 per group&#xD;
      All data will be collected anonymously, attributing to each selected patient only an&#xD;
      alpha-numeric code, into an electronic database (password protected), respecting privacy and&#xD;
      confidentiality of the data.&#xD;
