    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that anti-IL-6 therapy is effective for&#xD;
      reducing plaque inflammation as measured by fluorine-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (FDG-PET) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are synthetic&#xD;
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (dMARD) inadequate responders and are naive to biologic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center study will recruit 21 subjects to undergo an open-label tocilizumab&#xD;
      treatment for 13-18 weeks in order to examine the efficacy of tocilizumab on plaque&#xD;
      inflammation in RA patients. This multi-center study will employ PET/MR imaging of the&#xD;
      carotid and coronary arteries and aorta to assess the effect of anti-IL-6 therapy on arterial&#xD;
      inflammation in patients with RA who are synthetic dMARD inadequate responders and are naive&#xD;
      to biologic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary, exploratory evaluation will also examine correlations between atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaque inflammation and the inflammatory activity of the rheumatoid joint measured by PET-MR&#xD;
      imaging, as well as how the changes in inflammation correlate with lipid and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers, and how stress levels are associated with inflammatory activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults between 50 and 75 years old diagnosed with RA will come in for an initial screening&#xD;
      visit to assess for clinical eligibility criteria (visit 1). During the screening period,&#xD;
      patient acceptability for the study will be assessed on the basis of medical history,&#xD;
      concomitant medications, physical examination, and clinical laboratory test results. The&#xD;
      study doctor will review the screening test results and procedures to determine the subject&#xD;
      eligibility prior to imaging. Women able to become pregnant will be excluded due to&#xD;
      teratogenic side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A FDG-PET/MR imaging study will be performed at a second screening visit (visit 2) to assess&#xD;
      for the presence of arterial, plaque and joint inflammation. A serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
      drawn and confirmed to be negative prior to imaging for female subjects of childbearing&#xD;
      potential. Acceptability for study participants will be confirmed on the basis of a&#xD;
      tissue-to-background ratio (TBR) of greater than or equal to 1.7 in qualifying vessel&#xD;
      (calculated using the mean of the maximum SUV) as measured from FDG-PET/MR imaging.&#xD;
      Participants who meet clinical and imaging eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study (visit 3). Subjects will receive first dose of tocilizumab subcutaneously, on&#xD;
      subsequent weeks, subjects will be instructed to self-administer tocilizumab at a dose of&#xD;
      162mg every week for a 12 week period. 4 weeks post-initiation, participants will return for&#xD;
      a clinical safety follow-up (visit 4). Final evaluation will include physical exams, clinical&#xD;
      assessments and carotid IMT test. A second FDG-PET/MR imaging session will take place 12&#xD;
      weeks post-administration (visit 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of tocilizumab on arterial plaque inflammation will be examined by measuring the&#xD;
      change in FDG uptake in the carotid arteries, coronary arteries and aorta between the&#xD;
      baseline and 12 week FDG-PET/MRI.&#xD;
