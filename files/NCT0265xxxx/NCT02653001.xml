    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to establish a list of volunteers willing and able to donate stool&#xD;
      samples for use in the model colon so as to facilitate research directed toward understanding&#xD;
      the basic science underlying the interactions between the gut microbiome, potential external&#xD;
      modifiers, and health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult volunteers will be recruited to donate stool samples for laboratory-based experiments.&#xD;
      Once the sample has arrived at QIB 50-100g will be added to the colon model and, depending on&#xD;
      the system used, either cultured for 24h or for up to 40 days. During this time, factors&#xD;
      under investigation will be added to the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples added mimic food chyme arriving at the ileal-caecal valve in the intestinal tract. At&#xD;
      this stage digested, but non-absorbed food components plus cells and mucous shed from the&#xD;
      lining of the small intestine enter the large intestine. Samples of bacteria and media can be&#xD;
      taken at any point during the incubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two models are used&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a simple batch culture in which bacteria, media and test compounds are added to a single&#xD;
           compartment and analysed over 24h&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a three compartment model with continuous flow of media, test compounds and bacteria&#xD;
           from the entrance port of the first chamber to the exit of the third chamber mimicking&#xD;
           movement through the three main compartments of the colon. This model allows for a&#xD;
           stable bacterial population to be established before addition of test compounds, and can&#xD;
           remain viable for up to 40 days. In the case of these longer incubations, multiple time&#xD;
           points can allow for quite complex experiments looking at interactions between bacteria,&#xD;
           food and pharmaceutical products where different factors are added at different time&#xD;
           points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples collected during the incubation will be analysed by centrifuging the sample to create&#xD;
      a pellet containing bacteria and a supernatant containing a wide range of metabolites. The&#xD;
      bacteria will be analysed by extracting their DNA for genomic analysis or using RNA based&#xD;
      approaches. On occasion, conventional microbiological techniques might be used. The&#xD;
      supernatant will be filter sterilised prior to analysis of its chemical composition by&#xD;
      techniques such as mass spectrometry, gel electrophoresis, or chromatography. Alternatively&#xD;
      the supernatant may be added to cell lines to model the interaction between the bacterial&#xD;
      ecosystem and the cells lining the colon.&#xD;
