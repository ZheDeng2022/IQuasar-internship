  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if the study drug called pembrolizumab could control the&#xD;
      growth or shrink the cancer but it could also cause side effects. Researchers hope to learn&#xD;
      if the study drug will shrink the cancer by half, or prevent it from growing for at least 6&#xD;
      months. Pembrolizumab is an antibody that targets the immune system and activates it to stop&#xD;
      cancer growth and/or kill cancer cells.&#xD;

    <description>patients with stable disease will be considered responders if disease is stable for 27 weeks or more. The regimen will be considered worthy of further study if responses as defined above are observed in at least 3 of the 12 subjects. All subjects will undergo DCE-MRI of the head at the time points specified in Study Flow Chart . Local radiologic assessment of tumor measurements will be used during the study for clinical management and investigator-assessed disease progression. Additional MRIs may be obtained at the discretion of the investigators, as clinically indicated. Radiologic response (complete response or partial response) will be assessed by comparing on-treatment MRI scans with the pretreatment baseline MRI scans. Radiologic progression will be determined by using the smallest tumor measurement of either the pretreatment baseline or after initiation of study medication. The RANO criteria will be used for determining disease status.</description>

    <description>Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as an approximately 30 minute (-5/+10 mins) IV infusion every 3 weeks. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. Patients will be followed with DCE perfusion MRI done at baseline and every 9 weeks (+/- 7 days). Patients will be allowed to stay on treatment in spite of increase in tumor size, provided the patient has no, or manageable, new neurologic symptoms, and at the discretion of treating physician. In that situation, tumor resection should be encouraged for the distinction between tumor progression and immunologic reactions. Patients undergoing surgical resection will have tissue collected for collateral studies. All collected tissue will be stored in the Pathology Core Tissue bank at MSK.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant glioma by enrolling institution:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WHO grade IV tumors (GBM or its variants)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WHO grade III anaplastic astrocytoma or oligodendroglial tumors or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WHO grade II gliomas, if MRI shows contrast enhancement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor recurrence after previous treatment, which must have included at least radiation&#xD;
             therapy and one cytotoxic chemotherapy. There is no limit on number of previous&#xD;
             recurrences or lines of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously obtained tumor sample exhibits a hypermutator phenotype. For the purposes&#xD;
             of this trial, a hypermutator phenotype is defined as tumors harboring 30 mutations&#xD;
             (non-synonymous somatic point or indel mutations) detected by the MSK-IMPACT or&#xD;
             comparable next generation sequencing performed in a CLIA environment. Contingent to&#xD;
             approval by the MSK Principal Investigator, patients with less than 30 mutations may&#xD;
             be eligible if they display a mutation in a mismatch repair gene or other mutations in&#xD;
             genes known to be associated with hypermutator phenotypes or microsatellite&#xD;
             instability, including but not limited to MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, POLE, POLD as&#xD;
             determined by validated methods, or if microsatellite instability is present, as&#xD;
             identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other validated methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Note: The MSK-IMPACT (Integrated Mutation Profiling for Actionable Cancer Targets)&#xD;
             assay is a next generation genomic profiling performed on formalin-fixed,&#xD;
             paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue in a CLIA-certified Molecular Diagnostic Service&#xD;
             laboratory. IMPACT provides full exon coverage of 410 cancer related genes and can&#xD;
             detect base substitutions, small indels, copy number alterations and selected gene&#xD;
             re-rearrangements. In some cases, additional assays such as Sanger Sequencing or&#xD;
             fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be required to confirm specific results&#xD;
             detected on IMPACT. Patients at MSK will have this assay to determine eligibility. Use&#xD;
             of other validated next-generation sequencing techniques for eligibility may be&#xD;
             considered, provided they are performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory and are&#xD;
             approved by the MSK Principal Investigator.&#xD;

             enhancement on MRI outside of the radiation treatment field&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An interval of ≥ 4 weeks after the last administration of any investigational agent or&#xD;
             any other treatment prior to first dose of pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events of any&#xD;
             previous treatment. Note: Surgical resection for recurrent tumor prior to enrollment&#xD;
             is allowed.&#xD;
