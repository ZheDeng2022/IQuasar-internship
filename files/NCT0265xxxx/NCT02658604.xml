      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several examples in the literature describe the types of medication management issues&#xD;
      uncovered during the course of home-based medication reviews. For example, the investigators&#xD;
      previously reported the outcomes of home medication reviews of 43 homebound community&#xD;
      pharmacy patients, finding that 58% of patients were keeping medications in the home that&#xD;
      were expired, duplicates of other current medications, or no longer therapeutically&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of these issues, due to their nature, could be considered to be &quot;hidden&quot;, i.e. issues&#xD;
      that are unlikely to be adequately detected or resolved during the course of routine&#xD;
      interactions between patients and pharmacists in the community pharmacy setting. Currently,&#xD;
      only homebound patients in Ontario are eligible to receive government-funded home medication&#xD;
      review services from pharmacists. This limitation in funding eligibility is problematic as it&#xD;
      reduces the likelihood that non-homebound patients will receive home medication reviews, even&#xD;
      though this population may also benefit from these services. Indeed, evidence in the&#xD;
      literature is not limited exclusively to homebound patients, and suggests that non-homebound&#xD;
      patients are also at risk from home-centered medication management issues and may also&#xD;
      benefit from home medication reviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to characterize the prevalence and nature of &quot;hidden in the home&quot; medication&#xD;
      management issues in non-homebound patients. To our knowledge, this study would be the first&#xD;
      of its kind to focus specifically on this patient population and lend direct evidence in&#xD;
      support of expanding funding of home medication review services in Ontario to include&#xD;
      non-homebound patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of ambulatory, non-homebound patients who regularly attend community pharmacies are&#xD;
      affected by medication management issues that cannot be adequately identified and resolved&#xD;
      during the course of a typical medication review taking place within the pharmacy. These&#xD;
      patients would benefit from a full medication review taking place in their own homes, similar&#xD;
      to what is presently provided under Ontario's MedsCheck at Home program, for which only&#xD;
      homebound patients in Ontario are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS/OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the frequency of, and what type(s) and severity of, drug-related problems are&#xD;
           detected during pharmacist visits to patients' homes who would not otherwise qualify for&#xD;
           a MedsCheck at Home service?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Based on the findings from this study, which criteria would best assist community&#xD;
           pharmacists in identifying ambulatory patients who may stand to benefit most from a&#xD;
           home-based medication review?&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive a home visit from a pharmacist, including a medication review and the identification and addressing of drug therapy problems through patient education, the provision of pharmacologic and/or non-pharmacologic advice, or the adaptation of therapy or communication of recommendations to prescribers. All activities are within the current scope of practice for pharmacists in Ontario. A detailed assessment of the patient's medication inventory and organization/storage practices will be conducted, followed by a medication cabinet cleanup to help the patient organize their medications and discard any expired or discontinued medications. A list of inappropriate medications found in the home will be documented, detailing the reasons why they are inappropriate and if/how the patient is currently using these medications. With patient consent, inappropriate medications will be removed from the home and returned to the pharmacy for safe disposal.</description>
