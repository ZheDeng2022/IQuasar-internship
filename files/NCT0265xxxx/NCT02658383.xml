  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 3 billion people rely on biomass combustion to meet basic domestic energy needs. Many&#xD;
      households use traditional cookstoves to meet these energy needs, which can result in&#xD;
      extremely high indoor air pollution concentrations. Indoor air pollution from biomass&#xD;
      combustion accounts for an estimated 3.9 million premature deaths per year, representing&#xD;
      about 4.8% of the global disease burden. Improved stove designs have the potential to&#xD;
      substantially reduce indoor air pollution exposures. However, there are few randomized&#xD;
      intervention trials, and previous stove intervention studies have been plagued by low&#xD;
      improved stove adoption and sustained use, severely limiting interpretations of these&#xD;
      studies. This research proposes to conduct community surveys and in-depth interviews among&#xD;
      Honduran cookstove users to gain insight into the complex pathways surrounding barriers to&#xD;
      and predictors of sustained improved cookstove adoption (among the target population for the&#xD;
      proposed intervention). This information will be used to conduct and enhance a randomized&#xD;
      improved cookstove intervention among 300 Honduran families, incorporating qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative measures of cookstove use and measuring pre- to post-intervention changes in&#xD;
      pollutant exposures and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goals are twofold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To incorporate community-engaged approaches throughout all aspects of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To maximize sustained stove use (thereby maximizing the health impact of the&#xD;
           intervention) to achieve valid exposure-response estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both objectives utilize innovative strategies to fill knowledge gaps. The research team will&#xD;
      build upon previous studies in Latin America that have focused on identifying and validating&#xD;
      appropriate field techniques for exposure and health assessments in rural areas of developing&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the proposed project will provide insight regarding barriers/predictors of&#xD;
      sustained cookstove adoption, an issue impeding research in this field; assess the&#xD;
      relationship between stove use and indicators of cardiovascular health, a substantial and&#xD;
      quickly growing disease burden in developing countries; and result in a more comprehensive&#xD;
      and valid assessment of the impact of a cookstove intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Intention to treat analyses will incorporate the repeated measures within participants and the change in blood pressure comparing the two research arms will be the primary outcome of interest. Blood pressure is measured at each of 6 visits spaced approximately 6 months apart over the course of 2.5 years.</description>

    <measure>Change in Inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>The cleaner burning cookstove will be installed in the homes after 2 visits (after approximately 6 months) and after 4 visits (after approximately 1 yr and 6 months) for half of the population, respectively.</time_frame>
    <description>Inflammatory markers will be measured in dried blood spots collected at each of 6 visits spaced approximately 6 months apart. Exhaled nitric oxide will also be measured at each visit to assess pulmonary inflammation. The lab will analyze the dried blood spots after the completion of the study (not at each 6 month interval); planned inflammatory markers include C-reactive protein, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), Serum amyloid A, and vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1)</description>
