  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare anti-inflammatory effects of two anti-fibrinolyntic&#xD;
      drugs (Tranexamic acid versus Epsilon-aminocaproic acid) in pediatric patients undergoing&#xD;
      pediatric cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bleeding under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is one of the most common complications in&#xD;
      patients undergoing pediatric cardiac surgery. The inflammatory response produced during and&#xD;
      after CPB is a factor that adds significantly to the morbidity after cardiac surgery. A&#xD;
      number of factors have been shown to be involved inducing the inflammatory response. These&#xD;
      include complement system activation3 and activation of inflammatory cytokines, especially&#xD;
      IL-1 IL-64, IL-8 and TNF alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic Acid (TXA) and Epsilon-Aminocaproic Acid (EACA) are lysine analogues frequently&#xD;
      used as anti-fibrinolytic agents in patients undergoing CPB. Many authors have highlighted&#xD;
      the role of TXA in reducing blood loss and blood transfusion during and after CPB. Role of&#xD;
      EACA and aprotinin in decreasing pro-inflammatory response during and after CPB has been well&#xD;
      documented in adult literature. Patients undergoing redo sternotomy have higher inflammatory&#xD;
      response as compared to patients undergoing first cardiac surgery. It has also been shown&#xD;
      that the TXA can reduce the inflammatory response after CPB by acting directly or indirectly&#xD;
      on the inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no studies directly comparing the anti-inflammatory properties of EACA and TXA in&#xD;
      the pediatric population undergoing CPB. In our institution, EACA is used as the standard of&#xD;
      practice to reduce the blood loss during pediatric cardiac surgeries, but the investigators&#xD;
      have now started using TXA more recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrinolytic properties of&#xD;
      these two anti-fibrinolytic agents in pediatric patients undergoing CBP for cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Tranexamic acid (TXA) has better anti-inflammatory profile as compared to â‚¬-Amino&#xD;
      Caproic Acid (EACA) which may help in reducing blood loss, renal injury, hepatic injury and&#xD;
      blood transfusion during and after CPB&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives: During redo sternotomy procedures there is significant anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      response which occurs and plays a role in increasing amount chest tube output, blood loss,&#xD;
      renal injury, hepatic injury and ultimately patient morbidity and/or mortality. The proposed&#xD;
      study will help to know if antifibrinolytic agents are beneficial in reducing the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory response produced and which of the two drugs (EACA or TXA), has a better&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory profile when used in a similar setting for patients undergoing pediatric&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate whether TXA or EACA can decrease inflammatory response produced during redo&#xD;
      sternotomy procedures in pediatric patients and which drug decreases the injury and/or&#xD;
      cardiac dysfunction more as reflected by fluid balances, inotropic support, diuretic&#xD;
      requirement, length of ventilator support, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay.&#xD;
