      The purpose of this study is to use abatacept as a clinical molecular probe to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of inhibiting costimulation on immune responses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (RA).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory immune mediated arthritis which leads to&#xD;
      pain, swelling and destruction of joints. RA affects more than 500,000 subjects in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom (UK) and incurs significant health and economic cost. Most patients require potent&#xD;
      immune suppressing drugs such as methotrexate, which help reduce pain and stiffness, and&#xD;
      protect the joints against damage. However, many patients do not respond or are unable to&#xD;
      tolerate methotrexate. In these patients, biologic drugs such as abatacept are used to try to&#xD;
      control the arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abatacept is designed to target and inhibit a specific molecule involved in &quot;costimulation&quot;&#xD;
      of the inflammatory signal that is thought to be important in RA. While abatacept has been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in trials and clinical practice, the exact mechanism of action of&#xD;
      abatacept in RA has not been fully elucidated. Understanding these actions is likely to&#xD;
      inform both the use of abatacept in RA and lead to increased understanding of inflammation in&#xD;
      humans with implications for further therapies. This six month prospective open label study,&#xD;
      therefore, aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting costimulation on a variety of&#xD;
      important inflammatory cell types and processes in humans with RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 participants with RA who have bad prognostic genetic markers (Anti-citrullinated protein&#xD;
      antibodies (ACPA) and human leukocyte antigen (HLADR4) and who were scheduled to receive&#xD;
      subcutaneous abatacept as part of their standard clinical treatment will be recruited.&#xD;
      Consenting participants will followed for a total of 24 weeks during which time they will&#xD;
      have additional venous blood and urine samples taken to investigate the effects of abatacept&#xD;
      on their immune cells and system. The primary endpoint of the study is the characterisation&#xD;
      of the immune response following costimulatory modulation in RA patients at 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include change in immunological response and its association with&#xD;
      clinical outcome measures up to 24 weeks.&#xD;
