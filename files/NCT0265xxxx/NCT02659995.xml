      Our multicenter prospective observational study aims to show the relationship between blood&#xD;
      glucose levels and glycemic variability and the development of infections during the ICU stay&#xD;
      and with outcome. Within the secondary endpoints, we will evaluate if a blood glucose range&#xD;
      between 70 and 140 mg/dl is associated with an increasing surviving rate in non-diabetic&#xD;
      critically ill patients.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION High blood glucose levels and insulin resistance are frequently registered in&#xD;
      critically ill patients. In the past, hyperglycemia due to stress was considered as an&#xD;
      adaptive body reaction to satisfy higher energetic requests. This theory has been&#xD;
      re-discussed after Leuven's study in 2001, which demonstrated that a strict glycemic control,&#xD;
      by means of intensive insulin administration, may reduce mortality in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. However, more recent randomized controlled studies cannot confirm these results,&#xD;
      showing how an intensive insulinic therapy can be associated to an higher risk of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the attention has been shifted on the issue of glycemic variability in the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units (ICU), that seems to be a better mortality predictor than the simple&#xD;
      blood glucose level. A relationship between lower glycemic variability, normal glucose levels&#xD;
      (range 72-125 mg/dl) and outcome improving has been investigated. An high glycemic&#xD;
      variability it's been associated to an increased in-hospital mortality, also in patients&#xD;
      having total parenteral nutrition (TPN) independently from the presence of episodes of hypo&#xD;
      or hyperglycemia. Furthermore, an intensive insulinic therapy itself may lead to excessive&#xD;
      blood glucose levels fluctuations as it brings to an increased risk of hypoglycemia, usually&#xD;
      treated in an &quot;aggressive&quot; way. A recent retrospective study has evaluated the impact of&#xD;
      glycemic variability and hypoglycemia on outcome in non critically ill patients (undergone&#xD;
      insulin administration during the hospitalization), showing a strong correlation between&#xD;
      hypoglycemia and an increasing of mortality rate. A recent work of Arnold and coll. showed&#xD;
      that the application of a treatment protocol for hypoglycemia (using administration of 50%&#xD;
      dextrose) in critically ill patients was able to obtain a reduction of glycemic variability,&#xD;
      remaining safe in avoiding dangerous hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the real causal relationship between glycemic variability and mortality has not yet&#xD;
      been demonstrated. The increased oxydative stress due to wide glycemic fluctuations seems to&#xD;
      play a leading role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The altered glucidic homeostasis in the critically ill patient may also cause a disfunction&#xD;
      of immune cells with an increased risk of infections: Hirshberg et al. have found an&#xD;
      association between glycemic variability an the risk of nosocomial infections development in&#xD;
      a population of pediatric critically ill patients, studied retrospectively. A correlation&#xD;
      between high glycemic variability, development of sepsis and risk of nosocomial infections in&#xD;
      burn patients has also been demonstrated. Recently, a study by Krinsley and Preiser has&#xD;
      highlighted how keeping blood glucose levels in a range between 70 and 140 mg/dl is strongly&#xD;
      associated with an increased surviving rate in non diabetic patients, independently from ICU&#xD;
      length of stay and from the severity of the clinical conditions. Donati et al. have&#xD;
      demonstrated, in a retrospective study, the relationship between glycemic variability and&#xD;
      infections; however, it's not yet clear if the glycemic variability is a cause of an effect&#xD;
      of infections. Indeed, &quot;relationship&quot; is not equivalent to &quot;causality&quot; and it's yet to be&#xD;
      elucidated if an higher glycemic variability just represents a sign of a worse clinical&#xD;
      condition or, conversely, really leads to an increased risk of nosocomial infections. In this&#xD;
      last case, dedicated protocols should be mandatory, not only to normalize blood glucose&#xD;
      levels but also to minimize excessive glycemic fluctuations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PURPOSE Primary endpoint of this multicenter prospective observational study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the relationship between blood glucose levels and glycemic variability and the&#xD;
      development of nosocomial infection during ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm the correlation between blood glucose levels and outcome (ICU mortality and&#xD;
      hospital mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if keeping the blood glucose level in a range between 70 and 140 mg/dl is&#xD;
      associated with an increasing of surviving rate in non diabetic critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the discriminatory power of Glycemic Lability Index (GLI) on infections&#xD;
      development with AUC (ROC curve).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the discriminatory power of other indexes of glycemic variability on infections&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the discriminatory power of all the glycemic variability indexes on mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the eventual differences between diabetic and non diabetic patients about&#xD;
      infections development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the impact of the caloric intake on glycemic variability, infections&#xD;
      development and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATHERIALS AND METHODS The study will take place in ICUs of the participating centers.&#xD;
      Written formal informed consent will be request before the inclusion of each patient in the&#xD;
      study; if it won't be possible because of particular neurologic conditions of the patient, an&#xD;
      informing module will be provided to the patient's family and the informed consent will be&#xD;
      request to the patients as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: 300 patients consecutively admitted in the participating ICUs from&#xD;
      January 2016 and not later than 31/12/2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: age &lt; 18, patients with end-stage disease with life expectancy shorter&#xD;
      than 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection An Excel database will be edited, collecting these data about each patient:&#xD;
      age, sex, presence of type I or II diabetes, glycate haemoglobin (if present), at-home&#xD;
      antidiabetic therapy (including oral antidiabetics and their dose and insulin); admission&#xD;
      diagnosis, admission SAPS II score; for every day during the ICU stay will be registered:&#xD;
      insulin administration (if &quot;one-shot&quot; administration, dose and route of administration, if in&#xD;
      infusion, time of start, dose at the moment of glycemic measurement and min-max daily range);&#xD;
      steroid therapy (molecule, daily dose, date of start and stop); antibiotic therapy (molecule,&#xD;
      daily dose, date of start and stop); daily caloric and proteic intake specifying if via&#xD;
      enteral or parenteral nutrition of both; other therapies included glucose and propofol;&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (yes/no, date of start and stop); blood lactates (worst daily value);&#xD;
      daily leucocytes and differential white cells count; daily SOFA score; presence of infections&#xD;
      (suspected or confirmed; if confirmed, site and microorganism and eventual Multidrug&#xD;
      Resistance pattern); presence of sepsis (following SCCM criteria); length of ICU and hospital&#xD;
      stay; outcome (ICU and hospital mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every blood glucose level measurement obtained from laboratory analysis, bloodgas analysis&#xD;
      and Glucostix, will be registered with date and time (hours and minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycemic variability will be evaluated in terms of these four indexes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard deviation (SD) Mean Amplitude of Glycemic excursions - MAGE, calculated as the mean&#xD;
      of differences between consecutive values of blood glucose (absolute values) &gt; 1 SD of the&#xD;
      global values; Coefficient of Variation (CV) calculated as SD/mean. Glycemic Lability Index&#xD;
      (GLI) calculated following formule (where Gluc n is the number of the values registered on&#xD;
      the time H n e N is the total numbers of values registered in a week; measurements with an&#xD;
      interval between 1 and 12 hours will be registered; the mean of the GLI in the different&#xD;
      weeks will be calculated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLI ((mmol⁄l^2 )⁄h*〖week〗^(-1) )=∑_(n=1)^N▒〖(〖Gluc〗_n-〖Gluc〗_(n+1))〗^2⁄((h_(n+1)-h_n))&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTYCAL ANALYSIS All patients with an ICU length of stay shorter than 72 hours will be&#xD;
      excluded from the statistical analysis for the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on an earlier study, about the 40% of the admitted patients have a length of stay&#xD;
      shorter than 3 days and the incidence of infections was 30%. For this reason it's calculate&#xD;
      to be necessary to include 2928 patients to have an alpha error &lt; 0,01 and a beta error &lt;&#xD;
      0,01, excluding every patient with an ICU stay shorter than 72 hours. Considering the&#xD;
      variability in the length of ICU stay in the single ICUs and the possibility that on the date&#xD;
      of 31/03/2017 some ICUs could not reach the possibility of admitting 300 patients, the&#xD;
      theorical sample size is expanded to 3300 patients in total (20% of the theorical sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables distribution will be evaluated with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; parametric and non&#xD;
      parametric statistical tests will be applicated where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-Test (or Mann-Whitney test) will be used for the variables comparison between the groups&#xD;
      &quot;infections/no infections&quot;, &quot;sepsis/no sepsis&quot;, &quot;survivors/non survivors&quot;. ROC curves&#xD;
      (Receiver Operating Characteristics) will be made to evaluate the discriminatory power of&#xD;
      blood glucose levels, SD, MAGE, CV and GLI for the infections development, sepsis and&#xD;
      outcome. Binary logistic regression will be applicated for analyzing the correlation between&#xD;
      glycemic variability, infections development, sepsis and outcome, including APACHE II, SOFA,&#xD;
      age, sex, presence of diabetes, blood lactates (at the admission and mean value), insulin&#xD;
      administration, type of nutrition, mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay as&#xD;
      covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroups analysis will be performed based on admission diagnosis, presence of diabetes,&#xD;
      insulin administration on ICU, type of nutrition. Statistical significance will be considered&#xD;
      with a p value &lt; 0,05.&#xD;
&#xD;
