  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify a serum biomarker(s) that can detect increased levels&#xD;
      of a population of CD15+ hypodense neutrophils termed low-density granulocytes (LDG) in the&#xD;
      blood of patients with severe persistent asthma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neutrophils are implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple asthma phenotypes. It was shown&#xD;
      in study IST Q4935s that low-density granulocytes (LDG) are elevated in the blood of patients&#xD;
      with moderate or severe asthma. The greatest frequency and the highest percentages of LDG&#xD;
      were observed in subjects with severe asthma. The LDG, which were first identified and&#xD;
      characterized in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, have been reported to display&#xD;
      increased cytotoxicity for endothelial cells, increased tendency to form neutrophil&#xD;
      extracellular traps, and increased production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). It was also&#xD;
      observed that the LDG expressed increased levels of CD15, which can facilitate attachment of&#xD;
      activated platelets to the LDG. Identification of a putative serum biomarker that correlates&#xD;
      with increased levels of the CD15+ LDG may be useful for the detection of&#xD;
      neutrophil-associated inflammation in severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty subjects will be screened to identify 20 subjects with severe persistent asthma. The&#xD;
      following data and/or samples will then be obtained within three weeks of the clinical&#xD;
      assessment: (1) the percentages of LDG will be quantified by flow cytometry; (2) a blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected into a PAXgene Blood tube and stored until shipped to Genentech for&#xD;
      gene profiling analysis; and (3) a serum sample will be collected for measurement of total&#xD;
      immunoglobulin E (IgE) and for future confirmation of potential biomarkers identified in the&#xD;
      gene profiling analyses.&#xD;
