      A crossover trial with healthy volunteers will be conducted. Six sessions will be performed&#xD;
      once a week in a counterbalanced order and at least with seven days washout period to&#xD;
      minimize carry-over effects. In each session, volunteers will be submitted to quantity and&#xD;
      quality of sleep, type of eating, fatigue and motivation level, cortical brain activity&#xD;
      measures through paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS), spinal cord activity&#xD;
      measures through electrical stimulation, non-invasive spinal stimulation (tsDCS) or&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation (rTMS) and physical exercise (gait training).&#xD;

      After given prior informed consent, volunteers will be submitted to six pseudorandomized&#xD;
      sessions using a website (randomization.com) by a non-involved researcher. At study&#xD;
      beginning, volunteers will be evaluated through structured questionnaire and each session,&#xD;
      will comprise the following experimental sequence:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantity and quality of sleep: It will be enquired how many hours the volunteer slept in&#xD;
           the last night. The quality of the sleep will be measured through an analogue scale&#xD;
           graded from 0 (worst quality of sleep) to 10 points (best quality of sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Type of eating: All the individuals will be asked about ingestion of food and drinks&#xD;
           that could change the cortical excitability ( e. g.; coffee, chocolate, energetic, soda&#xD;
           e etcc). If positive, researchers will record the time since of ingestion and quantify&#xD;
           the amount of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fatigue and motivation level: Fatigue and motivation level: Fatigue and motivation&#xD;
           levels: It will be measured through an analogue scale graded from 0 (lower fatigue or&#xD;
           motivation levels) to 10 points (greater fatigue or motivation levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cortical excitability: the cortical will be measured through the motor evoked potential&#xD;
           (MEP), short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). All&#xD;
           the measures will be evaluated through transcranial magnetic stimulation (Neurosoft,&#xD;
           Russia). Initially, rest motor threshold (RMT) will be determined by finding the lowest&#xD;
           stimulator output that elicit motor evoked potential (MEP) at least 50 microvolts (μV).&#xD;
           For RMT measure, a figure-eight coil connected to the magnetic stimulator held manually&#xD;
           at 45 degrees from the midline, will be placed over the right primary motor cortex (C3 -&#xD;
           10/20 System). The short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation&#xD;
           (ICF) will be evaluated by paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. A&#xD;
           subthreshold conditioning stimuli (80% of RMT) and suprathreshold test stimuli (130% of&#xD;
           RMT) will be delivered at an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2 milliseconds for SICI and&#xD;
           10 milliseconds for ICF. Ten stimuli will be applied at each condition (unconditioned&#xD;
           pulse and pairs of stimuli with ISI of 3 and 20 milliseconds). Stimuli order delivery&#xD;
           will be pseudo-randomized and SICI and ICF will be expressed as conditioned stimulus&#xD;
           percentage regarding unconditioned stimulus. The MEP value will be obtained through&#xD;
           single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Ten suprathreshold (130% of RMT) stimuli&#xD;
           will be delivered on primary motor cortex (C3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Spinal cord activity: the level of excitability of spinal cord will be measured through&#xD;
           the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hoffman reflex (H reflex): the H reflex will be elicited by a percutaneous&#xD;
                electrical stimulation on tibial nerve delivered on popliteal fossae and recorded&#xD;
                the electromyographic responses from the soleus muscle. The values of maximal H&#xD;
                reflex, M wave and maximal H reflex and maximal M wave ratio (H/M ratio) will be&#xD;
                obtained through a recruitment curve. The recruitment curve will start with a&#xD;
                stimulus intensity delivered from 2 milliampere (mA) and increasing on steps of 1&#xD;
                mA until to M wave curve stabilization (no increasing of the M wave amplitude).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Homosynaptic depression (HD): the HD will be obtained through a serie of two&#xD;
                consecutive stimuli separated by a interstimulus interval (from 30ms until&#xD;
                10.000ms). The stimuli will be delivered on popliteal fossa and the&#xD;
                electromyographic responses from soleus muscle will be recorded. The stimuli will&#xD;
                be delivered with the intensity necessary to produce the maximal H reflex (this&#xD;
                information will be available in the recruitment curve as stated before). The&#xD;
                difference between the first and the second stimuli for each interstimulus interval&#xD;
                will give rise to the recovery curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nociceptive component of Withdrawal reflex (RIIIr): The RIIIr wil be elicited by&#xD;
                delivering percutaneous electrical stimulation on sural nerve (behind the right&#xD;
                lateral malleolus) and recording responses from the ipsilateral brevis head of the&#xD;
                biceps femoris muscle. For the reflex threshold (RT) record, the initial current&#xD;
                intensity will be adjusted to 2 mA and increased on steps of 1 mA, until obtain a&#xD;
                response of at least 20 µV, accompanied by pain report. Then, 5 stimulus (130% RT)&#xD;
                will be applied to obtain the latency and area average. Besides, pain perception&#xD;
                will be controlled through an analogue scale graded from 0 (without perception of&#xD;
                pain) to 10 points (greater pain already felt).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. tsDCS: transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation will be delivered through a direct current&#xD;
           (DC) stimulator (NeuroConn Plus, Germany) using a pair of saline-soaked sponge&#xD;
           electrodes (35cm²). The active electrode (anode or cathode) will be placed between the&#xD;
           eleventh and the twelfth thoracic vertebra) and the reference electrode, over the right&#xD;
           arm (deltoid muscle). Will be delivered a current intensity of 2.5 mA, fade in and fade&#xD;
           out of 10 seconds, during 20 minutes. Sham tsDCS has been used in several studies to&#xD;
           evaluate active tsDCS effects. Sham tsDCS will be applied using the same electrodes&#xD;
           placement and parameter settings of anodal tsDCS however, stimulation will last only 30&#xD;
           seconds but the volunteers will continue with electrodes montage for 20 minutes.Thus,&#xD;
           early sensations (eg. mild to moderate tingling or itch) on stimulation site will be&#xD;
           experienced without inducing any modulatory effects. Moreover, after each tsDCS session,&#xD;
           an adverse effects questionnaire will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. rTMS: Initially, the higher cortical representation area (hotspot) of first right dorsal&#xD;
           interosseous (FDI) muscle will be determined through a figure-eight coil connected to&#xD;
           the magnetic stimulator (Rapid2, Magstim, UK) held manually and positioned over the&#xD;
           scalp (C3 - 10/20 System) at an angle of 45 degrees from the midline pointed to the&#xD;
           target muscle (FDI). Thereafter, RMT will be measure. rTMS protocols was based on&#xD;
           previous studies. Low frequency protocol: 1 hertz (Hz), 90% RMT, 1500 stimuli (1 train).&#xD;
           High frequency protocol: 20 Hz, 90% RMT, 45 trains, 40 stimuli per train, inter interval&#xD;
           of 28 seconds, 1800 stimuli. Sham rTMS will be performed with low frequency protocol&#xD;
           using two coils. The first one - connected to the stimulator - will be positioned on a&#xD;
           coil support close to the volunteer but not visible. Therefore, characteristic&#xD;
           stimulation noises will be audible. The second - disconnected to the stimulator - will&#xD;
           be placed over left primary motor area. After each rTMS session, presence of adverse&#xD;
           effects will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Gait training: It consists of moderate gait training exercise for 20 minutes. To ensure&#xD;
           that the exercise will be performed at moderate intensity will be used the 64% - 76% of&#xD;
           maximum heart rate (HRmax = 220-age). Heart rate will be monitored every three minutes&#xD;
           through a heart polar. In addition will be monitored perceived effort, gait speed and&#xD;
           incline of the treadmill. The Borg scale will be used to evaluate perceived effort. This&#xD;
           is an analogue scale graded from 6 (light exercise) to 20 points (exhaustive exercise).&#xD;
           Information about the exercise on the treadmill will be noted in the evolution record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Spinal cord activity: this evaluation will be performed immediately after (T0), thirty&#xD;
           minutes after (T1) and 1 hour after (T2) the gait training. The procedures will be&#xD;
           conducted following the same protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Cortical brain activity: this evaluation will be performed after each revaluation of&#xD;
           spinal cord activity (T0, T1 and T2). The procedures will be conducted following the&#xD;
           same protocol.&#xD;
