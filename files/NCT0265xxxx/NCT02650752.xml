  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if capecitabine can be taken safely with different doses&#xD;
      of lapatinib in patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer involving brain (brain metastases)&#xD;
      and/or in spinal fluid (leptomeningeal disease).&#xD;

    <description>During the standard 3+3, the probability that dose escalation will occur at any stage during MTD determination is a function of the underlying DLT rate at the current dose level. This probability can be calculated as the sum of the binomial probabilities of the following two outcomes that would permit escalation to occur:&#xD;
No DLT observed in the first three patients.&#xD;
One DLT is observed in the first three patients followed by no DLT observed in three additional patients at the same dose level.</description>

    <description>A minimum of one patient at each dose level will be enrolled. Patients will receive a 4 week treatment cycle consisting of lapatinib 3 day on/11 day off in tandem with capecitabine 7 day on/7 day off with lapatinib. Both drugs will be administered orally as outpatient. Safety, toxicity, and DLT will be assessed weekly during the cycle 1 (first 4 weeks). Each patient will be monitored during cycle 1 prior to enrolling the next patient to the next higher dose level. Dose escalation will take place if no DLT or less than two occurrences of grade 2 toxicity (except those listed below) is observed within a given patient. In the event that a second instance of separate grade 2 toxicity (except those listed below) is noted, the cohort will be expanded to 3 patients at the same dose level and the study will revert to the standard 3+3 design with 3 patients per cohort. There will be no intra-patient dose escalation.</description>
