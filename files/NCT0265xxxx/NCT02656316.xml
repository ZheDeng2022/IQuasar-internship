      The current RCT aims to establish the therapeutic potential of tDCS for freezing of gait&#xD;
      (FOG) and motor-cognitive dysfunctions in PD. As noted, FOG is often unresponsive to&#xD;
      pharmacological and other treatments, especially in the advanced stages of the disease. While&#xD;
      it is likely that tDCS will provide symptomatic relief, we will also explore, via secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, the potential for tDCS to modify disease progression. Support for this possibility&#xD;

      The current study aim to establish the therapeutic potential of tDCS for freezing of gait&#xD;
      (FOG) and motor-cognitive dysfunctions in Parkinson's Disease (PD). FOG phenomenon is often&#xD;
      unresponsive to pharmacological and other treatments, especially in the advanced stages of&#xD;
      the disease. While it is likely that Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) will&#xD;
      provide symptomatic relief, we will also explore, via secondary outcomes, the potential for&#xD;
      tDCS to modify disease progression. Support for this possibility stems from the likely&#xD;
      mechanisms of action of tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on strong rationale and preliminary findings in previous works, the objectives of the&#xD;
      current proposal are to conduct a prospective multi-center, double-blinded, stratified&#xD;
      controlled randomized clinical trial, comparing real multifocal tDCS to sham stimulation. The&#xD;
      main aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To demonstrate the &quot;short-term&quot; and the longer-term effects of tDCS on FOG severity and&#xD;
      frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: A total of 85 patients will be recruited (Hoehn and Yahr Stage 1-3.5) who&#xD;
      suffer from FOG, as measured by the new FOG questionnaire (NFOG-Q) and as demonstrated in&#xD;
      response to a FOG provoking protocol, who are on stable medications, who have no&#xD;
      contraindications to tDCS, and who are between the ages of 40-80. Patients with DBS will not&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS intervention: Subjects will be randomized to receive either a real or sham tDCS&#xD;
      intervention. Each intervention will consist of 10, 20-minute treatments completed over 2&#xD;
      consecutive weeks (i.e., 5 per week), following previously established protocols. A single,&#xD;
      weekly &quot;maintenance&quot; treatment will then be provided for the following 12 weeks (note: for&#xD;
      depression, maintenance tDCS is most often provided once every two weeks; we will take a more&#xD;
      conservative approach here in this first long-term study for FOG in PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue taking their regular medications, and treatments will take place&#xD;
      in the &quot;ON&quot; medication state (approximately at the same time of day for each treatment). The&#xD;
      real tDCS intervention will simultaneously target both the M1 leg area and the the&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), in the brain hemisphere contralateral to the more&#xD;
      affected side of the body, as determined by the summation of the motor symptoms on The&#xD;
      unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS). Current will be applied using an array of 8&#xD;
      sponge electrodes and the StarStim tDCS device and software (Neuroelectrics, Inc). For this&#xD;
      protocol, the placement and current delivered through each electrode has been optimized using&#xD;
      the Neuroelectrics StimWeaver® Stimulation Optimization Service . In case of bilateral&#xD;
      symptom symmetry, tDCS will target the left M1 and DLPFC. For the sham intervention, the same&#xD;
      electrode placement and stimulation parameters will be used; however, current will only be&#xD;
      applied for the first 60 seconds of the stimulation session. This is a reliable control as&#xD;
      sensations arising from tDCS diminish considerably after the first minute of stimulation. At&#xD;
      the end of each treatment session, participants will complete a short questionnaire to assess&#xD;
      potential side-effects. At the end of the entire intervention, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      state if, in their opinion, they received the real or sham intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome will be the number of FOG episodes measured in the lab&#xD;
      when subjects undergo a validated FOG-invoking protocol, after the initial 2-week&#xD;
      intervention and at the final study point, similar to that proposed by Ziegler et al.&#xD;
      Briefly, this protocol includes situations that have been shown to provoke FOG. Patients will&#xD;
      be asked to sit, to stand up and to walk to a a mark on the floor. They will perform two 360°&#xD;
      turns, clockwise and counter-clockwise. Then, the patients will be asked to open a door and&#xD;
      walk through it, turn outside, and come back to their chair. Secondary outcomes of FOG will&#xD;
      include FOG duration and the new FOG questionnaire (NFOG-Q). This FOG-provoking protocol will&#xD;
      take place in both the ON and OFF medication state and higher values (worse) of FOG will be&#xD;
      used as the primary outcome measure (in secondary analyses, we will examine ON and OFF FOG&#xD;
      separately).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional secondary measures will test the influence of tDCS on other motor, cognitive or&#xD;
      motor-cognitive functions related to PD and FOG. Secondary outcomes related to motor&#xD;
      function, which are likely to be affected by changes in M1 excitability, will include gait&#xD;
      speed (usual walking), Timed Up &amp; Go scores, UPDRS motor scores, and level of activity over 7&#xD;
      days using portable, lightweight, water-proof sensors. Secondary measures of executive&#xD;
      function, which are hypothesized to be responsive to tDCS of the DLPFC, will include the&#xD;
      Trail Making test (TMT) parts A and B, and a previously validated computerized&#xD;
      neuropsychological battery that provides normalized scores for executive function and&#xD;
      attention (and memory). Dual-tasking gait speed (i.e., walking while performing a serial&#xD;
      subtraction test) will assess motor-cognitive interactions. Functional near infra-red&#xD;
      spectroscopy (available in Boston and Tel Aviv) will assess frontal activation during&#xD;
      dual-tasking walking; this reflects the subjects ability to handle cognitive loading and has&#xD;
      been associated with FOG. Finally, the PDQ-39 will evaluate quality of life.&#xD;
