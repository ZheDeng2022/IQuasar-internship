      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of long-term non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in stable chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (CHRF) has&#xD;
      recently been shown to improve survival and quality of life when applied with sufficiently&#xD;
      high inspiratory pressures and adequate backup breathing frequencies (so called&#xD;
      high-intensity NIV). However, for a broader implementation of this therapy in a potentially&#xD;
      large group of patients, important issues have to be solved. First, the initiation of&#xD;
      high-intensity NIV, currently performed in the hospital, is often time-consuming, expensive&#xD;
      and inconvenient for patients. Secondly, although clinicians recognise that not all patients&#xD;
      benefit, it is not known which factors predict a positive response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether home initiation of chronic NIV in stable COPD patients with CHRF&#xD;
           is non-inferior to inpatient initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate predictors of a favourable response to chronic NIV in COPD patients with&#xD;
           CHRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is 1:1 two-arm parallel group randomised controlled trial comparing the usual&#xD;
      inpatient NIV initiation to home initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Seventy-two COPD patients with a NIV indication (COPD GOLD stage III or IV;&#xD;
      partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) &gt; 6.0 kPa in stable condition, i.e. no COPD&#xD;
      exacerbation for 4 weeks and a pH &gt; 7.35), a sufficient social network at home, without&#xD;
      severe cardiac comorbidities, will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Home initiation of NIV will be compared with standard in-hospital initiation.&#xD;
      NIV at home will be titrated by a specialised nurse of our home mechanical ventilation centre&#xD;
      (HMV) on transcutaneously measured gas exchange and respiratory electromyography and will be&#xD;
      adjusted with the use of telemedicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate non-inferiority of home initiation, the change in arterial carbon dioxide&#xD;
           pressure after 3 months treatment will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are&#xD;
           safety, change in lung function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate predictors of a favourable response, patient demographics, and baseline&#xD;
           data on lung function as well as measures of respiratory muscle activity, arterial blood&#xD;
           gases, comorbidities, inflammatory blood markers and anxiety and depressions scores will&#xD;
           be collected of all patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a chronic disease with high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Patients with&#xD;
      end-stage COPD frequently develop CHRF associated with end-of-life. In that stage of disease,&#xD;
      treatment options are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term nocturnal NIV has been applied in patients with chronic alveolar hypoventilation&#xD;
      for decades. While there is no doubt that applying chronic nocturnal NIV improves outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with restrictive and neuromuscular diseases, the evidence in COPD patients has long&#xD;
      been controversial. At the HMV centre Groningen, the majority of patients treated with NIV&#xD;
      therefore still concerns patients with neuromuscular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial trials investigating chronic NIV in COPD showed no relevant benefits, neither in&#xD;
      terms of improvement in gas exchange nor in improvements in patient-centred outcomes as&#xD;
      HRQoL.However, most of these trials used low inspiratory pressures so that improvement of&#xD;
      alveolar hypoventilation was not or only partially achieved. Consequently, little improvement&#xD;
      in clinical outcomes could be expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 10 years ago, the concept of high-intensity NIV in COPD was introduced. By applying&#xD;
      higher inspiratory pressures and breathing frequencies aimed at a more controlled form of&#xD;
      ventilation and improvement in gas exchange, clinically relevant improvements in HRQoL and&#xD;
      lung function were observed, without undue loss of patient comfort. Recently, a German group&#xD;
      conclusively showed that high-intensity NIV improves survival in severe COPD patients with&#xD;
      CHRF. These positive results with high-intensity NIV have changed our view towards the use of&#xD;
      chronic NIV in stable COPD. Nowadays, the investigators believe that the evidence for&#xD;
      long-term nocturnal NIV is convincing and justifies the application of this therapy in&#xD;
      patients with severe stable COPD patients with CHRF. Nevertheless, for a broader&#xD;
      implementation of this treatment in a potentially large group of severe COPD patients,&#xD;
      important issues have to be solved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the current inpatient NIV initiation process has to be reconsidered, which despite&#xD;
      tight titration based on arterial blood gases, does not always lead to good patient&#xD;
      compliance, is inconvenient for patients and is expensive. While it might be thought that&#xD;
      high-intensity NIV necessitates inpatient titration to gain adequate reversal of&#xD;
      hypoventilation, different in hospital set ups of NIV initiation (on a general ward, medium&#xD;
      care unit or on an intensive care unit), with different ways of titration (guided by&#xD;
      transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtCO2) or arterial blood gases (PaCO2)), have not resulted in&#xD;
      different outcomes or a different compliance at the long-term. Also, these inpatient options&#xD;
      are expensive as initiation of NIV in COPD routinely requires 5-14 days. Recently, our group&#xD;
      of the HMV centre Groningen has shown that, in patients with neuromuscular and restrictive&#xD;
      thoracic diseases, initiation of NIV can safely be performed at home. Initiation of NIV at&#xD;
      home was preferred by the patients, was equally effective and saved costs compared to&#xD;
      inpatient initiation. Importantly, COPD patients have been excluded in this randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT), as at the start of that study chronic NIV in COPD was not considered&#xD;
      a regular standard treatment option in the Netherlands. Furthermore, initiation of NIV in&#xD;
      COPD patients at that time was thought to be probably too difficult to be performed at home,&#xD;
      because high-intensity NIV is needed in this patient group to improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, challenges with the initiation of high-intensity NIV require attention, but do not&#xD;
      necessarily have to be solved in-hospital. On the one hand, patients with COPD need higher&#xD;
      inspiratory pressures and higher backup breathing frequencies as it is more difficult to&#xD;
      correct alveolar hypoventilation in lung parenchyma diseases compared to diseases in which&#xD;
      the lungs are not primarily affected, such as in neuromuscular disease. On the other hand,&#xD;
      the investigators believe that careful high-intensity NIV initiation and titration should not&#xD;
      only focus on maximal improvement in PaCO2 but also on patient comfort. The consequence of&#xD;
      high-intensity might be that COPD patients need even more time and attention from caregivers&#xD;
      to get used to the high pressures and high backup frequencies before our target can be&#xD;
      reached, i.e. improvement in gas exchange and respiratory muscle unloading, before the&#xD;
      conditions also for a good long-term compliance can be satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finding the individual high-intensity setting leading to sufficient improvement in objective&#xD;
      physiological parameters is challenging in this group of patients. This process therefore&#xD;
      probably requires more frequent and more intensive monitoring. At home, the investigators&#xD;
      will optimise monitoring of the patients with the use of frequent non-invasive monitoring of&#xD;
      gas exchange with transcutaneous measurements (SenTec DM®, Software V-STATS 4.0; SenTec AG;&#xD;
      Therwil, Switzerland). Secondly, analysis of data read from the ventilator software&#xD;
      (Respironics Trilogy 202®, Philips, the Netherlands) will be used to provide information&#xD;
      about compliance and the actual provided ventilation. Finally, the investigators will aid&#xD;
      measurements of respiratory muscle activity by means of surface electromyography (EMG) as a&#xD;
      relatively new tool which can aid in optimising NIV initiation. Surface EMG is a new tool&#xD;
      that might help to optimise NIV initiation. It has been shown that especially high-intensity&#xD;
      NIV is able to unload the respiratory muscles (Duiverman, work in progress).This might&#xD;
      importantly add to the achievement of clinical relevant benefits. Until now, no studies have&#xD;
      used non-invasive measurements of respiratory muscle unloading to optimise initiation of NIV.&#xD;
      In the last decade, I have developed and validated a surface EMG technique for use in COPD&#xD;
      patients, measuring respiratory muscle activity as a surrogate of respiratory neural drive&#xD;
      and thus muscle loading. As this method is non-invasive, it can easily be applied at home.&#xD;
      Furthermore, surface EMG can be used to asses patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA). Especially&#xD;
      with higher inspiratory pressures and/or high breathing frequencies PVA may arise.PVA is&#xD;
      important as it leads to increased work of breathing, decreased patient comfort and less&#xD;
      effective ventilation. During the traditional in-hospital NIV initiation, one might suggest&#xD;
      that an indication of respiratory muscle (un)loading and patient-ventilator synchrony is&#xD;
      received through observation of the patient. However, observation by the respiratory nurses&#xD;
      is mostly of limited time and detects only events leading to a huge excess of respiratory&#xD;
      muscle loading, such as during severe PVA. During home initiation, direct observation is far&#xD;
      less easy and less frequent. In concordance with a recent study showing that parasternal EMG&#xD;
      can be used to assess PVA in a mixed group of patients initiated on home NIV, the&#xD;
      investigators have shown in a recent pilot project that also our surface EMG is feasible to&#xD;
      measure respiratory muscle unloading and detect PVA, of note, during different settings, also&#xD;
      high-intensity NIV (submitted work). As the use of surface EMG for optimising NIV initiation&#xD;
      is relatively new, the investigators will extend the monitoring of patients in both groups&#xD;
      including surface EMG as a surrogate marker of respiratory muscle unloading and to detect PVA&#xD;
      during NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second issue, the necessity for acclimatisation time and caregiver attention, very&#xD;
      elegant solutions are available to provide this at home too. A longer initiation period can&#xD;
      better be met at home, in a trusted environment for the patient, saving the disadvantages and&#xD;
      costs of a prolonged hospital stay. With modern technologies the necessary caregiver&#xD;
      attention can also be provided at home. Monitoring data can be sent to caregivers on daily&#xD;
      basis by telemonitoring. This proven technology enables caregivers to make on daily basis, on&#xD;
      distance, decisions regarding the NIV initiation process, which will be discussed with the&#xD;
      patient by frequent telephone calls. This so called telemedicine has already been shown to be&#xD;
      a valuable and promising tool to monitor and to adjust treatment of patients already&#xD;
      established on chronic NIV at home. In our home NIV initiation pilot project in neuromuscular&#xD;
      patients, the investigators were the first to show in a RCT that this technology was very&#xD;
      feasible to use for NIV initiation at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second important issue to be solved regards better patient selection. By collecting the&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up data of the COPD patients initiated on NIV, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      find predictors of a favourable response to NIV. It is known, from clinical practice and from&#xD;
      studies, that not all patients respond favourably. Until now, data have shown that patients&#xD;
      with CHRF benefit. Furthermore, benefits at least in terms of improvement in gas exchange,&#xD;
      seem to be more prominent in patients with severe stable hypercapnia. In contrast, our group&#xD;
      has shown that patients that remain hypercapnic after an exacerbation do not uniformly&#xD;
      benefit. An individual COPD phenotype benefiting most from this demanding therapy has not&#xD;
      been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to investigate whether home initiation of chronic NIV in&#xD;
      stable COPD patients with CHRF is non-inferior to inpatient initiation in terms of&#xD;
      improvement in PaCO2 after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are change in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1),&#xD;
      lung volumes (total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV) and RV%TLC), and diffusion&#xD;
      capacity (DLCO (%predicted)), change in HRQoL, and costs including cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to collect patient demographics (age, weight, height,&#xD;
      social status, HRQoL, anxiety and depression scores, data on comorbidities and medication&#xD;
      use), respiratory function (lung function as well as measures of respiratory muscle activity,&#xD;
      arterial blood gases), and inflammatory blood markers, in order to analyse how differences in&#xD;
      baseline parameters are related to changes in HRQoL.&#xD;
