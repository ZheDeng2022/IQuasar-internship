    <textblock>
      Bystander interventions, recognized as promising violence prevention strategies, are unique&#xD;
      in their engagement of all community members to 1) recognize situations that may become&#xD;
      violent and 2) learn to safely and effectively intervene to reduce violence risk. Based on&#xD;
      their promise, the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act (SaVE) now requires all&#xD;
      publicly-funded colleges to provide bystander intervention. With SaVE's policy intervention&#xD;
      requiring bystander interventions, a &quot;natural experiment&quot; has arisen to determine the&#xD;
      relative efficacy of students' bystander training across multiple colleges. Investigators&#xD;
      propose a quasi-experimental design (using fractional factorials) to evaluate the relative&#xD;
      efficacy of three bystander interventions to reduce violence in college communities. Green&#xD;
      Dot will be one of three bystander interventions evaluated. A recent rigorous evaluation has&#xD;
      found that Green Dot is associated with a 20-40% reduction in VAW in college and high school&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In aim 1, investigators will compare the relative efficacy of bystander interventions to a)&#xD;
      increase bystander efficacy and behaviors, b) reduce violence acceptance, c) reduce&#xD;
      interpersonal violence victimization and perpetration, and d) increase program cost&#xD;
      effectiveness. The three main bystander groups compared will be: exclusively online training,&#xD;
      Green Dot (speeches and intensive bystander training), and other skills-based bystander&#xD;
      training. Program efficacy data will be obtained from student surveys, campus crime&#xD;
      statistics, and surveys with college staff and administrators responsible for selecting and&#xD;
      implementing bystander interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In aim 2, investigators seek to grow communities of VAW prevention researchers. Researcher&#xD;
      communities will form through researchers' engagement with college recruitment, survey&#xD;
      design, data collection and analyses. Specifically investigators will determine the efficacy&#xD;
      of this program to increase VAW prevention research productivity defined as a) increasing&#xD;
      research skills and b) increasing research communications measured as manuscript submissions,&#xD;
      presentations, and publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This natural experiment will generate new understanding into efficacy of how bystander&#xD;
      programs work. This natural experiment will also provide the VAW research community an&#xD;
      opportunity to increase our skill-sets and share our experiences with and help grow the next&#xD;
      generation of VAW prevention researchers.&#xD;

      A. SPECIFIC AIMS Goal 1. Grow Colleges as Communities for Primary Prevention of Violence&#xD;
      Against Women Research The opportunity: Because the 2013 Campus Sexual Violence Elimination&#xD;
      Act1 (SaVE) now requires bystander training in all publicly funded colleges and universities&#xD;
      (hereafter colleges), a &quot;natural experiment&quot; presents itself to determine what components of&#xD;
      bystander interventions have greater efficacy. Inclusion of multiple college communities&#xD;
      (n=24) provides sufficient statistical power for these comparisons. The timing of this U01&#xD;
      (RFA-CE-15-003) is strategically important for the work investigators propose: to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of bystander interventions components (BIC) to reduce violence against women&#xD;
      (VAW: operationally defined as intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence (SV)).&#xD;
      Investigators propose a quasi-experimental design using fractional factorials. Data to&#xD;
      measure program efficacy for bystander and violent behavior outcomes will be obtained from&#xD;
      student surveys and campus crime data. Key informant interviews with college administrators&#xD;
      responsible for selection and implementation of bystander programs will describe components&#xD;
      and attributes of bystander programs important for colleges' adoption, implementation and&#xD;
      retention of bystander programs over the 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this quasi-experimental, multi-college study is to evaluate the relative&#xD;
      efficacy of newly implemented bystander interventions over time. Because all colleges must&#xD;
      adopt an intervention, comparisons will be made prospectively before and after implementation&#xD;
      and across program interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Compare the relative efficacy of bystander interventions to a) increase bystander&#xD;
      efficacy and behaviors, b) reduce violence acceptance, c) reduce violence victimization and&#xD;
      perpetration, and d) increase program cost effectiveness. Three BIC comparisons will be:&#xD;
      exclusively online training, Green Dot, and other skills-based, interactive bystander&#xD;
      programs. Whether training is mandatory will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Relative to colleges implementing exclusively online training, colleges&#xD;
      implementing Green Dot (or other skills-based programs) will significantly a) increase&#xD;
      bystander efficacy and behaviors, b) reduce violence acceptance, c) reduce violence&#xD;
      victimization and perpetration, and d) demonstrate greater cost effectiveness to reduce VAW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal 2. Grow Communities of Violence Against Women Prevention Researchers The opportunity:&#xD;
      This &quot;natural experiment&quot; also offers a unique opportunity for more senior VAW prevention&#xD;
      researchers to share their expertise with each other and with more junior researchers, i.e.&#xD;
      grow a researcher community. Team science is increasingly required in violence prevention&#xD;
      research yet funding mechanisms supporting cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary career&#xD;
      development grants in violence prevention are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose: Investigators propose a researcher community collaborative to grow the next&#xD;
      generation of VAW researchers. Through engaging multiple public universities as our research&#xD;
      community partners (Goal 1), investigators have the added opportunity to partner as a&#xD;
      researcher community to both a) conduct better research because a broader skill-set can be&#xD;
      engaged and b) share our research skill-sets with more junior researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Determine the efficacy of this collaborative to increase VAW prevention researchers'&#xD;
      productivity defined as a) research skills and b) research communications measured as&#xD;
      manuscript submissions, presentations, and publications. Both senior and junior researchers&#xD;
      will be members of this collaborative and included in prospective qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Participation within research communities will, over time, increase research&#xD;
      productivity for both senior and more junior collaborative members relative to their&#xD;
      productivity prior to study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 1) This study will identify components of bystander programs associated with greater&#xD;
      violence prevention efficacy and greater cost-effectiveness. Currently colleges have limited&#xD;
      data or experience to make informed decisions regarding selecting a bystander intervention,&#xD;
      now required by SaVE. With the range of bystander program comparisons afforded by including&#xD;
      up to 24 multiple college communities, investigators will have the ability to measure&#xD;
      relative bystander program efficacy (which programs are associated with the greater reduction&#xD;
      in violence), which programs are associated with lower program implementation costs, and the&#xD;
      programs associated with the lower cost to violence reduction ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 2) As both senior and junior researchers are engaged in college recruitment,&#xD;
      mixed-method data collection, and data analyses, research skill-sets will be shared such that&#xD;
      senior researchers learn newer research approaches and junior researchers learn skills in&#xD;
      survey design and conduct, measurement and surveying on sensitive topics), data analyses, and&#xD;
      research communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benchmarks for Success will be measured: [Aim 1] as our ability to recruit 24 colleges,&#xD;
      conduct key informant interviews and annual undergraduate surveys, and final analyses by Fall&#xD;
      2019; and [Aim 2] by our ability, as a collaborative, to recruit and retain VAW prevention&#xD;
      researchers from identified colleges and provide mentoring and training needed to advance&#xD;
      their research skills.&#xD;
