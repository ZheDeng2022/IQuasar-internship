    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open-label pilot study to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of a single dose administered as spilt fractions of autologous T cells expressing CD22&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptors expressing tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ/4-1BB) co-stimulatory&#xD;
      domains (referred to as &quot;CART22&quot; cells) in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of three sequential phases: 1) a screening phase, 2) a manufacturing&#xD;
      and pre- treatment phase, consisting of apheresis (if applicable) and chemotherapy (if&#xD;
      applicable), and 3) a treatment phase, consisting of a CART22 transfused cell infusion and&#xD;
      follow up evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent, patients will undergo screening tests and procedures to&#xD;
      determine eligibility. Once patient eligibility is confirmed, patients will have cells&#xD;
      collected by leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for CART22&#xD;
      manufacturing, unless adequate numbers of cells are available from a prior apheresis. Cells&#xD;
      will be transduced with the anti-CD22 TCRζ/4-1BB lentiviral vector, expanded in vitro and&#xD;
      then frozen for future administration. Cryopreserved historical apheresis products collected&#xD;
      from the patient prior to study entry are usable for CART22 manufacturing if collected at an&#xD;
      appropriately certified apheresis center and the product meets adequate mononuclear cell&#xD;
      yields. If a historical apheresis product is not available, an apheresis procedure will be&#xD;
      scheduled for cell procurement after study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unless contraindicated and medically not advisable based on previous chemotherapy, patients&#xD;
      will be given conditioning chemotherapy prior to CART22 cell infusion with the intent of&#xD;
      lymphodepletion. Additionally, if the patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is ≤ 1,000 /uL,&#xD;
      conditioning/lymphodepleting chemotherapy is NOT required. The chemotherapy will be planned&#xD;
      so that the last dose is completed 1-4 days BEFORE the planned infusion of CART22 cells. The&#xD;
      chemotherapy start date will vary based on the duration of the selected chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
      If the period from chemotherapy to CART22 infusion is delayed 4 or more weeks, the patient&#xD;
      will need to be re-treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CART22 infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll 15 evaluable patients for the primary safety endpoint analysis. Primary safety&#xD;
      evaluable patients are those who have received any CART22 cells. The first three subjects&#xD;
      infused with CART22 will be staggered by 14 days to allow for monitoring of adverse events,&#xD;
      including CRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with a manufactured cell dose that is less than the protocol-specified dose will be&#xD;
      scored as a manufacturing failure. These subjects will receive their cell infusion, provided&#xD;
      that all other manufacturing release criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have blood tests to assess CART22 safety, engraftment and persistence at&#xD;
      regular intervals throughout the study (Visit Evaluation Schedule in Appendix 1). Circulating&#xD;
      CART22 T cells subsets will be assessed at various times after infusion. CART22 trafficking&#xD;
      will be assessed in bone marrow aspirates, and other tissues, if available. Follow up is&#xD;
      planned at a minimum of weekly for 4 weeks, monthly for 6 months, then patients will be&#xD;
      followed quarterly for the remainder of the year to obtain a medical history, undergo a&#xD;
      physical examination, and blood tests. Additional samples collections and assessments between&#xD;
      schedule visits after CART22 cell infusion will be performed as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these evaluations, patients will enter a roll-over study for long term follow-up&#xD;
      for up to an additional fourteen years to assess for safety assessments per the FDA&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
