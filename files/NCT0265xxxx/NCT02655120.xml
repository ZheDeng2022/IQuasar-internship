      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the injection of bone&#xD;
      marrow unconcentrated more R BMP 7 to repair necrosis of the femoral head with stage I-III&#xD;
      classification FICAT.&#xD;

      Rationale and Objectives Epiphyseal necrosis are common in young adults (2000 new cases per&#xD;
      year in the Nord Pas -de- Calais region) resulting in severe functional impairment and&#xD;
      disability . Drilling is the procedure most simple, but its effectiveness and safety are&#xD;
      discussed ( fracture risk , long discharge period , success rates below 50 % until stage&#xD;
      III). However, it can be optimized in two ways: 1) reducing morbidity and discharge period by&#xD;
      reducing the diameter of the channel and percutaneous achievement , 2 ) increase efficiency ,&#xD;
      including coverage contribution of stem cells and osteogenic hormone . The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to test the effectiveness of the contribution of these elements to the healing&#xD;
      necrosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material, Method, and primary endpoint This is a prospective multicenter clinical trial&#xD;
      randomized double-blind . The effect of addition of autologous bone marrow stem cells and&#xD;
      BMP7 on healing necrosis is assessed by magnetic resonance imaging ( NMRI ) and is the&#xD;
      primary endpoint . Patients are randomly assigned to two arms : 1 ) Group I: a simple&#xD;
      drilling is practiced , 2 ) Group II : the drilling is completed by a joint supply of&#xD;
      autologous marrow unconcentrated and recombinant BMP7 ( OP1 ) . Necrosis of the femoral head&#xD;
      with stage I to III are retained Ficat (only stage III with a recess of less than 3 mm are&#xD;
      used , corresponding I-III according to Steinberg ) . Forty patients are included in each arm&#xD;
      . A IRMN practiced preoperatively and at 6 months and 2 years. Clinical evaluation will be&#xD;
      continued up to 5 years in testing the survival rate ( criterion censorship = recovery by hip&#xD;
      ) Expected results and possible implications In terms of radiological stabilization ( NMRI )&#xD;
      the effectiveness of single drilling necrosis stage I to III Ficat is 60 % ( non-&#xD;
      stabilization or worsening of size). The hypothesis tested is a gain stabilization ( and / or&#xD;
      recovery) of 20 % . The clinical efficacy of single drilling necrosis stage I to III Ficat is&#xD;
      estimated at 50 % (50% recovery by prosthesis in 5 years) . The assumption is a 20%&#xD;
      improvement in the rate of success of the intervention . Reducing morbidity due to technical&#xD;
      modifications has been previously tested. If the assumption of success is reached, the&#xD;
      indications of drilling could be reinforced especially for patients with multiple visceral&#xD;
      defects usually supported on the websites of University Hospital of Lille and Amiens and CH&#xD;
      Roubaix ( organ transplant or tissue , ethyl , .. ) .&#xD;
