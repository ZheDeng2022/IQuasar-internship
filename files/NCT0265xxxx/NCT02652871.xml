  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of LY2510924 in&#xD;
      combination with cytarabine and idarubicin in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. We&#xD;
      will also study if LY2510924 in combination with cytarabine and idarubicin can help to&#xD;
      control relapsed or refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LY2510924 is designed to help cancer cells move from the bone marrow into the bloodstream,&#xD;
      where they are exposed to chemotherapy (in this case, cytarabine and idarubicin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. LY2510924 is not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      Its use in this study is investigational. Cytarabine and idarubicin are approved to treat&#xD;
      certain types of leukemia. Their use in this study in combination with LY2510924 is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 36 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 3 groups of up to 6 participants each will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the Dose Escalation part of the study, and up to 18 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      in Dose Expansion part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Dose Escalation part of the study, the dose of LY2510924 you&#xD;
      receive will depend on when you join this study. The first group of participants will receive&#xD;
      the lowest dose level of LY2510924. Each new group will receive a higher dose of LY2510924&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of LY2510924 is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Dose Expansion part of the study, you will receive LY2510924 at&#xD;
      the highest dose that was tolerated in the Dose Expansion part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also receive idarubicin and cytarabine. Your dose level will be&#xD;
      assigned based on your age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment on this study is given in 2 phases: Induction and Consolidation. Each phase is made&#xD;
      up of 28-day study cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive 1-2 cycles during the Induction phase. During Cycle 1, you will be admitted&#xD;
      to the inpatient Leukemia service when you receive the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive LY2510924 alone each day for 7 days and then together with chemotherapy on&#xD;
      Days 8, 9 and 10 and also on Day 11 if you are under the age of 60, of every 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On days that you do not receive idarubicin/cytarabine, LY2510924 will be given as an&#xD;
           injection under the skin at about 8:00 am (+/- 1½ hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On days when you do receive idarubicin/cytarabine, it will be given about 4 hours (+/- ½&#xD;
           hour) before you receive idarubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8 and 9, in addition to LY2510924:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive idarubicin by vein over about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive cytarabine by vein over about 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 10, in addition to LY2510924:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive cytarabine by vein over about 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are under age 60, you will receive idarubicin by vein over about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are under age 60, on Day 11, in addition to LY2510924, you will receive cytarabine by&#xD;
      vein over about 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days that you are receiving the cytarabine infusions, you will receive drugs to help&#xD;
      reduce the risk of side effects. You will receive dexamethasone before the cytarabine&#xD;
      infusion by vein over about 30 minutes. You will also receive corticosteroid-containing eye&#xD;
      drops during this time and for 2 days following the last dose of cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease does not respond during Cycle 1, you may be allowed to receive an additional&#xD;
      Induction cycle, which will also be called Cycle 1.If you do respond to Induction, you can&#xD;
      move to the Consolidation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are benefitting from the treatment, you may continue with Consolidation therapy for an&#xD;
      additional 4-6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these cycles, you will receive LY2510924 in the same way as during earlier cycles, for&#xD;
      3 days with chemotherapy. During Consolidation, all participants will receive idarubicin by&#xD;
      vein over 1 hour on Days 1 and 2, and cytarabine by vein over 24 hours on Days 1-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Days 1-12 of Cycle 1 (if over the age of 60, Days 1-10), blood (about 4 teaspoons)&#xD;
      will be drawn for routine tests. During Days 1-7, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn 4&#xD;
      hours after your injection with LY2510924 for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8 and 28 of Cycle 1, you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to check the status&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Day 11 of Cycle 1, blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn every 2-4 days for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 1-2 weeks during Cycles 2-6, blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2-4 weeks during Cycles 2-6, you will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Cycles 4 and 6, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to check the status&#xD;
      of the disease. You will also have an EKG and either an ECHO or MUGA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any time the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have additional blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 8 cycles of the study drugs. You will be taken off study if the disease&#xD;
      gets worse, you experience intolerable side effects, or if the study doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over after you complete the End-of-Treatment Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days (+/- 5 days) after your last dose of the study drugs, blood (about 2 teaspoons)&#xD;
      will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long Term Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2-3 months for up to 2 years after you stop receiving the study drugs, blood (about 4&#xD;
      teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This can be performed at your local doctor's&#xD;
      office. You should also have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy every 3 months for the first&#xD;
      year, and then more after that if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. If any of&#xD;
      these tests show abnormal results, you will return to the study clinic for follow-up testing.&#xD;
