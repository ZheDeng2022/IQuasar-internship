  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies in the past three decades have examined the beneficial effects of omega-3&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids in diet and supplementation. The effect of polyunsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids, specifically omega-3 and omega-6, on health have been well-studied but most of the&#xD;
      study to date has been on animal not plant sources and much less is know about their effects&#xD;
      on exercise performance. Additionally, while positive effects have been detected for&#xD;
      sedentary populations or those that are at risk, well-trained athletes generally have not had&#xD;
      established advantages in taking supplements for omega-3 and omega-6 oils. There is evidence&#xD;
      that a specific ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is most beneficial for the human body with&#xD;
      regards to cardiovascular and mental health. In this study, participants randomized to either&#xD;
      a plant supplement group (pureform omega; containing Flax, Evening Primrose, Sunflower,&#xD;
      Coconut &amp; Pumpkin oils; Natural Product Number = 80050660) or placebo (isoenergetic sugar&#xD;
      pills) will be subjected to both a time trial and a high intensity interval bout, where their&#xD;
      performance and power output will be analyzed. Blood lactate and glucose concentration, as&#xD;
      well as oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production will also be examined to determine&#xD;
      if there is a change in on fat oxidation after supplementation.&#xD;

      Double-blind placebo controlled study with two groups: a PUFA supplemented group (over 5&#xD;
      weeks) and a placebo (corn syrup) group. Participants are matched for initial exercise&#xD;
      performance and assigned to each of the two groups systematically so the initial group means&#xD;
      are similar. This is done by ranking all individuals from highest to lowest and assigning the&#xD;
      participant with the highest score randomly to the treatment group and the other to the&#xD;
      placebo group. Then, for the next two individuals in ranking, the highest of the two is&#xD;
      assigned to the placebo group and the other to the treatment group. This procedure is&#xD;
      repeated for all participant pairs. Of course, this is done separately for men and women&#xD;
      because on average the men have greater exercise performance scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage is 3.8 capsules/70kg body mass (rounded to the nearest capsule; 1 capsule contains&#xD;
      369mg PUFA from Flax, Evening Primrose, Pumpkin, Sunflower, and Coconut oil; &lt;4 Calories) or&#xD;
      isoenergetic placebo capsules (containing corn syrup) plus 2 capsules 20 minutes prior to&#xD;
      exercise workouts. Eighteen recreationally active student volunteers (18-35 years old) will&#xD;
      be recruited to complete 4 exercise tests: a cycle time trial (~15 minutes), a cycle maximal&#xD;
      power test (30 second Wingate test), a maximal aerobic power test (running treadmill test)&#xD;
      plus a strength/endurance test (number of bench presses with 60 kg load) pre- and post 5&#xD;
      weeks of daily supplementation. There will an accommodation day pre-study where each&#xD;
      participant is familiarized with the tests to be used. Each exercise test will be completed&#xD;
      on a separate day with at least 48 hours between each test day due to the fatiguing nature of&#xD;
      the testing.&#xD;
