    <textblock>
      This study will be looking at the effect of compression therapy in patients having endovenous&#xD;
      treatment for varicose veins using foam sclerotherapy. Patients will be randomised to either&#xD;
      the compression group (group A) or the no compression group (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain scores, compliance, quality of life scores, occlusion rate at 6 months as well as&#xD;
      the cost effectiveness of each intervention will be assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This will be a randomised clinical trial looking at the impact of wearing or not wearing&#xD;
      compression stocking following endovenous ablation using foam sclerotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to group A (compression) and group B (no compression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population Patients referred to the Imperial College NHS Trust for treatment of&#xD;
      symptomatic varicose veins will be recruited if they are found to have varicose veins&#xD;
      suitable for foam sclerotherapy on colour duplex scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to have compression (group A) or no compression (group B). This&#xD;
      will be done by using an online randomisation software (Sealed Envelope Ltd).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compression therapy used will be Class II compression stockings. The treatment offered&#xD;
      will be foam sclerotherapy of varicose veins using either Polidocanol or Sodium Tetradecyl&#xD;
      Sulphate (STS) with the concentration used left to the discretion of the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomised to group A will be asked to wear compression stockings for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomised to group B will be provided with bandages to wear for 24 hours only, with&#xD;
      no further compression afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, patients will be asked to fill validated quality of life questionnaires (EQ-5D,&#xD;
      AVVQ and CIVIQ) and will have their clinical scores assessed using a validated scoring system&#xD;
      (CEAP and VCSS). On discharge after their varicose vein intervention, they will then be&#xD;
      provided with a diary to record their post-procedural pain every day for 10 days using a&#xD;
      validated visual analogue scale (VAS) as well as to record when they return to their normal&#xD;
      activities and are back to work. They will also be asked to attend a follow-up in 2 weeks and&#xD;
      at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' GP will also be sent a letter to inform them of their patient's participation in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up in the outpatient clinic at 2 weeks and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up at 2 Weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 2 weeks' follow-up, the diary containing details of the pain scores and how soon&#xD;
      patients were able to return to normal activities/work will be collected. In addition,&#xD;
      patients will be asked about any phlebitis they have had in the two weeks after their&#xD;
      procedure and how compliant they have been with the compression. They will be examined and&#xD;
      the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) will be recorded. They will also be asked to fill&#xD;
      in the EQ-5D, AVVQ and CIVIQ scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up at 6 Months&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6 months follow-up, patients will be examined and their VCSS will be recorded. They&#xD;
      will also be asked to fill the EQ-5D, AVVQ and the CIVIQ scores. They will have a venous&#xD;
      Duplex scan to determine occlusion of the treated vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Study Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimated the sample size needed to observe a difference of at least 10mm in the VAS&#xD;
      score, with a standard deviation of 20mm. With power at 80% and 5% significance equivalence,&#xD;
      we would need to recruit 128 patients (64 per group) to show a difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies looking at compression stockings have shown drop out rates close to 37% at 3&#xD;
      months10. Therefore, if we estimate a drop out rate of about 40% by 6 months, we would need&#xD;
      to recruit at least 180 patients. If we recruit at least 2 patients per week, this will be&#xD;
      approximately a total of 208 patients that could potentially be randomised over the course of&#xD;
      two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 6 months follow-up, therefore, the study will be running for 24 months with a target&#xD;
      recruitment of 180 patients.&#xD;
