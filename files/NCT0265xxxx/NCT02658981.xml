      This phase I trial studies the safety and best dose of anti-LAG-3 (anti-LAG-3 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody BMS-986016) or urelumab alone and in combination with nivolumab in treating patients&#xD;
      with glioblastoma that has returned (recurrent). Anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016,&#xD;
      urelumab, and nivolumab are antibodies (a type of protein) that may stimulate the cells in&#xD;
      the immune system to attack tumor cells. It is not yet known whether anti-LAG-3 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody BMS-986016 or urelumab alone or in combination with nivolumab may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells. (The Anti-CD137 antibody (BMS-663513 - urelumab) treatment arm closed by BMS on&#xD;
      10/16/18 due to closure of BMS Urelumab development program. Subjects currently on treatment&#xD;
      may continue.)&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine a maximum tolerated dose or maximum administrated dose of anti-lymphocyte&#xD;
      activation gene-3 (LAG-3) antibody (BMS-986016) (anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016)&#xD;
      and anti-cluster of differentiation 137 (CD137) antibody (BMS- 663513) (urelumab) given&#xD;
      independently and in combination with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody (nivolumab,&#xD;
      BMS-936558) safely in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate overall survival. II. To estimate 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) rate.&#xD;
      III. To estimate radiographic response (radiographic assessment in neuro-oncology [RANO] and&#xD;
      immunotherapy response assessment for neuro-oncology [iRANO]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of anti-LAG-3 antibody (BMS-986016), anti-CD137&#xD;
      antibody (BMS- 663513), and/or anti-PD-1 antibody (BMS-936558) on biomarkers in peripheral&#xD;
      blood, including the T cell compartments, and serum proteins (cytokines and other immune&#xD;
      modulators).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the pharmacodynamic activity in tumor tissue and peripheral blood in treated&#xD;
      subjects who undergo optional tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore potential associations between biomarker measures and anti-tumor activity by&#xD;
      analyzing markers of inflammation, immune activation, host tumor growth factors, and&#xD;
      tumor-derived proteins in the pre-treatment and on-treatment setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To further characterize the occupancy and immune cell function at multiple dose levels of&#xD;
      anti-LAG-3 antibody (BMS-986016), anti-CD137 antibody (BMS-663513), and/or anti-PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      (BMS-936558).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore characteristics of tumor immune microenvironment changes after the treatment of&#xD;
      anti-LAG-3, anti-CD137, and its combination treatment with anti- PD-1 in surgically indicated&#xD;
      patients undergoing tumor resection&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART A: This is a dose-escalation study of the monotherapy of Anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      BMS-986016 and Anti-CD137 (urelumab). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 intravenously (IV) on days&#xD;
      1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive anti-CD137 (urelumab) IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for up to 15 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART B: This is the dose-escalation combination therapy portion study of Anti-LAG-3&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 plus Anti-PD-1(nivolumab) and Anti-CD137 (urelumab) plus&#xD;
      Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) IV over 60 minutes and anti-LAG-3 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody BMS-986016 IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 and&#xD;
      urelumab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2pts enrolled before the Anti-CD137 antibody (BMS-663513 - urelumab) treatment arm closed by&#xD;
      BMS on 10/16/18 due to closure of BMS Urelumab development program. Subjects currently on&#xD;
      treatment may continue.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRATUMORAL STUDIES: Patients enrolled on the Intratumoral Studies surgical arm&#xD;
      pre-operatively receive either anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 as in Part A Arm I,&#xD;
      urelumab as in as in Part A Arm II, nivolumab and anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016&#xD;
      as in Part B Arm I, or nivolumab and urelumab as in Part B Arm II. Within 45 days of surgical&#xD;
      resection, patients post-operatively receive either anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016&#xD;
      as in Part A Arm I, urelumab as in as in Part A Arm II, nivolumab and anti-LAG-3 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody BMS-986016 as in Part B Arm I, or nivolumab and urelumab as in Part B Arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3pts enrolled before the Anti-CD137 antibody (BMS-663513 - urelumab) treatment arm closed by&#xD;
      BMS on 10/16/18 due to closure of BMS Urelumab development program. Subjects currently on&#xD;
      treatment may continue.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60 days, every 2 months for&#xD;
      2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter. Patients taken off treatment for other reasons&#xD;
      than disease progression are followed up every 2 months for 1 year.&#xD;
