    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well talimogene laherparepvec works in treating patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer that has come back and cannot be removed by surgery. Biological therapies, such&#xD;
      as talimogene laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or&#xD;
      suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in inflammatory breast cancer or&#xD;
      non-inflammatory breast cancer patients with inoperable local recurrence measured by the&#xD;
      overall response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in inflammatory breast cancer or&#xD;
      non-inflammatory breast cancer patients with inoperable local recurrence measured by the&#xD;
      overall disease control rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the rate of local overall response and disease control rate,&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the rate of local overall response and disease control rate, PFS, and OS in&#xD;
      patients without distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the rate of local overall response and disease control rate, PFS, and OS in&#xD;
      patients with distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the safety of talimogene laherparepvec injection to local disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE STUDIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of talimogene laherparepvec on injection sites and distant&#xD;
      metastatic sites by evaluating immune function and apoptosis with immune cell surface markers&#xD;
      and cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess changes in the following: serum or plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12,&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon (IFN)- alpha; (Reuben's Lab); phenotype for&#xD;
      T-cell subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25) and natural killer cell (NK-cell) subsets (CD16, CD56),&#xD;
      which will be determined via multiparameter fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)&#xD;
      analysis (percentage and absolute numbers) in peripheral blood at Dr. James Reuben's&#xD;
      laboratory of MD Anderson; serum analysis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 serology with&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess distant tumor tissue changes by evaluating necrosis and immune cell&#xD;
      infiltration (T-/B-/NK-Cell, macrophage, dendritic cell) by immunohistochemistry assay (CD3,&#xD;
      CD4, CD8, CD20, CD16, CD56, granzyme B, cleaved caspase 3, and Ki-67) when distant tumor&#xD;
      sample is obtained; if the sample volume is ample, additional immunohistochemistry assays&#xD;
      will be performed for CD45RO, TIA-1, FoxP3, CD25, OX-40, CD57, CD1a, CD208, myeloperoxidase,&#xD;
      CD68, COX-2, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II in Dr. Savitri&#xD;
      Krishnamurthy's laboratory at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intratumorally (IT) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3&#xD;
      weeks in cycle 1 and every 2 weeks thereafter in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 1 year.&#xD;
