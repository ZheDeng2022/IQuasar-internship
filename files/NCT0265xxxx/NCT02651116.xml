  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel group pilot study in&#xD;
      approximately 150 subjects to evaluate the efficacy of dextromethorphan hydrobromide (DXM) on&#xD;
      acute cough in a pediatric population. Subjects will be otherwise healthy males and females&#xD;
      aged 6-11 inclusive who are experiencing acute cough as a symptom of common cold or upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection. Subjects must have had onset of symptoms within 3 days of&#xD;
      screening and qualify based on physical exam and symptom questionnaire. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be given a single-blind placebo, and fitted with a cough counting device for a 2 hour&#xD;
      run-in period. Qualifying subjects will be stratified by age and then randomized to either&#xD;
      DXM or placebo in a 1:1 ratio and fitted with the cough recording device for the first 24&#xD;
      hours of treatment. Subjects will receive approximately 9 doses of investigational product&#xD;
      over the course of the 4 day study and will complete patient reported outcome questions&#xD;
      before the morning and afternoon doses. Subjects will return to the study site on Day 2 to&#xD;
      remove the cough recorder and on Day 4 (+ 2 days) to complete the final visit. A review of&#xD;
      any reported adverse events will also be completed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of taking any of the specified prohibited medications or products within the&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study was conducted in the United States from 25 February 2016 to 19 March 2020.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There was a run-in period of 2 hours where participants were administered 10 milliliter (mL) of non-medicinal liquid oral confection for once, and fitted with cough counting device VitaloJAKTM. Eligible participants who completed run-in period, were qualified for randomization to either dextromethorphan hydrobromide (DXM HBr) or placebo in a 4 day treatment period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide</title>
          <description>Participants were randomized to receive 9 doses of DXM HBr (15 milligram [mg] per 10 mL) over the course of 4 day study treatment and were fitted with the cough recording device VitaloJAKTM for the first 24 hours of treatment. On Day 1, participants received a single 10 mL oral dose of DXM HBr syrup each in afternoon and evening. On Day 2 and 3, participants received a single 10 mL oral dose of DXM HBr syrup each in morning, afternoon and evening. On Day 4, participants received a single 10 mL oral dose of DXM HBr syrup in morning. Participants were followed up for 14 days after last dose of study medication.</description>

On Day 1, participants received a single 10 mL oral dose of placebo syrup each in afternoon and evening. On Day 2 and 3, participants received a single 10 mL oral dose of placebo syrup each in morning, afternoon and evening. On Day 4, participants received a single 10 mL oral dose of placebo syrup in morning. Participants were followed up for 14 days after last dose of study medication.</description>

        <title>Mean of Total Cough Counts: Over 24 Hours Post-First Dose on Day 1</title>
        <description>Total cough count was collected by the cough recording device VitaloJAKTM in an ambulatory setting. The VitaloJAKTM device recorded continuous digital audio obtained through both a lapel microphone clipped to the participant's clothing at the neck or upper chest level, and a chest wall sensor attached to the participant's chest at the top of the sternum. Data was captured on a data card and the vitalograph analyst evaluated cough counts.</description>

          <title>Mean of Total Cough Counts: Between Dose 3 to Dose 4 on Day 2</title>
          <description>Total cough count was collected by the cough recording device VitaloJAKTM in an ambulatory setting. The VitaloJAKTM device recorded continuous digital audio obtained through both a lapel microphone clipped to the participant's clothing at the neck or upper chest level, and a chest wall sensor attached to the participant's chest at the top of the sternum. Data was captured on a data card and the vitalograph analyst evaluated cough counts.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set included all participants who were randomized, took Dose 1, had a valid baseline cough count assessment, and provided any post-dosing efficacy data.

On Day 1, participants received a single 10 mL oral dose of DXM HBr syrup each in afternoon and evening. On Day 2 and 3, participants received a single 10 mL oral dose of DXM HBr syrup each in morning, afternoon and evening.

          <title>Pediatric Global Assessment of Satisfaction With Study Medication: By Participant, and Caregiver</title>
          <description>Participants at the end of the study were asked to respond to the following question: &quot;How would you rate the study medication for taking away your cough?&quot; on a 7-point scale: 0= excellent, 1= very good, 2= good, 3= fair, 4= poor, 5= very poor, and 6= terrible. Higher scores indicated poorer satisfaction with study medication. Within 20 minutes after participants completed the assessment parents/legally acceptable representative were asked to respond to the question: &quot;How would you rate the study medication for taking away your child's cough?&quot; on a 7-point scale: 0= excellent, 1= very good, 2= good, 3= fair, 4= poor, 5= very poor, and 6= terrible. Higher scores indicated poorer satisfaction with study medication.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set included all participants who were randomized, took Dose 1, had a valid baseline cough count assessment, and provided any post-dosing efficacy data. Here &quot;Overall number of participants analyzed&quot; signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>
