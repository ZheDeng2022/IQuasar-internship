      SIC 8000 is indicated for use in gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures for submucosal lift&#xD;
      of polyps, adenomas, early-stage cancers or other gastrointestinal mucosal lesions, prior to&#xD;
      excision with a snare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial will focus on only colonic polyps ≥20 mm removed by snare EMR technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with lesions not suitable for EMR because of features strongly suggestive of&#xD;
      sub-mucosal invasion will not be included.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             the colon equal to or greater than 20 mm in largest dimension, assessed by the&#xD;
             investigator to be suitable for EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The base of the lesion should measure at least 20mm in at least one dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A photograph demonstrating the lesion size ≥20 mm against a stiff Boston Scientific&#xD;
             Captivator snare of 20 mm must be recorded for each patient prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ASA status: limited anesthesiology risk, with ASA score 1, 2 or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Contraception: women of childbearing potential must use at least one reliable method&#xD;
             of contraception or be abstinent. Women of non-child-bearing potential or in&#xD;
             post-menopausal status must have been in that status for at least 1 year. For all&#xD;
