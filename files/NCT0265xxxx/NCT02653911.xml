  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a dysfunction of endocrine system of women of&#xD;
      reproductive age. Approximately 5%-10% women in China have this syndrome. Irregular&#xD;
      menstruation (oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea), hirsutism and obesity are the common clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of PCOS. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in&#xD;
      improving the menstrual frequency of PCOS patients who do not have fertility requirements.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methods: A total of 172 participants diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome would be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group or sham-acupuncture group, at a ratio of&#xD;
      1:1. Participants in both groups will receive treatment for 12 weeks, three times a week. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be the proportion of participants with at least a 50% increase from&#xD;
      baseline in the monthly menstrual frequency from baseline after 12 weeks intervention, while&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be the difference in anthropometrics, serum hormone level, ovarian&#xD;
      morphology, anxiety and depression, and quality of life from baseline to after 12 weeks&#xD;
      intervention and to 12 weeks post-intervention follow-up between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for&#xD;
      improving menstrual frequency and other symptoms of patients with PCOS. The limitation of&#xD;
      this trial is that it would be difficult to blind the acupuncturists. Additionally, these&#xD;
      findings may not be suitable for women with PCOS who are seeking pregnancy.&#xD;
