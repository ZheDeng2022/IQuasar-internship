  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experimental design is an open-label two-week trial of tolcapone to evaluate which&#xD;
      clinical domains are affected by tolcapone treatment and to identify &quot;responders&quot; to&#xD;
      tolcapone treatment in the two subject groups (BI and NCD)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will receive a two-week specified dosing amount of tolcapone (100mg TID on Day&#xD;
      1; 200mg TID on Days 2-14). The patient will be instructed to take the study drug three times&#xD;
      daily. Tolcapone will be tapered after Day 14 to avoid potential withdrawal reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Instruments for patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Question banks from large patient-reported outcome measure initiatives will be used and&#xD;
           administered and used by computerized-adaptive tests (CATs). These include the TBI-QoL&#xD;
           for patients with TBI and question banks from the patient-reported outcome measure&#xD;
           information systems (PROMIS) and neurology quality of life measurement initiative&#xD;
           (Neuro-QoL). Patients will answer questions related to their mobility, fatigue, pain&#xD;
           interference, positive affect and well-being, depression, anxiety, anger and&#xD;
           irritability, and emotional and behavioral dyscontrol.&#xD;
