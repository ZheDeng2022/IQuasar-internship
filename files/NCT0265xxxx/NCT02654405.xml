    <textblock>
      The purpose of this grant is to evaluate the efficacy of sodium butyrate as a novel treatment&#xD;
      for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (SZ). Sodium butyrate is a short chain fatty acid and&#xD;
      binds to the zinc site of histone deacetylases (HDAC). The inhibition of HDAC results in&#xD;
      histone hyperacetylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal consists of a small preliminary open label study to assess tolerability and side&#xD;
      effects of sodium butyrate in schizophrenic patients receiving antipsychotic treatment ( in 5&#xD;
      patients with SZ treated with sodium butyrate for 8 weeks), followed by a larger double-blind&#xD;
      study of the effects of sodium butyrate on cognitive function and symptoms, in SZ patients&#xD;
      who are not in an acute exacerbation of the primary symptoms and show continued cognitive&#xD;
      deficits. Secondary aims will be to evaluate its effects on improving symptoms and&#xD;
      functioning in SZ, and the relationship of the drug's clinical effects to epigenetic and&#xD;
      inflammation related biochemical changes. In the double-blind phase we plan a study at 3&#xD;
      sites: 2 US, 1 China, but only the US site at the Nathan Kline Institute ( NKI) will be&#xD;
      active in the initial phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will provide a brief overview of the importance of these questions, some previous&#xD;
      interventional treatment approaches, and the potential of HDAC inhibitors and sodium butyrate&#xD;
      in particular to improve cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The persistent cognitive deficits which can be appreciated across the course of SZ, from&#xD;
      prodromal to chronic SZ, may be the most important underlying dysfunction in preventing&#xD;
      functional, occupational, and social recovery in SZ compared to other symptom domains. There&#xD;
      is no effective treatment for these cognitive deficits which persist after antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication has reduced or resolved the positive symptoms of SZ. Although some exploratory&#xD;
      studies of nicotinic agonist drugs showed promise for improvement of cognitive deficits&#xD;
      associated with SZ , later larger and better-controlled studies with nicotinic agonist drugs&#xD;
      have not shown markedly positive effects for this type of pharmacologic intervention,&#xD;
      although one recent study is promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing interest in epigenetic mechanisms involving in DNA methylation and&#xD;
      histone acetylation involved in the pathology underlying SZ and related disorders ). There is&#xD;
      also interest in activation of inflammatory process as a part of the underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology of SZ, and there is research showing that effects on inflammatory markers may&#xD;
      be partially mediated though epigenetic mechanisms of histone acetylation and DNA&#xD;
      methylation. There is growing evidence that HDAC inhibitor drugs (HDACi) have properties of&#xD;
      being cognitive enhancers and potential treatments for psychiatric disorders where cognitive&#xD;
      deficits are prominent, such as SZ and Alzheimer's disease. Graff and Tsai suggest they may&#xD;
      be particularly important in the process of promoting memory consolidation or conversion of&#xD;
      short-term to longer- term memory and increasing memory retention or consolidation. Memory&#xD;
      consolidation is demonstrated by the temporal gradient of retrograde amnesia (severity of&#xD;
      amnesia most severe for events that occurred shortly before the amnesic event), as well as&#xD;
      improvements in delayed recall of previously learned information after a retention interval.&#xD;
      A specific deficit in memory consolidation has been demonstrated in SZ . Delayed recall&#xD;
      performance may be used as an index of consolidation. For example, Goff et al found evidence&#xD;
      of a beneficial effect of d-cycloserine on delayed but not immediate thematic recall using&#xD;
      the Logical Memory Test (LMT) from the Revised Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium butyrate is a chemical compound found in foods and sold as a health food supplemental&#xD;
      (a nutraceutical) which is a strong HDAC inhibitor (predominantly class I HDAC) and has&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties). Previous studies suggest it may have&#xD;
      potential as a treatment for cognitive deficits in several psychiatric disorders, and have&#xD;
      potential ameliorative effects on depression, and on human inflammatory diseases. Research&#xD;
      with animal models show that sodium butyrate and phenylbutyrate have potential to improve&#xD;
      cognition, including rescue of fear and spatial memories and enhancement of contextual&#xD;
      memory, spatial memory and object recognition and improved memory in a mouse model of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. Sodium butyrate also decreased depressive-like behaviors in models of&#xD;
      maternal deprivation and chronic stress . One human study with a butyrate congener improved&#xD;
      cognitive outcome, including improvements in a test of working memory, in treatment of a urea&#xD;
      cycle hyperammonia disorder. Sodium butyrate has also been used in clinical trials of&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) with positive effects on&#xD;
      clinical state and also with improvement on indicators of inflammation . In the Crohn's&#xD;
      disease study it also significantly decreased an immunological component interleukin-1 beta&#xD;
      (IL-1 β). It has been used and sold widely as health food supplement nutraceutical in humans&#xD;
      and has a good safety profile . It also reduces insulin resistance and lipid metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities as documented in both an animal model of fat induced insulin resistance and in&#xD;
      an experimental human study preventing lipid induced insulin resistance . This effect may be&#xD;
      relevant as a beneficial effect for metabolic abnormalities that are frequently reported in&#xD;
      obese SZ. Sodium butyrate is lipophilic compound that passes the blood-brain barrier. This is&#xD;
      reported in previous studies and reviews stating that sodium butyrate crosses the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier). For example, in a mouse model oral sodium butyrate increased histone acetylation&#xD;
      both in brain and periphery. This fulfills a criterion the Stanley granting organization&#xD;
      requests be reported for proposed pharmacological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above background provides a rationale for a trial of sodium butyrate as a cognitive&#xD;
      enhancer in SZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the double-blind will be to test the following hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment with sodium butyrate will improve cognition in SZ as measured by the composite&#xD;
           and domain scores of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in&#xD;
           Schizophrenia battery (MATRICS [MCCB]) . The primary outcome measure will be the MCCB&#xD;
           composite score.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment with sodium butyrate will improve memory consolidation as measured by delayed&#xD;
           recall performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improvement in cognitive function induced by sodium butyrate in SZ will be correlated&#xD;
           with improvement in a measure of performance on real world functional tasks as assessed&#xD;
           by the University of California San Diego (USCD) Performance- Based Skills Assessment&#xD;
           Battery (UPSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also explore whether improvement in cognition is related to change in HDAC activity&#xD;
      in peripheral blood cells and changes in inflammatory makers in the blood (CRP, IL-1 β ), and&#xD;
      assess whether there is any improvement in psychopathology as measured by PANSS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two phases, an open-label study of the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of sodium butyrate in patients with schizophrenia followed by a randomized placebo controlled&#xD;
      experimental study of the effects of adjunctive 6.57 gms of sodium butyrate per day for 12&#xD;
      weeks&#xD;
