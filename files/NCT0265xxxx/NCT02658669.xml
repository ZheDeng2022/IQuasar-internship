  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn era Veterans have&#xD;
      suffered a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and now cope with multiple post-injury&#xD;
      symptoms, including sleep disturbances (especially insomnia). Chronic insomnia in mTBI&#xD;
      patients has the potential to exacerbate other symptoms, delay recovery, and negatively&#xD;
      affect many of the cognitive, psychological, and neuromuscular sequelae of mTBI, thereby&#xD;
      decreasing quality of life. Although Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has&#xD;
      been shown to be an effective evidence-based treatment for insomnia, there are no published&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials evaluating the potential strengths and/or limitations of CBT-I&#xD;
      in post-mTBI patients. Therefore, assessing CBT-I in the context of mTBI holds promise to&#xD;
      provide substantial benefits in terms of improved rehabilitation outcomes in Veterans who&#xD;
      have suffered mTBI.&#xD;

      This VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Career Development Award (CDA-2) proposal is&#xD;
      designed to significantly advance the application of Behavioral Sleep Medicine practices in&#xD;
      the treatment of Veterans seen in the VA Healthcare System, especially those recovering from&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI has been deemed the &quot;signature wound&quot; of the Iraq and&#xD;
      Afghanistan Wars, occurring in about 19.5% of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi&#xD;
      Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) service members. For many Veterans, mild traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury (mTBI) can be associated with persistent post-concussive symptoms, especially&#xD;
      sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances are among the most frequent complaints following mTBI,&#xD;
      with studies suggesting that over 93% of Veterans who experienced brain injuries develop&#xD;
      chronic sleep problems. Of the sleep disturbances diagnosed in this patient population the&#xD;
      most common is insomnia, observed in over 50% of patients. Chronic and untreated insomnia is&#xD;
      known to be associated with and/or increase risk for psychiatric problems, suicidal ideation,&#xD;
      and unhealthy lifestyles (e.g., alcohol/drug abuse), lead to poorer physical health,&#xD;
      disruption in major social and occupational responsibilities, and decreased quality of life,&#xD;
      and may generally contribute to the persistence of post-concussive symptoms beyond the&#xD;
      expected period of recovery. As such, treatment of sleep disturbance represents an essential&#xD;
      component of Veteran care, one which may be particularly beneficial for Veterans with history&#xD;
      of mTBI who commonly present to the clinic with complex multi-symptom concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this important clinical issue, the proposed randomized clinical trial (RCT) will&#xD;
      attempt to assess the efficacy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) versus a&#xD;
      Sleep Education control in Veterans with insomnia and a history of mTBI. CBT-I is recommended&#xD;
      by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine for treatment of chronic insomnia and has also been&#xD;
      adopted by the VA within an Evidence Based Practice roll-out program. Despite the acceptance&#xD;
      of CBT-I as a first line treatment for sleep disturbance, there are no published RCTs&#xD;
      evaluating CBT-I in mTBI patient populations. Therefore, this proposed investigation will&#xD;
      address this gap in the literature by assessing the efficacy of CBT-I in Veterans with&#xD;
      history of head injury.&#xD;
