  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparison trial with novel application of AmnioFix and a control arm. Patients&#xD;
      electively being treated with facial lasers will be assigned to receive AmnioFix in addition&#xD;
      to the normal standard of care placed on half of their face after laser procedure, and normal&#xD;
      post laser standard of care alone on the other half of their face. The investigators will&#xD;
      investigate the end points of healing, recovery time, re-epitheliaziation, and other cosmetic&#xD;
      factors. The study is designed to compare AmnioFix to the current standard of laser care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AmnioFix is a dehydrated Human Amnion/ Chorion Membrane (dHACM) allograft and is composed of&#xD;
      multiple layers including a single layer of epithelial cells, a basement membrane and an&#xD;
      avascular connective tissue matrix. Amniotic membrane is a unique material and its&#xD;
      composition contains collagen types I, III, IV, V, and VII. Amniotic membrane is composed of&#xD;
      structural extracellular matrix (ECM), that also contains specialized proteins fibronectin,&#xD;
      laminins, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. In addition, amniotic membrane contains&#xD;
      essential, active, healing growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming&#xD;
      growth factor beta (TGF-b), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and platelet derived growth&#xD;
      factor (PDGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to compare AmnioFix to the current standard of laser care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients coming in for fraction or total ablative resurfacing with any methods will be&#xD;
           studied&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients will be assessed prior to any treatment by clinician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  additionally patients will participate in a clinician constructed survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients will be assessed on a rating scale of 1-4 based on erythema, edema/induration,&#xD;
           oozing/drainage, and epithelialization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  preoperative photos will be taken of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  laser resurfacing will proceed under clinician guidance, and under clinician selected&#xD;
           settings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  repeat photographs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients will be randomized as to which side of the face receives AmnioFix treatment,&#xD;
           and which side receives standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  epifix will be applied appropriatly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  repeat photographs and repeat assessment on 1-4 scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients will follow up at day 1, 4, 7, 14, and 28 +/-3 days to repeat scoring and&#xD;
