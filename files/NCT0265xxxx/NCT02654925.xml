      In order to design new programs to help prevent weight gain, promote successful and&#xD;
      sustainable weight loss, and help treat diseases related to obesity, the investigators need a&#xD;
      better understanding of why accumulating fat in certain regions of the body is bad for&#xD;
      health. It is known that not all fat cells are the same, but it was recently discovered that&#xD;
      some fat cells may arise from stem cells that come from the bone marrow (bone marrow&#xD;
      progenitors), a previously unrecognized origin. This discovery has been paradigm shifting,&#xD;
      because dogma has long held that all white fat cells arise from fat tissue resident&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells. This is also important because fat cells arising from the bone marrow&#xD;
      lineage may be linked to worse health outcomes. The aim of this study is to determine if&#xD;
      cells that were not previously believed to contribute to fat generation in humans are indeed&#xD;
      capable of becoming fat cells. To answer this question the investigators will take samples of&#xD;
      cells from the blood and the fat tissue of younger and older men and women, isolate the cells&#xD;
      that came from the bone marrow and grow them in culture to determine if they will turn into&#xD;
      fat cells. The results of this investigation may reveal potential mechanistic targets for&#xD;
      future therapies to reduce the negative health outcomes associated with obesity related&#xD;
      chronic diseases.&#xD;
