  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This crossover study is designed to compare the gastric layering and rates of emptying and by&#xD;
      inference rates of digestion of two different porridge meals prepared from either finely&#xD;
      milled or flaked oats. On each of two study days, a total of 9 MRI scans will be taken, I&#xD;
      baseline and 8 post meal, to assess gastric layering and emptying over three hours. Blood&#xD;
      samples will also be taken periodically over the same period in order to determine changes in&#xD;
      concentrations of circulating glucose, insulin and key gastrointestinal hormones.&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire at predetermined times to assess&#xD;
      feelings of satiation.&#xD;

      Eight participants will be recruited onto the study via the Human Nutrition Unit (HNU)&#xD;
      Volunteer Database, advertising fliers and social media. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      invited to IFR for a talk about the study, followed by health screening if they wish to&#xD;
      participate. Written, informed consent will be taken by a member of the research team prior&#xD;
      to undertaking any study related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo 2 study days (min.7 days apart) and they will eat 2 types of&#xD;
      porridge in a random order. Allocation of the order of the porridge meals will be done before&#xD;
      the participants are recruited onto the study, using an online randomizer. On one occasion&#xD;
      participants will consume porridge made from milled oats and on the other occasion porridge&#xD;
      made from flaked oats. Participants will undergo 9 MRI scans of the stomach over a 3h post&#xD;
      ingestion period, and after each scan a 4 ml blood sample will be collected via an&#xD;
      intravenous cannula. Feelings of satiety will be assessed using a short VAS questionnaire at&#xD;
      9 intervals during the study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study day participants will not be able to eat any food after 10.00pm on the evening prior to&#xD;
      each study day, but they will be allowed water until they go to bed. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to record what they have eaten on the evening prior to study day 1, and they will be&#xD;
      asked to eat the same foods on the evening before the second study day. Participants must not&#xD;
      consume any breakfast on the morning of the study day, but they can drink up until 7 am. The&#xD;
      study day will start at 9 am at the Radiology Department at the Norfolk and Norwich&#xD;
      University Hospital. After cannulation and blood sampling, initial baseline MRI scans and VAS&#xD;
      questionnaires, the participants will eat the allocated porridge (264 g) and drink the water&#xD;
      provided (175 ml). They will then undergo 8 more MRI scans, have blood taken 8 more times and&#xD;
      complete 8 satiety questionnaires at specific time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of all MRI scans, blood sampling and satiety questionnaires, participants&#xD;
      will be provided with a 500 ml bottle of water and a packed lunch.&#xD;
