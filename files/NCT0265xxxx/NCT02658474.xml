      The purpose of this study is to determine whether group based Acceptance and Commitment&#xD;
      Therapy (ACT) at a university hospital clinic is superior to treatment in a primary care&#xD;
      setting among patients with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) A group based ACT treatment leads to less pain and greater Health Related Quality of Life&#xD;
      (HRQOL) in patients with chronic pain than treatment in a primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) The improvement in pain and HRQOL is mediated through an increased degree of pain&#xD;
      willingness and involvement in activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Improvement of pain and HRQOL after the two treatments is associated with demographic,&#xD;
      psychosocial and somatic characteristics.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain represents a substantial social problem. In Norway, the prevalence of chronic&#xD;
      moderate pain is between 25 and 30%, and for severe pain it is at 2%. Multidisciplinary&#xD;
      treatment is recommended for chronic pain, and during the last years Acceptance Commitment&#xD;
      Therapy (ACT) has been implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design, methods and analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and twenty participants will be recruited from a list of patients referred to the&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary Pain Department at the University Hospital of North Norway. Those who meet&#xD;
      the defined criteria, are invited to participate. The study has a randomized, semi-crossover&#xD;
      design. The participants are allocated to group based ACT or treatment in a primary care&#xD;
      setting with a gender stratified, block randomization with a ratio of 1: 1. This means that&#xD;
      half of the participants (intervention group, n: 60) get early group based ACT, while the&#xD;
      other half (control group, n: 60) will be treated in a primary health care setting. Those of&#xD;
      the control group who still meet the criteria, will be offered ACT afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will take place at a) start of the study, b) a few days prior to the onset of&#xD;
      ACT and c) a few days after ended ACT, and 6 months after the onset of ACT. Data collection&#xD;
      is carried out with the same time intervals in the control group. After having received ACT&#xD;
      data is collected 12 months after the onset of ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first appointment all participants undergo a multidisciplinary evaluation where&#xD;
      participants alternate between telling their life story and listening to responses from the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team. The aim is to initiate a reflexive attitude and a feeling of being&#xD;
      acknowledged. The multidisciplinary report to the general practitioner provides diagnostic&#xD;
      considerations as well as recommendations for future treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Intervention group: Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT) is based on the principles of&#xD;
      operant conditioning and is less problem-oriented compared with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
      (CBT). The patients learn how to accept and to realize that thoughts, feelings and sensations&#xD;
      do not have to decide how life is. In a comparative efficacy study ACT has been shown equally&#xD;
      effective as CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction is included in ACT, and the patients will therefore get a&#xD;
      systematic training in mastering stress and emotional conflicts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: Control Group: Patients in the control group are primarily treated by the general&#xD;
      practitioner supported by recommendations from the multidisciplinary pain team. The treatment&#xD;
      will vary in content and form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic data storage: Data will be collected by an internet based system according the the&#xD;
      Norwegian regulations for social insurance and are imported and stored anonymized in a&#xD;
      password protected SPSS file data at the University Hospital of North Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic variables include gender, year of birth, marital status, number of children,&#xD;
      education, occupation and employment status, as well as benefits from the social security&#xD;
      system (NAV), financial situation and possible compensation or application for disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical variables include comorbidity specified by a list of diseases related to the major&#xD;
      organ systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain analyses: Pain intensity is one of two primary outcomes and is measured with four&#xD;
      numerical scales for pain intensity (0 being no pain and 10 the worst possible pain) obtained&#xD;
      from the Brief Pain Inventory. Localization (specified by a body map) and temporal aspects,&#xD;
      duration and variety of pain are also measured&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health related Quality of life: Short form 36 (version 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity: The Gothenburg Activity Question .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep: Insomnia Severity Index is a self-reporting questionnaire that assesses the severity&#xD;
      of the sleeping problems. The form contains seven questions answered with a 5 point Likert&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue: Chalder fatigue questionnaire contains 11 questions and operates with 4 answer&#xD;
      options with varying degrees of severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety and depression: Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25 with 25 questions about anxiety and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain catastrophizing: The Pain Catastrophizing Scale with 13 questions measuring rumination,&#xD;
      worst case thinking and helplessness. General Self-Efficacy: General Perceived Self-Efficacy&#xD;
      Questionnaire is based on Bandura's model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse life events: Those who report positively on a severe life event are asked to fill in&#xD;
      Impact of Event Scale-6 with 6 questions related to thoughts after traumatic life event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific evaluation of the ACT intervention: The questionnaire Chronic Pain Acceptance&#xD;
      Questionnaire (CPAQ 20) includes 20 items selected to assess the degree of pain willingness&#xD;
      and involvement in relation to activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of health services: Type and number of treatments given in and outside the Pain&#xD;
      department with waiting time and expectations to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Consumption: Consumption of non-opioids (paracetamol and NSAIDs), opioids (daily dose is&#xD;
      converted to morphine equivalents), and coanalgesics (antidepressants and anticonvulsants)&#xD;
      are recorded by a physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: The investigators will perform repeated comparisons of the two treatment groups&#xD;
      over a 6 month period, and &quot;within-group&quot; comparisons of ACT treated patients over a 12 month&#xD;
      period. The statistical analyses will be carried out in collaboration with a statistician.&#xD;
      Comparison analyses between the groups and to baseline as well as predictor analyses will be&#xD;
      performed by Mixed models (SPSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power: Based on previously published studies and power calculations from pilot data, a&#xD;
      statistical power of 80% and significance level of 5% the investigators will include 120&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project plan, project, organization and Cooperation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is an independent part in a national multicenter survey of patients treated at&#xD;
      multidisciplinary pain departments at university hospitals in Norway. Our project will&#xD;
      largely use the same screening measures and outcomes as the national survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics: This study compares two established therapy modalities offered to patients referred&#xD;
      to the Pain department at the University Hospital of North Norway. The project was approved&#xD;
      by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health research ethics 10/12/13.&#xD;
