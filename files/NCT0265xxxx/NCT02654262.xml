      Obesity during adolescence, a critical time for bone development, may impair mineral accrual&#xD;
      and reduce bone strength, leading to greater fracture risk during adolescence and later in&#xD;
      life. This study seeks to determine the effect of obesity and accompanying metabolic changes&#xD;
      (insulin resistance and inflammation) on bone mineral accrual and related changes in&#xD;
      structure and strength in young girls. The information is critical to developing effective&#xD;
      prevention strategies to counter the linked risks of obesity and osteoporosis, both major&#xD;
      public health concerns.&#xD;

      The pediatric obesity epidemic continues unabated. Its cardio-metabolic complications are&#xD;
      undisputed, including inflammation, insulin resistance (IR), glucose intolerance and greater&#xD;
      prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth. We contend an equally serious consequence of&#xD;
      these obesity co-morbidities is their detrimental effects on bone development during&#xD;
      adolescence, a critical time for mineral accrual and architectural modeling that underlies&#xD;
      bone strength and fracture risk. This proposition has received little attention and the&#xD;
      sparse results are mixed, with reports of augmented and impaired mineralization. In contrast,&#xD;
      animal data demonstrates reduced mineral accrual and compromised architecture with insulin&#xD;
      resistance and chronic inflammation. The conflicting results in youth are likely due to mixed&#xD;
      samples and analyses that commingle obese youth with metabolic complications with so called&#xD;
      metabolically healthy obese youth and the use of technology (i.e., dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry, DXA) to measure bone outcomes that is confounded by the very changes that&#xD;
      investigators seek to detect. We posit that the positive mechanical effect of excess&#xD;
      adiposity on bone is countered by chronic low-grade inflammation and IR so that obese youth&#xD;
      with these metabolic complications suffer impaired bone development whereas obesity in&#xD;
      otherwise metabolically healthy youth augments development. A thorough understanding of the&#xD;
      effects of adiposity and its co-morbidities on bone development is crucial to the development&#xD;
      of efficacious interventions aimed at maximal mineral accrual and bone modeling. Thus, we&#xD;
      propose primary aims designed to clarify the effects of obesity, insulin resistance and&#xD;
      inflammation on bone around the time of peak height velocity. Adipose tissue (AT)&#xD;
      distribution undoubtedly matters, especially abdominal visceral AT and skeletal muscle fat&#xD;
      content, both strongly related to insulin resistance. Failure to characterize fat&#xD;
      distribution is another important limitation of past studies. Consequently we will assess the&#xD;
      effect of visceral AT and skeletal muscle fat along with whole body fatness and propose&#xD;
      secondary aims designed to develop safe, cost effective methods that we and others can use&#xD;
      for estimating AT distribution, a critical component of risk that has rarely been studied in&#xD;
      youth relative to bone development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the associations of total and regional adiposity (visceral AT and leg muscle fat&#xD;
           content), insulin resistance, and inflammation with bone mass, density, structure and&#xD;
           strength in normal weight, overweight, and obese pre-menarcheal girls&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the effects of total and regional adiposity, insulin resistance, and inflammation&#xD;
           on bone development (i.e., 2 year changes in bone parameters) in normal weight and obese&#xD;
           pre-menarcheal girls.&#xD;
