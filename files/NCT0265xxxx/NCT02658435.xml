  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to provide evidence of retinal safety to support the use of tafenoquine as a&#xD;
      potential single dose radical cure treatment for patients with Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax)&#xD;
      malaria (i.e., co-administration of a schizonticidal drug with TQ). The study will be&#xD;
      conducted as a single masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group design. It will&#xD;
      assess retinal changes from baseline using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#xD;
      and fundus auto fluorescence (FAF) at Month 3 (90 days) post-dose in adult healthy volunteers&#xD;
      (participants). A placebo control group will be used to compare the results in the TQ group.&#xD;
      Interim analysis will be conducted after completing 100 out of 300 participants in TQ group&#xD;
      and 50 out of 150 participants in matched placebo.&#xD;
