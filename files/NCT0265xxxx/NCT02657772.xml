    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy rates of the treatment of&#xD;
      small intracranial aneurysms with Stryker Neurovascular's Target® 360 Ultra coils which are a&#xD;
      type of platinum coils used to occlude aneurysms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective single-arm multi-center Registry which aims to collect data to&#xD;
      determine the safety and efficacy of one of these marketed coils, namely the Target® 360&#xD;
      Ultra coils. This is not an intervention or treatment study. Up to 100 subjects at up to 6&#xD;
      sites will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening and Informed consent: Patients will undergoing endovascular treatment of&#xD;
           intracranial aneurysm will be screened using the Eligibility criteria checklist, and&#xD;
           enrolled using approved Institutional Informed Consent process and approved Informed&#xD;
           Consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline assessment: This involves standard of care history, medical examinations and&#xD;
           laboratory assessments prior to coiling procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Coiling procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. One day post procedure assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 3- 28 days post procedure assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 3-9 months post procedure assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 9-18 months post procedure assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Site investigator and/or co-investigator or their representative(s) will conduct training&#xD;
      before initiating the study to develop a common understanding of the clinical protocol, Case&#xD;
      Report Forms, and study procedures among the investigators and site research staff.&#xD;
      Regulatory binders with study protocol, training documents, and standard operating guidelines&#xD;
      will be provided for each study site. The Principal investigator and/or co-investigator shall&#xD;
      confirm data received is accurate by reviewing with the provider collecting the data. The&#xD;
      principle investigator and/or co-investigator will approve all data received. Additionally,&#xD;
      OpenClinica, a web-based data capture service, will receive all Case Report Forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Monitoring will be electronic requiring upload of de-identified source documents&#xD;
      through provided secure channels. However on site visits maybe scheduled in advance with the&#xD;
      site personnel. Audits may be also be performed for quality assurance.&#xD;

        Patients will be between 18 and 80 years of age (inclusive)and have a documented untreated&#xD;
        intracranial aneurysm, less than or equal to 5 mm, ruptured or unruptured, for which Ultra®&#xD;
        coils are treatment options, and for which primary coiling treatment is planned to be&#xD;
        completed during a single procedure (i.e., no &quot;staged&quot; treatment). Preliminary intracranial&#xD;
        stent placement and/or use of an intracranial endoluminal balloon device as adjunctive&#xD;
        therapy is allowed.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is between 18 and 80 years of age (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has a documented untreated intracranial aneurysm less than or equal to 5.0 mm&#xD;
             in maximal dimension, ruptured or unruptured, suitable for embolization with coils.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Target® Ultra coils may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Target aneurysm can be completely or nearly completely coiled at index procedure (No&#xD;
             staged treatment procedures) without anticipated need for any target aneurysm&#xD;
             reintervention after 72 hours of the index procedure. If a stent is to be placed&#xD;
             during a separate preliminary procedure, then screening and enrollment for the coiling&#xD;
             procedure must take place after the stenting procedure is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Target aneurysm morphology allows for adequate retention of coils within the&#xD;
             aneurysmal sac without occlusion of the parent artery, as determined by the treating&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient (or patient's legally authorized representative) has provided written informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;

             in etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Target aneurysm is &gt;5.0 mm maximum luminal dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Target aneurysm has been previously treated by surgery or endovascular therapy.&#xD;

             structurally related compounds found in Target® Ultra coils.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who have had or could have a severe reaction to contrast agents that cannot&#xD;
             be adequately pre-medicated prior to the coiling procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;

             atherosclerotic stenosis, tortuousity or other conditions preventing access to the&#xD;
             target aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Target aneurysm with significant thrombosis that may increase the likelihood of&#xD;
             recanalization at the discretion on the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Female patient has a positive pregnancy assessment at baseline, breastfeeding patient,&#xD;
             or patient who plans to become pregnant within the 18 months following coiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The following comorbidities that may confound results: (a) organ failure of kidney (b)&#xD;
             uncorrectable coagulation abnormality.&#xD;
