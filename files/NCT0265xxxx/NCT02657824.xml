  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a parameter that should be evaluated rapidly to&#xD;
      the patients, admitted to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The&#xD;
      investigators aimed to investigate correlation between LVEF and 4 different mitral valve&#xD;
      movements which alternate to the classical LVEF assessing methods and evaluate these methods&#xD;
      can be used or not in the emergency department.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective observational study was conducted in an acutely dyspneic patients with&#xD;
      receiving echocardiagraphy by the chief physicians. Measurements were performed before&#xD;
      echocardiography lab by the physician who conducted the survey in the emergency department.&#xD;
      In parasternal long axis view mitral valve E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS) M-Mod&#xD;
      measurements and mitral valve anterior leaflet and septal distance (P-ALSS) B-Mod&#xD;
      measurements and in apical four chamber view mitral valve anterior leaflet and septal&#xD;
      distance (A-ALSS) B-Mod measurements and distance between mitral valve anterior and posterior&#xD;
      leaflets (MVLS) B-Mod measurements were acquired as the minimum distance in diastole. LVEF of&#xD;
      patients were measured by cardiologist. Correlation of the all values between LVEF and&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood probabilities were calculated.&#xD;

    <description>New methods are described: First measurement is distance between mitral valve anterior leaflet and septum in early diastole in the parasternal long axis view m-mode in millimeter.second measurement is distance between mitral valve anterior leaflet and septum in early diastole in the parasternal long axis view b-mode in millimeter. third is the distance between mitral valve anterior leaflet and septum in the apical four chamber view b-mode in millimeter. forth is the distance between mitral valve anterior and posterior leaflet in apical four chamber b-mode in millimeter.</description>
