      In light of the controversy that are already approved but that however still exists regarding&#xD;
      the efficacy and influence of the decontaminant tools for the management of Chronic&#xD;
      Periodontitis (cp), the aim of this study was to evaluates, at 1 year follow-up, the&#xD;
      post-treatment clinical parameters and immunological and gingival microbial profiles in&#xD;
      patients with CP, treated by either SRP in addition to desiccant or SRP alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis to invalidate was that, after a one year follow-up, there were no&#xD;
      variations, in relation to clinical, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory parameters between&#xD;
      SRP + desiccant and SRP alone treatment.&#xD;

      This trial was conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association's Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki of 1975, and reviewed in 2008. The local ethical committee of the University of&#xD;
      Messina approved the study protocol and each patient was carefully informed about the&#xD;
      possible inherent risks of the study and provided their informed written consent. Subjects&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of CP (Chronic Periodontitis) were enrolled in this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Thirty-six patients, 19 men and 17 women, aged 27 to 65 (mean age 46.7) were&#xD;
      assessed for eligibility at the Department of Biomedical, Odontostomatological Sciences and&#xD;
      Morphological and Functional Images at the University of Messina, Messina, Italy. This trial&#xD;
      was conducted in agreement with the CONSORT guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all subjects, subgingival plaque was acquired from 4 separate proximal sites at 365 days&#xD;
      after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To permit the noninvasive specimen, all the sites chosen for analysis were isolated using&#xD;
      cotton rolls. Subsequently, by one #40 sterilized paper point present in the commercial kit†&#xD;
      introduced into the base of the selected site for 30 s, a subgingival plaque sample was&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF) was gathered, at the same time from other four different&#xD;
      non-contiguous interproximal sites using filter paper strips‡ as previously described. The&#xD;
      levels of IL-1β, IL-10 and TNF-α were recognized by conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
      assay using an equation with software using a five polynomial parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each selected subject underwent randomly, without anaesthesia, at the same time and after&#xD;
      recording periodontal parameters, the two following treatments: in one, maxillary quadrants&#xD;
      were treated as conventional Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) + desiccant (Hybenx), while the&#xD;
      contra-lateral quadrants were treated as conventional SRP alone.&#xD;

In the maxillary quadrant assigned to SRP + hybenx treatment, hybenx was applied, after SRP, on the marginal gingiva with a 30-second incubation period and then thoroughly rinsed away through abundant irrigation with a sterile saline solution.</description>
