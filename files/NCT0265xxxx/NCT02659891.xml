  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to rapidly improve clearance of BK viremia with&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin (Privigen®) thereby decreasing the potential for formation of alloantibodies&#xD;
      in renal transplant recipients that have had immunosuppression reduction due to BK viremia.&#xD;
      Our approach is to perform a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trial intravenous&#xD;
      immune globulin (IVIg; Privigen®) plus protocolized immunosuppression reduction versus&#xD;
      placebo and protocolized immunosuppression reduction in patients with BK viremia post-kidney&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure&#xD;
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn&#xD;
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject is either postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening&#xD;
             visit, is surgically sterilized or if they are of childbearing potential, agree to&#xD;
             practice effective methods of contraception from the time of signing the informed&#xD;
             consent form through 30 days after the last dose of intravenous immune globulin, or&#xD;
             agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Kidney transplant recipients (living and deceased donors) with new onset BK viremia&#xD;

             enrollment). For values &gt;5000 copies/mL repeat testing is not required. For values&#xD;
             ≤5000 copies/mL repeat testing should be performed to confirm viremia before&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppression therapy at enrollment with tacrolimus, MPA, +/- prednisone.&#xD;
