    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of increasing doses of&#xD;
      primaquine in combination with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in G6PD deficient males.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the current study the investigators aim to assess safety of PQ, in particular the risk of&#xD;
      acute haemolysis, when given together with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAP) in G6PD&#xD;
      deficient individuals. Forty male participants with haemoglobin levels (≥11g/dL), reduced&#xD;
      G6PD enzyme function, and aged ≥10years will be sequentially enrolled into two dosing cohorts&#xD;
      consisting of 20 individuals and doses of 0.25 and 0.4 mg/kg PQ in combination with a full&#xD;
      three-day course of DHAP. Participants will first be assigned to the lowest open cohort;&#xD;
      enrolment in the next cohort is initiated after tolerability and short-term safety is&#xD;
      demonstrated at the preceding lower dose. Furthermore, the investigators will include 3&#xD;
      control groups into the first cohort: i) 10 male participants aged ≥10years with normal&#xD;
      haemoglobin levels (≥11g/dL) and a reduced G6PD enzyme function will receive DHAP only, ii)&#xD;
      10 male participants with normal haemoglobin levels (≥11g/dL) and normal G6PD enzyme function&#xD;
      will receive 0.25 mg/kg PQ in combination with a full three-day course of DHAP, and iii) 10&#xD;
      male participants with normal haemoglobin levels (≥11g/dL) and normal G6PD enzyme function&#xD;
      will receive 0.4 mg/kg PQ with DHAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment and group assignment Individuals who agree to participate for screening and meet&#xD;
      all inclusion criteria, will be invited for enrolment. During this, participants and/or their&#xD;
      carers will be informed again about the objectives and practical consequences of&#xD;
      participation in the current study and asked to sign an informed consent form. The&#xD;
      possibility of withdrawal from the study, at any time and without any declaration of the&#xD;
      reason will again be pointed out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrolment, participants will be assigned to the lowest-dose open cohort, with enrolment&#xD;
      in the second cohort initiated after tolerability and short-term safety is demonstrated at&#xD;
      the preceding lower dose (this enrolment to the second cohort accounts for G6PD deficient&#xD;
      participants only). Within each cohort, the first 2 participants of the intervention group&#xD;
      are treated and monitored for 6 days for immediate side-effects and haematological&#xD;
      abnormalities before the rest of the participants of that particular intervention group are&#xD;
      enrolled and treated. Once safety of these first 2 participants is confirmed, the next 4&#xD;
      subjects are enrolled and treatment for the next 4 subjects is initiated on day 2 of the last&#xD;
      treated participant of the preceding 4 subjects. The last two groups for each intervention&#xD;
      group comprise 5 individuals, making a total of 20. After inclusion of the intervention group&#xD;
      of the first cohort (n=20) is completed (follow-up day 14 of last participant in that group),&#xD;
      a 10-day safety observation period is installed before enrolment of the intervention group of&#xD;
      the second cohort is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and evaluation Clinical follow-up of participants and sampling will be done&#xD;
      twice daily for the first 4 days (days 0, 1, 2 and 3) and once daily on days 4, 5, 7, 10, 14&#xD;
      and 28. At each time-point participants will be examined clinically (except for day 28) and a&#xD;
      structured questionnaire is used to determine the occurrence of side effects. Furthermore,&#xD;
      laboratory safety parameters are measured, including haematology, biochemistry, and urine&#xD;
      dipstick for haemoglobinuria/urobilinogen. Five individuals from each intervention group&#xD;
      (total of 10) will also be asked to provide seven venous blood samples (of less than 1 mls&#xD;
      each) on days 0, 1 and 2 to study pharmacokinetics of PQ in G6PD deficient individuals&#xD;

    Enrollment took longer than anticipated; it was financially and logistically impossible to&#xD;
