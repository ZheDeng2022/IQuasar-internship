      The trial shall assess the accuracy of the Oxitone® 1000 in measuring oxygen saturation, by&#xD;
      comparing its measurement to reference devices: non-invasive SpO2 and pulse-rate values&#xD;
      determined by a pulse oximeter. A total of approximately 40 subjects: 20 healthy and 20 COPD&#xD;
      (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) patients will be enrolled. These subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled at the medical center pulmonary department and will be recruited from the clinic&#xD;
      patient base. The subjects will be represented by male and female adults who optimally cover&#xD;
      a range of ethnic backgrounds (skin pigmentation). All testing will be performed in singleton&#xD;
      and in a blinded fashion. This study will be conducted with the approval of the medical&#xD;
      center ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a comparison open study with no subject follow-up.&#xD;

      The Oxitone® 1000 oximetry readings are accurate and measure with an acceptable relative&#xD;
      absolute difference (RAD) when compared to accepted measurement systems (FDA recognized&#xD;
      predicate) the &quot;Reference&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To validate the Oxitone® 1000 performance in continuous or spot oximetry monitoring,&#xD;
           relative to Reference readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To aggregate longitudinal clinical data from COPD patients measuring SpO2, pulse rate&#xD;
           and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the main device parameters and characteristics such as sensor placement&#xD;
           tolerance, device accuracy, precision, convenience and easy-to-use at stationary supine&#xD;
           or seated tests and at mild motions as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether the measured data provided from patients (SpO2, pulse rate and&#xD;
           movement) is useful in adjusting their treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the safety and tolerability (compliance) of the Oxitone® 1000 in continuous&#xD;
           oximetry monitoring in order to obtain sufficient clinical trial data in order to define&#xD;
           performance criteria of the device system that are acceptable / useful in the medical&#xD;
           context for patient populations and other healthy individuals, in which the device is&#xD;
           likely to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview: The trial shall assess the accuracy of the Oxitone® 1000 in measuring oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, by comparing its measurement to reference devices: non-invasive SpO2 and&#xD;
      pulse-rate values determined by a pulse oximeter. A total of approximately 40 subjects (20&#xD;
      healthy and 20 COPD patients) will be enrolled. These subjects will be enrolled at the&#xD;
      medical center pulmonary department and will be recruited from the clinic patient base. The&#xD;
      subjects will be represented by male and female adults who optimally cover a range of ethnic&#xD;
      backgrounds (skin pigmentation). All testing will be performed in singleton and in a blinded&#xD;
      fashion. This study will be conducted with the approval of the medical center ethics&#xD;
      committee.This is a comparison open study with no subject follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: All instruments will be checked for functionality and battery operational&#xD;
      capacity, prior to subject attachment including the data collection system, i.e. the wireless&#xD;
      (B.T.) connectivity to P.C. (synchronized bidirectional two channels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Reference&quot; oximeter device shall be set for averaging mode of 12 seconds. Two sensors&#xD;
      will be placed simultaneously on the subjects: A standard SpO2 (reference) will be placed on&#xD;
      the subject's index finger and the tested Oxitone® 1000 will be placed on the subject's wrist&#xD;
      of the same hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:: The investigators are to study approximately 40 subjects, both normal, i.e.&#xD;
      comparison group and patients with a variety of pulmonary conditions that effect oxygen&#xD;
      saturation. The investigators will compare the oxygen saturation of each subject as measured&#xD;
      with Oxitone® 1000 device and with the oxygen saturation as measured with calibrated&#xD;
      conventional FDA approved pulse oximeter (predicate). The &quot;Reference&quot;. No treatment decision&#xD;
      will be made utilizing the results of the tested device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Healthy subjects: Spot-check measurements of 20 healthy volunteers simultaneously tested&#xD;
      by using Oxitone oximeter and standard fingertip pulse oximeter at stationary state i.e. at&#xD;
      sitting and standing positions up to 6 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. A 6-minute.walk: oximetry tests of 20 healthy volunteers simultaneously tested using&#xD;
      Oxitone oximeter and standard fingertip pulse oximeter in accordance with the industry&#xD;
      (Medical) standards of 6-min walk protocol. Measurements are collected and recorded&#xD;
      continuously prior to test, during the test and after 6 minutes the test. The distance of the&#xD;
      6-min walk will be recorded (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Spot-check measurements up to 20 ambulatory COPD patients. Patients should be referred&#xD;
           and admitted to the pulmonary lab for clinical treatment or should be under the&#xD;
           rehabilitation procedures. Measurements will be made simultaneously using Oxitone®&#xD;
           oximeter and while standard fingertip pulse oximeter stationary state at e.g. supine or&#xD;
           dorsal elevated sitting, and while standing (upright) positions up to 6 min each.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 6-min walk oximetry tests of ambulatory COPD patients. Patients should be referred to&#xD;
           the pulmonary lab for clinical purposes or should be under the rehabilitation&#xD;
           procedures. The measurements are taken using Oxitone® oximeter and standard fingertip&#xD;
           pulse oximeter in accordance with the standard protocol. Measurements are taken&#xD;
           continuously prior to the test, during the test and 1 minute after the test, at rest.&#xD;
           The distance of the 6-min walk will be recorded. Rehabilitation subjects procedures. The&#xD;
           measurements are taken using Oxitone® Oximeter and standard fingertip pulse oximeter in&#xD;
           accordance with the standard protocol. Measurements are taken continuously prior to the&#xD;
           test. The distance of the 6-min walk will be recorded.&#xD;
