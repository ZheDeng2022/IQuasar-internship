  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reflex plus™ is a unique blend of Collagen Hydrolysate with Rosehip extract. The blend&#xD;
      contains individual ingredients which have been widely studied for its effectiveness in&#xD;
      osteoarthritis(OA). Collagen hydrolysate is accumulated in the cartilage and helps to repair&#xD;
      the OA, related cartilaginous changes. Rosehip works in the anti-inflammatory pathway thus&#xD;
      reducing the pain and inflammation of the joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two open-label studies have showed the effectiveness of the investigational product on&#xD;
      OA. The 2 studies did not show any specific safety concern to be considered. The study&#xD;
      demonstrated the synergistic effect of CH and Rosehip extract from former in-vitro results in&#xD;
      the formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supplement has been manufactured in GMP certified manufacturing units in Germany and&#xD;
      India under strict quality control check. Hence, quality of the supplement and batch to batch&#xD;
      consistency is well assured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of Reflex Plus on osteoarthritis(OA)&#xD;
      patients. The duration of the study is 12 / 24 weeks excluding the screening period of&#xD;
      approximate 1 week. The test product being studied is Reflex Plus is composed of Collagen&#xD;
      hydrolysate and Rosehip extract, it is a health supplement. It is expected to help in the&#xD;
      building of cartilage for efficient joint functioning and relieving pain associated with&#xD;
      arthritis It helps in cartilage protection and joint pain management.The primary endpoint of&#xD;
      the study is the change in knee pain as measured by the WOMAC osteoarthritis (OA) index sum&#xD;
      score between baseline and last visit in the comparison between IP and placebo.&#xD;
