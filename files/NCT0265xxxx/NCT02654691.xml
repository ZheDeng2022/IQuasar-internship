    <time_frame>5-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements found with threshold tracking. The most common motor parameters assessed with threshold tracking. Outcomes are extracted from the QTrack software. The relative refractory period (RRP) is the interval of time during which a second action potential can be initiated, refractoriness is change in threshold by a preceding simple impulse, and specifically at 2,5 ms. A shorten RRP makes the nerve more excitable and longer RRP less excitable (values see result 22 for refractoriness at 2.5 ms, superexcitability and subexcitability).</description>

A shorten RRP makes the nerve more excitable and longer RRP less excitable (values see result 21 for refractoriness at 2.5 ms, superexcitability and subexcitability). Superexcitability and subexcitablity are measured in the recovery period. The recovery cycle is characterized by changes in axonal excitability following a supramaximal conditioning stimulus. The cycle includes a relative refractory period (at short inter-stimulus intervals), superexcitable period (when the threshold is reduced), and subexcitable period (when the nerve is less excitable).</description>

        <description>Measurements found with threshold tracking. The most common sensory parameters assessed with sensory threshold tracking. Outcomes are extracted from the QTrack software. The relative refractory period (RRP) is the interval of time during which a second action potential can be initiated, refractoriness is change in threshold by a preceding simple impulse, and specifically at 2,5 ms. A shorten RRP makes the nerve more excitable and longer RRP less excitable (values see result 21 for refractoriness at 2.5 ms, superexcitability and subexcitability).</description>

The relative refractory period (RRP) is the interval of time during which a second action potential can be initiated, refractoriness is change in threshold by a preceding simple impulse, and specifically at 2,5 ms. A shorten RRP makes the nerve more excitable and longer RRP less excitable (values see result 22 for refractoriness at 2.5 ms, superexcitability and subexcitability).</description>

        <description>Measurements found with threshold tracking. The most common sensory parameters assessed with sensory threshold tracking. Outcomes are extracted from the QTrack software. The relative refractory period (RRP) is the interval of time during which a second action potential can be initiated, refractoriness is change in threshold by a preceding simple impulse, and specifically at 2,5 ms. A shorten RRP makes the nerve more excitable and longer RRP less excitable (values see result 21 for refractoriness at 2.5 ms, superexcitability and subexcitability). Superexcitability and subexcitablity are measured in the recovery period. The recovery cycle is characterized by changes in axonal excitability following a supramaximal conditioning stimulus. The cycle includes a relative refractory period (at short inter-stimulus intervals), superexcitable period (when the threshold is reduced), and subexcitable period (when the nerve is less excitable).</description>

          <title>Neuronal Excitability Changes After Chemotherapy Assessed With Threshold Tracking: Sensory</title>
          <description>Measurements found with threshold tracking. The most common sensory parameters assessed with sensory threshold tracking. Outcomes are extracted from the QTrack software. The relative refractory period (RRP) is the interval of time during which a second action potential can be initiated, refractoriness is change in threshold by a preceding simple impulse, and specifically at 2,5 ms. A shorten RRP makes the nerve more excitable and longer RRP less excitable (values see result 21 for refractoriness at 2.5 ms, superexcitability and subexcitability). Superexcitability and subexcitablity are measured in the recovery period. The recovery cycle is characterized by changes in axonal excitability following a supramaximal conditioning stimulus. The cycle includes a relative refractory period (at short inter-stimulus intervals), superexcitable period (when the threshold is reduced), and subexcitable period (when the nerve is less excitable).</description>
