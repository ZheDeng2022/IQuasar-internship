  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments for advanced NSCLC. However, chemotherapy induced&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (CIT) is one of the most important limitations for subsequent chemotherapy&#xD;
      of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, although platelet transfusion is the gold standard to treat severe CIT, its&#xD;
      clinical application is limited due to many disadvantages, such as short time for storage,&#xD;
      not easy to save, the risk of infection and immunological diseases. What's more, other&#xD;
      cytokines including IL-11 and rhTPO, are not so useful in clinical work. It is necessary to&#xD;
      explore a new therapeutic method to treat CIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researches show that spleen resection could improve the count of PLT. In this clinical trial,&#xD;
      we design chemotherapy plus spleen radiotherapy to the subjects with advanced NSCLC,&#xD;
      simultaneously, who underwent grade II or worse CIT. The primary endpoint is the incidence of&#xD;
      severe CIT (≧grade III) in subsequent chemotherapy, the second endpoints are recovery time&#xD;
      from bone marrow suppression and progression free survival, and the exploring index is the&#xD;
      immulogical status.&#xD;
