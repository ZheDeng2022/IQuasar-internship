    <textblock>
      Closed loop technology has been shown to reduce both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, as well&#xD;
      as reduce glycemic variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several groups around the world investigate efforts in developing closed-loop systems.&#xD;
      Investigators combined two closed-loop systems with different mode of operation in order to&#xD;
      enhance the closed-loop system. The two systems are Hybrid closed-loop system and the&#xD;
      MD-Logic closed-loop system . The combined algorithm Hybrid logic closed loop (HLCL) was&#xD;
      tested 'In silico' and was proved to be safe and effective. The next step is to test the&#xD;
      system in a clinical study in a supervised environment in a camp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two systems were tested separately in several clinical studies and were proven to be safe&#xD;
      and effective in a diverse population of patients with type 1 diabetes. The MD-Logic system&#xD;
      for overnight use &quot;the GlucoSitter&quot; has a CE mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to collect data on the feasibility of the HLCL system in a camp&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

      for overnight use &quot;the GlucoSitter&quot; has a CE mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the overall management of the glycemic&#xD;
      control using this system including Safety. The data collected in this study will be used to&#xD;
      confirm/develop the HLCL System further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study include evaluation of the HLCL system in a monitored&#xD;
      setting (camp) with the following stresses:Exercise, high carbohydrate and high fat meals&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-arm, single-center, in clinic Investigation in subjects with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes on insulin pump therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of up to 10 subjects will be enrolled (age 18-40). A minimum of 6 days run-in period&#xD;
      with sensor augmented pump will be used to collect sensors and insulin data and to allow the&#xD;
      subject to become familiar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period - Camp:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the run-in period subjects will participate in a 5 day, 4 night study period in a&#xD;
      camp setting during which the HLCL feature will be studied.&#xD;
