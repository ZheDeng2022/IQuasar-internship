  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Wnt proteins belong to a family of proteins that have been demonstrated to play a role in&#xD;
      the formation and dissemination of tumours. The present project focuses on the critical role&#xD;
      of the Wnt-5a protein in the pathobiological processes that lead to metastatic cancer&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WntResearch has identified a formylated 6 amino acid peptide fragment, named Foxy-5, which&#xD;
      mimick the effects of Wnt-5a to impair migration of epithelial cancer cells and thereby&#xD;
      acting anti-metastatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the first clinical phase I study was to establish the recommended dose for a&#xD;
      clinical phase II study and enable further development of Foxy-5 as a first in class&#xD;
      anti-metastatic cancer drug. The study did not see any DLTs and therefore failed to reach&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD); no recommended phase II dose (RP2D) could therefore be&#xD;
      established based on toxicity. The aim of this study is to continue to establish the safety&#xD;
      profile of Foxy-5 in higher doses, and determine the RP2D for later stage development based&#xD;
      on any observed DLT's/MTD and further analysis of the pharmacodynamic profile of Foxy-5 to&#xD;
      determine the biological response dose (BRD).&#xD;
