      This study is being conducted to collect and analyze biospecimens (blood and urine) and&#xD;
      clinical data from patients with prostate cancer as well as healthy volunteers to better&#xD;
      understand the differences between cancer cells and normal tissues with the goal of&#xD;
      developing a better way to detect and track the treatment of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These samples are being collected to conduct research to accomplish the goal of&#xD;
           improving cancer therapies, biomarkers, and hopefully lead to more effective treatment&#xD;
           of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The samples that you are providing as a patient with prostate cancer will be used in&#xD;
           future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your biospecimens will be compared to the cancer and normal volunteer specimens from&#xD;
           other participants to understand genetic differences between normal and cancer cells.&#xD;
           Genetic material, including DNA and RNA, will be obtained from samples, stored, and used&#xD;
           for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical information and samples will be collected and stored for ongoing research. This&#xD;
           is a necessity because improved diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer in the&#xD;
           future depend upon the ongoing analysis of basic research findings and clinical&#xD;
           outcomes. This type of research may improve the lives of future patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men between the ages of 18 and 100 with a diagnosis of cancer undergoing standard therapy&#xD;
      with radiation may join.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 29,480 men will die of prostate&#xD;
      cancer in the United States in 2014. Many of these men were initially diagnosed with&#xD;
      aggressive prostate cancer (so-called &quot;high risk&quot; prostate cancer), often with cancer that&#xD;
      extended beyond the prostate gland itself or was of a high Gleason score, or was associated&#xD;
      with a Prostate Specific Antigen [PSA] level &gt; 20 ng/ml. In contrast to the more favorable&#xD;
      outcomes in men with low and intermediate risk disease, nearly 50% of men with high-risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer will have a recurrence of their cancer despite a complete course of&#xD;
      treatment. One of the mainstays of care for men with high-risk prostate cancer is a&#xD;
      combination of radiation therapy and hormone suppression (more appropriately called androgen&#xD;
      deprivation [ADT]). Despite advances, a clear need exists for improved clinical management of&#xD;
      high risk disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the challenges in the overall management of men with high risk prostate cancer is the&#xD;
      lack of a reliable test allowing clinicians to monitor tumor response both during and after&#xD;
      radiation therapy. The commonly used marker, prostate specific antigen (PSA), is less useful&#xD;
      in men receiving ADT. In these men, the PSA is level is strongly suppressed by the ADT and is&#xD;
      a less reliable surrogate for detecting active tumor. Importantly, ADT is given both during&#xD;
      and for up to 3 years following radiation therapy, limiting the utility of PSA testing for an&#xD;
      extended period of time during which the window for curative therapies may close. The&#xD;
      development of an accurate, noninvasive monitoring test is needed, to guide early&#xD;
      implementation of salvage strategies aimed at increasing the proportion of patients cured of&#xD;
      their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior research from our group and several others has demonstrated that prostate cancers&#xD;
      nearly universally harbor stable, cancer-specific changes (modifications) of the DNA.&#xD;
      Furthermore, published studies have shown that this modified (methylated) DNA can be readily&#xD;
      detected in urine and blood specimens from men with primary prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that large scale assessment of cancer-specific DNA changes and&#xD;
      rearrangements in the urine and plasma of prostate cancer patients using technology developed&#xD;
      by our group (qMBD-seq), will allow for more informative and accurate tracking of disease&#xD;
      burden and therapeutic response in men receiving radiation therapy and ADT for high-risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have two straightforward primary objectives for this pilot study. First we will&#xD;
      establish the background levels of modified DNA in individuals with no history of prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Second, investigators will quantify cancer-specific methylated DNA in men with known&#xD;
      high risk prostate cancer. Investigators will begin by collecting urine and plasma specimens&#xD;
      from normal volunteers. In parallel investigators will collect specimens for quantitation of&#xD;
      cancer-specific DNA modifications in men with known high-risk prostate cancer receiving&#xD;
      standard treatment in the Department of Radiation Oncology. Patient samples will be collected&#xD;
      at multiple time points before, during, and after radiation treatment and then will be&#xD;
      subjected to careful DNA sequencing and analysis. This will allow investigators to&#xD;
      simultaneously characterize and quantify prostate cancer specific DNA occurring anywhere in&#xD;
      the genome, thereby allowing investigators to predict which patients have prostate cancer&#xD;
      still present in their body after treatment even if the PSA is very low or undetectable. If&#xD;
      successful, this project will be an important first step in the development of a noninvasive&#xD;
      test to track disease burden and therapeutic response during and after radiation therapy for&#xD;
      high-risk prostate cancer.&#xD;
