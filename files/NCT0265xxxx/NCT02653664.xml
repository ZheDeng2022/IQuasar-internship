  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a significant problem for many Veterans, including new Veterans returning&#xD;
      from Iraq and Afghanistan. It is also associated with a number of other significant problems,&#xD;
      such as post-traumatic stress disorder and sleep problems. All of these can have significant&#xD;
      negative effects of the quality of life of Veterans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different types of treatment that have been used to treat chronic pain in the general&#xD;
      population include self-hypnosis, education about chronic pain, and teaching individuals how&#xD;
      to be more mindful. The purpose of this study is to see if these three treatments can help&#xD;
      decrease pain in Veterans. Additionally, the researchers want to determine if each of these&#xD;
      treatments can help reduce the negative consequences associated with pain, such as changes in&#xD;
      mood, sleep, and enjoyment of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different types of treatment that include self-hypnosis, education about chronic pain, and&#xD;
      learning skills on how to change how a person perceives his/her pain have been used to treat&#xD;
      chronic pain the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study of this study is to see if these different treatments can help&#xD;
      decrease pain and improve quality of life in Veterans with chronic pain, and determine how&#xD;
      and why these treatments are effective. A subject must have a Veteran status, have chronic&#xD;
      pain, speak English and be at least 18 years old to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Sub-Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain and sleep problems are common among Veterans. Study researchers believe the&#xD;
      treatment interventions provided as part of the main study will help improve pain and sleep.&#xD;
      However, the main study does not include a &quot;real time&quot; measurement of sleep nor does it&#xD;
      include any specific strategies for examining the relationship between sleep and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has shown that adequate sleep has been linked to improvements in pain&#xD;
      reports. Adversely, sleep deprivation has been found to increase pain perception since it&#xD;
      decreases a person's ability to disengage from pain. Therefore, the purpose of this sub-study&#xD;
      is to measure sleep in order to learn more about how it interacts with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the subjects in this sub-study will be Veterans recruited from VA Puget Sound who&#xD;
      experience moderate-to-severe chronic pain on a regular basis and who have enrolled in the&#xD;
      main study. Study investigators will enroll up to 135 subjects into the sub-study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrollment, research staff will administer a battery of five neuropsychological&#xD;
      measures assessing memory, information processing, and executive functioning. These measures&#xD;
      take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnotic and Relaxation Exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research staff member will administer in person the Modified Stanford Hypnotic Clinical&#xD;
      Scale (SHCS) to assess hypnotizability for all participants following enrollment but prior to&#xD;
      randomization. This measure takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Data and Demographic Form&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research staff member will then ask the participant to provide demographic data (age, sex,&#xD;
      marital status, income, education level, employment status) and deployment history (number&#xD;
      and month of deployments, whether deployment involved hostile duty) for descriptive purposes.&#xD;
      Study investigators will also ask participants their history of receiving the study&#xD;
      treatments, and the presence of history of military sexual trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline data and demographic form will take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete, and&#xD;
      may be completed following enrollment either in person or over the telephone at a later time&#xD;
      if more convenient for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain Wave Activity (or EEG) Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain wave activity will be assessed following enrollment by conducting a brain wave activity&#xD;
      or EEG assessment. The brain wave activity assessment will take place at the Integrated Brain&#xD;
      Imaging Center (IBIC) at the University of Washington main campus. The IBIC is a&#xD;
      research-dedicated technology center organized under the department of Radiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG will be sampled with an electrode array using an electrode net dipped in a saline&#xD;
      solution. The research staff member, an IBIC employee with a Without Compensation (WOC)&#xD;
      appointment at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS), will collect the EEG activity&#xD;
      data, and ask the participant to remain as still as possible during portions of the&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG technician will collect from the participant data regarding medication used within 24&#xD;
      hours of assessment. He/she will also ask the participant to rate the intensity of his or her&#xD;
      pain just before the assessment (current pain), after a few minutes of the assessment&#xD;
      (current pain and worst, least, and average pain over the past few minutes), and at the end&#xD;
      of the EEG session (current pain, and worst, least, and average pain over the past few&#xD;
      minutes), using 0-10 Numerical Rating Scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire brain wave activity assessment will take approximately 45-60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to complete the same brain activity assessment following completion of&#xD;
      treatment following the same procedures above. Participants may still participate in the&#xD;
      study if they decline to participate in the EEG assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Pre-Treatment and General Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective reports of pain intensity vary over time, and to most accurately measure pain&#xD;
      intensity (our primary outcome), it is most valid to assess multiple times and take an&#xD;
      average. Hence, study investigators have developed a method of assessment that will seek to&#xD;
      obtain up to four telephone assessments over a period of one week or 7 days with a minimum of&#xD;
      24 hours between each assessment. During each telephone contact, research staff will ask&#xD;
      participants, at minimum, to rate their current, average, worst and least pain intensity over&#xD;
      the past 24 hours, as well as their average pain intensity over the past 7 days. In addition,&#xD;
      if possible, research staff will ask the participant to rate their current, average, worst&#xD;
      and least pain intensity over the past week during the final telephone contact. These&#xD;
      assessments will be referred to as &quot;short assessments.&quot; The primary outcome will be an&#xD;
      average of all of the 24-hour ratings (range=1-4 ratings) of average pain intensity obtained&#xD;
      over a period of one week during each assessment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, sometime during this assessment period researchers will ask questions regarding&#xD;
      pain interference, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, post-traumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD) symptoms, medication use, medical services utilization, thoughts about pain and&#xD;
      treatment motivation. This latter set of questions will only be asked once during the&#xD;
      assessment period, and will be referred to as &quot;the long assessment.&quot; Research staff will give&#xD;
      participants the option to: 1) complete the long assessment during one of the four short&#xD;
      telephone assessments described above; or 2) spread the long assessment across several days&#xD;
      during the assessment period. The entire long assessment or portions thereof may fall up to&#xD;
      two days outside the 7-day period for the four short assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire time required to answer questions during the assessment period is 45-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment period described above will be completed prior to initiating treatment, and&#xD;
      then after completion of treatment sessions #2, 4 and 6 and 8 (i.e. post-treatment), and 3&#xD;
      and 6 months following the end of treatment for a total of seven times. These assessment&#xD;
      periods that occur following the start of treatment will also include questions about group&#xD;
      climate, therapeutic alliance with the group clinician, treatment satisfaction, and overall&#xD;
      improvement since the participant began the pain program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants who complete the required baseline components (cognitive assessment,&#xD;
      hypnotic and relaxation exercise, baseline data form, and pre-treatment assessment period)&#xD;
      will be randomized in stratified blocks to ensure that participants with each sex and pain&#xD;
      type (neuropathic, non-neuropathic, mixed or undetermined) have an equal chance of being&#xD;
      randomized to one of the 3 conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Scheduling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of study intervention groups will be offered beginning every four months. In each&#xD;
      4-month period, there will be two class options for each condition, one based in Seattle and&#xD;
      one at American Lake. Thus, there will be six classes offered per four month period, or a&#xD;
      total of 18 classes per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 15 participants can be enrolled in each intervention class; 10 spots will be protected&#xD;
      for research participants, and the remaining 5 for Veterans who have completed the study and&#xD;
      wish to try another type of intervention, or who are non-research participants. If any&#xD;
      protected research spots are not filled at the start of a cohort, non-research participants&#xD;
      will be offered those spots and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all three treatment conditions, intervention appointments will be scheduled in regular&#xD;
      group clinics at the VA facility (American Lake or Seattle). This means that treatment&#xD;
      sessions will appear on the Veterans' lists of regular clinical appointments. Although the&#xD;
      appointments are scheduled for 90 minutes, in practice they will last 60-80 minutes, with a&#xD;
      10 minute time cushion built in to allow for participants who may have mobility limitations&#xD;
      to arrive, settle, and then vacate the group rooms without hurrying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group sessions will be conducted by VAPSHCS providers who have undergone a formal two-day&#xD;
      training process that prepares clinicians to conduct each of the three treatment&#xD;
      interventions in a group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all conditions, home practice activities will be assigned to increase engagement in the&#xD;
      treatment. Participants will be asked to record the extent of engagement in these activities&#xD;
      using a form provided to them by the clinician. Study investigators realize that adherence to&#xD;
      interventions assigned outside of treatment sessions may influence study outcomes so will&#xD;
      utilize data collected by the clinicians about homework compliance. In addition, all&#xD;
      participants in all interventions will be given a treatment workbook with materials to refer&#xD;
      to and discuss during the group sessions as well as additional materials to read between&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please see below for description of study treatment interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collected during Treatment Sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete and hand in a form regarding their completion of tasks or&#xD;
      &quot;homework&quot; assigned by the clinician from the previous session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will complete and hand in forms before and after each session that&#xD;
      include questions regarding pain intensity and comfort level, as well as questions about what&#xD;
      the participants have found helpful or non-helpful about the treatment. Finally, study&#xD;
      clinicians will complete a form each session that captures information regarding the&#xD;
      perceived engagement of each participant in that particular session. All of these forms will&#xD;
      be labeled with a subject's name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audio Recordings&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group treatment sessions will be audio recorded to make sure the study clinician is&#xD;
      following study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pre-treatment and post-treatment telephone assessment periods, research staff will&#xD;
      use a script to invite participants upon completing the assessment period to participate in&#xD;
      an optional assessment consisting of two measures developed by study researchers. The&#xD;
      optional assessment should take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete, and consists of&#xD;
      questions about how participants feel when they feel pain or think about their pain problem,&#xD;
      and how participants respond to their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open Label Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of the 6-month telephone assessment period research staff will&#xD;
      invite participants to complete in one or both of the treatment groups they did not attend&#xD;
      during participation in the main phase. Participants would only participate in one treatment&#xD;
      group at a time. The open label phase does not include any screening procedures; all research&#xD;
      participants are welcome to participate. Research staff will schedule a consent session if&#xD;
      the participant is interested in participating in the 'open label phase' of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Sub-Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in the main study will be offered the opportunity to participate&#xD;
      concurrently in the sleep sub-study. All subjects enrolled in the main study are eligible to&#xD;
      participate in the sub-study. Interested subjects will participate in a separate informed&#xD;
      consent process before participating in sub-study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research staff member will ask each sub-study subject two questions about how much the&#xD;
      subject agrees with certain statements about his/her sleep, as well as two questions about&#xD;
      how confident the subject is about carrying our certain sleep behaviors. These questions will&#xD;
      be asked during the pre-treatment assessment period, 4-week assessment period, post-treatment&#xD;
      assessment period, and the assessment period that takes place 3 months following the end of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three times during his/her participation in the sub-study, study investigators will ask the&#xD;
      subject to keep a sleep diary: once following enrollment but prior to randomization, once&#xD;
      following the end of treatment, and once three months following the end of treatment. The&#xD;
      subject will complete a diary entry twice a day (morning and night) for seven days. In the&#xD;
      morning, the subject would answer basic questions about his/her sleep during the previous&#xD;
      night, including time the subject thinks s/he fell asleep, the quality of his/her sleep, and&#xD;
      any other experiences that might have affected his/her sleep. In the evening, the subject&#xD;
      will answer questions about how the subject felt that day, any problems s/he experienced such&#xD;
      as illness or discomfort, and basic activities s/he participated in like going to work,&#xD;
      napping, drinking caffeinated beverages, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the subject will be instructed to call a toll free number twice a day to report when&#xD;
      s/he woke up in the morning, and when s/he is going to sleep in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actigraphy Device&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three times during his/her participation in the sub-study, study investigators will ask the&#xD;
      subject to wear a sleep monitor device called an Actigraph: once following enrollment but&#xD;
      prior to randomization, once following the end of treatment, and once three months following&#xD;
      the end of treatment. The subject would wear the actigraph (Actiwatch , Philips Respironics,&#xD;
      Bend, OR) like a wrist watch on his/her non-dominant arm. The device will measure how long&#xD;
      the subject sleeps, as well as the overall quality of his/her sleep. The subject will wear&#xD;
      the actigraph at all times during the same 7-day period s/he is completing the sleep diary&#xD;
      except for when the subjects is participating in activities that might get the actigraph wet&#xD;
      like swimming, showering, or bathing.&#xD;

        <title>Change From Pre-Treatment in Average Pain Intensity on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale Immediately Following End of Treatment (Post-Treatment)</title>
        <description>An average of all of the 24-hour ratings (range=1-4 ratings) of average pain intensity was obtained over a period of one week during each assessment period, pre-treatment and post-treatment.&#xD;
Range: 0-10, 0='no pain' and 10 ='pain as bad as you can imagine'&#xD;
The difference between the two average scores from the different assessment periods (pre-treatment and post-treatment) was computed by subtracting the pre-treatment score from the post-treatment score, resulting in a change score. A negative value denotes a decrease in pain intensity between the two assessment periods, whereas a positive value denotes an increase.</description>
