  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/IIa trial studies the side effects and best dose of gene-modified T cells when&#xD;
      given with or without decitabine, and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      malignancies expressing cancer-testis antigens 1 (NY-ESO-1) gene that have spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (advanced). A T cell is a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill&#xD;
      abnormal cells of the body. Placing a modified gene for NY-ESO-1 into the patients' T cells&#xD;
      in the laboratory and then giving them back to the patient may help the body build an immune&#xD;
      response to kill tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet&#xD;
      known whether giving gene-modified T cells with or without decitabine works better in&#xD;
      treating patients with malignancies expressing NY-ESO-1.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of adoptive transfer of TGFbDNRII-transduced&#xD;
      autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (autologous NY-ESO-1 TCR/dnTGFbetaRII transgenic T&#xD;
      cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. NY-ESO-1 TCR/ dnTGFbetaRII transgenic T cell persistence by analyzing serial peripheral&#xD;
      blood samples for the presence of T cells with the NY-ESO-1 TCR by tetramer analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study T cell differentiation that correlates with higher anti-tumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To test the hypothesis that NY-ESO-1 TCR/dnTGFbetaRII will constitute in cells more&#xD;
      efficient in inducing tumor regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine objective tumor responses by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (irRECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the role of microbiota on the therapeutic efficacy of the proposed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of NY-ESO-1 TCR/TGFbDNRII-transduced TILs&#xD;
      followed by a phase IIa study. Participants are assigned 1 to 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients undergo leukapheresis on day -6, and receive cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -5 and -4. Patients then receive TGFbDNRII-transduced&#xD;
      autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Eligible patients who&#xD;
      showed initial response/disease control, may receive a second TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous&#xD;
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes infusion at any time after progression is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients undergo leukapheresis on day -6 and receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on&#xD;
      days -6 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Patients then receive&#xD;
      TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes IV over 15 minutes on day 0.&#xD;
      Eligible patients who showed initial response/disease control, may receive a second&#xD;
      TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes infusion at any time after&#xD;
      progression is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 1-4, 6, 8, and 12, at&#xD;
      6 and 9 months, every 6 months for 5 years, and then yearly for 10 years.&#xD;

          -  A second T cell infusion is discussed and the patient agrees to receive it&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Either cryopreserved extra cells from the first T cell product is available or&#xD;
             cryopreserved autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) is available for the&#xD;
             manufacture of a second transgenic T cell product&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously known hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents. Note: Patients who have suffered&#xD;
             &gt;grade 2 irAEs during previous checkpoint inhibitor therapy should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements; electrocardiogram (EKG) will be done at screening; cardiac stress&#xD;
             test will be done as clinically indicated, the specific test to be chosen at the&#xD;
             discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe autoimmune disease requiring steroids or other immunosuppressive&#xD;
             treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or other chronic&#xD;
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea or bleeding, which in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion would place the patient at an increased risk for adverse effect&#xD;
             or current acute colitis of any origin; treated cases with no active disease are&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential requirement for systemic corticosteroids or concurrent immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs based on prior history or received systemic steroids within the last 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to enrollment (inhaled or topical steroids at standard doses or isolated use of&#xD;
             steroids as premedication for medical procedures to minimize allergic reaction [e.g.&#xD;
             computed tomography (CT) scan dye] are allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, hepatitis&#xD;
             C or cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known cases of clinically active brain metastases (brain magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
             [MRI] as clinically indicated); prior evidence of brain metastasis successfully&#xD;
             treated with surgery or radiation therapy will not be exclusion for participation as&#xD;
             long as they are deemed under control at the time of study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding&#xD;
             or rendering of compliance with the requirements of this protocol even with caregiver&#xD;
             support&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding; female patients must be surgically sterile or be&#xD;
             postmenopausal for two years, or must agree to use effective contraception during the&#xD;
             period of treatment and 6 months after; all female patients with reproductive&#xD;
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum/urine) within 48 hours from&#xD;
             starting the conditioning chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of availability of a patient for immunological and clinical follow-up assessment&#xD;
