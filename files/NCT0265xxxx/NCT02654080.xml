      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an HIV-1 nef/tat/vif,&#xD;
      env pDNA vaccine delivered with electroporation (EP), followed by a recombinant vesicular&#xD;
      stomatitis virus (rVSV) HIV envC vaccine boost, in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of an HIV-1 nef/tat/vif, env pDNA&#xD;
      vaccine delivered with EP, followed by a rVSV HIV envC vaccine boost, in healthy,&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Participants in Group 1 will&#xD;
      receive the HIV-1 nef/tat/vif, env pDNA vaccine at Day 0 and Months 1 and 3, followed by the&#xD;
      rVSV HIV envC vaccine boost at Months 6 and 9. Participants in Group 2 will receive placebo&#xD;
      vaccine at Day 0 and Months 1, 3, 6, and 9. Study visits will occur at Day 0, Week 2, and&#xD;
      Months 1, 1.5, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 6, 6.25, 6.5, 9, 9.25, 9.5, 12, and 15. Visits may include&#xD;
      physical examinations, urine collection, blood collection, HIV testing, risk reduction&#xD;
      counseling, assessments, and questionnaires. Participants will be contacted by study staff&#xD;
      for follow-up monitoring annually for 3 years following the initial study injection.&#xD;
