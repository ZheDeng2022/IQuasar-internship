    <textblock>
      To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the New Orleans Intervention Method (NIM)&#xD;
      in relation to an enhanced services as usual model, Case Management (CM), for the management&#xD;
      of maltreated infants and young children entering care in the United Kingdom (UK) .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children who have experienced abuse and neglect are at increased risk of mental and physical&#xD;
      health problems throughout life. This places an enormous burden on individuals, families and&#xD;
      society. Regardless of the severity of this abuse and neglect, these negative effects can&#xD;
      largely be reversed if children are placed in secure, loving homes early enough in life.&#xD;
      Placing children in nurturing foster placements can help them recover rapidly, but it is not&#xD;
      known whether it is better for children's long term development to place them with substitute&#xD;
      (foster or adoptive) families or return them to birth or extended families. Efforts to&#xD;
      improve the mental health of maltreated children in birth families or foster placements have&#xD;
      had mixed success and researchers have recommended that far more intensive approaches are&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have carried out careful exploratory research, in Glasgow, on an intensive&#xD;
      approach, which was developed in the United States. This is was investigators have called&#xD;
      this the New Orleans Intervention Model (NIM). NIM offers families who have a child who&#xD;
      enters care due to abuse or neglect a structured assessment of family relationships followed&#xD;
      by an intensive treatment that aims to improve family functioning and child mental health. If&#xD;
      adequate change is achieved a recommendation is made for the child to return home but, if&#xD;
      not, the recommendation is for adoption. Preliminary research from the US suggests that NIM&#xD;
      might reduce future maltreatment of the child and other children in the family, and improve&#xD;
      mental health in middle childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are currently conducting a study in which, since December 2011, has&#xD;
      recruited around two-thirds of all maltreated children aged 0 to 5 years coming into an&#xD;
      episode of care in Glasgow. Half of the families who are taking part receive NIM, which is&#xD;
      delivered by a multidisciplinary team comprising health and social care professionals. The&#xD;
      remaining half of families will receive usual services, which is delivered by social workers.&#xD;
      Preliminary findings suggest that NIM is acceptable to parents, foster carers, social workers&#xD;
      and legal professionals. Investigators added an additional site, London, as there is a need&#xD;
      to test whether NIM is effective, in terms of both clinical outcomes and cost, in the&#xD;
      different legal systems across England and Scotland. The plan is to launch NIM teams at these&#xD;
      sites in 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators, therefore, propose a study of NIM involving a continuation of our current&#xD;
      Glasgow work and including 1-2 additional sites. This will involve approximately 500 children&#xD;
      (396 families) in total across the sites, including those recruited in our current Glasgow&#xD;
      internal pilot study. This will determine whether or not NIM is effective in the UK and to&#xD;
      follow up Glasgow children for five years to examine longer term effects on mental health.&#xD;
