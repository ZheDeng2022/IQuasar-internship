      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that INTERCEPT Blood System for&#xD;
      platelet components stored for 6 or 7 days after INTERCEPT Blood System treatment retain&#xD;
      sufficient viability for therapeutic efficacy. The post-infusion recovery and lifespan of&#xD;
      autologous INTERCEPT Blood System for platelet components in 35% plasma/65% InterSol (Test&#xD;
      platelets) stored for 6 or 7 days will be measured in comparison to &quot;fresh&quot; autologous&#xD;
      radiolabeled platelets (Control platelets) according to FDA guidance for platelet testing&#xD;
      (FDA 1999). Recovery and lifespan results between components stored for 6 and 7 days will&#xD;
      also be assessed.&#xD;

      For each of the 2 study donation periods, this study will have the following procedures:&#xD;
      single or double dose platelet apheresis collection, pathogen inactivation with INTERCEPT&#xD;
      Blood System treatment, storage for 6 or 7 days (depending on the period and randomization&#xD;
      scheme) at 20°C to 24°C with agitation, collection of &quot;fresh&quot; autologous platelets,&#xD;
      radiolabeling, infusion of fresh and stored INTERCEPT Blood System-treated radiolabeled&#xD;
      autologous platelets, and collection of blood samples for assessment of platelet recovery and&#xD;
      survival (lifespan). There will be a minimum wash-out period of two weeks between the two&#xD;
      study periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apheresis platelets will be collected using the Amicus separator and stored for 6 or 7 days&#xD;
      (depending on the period and randomization scheme) in 35% plasma/65% InterSol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures will be as follows: On Day 0, each healthy volunteer subject has apheresis&#xD;
      platelets collected. INTERCEPT Blood System treatment will begin on either the day of&#xD;
      donation (Day 0) or the day following donation (Day 1) and will be completed within 24 hours&#xD;
      after collection. Platelets will then be stored for 6 or 7 days after collection (depending&#xD;
      on the period and randomization scheme) at 22°C ±2°C with agitation. Aliquots for in vitro&#xD;
      platelet function will be taken on Day 0/1 before INTERCEPT Blood System treatment and on Day&#xD;
      6 or 7. On Day 6 or 7, healthy volunteers will return to the site, and 43 mL of blood will be&#xD;
      drawn into a syringe containing 9 mL of Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose Solution, Formula A&#xD;
      (ACD-A). Fresh platelets will be prepared from this sample. An aliquot (10-20 mL) of the&#xD;
      stored INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets will be aseptically removed from each subject's&#xD;
      test container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously stored (Test) and fresh (Control) platelets will be radiolabeled according to&#xD;
      randomization assignment with either Chromium-51 (51Cr) (≤20 μCi) as sodium radiochromate&#xD;
      (Na251CrO4) or Indium-111 (111In) (≤15 μCi) as indium oxine, following the labeling and&#xD;
      washing procedures outlined by the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST)&#xD;
      Collaborative. The isotope labels will be assigned randomly with equal probability that fresh&#xD;
      platelets and stored INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets will be labeled with each isotope.,&#xD;
      and the same randomization assignment of isotope labels will be utilized for both donation&#xD;
      periods for the same subject. Aliquots of the fresh and stored platelets will be radiolabeled&#xD;
      in tubes with the standard techniques. After radiolabeling, the autologous fresh and stored&#xD;
      INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets will be simultaneously infused into the subject&#xD;
      (approximately 10-30 mL). Negative pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential are&#xD;
      required before infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for radioactivity measurements will be drawn immediately before infusion and at&#xD;
      approximately 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 hours post-infusion, and then 6 more samples will be drawn at&#xD;
      1, 2, 3, 4 (or 6), 7, and 11±1 days post-infusion, at approximately the same time of day as&#xD;
      the radiolabeled platelet infusion was administered (±4 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for safety (adverse events) from the beginning of the study until&#xD;
      10 days following the infusion of radiolabelled platelets in period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioactivity measurements Samples will be obtained from the radiolabeled fresh and stored&#xD;
      INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets before infusion and used as a radioactive standard. By&#xD;
      measuring the volume infused, the total dose of radioactivity infused will be calculated. In&#xD;
      vitro elution of the label from the transfused platelets will be determined by the BEST&#xD;
      elution assessment method, as well as the in vivo elution of radioactivity from the serial&#xD;
      blood samples obtained post-infusion of the labeled platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard as well as the subject's whole-blood samples will be corrected for elution and&#xD;
      also for the residual activity in the cellular fraction one day after the infusion. Data&#xD;
      points 24 hours post-infusion will be used to calculate in vivo recovery after all&#xD;
      radioactive corrections have been made. The radioactivity of the samples will be determined&#xD;
      by use of a gamma counter. A multiple-hit model will be used to estimate the survival of the&#xD;
      radioactively labeled platelets.&#xD;
