  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Feeding-Exercise Trial in Adolescents (FETA) was a randomised controlled intervention&#xD;
      study designed to promote healthy weight in overweigh and obese adolescents through a&#xD;
      professional-delivered, community-based program with active parents' involvement, focused on&#xD;
      supervised physical activity and structured nutritional education. The aim of FETA was to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of two intervention groups- physical activity in isolation and combination&#xD;
      of physical activity with provision of dietary information- for improving overweight and&#xD;
      obesity in adolescents. Our primary hypothesis was that a combined program would be more&#xD;
      efficacious than activity in isolation and that activity alone would also be effective&#xD;
      compared to control group in improving adiposity profiles in overweight and obese adolescents&#xD;
      as well as family activity and feeding habits.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All students from the 15 public middle schools in the city of Larissa in central Greece were&#xD;
      invited to measure their weight and height, in order to calculate their Body Mass Index&#xD;
      (BMI). All the overweight or obese students were invited to take part in the study. The&#xD;
      participation was free of charge for the children. Parents were informed about the purposes&#xD;
      of the project and were asked to provide written informed consent for participation. The&#xD;
      study's protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Department of the&#xD;
      University of Thessaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred eighty one adolescents were enrolled and randomized in the three groups of the&#xD;
      study, by the same professional teacher of physical education who conducted the program. One&#xD;
      hundred fifty remained the end of the program and the 6-months follow up and were included in&#xD;
      the analysis. None of the subjects had an organic cause for his/her obesity and none received&#xD;
      any medication, which would interfere with growth or weight control (e.g. corticosteroids,&#xD;
      thyroid hormone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FETA project involved one control and two intervention groups: a Physical Activity Skill&#xD;
      Development Program (Activity) and a combination of a Dietary Information and a Physical&#xD;
      Activity Skill Development Program (Diet and Activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity Skill Development Program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adolescents participated in a three-day per week training programme (45 minutes per&#xD;
      training session). Training was directed by a professional teacher of physical education in a&#xD;
      public training centre. The training program was designed according to the type and intensity&#xD;
      of exercise that school children normally perform. Many activities were delivered as games in&#xD;
      order to encourage enthusiasm and participation. Endurance type activities accounted for most&#xD;
      of the time spent in training (about 50% team sports and 50% running games), with attention&#xD;
      to coordination and flexibility skills. In order to encourage adolescents' behaviour change,&#xD;
      they were instructed to add an extra 30-45 minutes of walking or other sport activity of&#xD;
      their preference at least once a week and to reduce inactivity (discouraging television&#xD;
      watching and playing video games and encouraging the use of stairs instead of lifts and&#xD;
      playing outdoors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured nutrition education:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, to the training sessions, the participants of the combined intervention&#xD;
      attended a structure nutrition educational program. In the introductory meeting (45-60&#xD;
      minutes) general information was presented about the reasons behind childhood obesity,&#xD;
      dietary and cooking habits and the motivation for weight loss in an effort to involve the&#xD;
      whole family in the ''battle'' against obesity. During all the following meetings, before the&#xD;
      initiation of the training sessions, 10 to 15 minutes were devoted to an interactive&#xD;
      discussion with participants on food pyramid, food choices, food labels, food preparation and&#xD;
      cooking, eating habits, regular meals, controlling environments that stimulate overeating.&#xD;
      The topics discussed were given to the adolescents in the form of a printed notebook, while&#xD;
      parents were also invited to attend these sessions. The discussions were led by the same&#xD;
      person who performed the training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the outcomes measures were taken at baseline and every month until the end of the sixth&#xD;
      month, when the 3-month follow up period after the intervention ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anthropometric measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Students were weighed on a digital scale twice and the average was recorded.&#xD;
           Participants removed shoes and jackets before heights and weights were measured.&#xD;
           Participants' heights were measured using a metric measuring tape affixed on the wall.&#xD;
           Body weight and height were measured using the same instruments, at the same place and&#xD;
           day of the week, before the start of the day's program. Non-extensible steel tapes were&#xD;
           used to assess waist circumference, which was measured at the level of the mid point&#xD;
           between the lower costal border and the iliac crest. All the anthropometric measures&#xD;
           were conducted using the International Society for the Advancement of Kin anthropometry&#xD;
           procedures. BMI was determined according to the following formula: BMI=&#xD;
           [weight/height2]. We used the cut off points for the BMI in childhood presented by Cole&#xD;
           et al in order to allow international comparisons with our findings in the prevalence of&#xD;
           overweight and obesity. Pulses per minute were measured using an automated blood&#xD;
           pressure monitor under standardised procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fitness assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pre- and post- intervention evaluations (at 3 and 6 months) of physical fitness were&#xD;
           based on the EUROFIT Tests Protocol designed by the Committee of Experts on Sports&#xD;
           Research that has been used in several European countries. The 50m sprint Run Test that&#xD;
           was used is a test for the evaluation of speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified version of the Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire (FEAHQ) was&#xD;
      completed by parents and adolescents. FEAHQ is divided into four subscales: activity level (4&#xD;
      items), stimulus exposure (8 items), eating related to hunger (4 items), and eating style (13&#xD;
      items).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized adolescents in each group were not aware of the existence of the other two&#xD;
      study groups. This was achievable by programming the attendance of each group at different&#xD;
      hours, even on the same days. Moreover their parents were also unaware of the study's design.&#xD;
      Finally, all the participants from each of the three groups- both adolescents and parents-&#xD;
      were asked not to discuss their study experience until the completion of the follow up, at&#xD;
      6-months from the initiation of the study.&#xD;
