      The purpose of this study is to determine whether hypnosis is efficacious in reducing&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain in breast cancer survivors taking aromatase inhibitors, and by doing so,&#xD;
      whether hypnosis can help survivors to be more adherent to their medication regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hypnosis for reducing&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain (MSP) in women taking aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for breast cancer.&#xD;
      Research indicates that AIs are associated with musculoskeletal pain in up to 61% of breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors. AI-associated MSP can include joint pain in the wrists, hands, and knees;&#xD;
      carpal tunnel syndrome and trigger finger; and decreased grip strength, morning stiffness,&#xD;
      and general muscle pain. MSP can lead to difficulty performing daily activities and can&#xD;
      reduce quality of life in breast cancer survivors. This pain is not only aversive in and of&#xD;
      itself, but also is associated with non-adherence to prescribed, daily AI regimens. In some&#xD;
      studies, AI non-adherence estimates were as high as 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time, there is no &quot;gold standard&quot; treatment for AI-associated MSP. What is&#xD;
      needed is an intervention that: reduces breast cancer survivors' MSP and helps them be more&#xD;
      adherent to their prescribed AI regimen, does not have side-effects of its own, does not&#xD;
      place a large time or financial burden on survivors, and which can be taught to survivors to&#xD;
      practice on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnosis, a mind-body intervention, has been widely demonstrated to reduce pain. In fact,&#xD;
      analgesia is perhaps the best known effect of hypnosis. Meta-analyses have consistently&#xD;
      supported the efficacy of hypnosis for pain control, including chronic pain. Hypnosis also&#xD;
      has a long tradition in cancer symptom management, especially for pain reduction. Hypnosis&#xD;
      has been defined as an agreement between a person designated as the hypnotist (e.g., health&#xD;
      care professional) and a person designated as the client or patient to participate in a&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic technique based on the hypnotist providing suggestions for changes in&#xD;
      sensation, perception, cognition, affect, mood, or behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine whether or not hypnosis is helpful in reducing breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors' AI-related MSP and in improving their adherence to their prescribed AI regimen.&#xD;
      This study will also examine whether the hypnosis intervention is cost effective. To answer&#xD;
      these questions, this randomized clinical trial will compare hypnosis (three sessions) to a&#xD;
      non-hypnosis, attention control, empathic listening condition (three sessions). For each&#xD;
      intervention, the first session will be approximately 40 minutes, and sessions 2 and 3 will&#xD;
      be approximately 30 minutes each. Both interventions will be delivered face-to-face, by a&#xD;
      doctoral-level psychology professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be taking AIs for breast cancer, will be experiencing some&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain since starting AIs (≥3 on a 10 point scale), and will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of the two intervention groups. Study participants will be asked to complete measures of&#xD;
      pain, AI adherence, and other behavioral and psychosocial measures over the course of&#xD;
      12-month period. The follow-up assessments will evaluate the clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of hypnosis versus professional attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, this project is a critical step towards reducing the struggles of breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors experiencing AI-related MSP, and associated non-adherence. By reducing MSP and&#xD;
      improving AI adherence, the hypnosis intervention tested here has the potential to improve&#xD;
      quality of life and well-being.&#xD;

    <description>The hypnosis intervention involves three parts. First, participants will receive three, face-to-face hypnosis sessions delivered by doctoral-level psychology professionals. The sessions are based on materials developed by experienced psychologists in the Integrative Behavioral Medicine Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Second, participants will be taught how to use hypnosis themselves (self-hypnosis) to help manage their pain. Third, participants will receive a hypnosis recording to listen to in-between sessions and throughout the course of the study. At home hypnosis practice will be recommended.&#xD;
Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires over a period of 12 months.</description>

    <description>The attention control intervention involves three face-to-face meetings with a doctoral-level psychology professional. During these sessions, participants will be asked to discuss with the interventionist their experience of taking aromatase inhibitors and associated musculoskeletal pain. The interventionist will not lead the patient in imagery, relaxation, evaluation of thought processes, or even simple discussion. Rather interventionists will allow the patient to direct the flow of the conversation and will provide support and empathy. Interventionist contact time in AC sessions will be identical to that in the hypnosis group. Overall, the attention control intervention will control for professional attention.&#xD;
Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires over a period of 12 months.</description>
