  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently published European guidance recommends the evaluation of the radiation dose to the&#xD;
      bone marrow in patients undergoing radioiodine therapy for thyroid cancer. The methods&#xD;
      described in these guidelines require serial blood samples to be taken from the patient,&#xD;
      followed by a sophisticated analysis to determine the radiation dose. However, radiation risk&#xD;
      assessments carried out locally have indicated that a relatively high radiation exposure will&#xD;
      be received by the operator taking the blood samples, which may prohibit this procedure being&#xD;
      carried out routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiation dose to the operator will be lowered if the duration of the blood sampling&#xD;
      procedure were reduced. The investigators hypothesize that the use of a lancet and pipette to&#xD;
      collect blood from the finger tip will greatly reduce the time spent in proximity to the&#xD;
      patient, significantly reducing the operator exposure and allowing this procedure to be&#xD;
      performed routinely. The proposed method is also less invasive for the patient compared to&#xD;
      the intravenous sampling recommended in the guidelines. A proof-of-principal pilot project&#xD;
      using radioiodine diluted to the expected concentration in blood has indicated that using&#xD;
      very small volumes of blood (such as from a lancet) does not compromise the accuracy of the&#xD;
      dosimetry measurement when compared to large-volume standard blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether sampling a small volume of blood&#xD;
      using a lancet and pipette can replace standard intravenous blood samples for bone marrow&#xD;
      dosimetry in patients undergoing radioiodine treatment for thyroid cancer. Statistical tests&#xD;
      will determine whether there is a significant difference between the doses calculated using&#xD;
      each blood sampling method. In addition, the investigators will measure the radiation&#xD;
      exposure received by the operator during each procedure using Electronic Portable Dosimeters.&#xD;
      The results of these measurements will be used to quantify the reduction in operator&#xD;
      radiation exposure afforded by the new technique.&#xD;

      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited to the trial from the pool of routine referrals for this therapy.&#xD;
      Potential participants will receive an information leaflet via the post several weeks in&#xD;
      advance of attendance at clinic. Patients will have the opportunity to telephone the study&#xD;
      team during this time to answer any questions. Patients who are interested in participating&#xD;
      will have the procedure further explained verbally by a physicist on the study team upon&#xD;
      attending for therapy. The patient will then have time to consider whether or not to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Written consent will be sought before commencing the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the recent guidelines, the proposed new clinical protocol will include blood&#xD;
      samples taken from the patient during the in-patient stay. On the day of treatment, blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken at 2h and 6h after radioiodine administration, at the same time as the&#xD;
      clearance measurements. Thereafter, a blood sample will be taken from the patient once per&#xD;
      day, at the same time as one of the clearance measurements. In addition, a further blood&#xD;
      sample will be taken when the patient attends for whole-body and SPECT/CT scans. These blood&#xD;
      samples will then be analysed in the laboratory using standard radiation measurement&#xD;
      procedures to determine the blood dose according to the European guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve the patient having blood samples taken by two different methods at&#xD;
      each of the time points described above. In the first method, a butterfly needle will be used&#xD;
      to gain intravenous access at the antecubital fossa, and a heparinised vacutainer will be&#xD;
      used to collect a 4ml blood sample. The needle will then be removed and the venepuncture site&#xD;
      dressed with a plaster. In the second method, a single-use safety lancet will be used to&#xD;
      puncture the skin on the finger, and a small pipette used to collect a small quantity of&#xD;
      blood. The entire pipette will be transferred to a sample tube for later processing. The&#xD;
      puncture site on the finger will then be dressed with a small plaster. The exact start and&#xD;
      end times for each sample will be recorded using a radio-controlled standard clock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While carrying out blood sampling, the operator will wear an electronic portable dosimeter&#xD;
      (EPD) to measure radiation exposure. This device will be positioned on the operator's chest&#xD;
      to reflect the whole body dose received, and will be configured to record the radiation dose&#xD;
      as a function of time during the procedure. After the procedure, the data from the EPD will&#xD;
      be downloaded and split into two segments representing each blood sampling procedure, using&#xD;
      the recorded timing information. Each segment will then be integrated to give the total&#xD;
      radiation exposure received by the operator for each procedure. At the end of the treatment,&#xD;
      patients will be asked which of the two blood sampling methods were the most tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each sample will be labelled with the patient identification number, the date, time and&#xD;
      radioisotope (I-131). To minimise the risk of spills, the samples will be transferred to a&#xD;
      tray and moved to the Nuclear Medicine Department using a trolley. Sample manipulations will&#xD;
      be carried out in the low level counting laboratory in the Nuclear Medicine Department. Three&#xD;
      1ml aliquots of whole blood will be removed from each vacutainer and transferred to&#xD;
      appropriately labelled sample containers using an Eppendorf pipette. The volume of the&#xD;
      samples collected by pipette will be determined by measuring the weight of the sample and&#xD;
      subtracting the previously determined combined weight of the empty pipette and sample tube.&#xD;
      Once all the blood samples have been collected and processed, measurements will be taken in&#xD;
      an automated gamma counter to determine the concentration of radioiodine. The counting time&#xD;
      for the pipette samples will be increased compared to the intravenous samples, in order to&#xD;
      ensure the final dosimetry calculations are not influenced by the statistical uncertainty in&#xD;
      the measured counts from the smaller volume samples. The resulting data will then be used in&#xD;
      the detailed dosimetry calculations, in accordance with the published European guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no published data available on the intra-patient variation of bone marrow dose using&#xD;
      either of the two proposed blood sampling methods. Without knowledge of the expected&#xD;
      variances of the measurements in question, accurate sample size calculations are not possible&#xD;
      prior to commencing the study. A sample size of 35 patients will be used in this pilot study&#xD;
      - this sample size was chosen based on the number of patients seen in the department for this&#xD;
      therapy. Recruiting a sample size of 35 patients is achievable within a 2 year time frame.&#xD;
      However, the study will be stopped early if the total annual radiation exposure to the&#xD;
      operators, combined with the total radiation exposure due to normal clinical workload, is&#xD;
      likely to exceed the annual UK dose constraint of 2mSv for whole body radiation exposure (The&#xD;
      Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999, SI 1999/3232).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the measured concentrations of radioiodine in the blood samples, the radiation dose to&#xD;
      the bone marrow of each participant will be calculated following the methods described in&#xD;
      European guidance (Luster et al, Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 35(10) 1941 2008). This&#xD;
      calculation will be performed for each of the two blood sampling methods, creating paired&#xD;
      measurements of the same variable for each participant. The statistical significance of the&#xD;
      percentage difference in bone marrow dose calculated from each blood sampling method will&#xD;
      then be assessed using a Wilcoxon matched pairs test with the null hypothesis that there is&#xD;
      no difference in the calculated bone marrow doses. This study has 80% power to demonstrate at&#xD;
      the 5% level of statistical significance a difference of no less than 5% between the mean&#xD;
      values for the two bone marrow doses. Therefore statistical analysis of the differences has&#xD;
      80% power to show that the null hypothesis that the difference is no greater than 5% is&#xD;
      tenable, if indeed this null hypothesis holds true in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiation exposure received by the operator during each blood sampling procedure will be&#xD;
      measured using an Electronic Portable Dosimeter (EPD) worn on the chest of the operator. The&#xD;
      data will be split into two using the known start and end times of each blood sampling&#xD;
      procedure. The data will then be integrated over each time period to calculate the total&#xD;
      radiation dose for each interval. This will create paired measurements of the same variable&#xD;
      for each blood sampling event for each participant. The statistical significance of the&#xD;
      percentage difference in the radiation exposures received by the operator during each blood&#xD;
      sampling method will then be assessed using a Wilcoxon matched paired test with the null&#xD;
      hypothesis that there is no difference between the measured radiation doses. The aim in this&#xD;
      case is to show statistically that the null hypothesis of no difference in the mean radiation&#xD;
      doses for the 2 techniques is untenable.&#xD;
