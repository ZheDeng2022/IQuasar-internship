    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of 3 different dosages (20µg -&#xD;
      50µg and 100µg) of a placental malaria vaccine candidate (PRIMVAC vaccine) adjuvanted either&#xD;
      with Alhydrogel® or GLA-SE, and administered at D0, D28 and D56 in healthy European and&#xD;
      Burkinabe adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and the tolerability of the vaccine will be assessed on the rate of solicited and&#xD;
      unsolicited events/reactions The safety profile will included local and systemic&#xD;
      reactions/events as well as the biological safety, based on a clinically significant change&#xD;
      of the baseline value of the main biological criteria&#xD;

      The project aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective is to evaluate the safety of 3 different dosages (20µg - 50µg and&#xD;
           100µg) of the PRIMVAC vaccine adjuvanted either with Alhydrogel® or GLA-SE, and&#xD;
           administered at D0, D28 and D56 in healthy European and Burkinabe adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives are to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the humoral immune response to the PRIMVAC vaccine antigen (VAR2CSA) by measuring&#xD;
                the variation in the level of total IgG and the level of the isotypic subtypes&#xD;
                capable of recognizing the native antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the cellular immune response by measuring:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  the number of T cell secreting IL5 and IFNg following an ex-vivo stimulation&#xD;
                     with the vaccine antigen&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  the B lymphocyte phenotypes isolated from PBMC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To explore the quality of the humoral immune response by the measure of the&#xD;
                capability of the antibodies specific to the vaccine antigen to:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Cross-react with different VAR2CSA variants expressed on the surface of&#xD;
                     erythrocytes infected by various strains of Plasmodium falciparum,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Inhibit interactions between parasitized erythrocytes expressing different&#xD;
                     VAR2CSA variants and Chondroitin Sulfate A (receptor involved in placental&#xD;
                     sequestration),&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Promote opsonic phagocytosis of parasitized erythrocytes with various strains&#xD;
                     of Plasmodium falciparum expressing different VAR2CSA variants&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To explore the quality of the cellular immune response induced by the vaccine&#xD;
                antigen by the quantitation of a large panel of cytokines in the ELISpot&#xD;
                supernatants.&#xD;
