  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, blinded trial in healthy volunteers. The volunteers will&#xD;
      receive bilateral placement of the new catheter corresponding to the adductor canal. Each&#xD;
      volunteer will have a catheter placed in the adductor canal in both legs. The catheters are&#xD;
      randomized to be placed either in the long-axis or short-axis plane of the adductor canal.&#xD;
      Both catheters will be injected with local analgesics (LA). Allocation will be blinded to the&#xD;
      volunteer and the investigator assessing sensory function. The volunteers will be sent home&#xD;
      with the catheter in situ and return the following day. Injection with LA is repeated and&#xD;
      sensory function is tested again. Furthermore catheter position is determined with ultrasound&#xD;
      during injection. If sensory function is not affected by injection of LA then the catheter is&#xD;
      visualized with ultrasound and repositioned followed by a second injection of LA and&#xD;
      subsequent assessment of sensory function&#xD;

      3.2.1 Allocation concealment The volunteers are randomized using sealed opaque envelopes with&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio. The randomization defines which leg will be used for insertion of a catheter in&#xD;
      the long-axis plane and which leg will be used for insertion in the short-axis plane of the&#xD;
      adductor canal. The envelopes are prepared by health personnel with no relation to the study&#xD;
      based on a computer-generated list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.2 Blinding Volunteers will be blinded to allocation. An opaque sterile draping will be&#xD;
      used for insertion to prevent volunteers from observing the catheter insertion. After&#xD;
      insertion the catheters will be covered with bandages to prevent unblinding of the&#xD;
      volunteers. The investigator responsible for insertion of the catheters will leave the room&#xD;
      after insertion and a separate assessor blinded to allocation will perform outcome&#xD;
      assessments. On day 2 the investigator responsible for primary insertion will assess catheter&#xD;
      position with ultra-sound (US), record a video for the assessors, injection of local&#xD;
      anesthetics and cover the catheter in bandages. A separate blinded assessor will again&#xD;
      perform the outcome assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.3 Execution During catheter placement the volunteers are monitored using pulse oximetry&#xD;
      and a secure intravenous access is obtained. A baseline sensory assessment is performed where&#xD;
      cold sensation on the medial side of the lower leg is tested using alcohol swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A peripheral nerve catheter will be inserted on each side under US guidance. This involves&#xD;
      skin punctures at the site of insertion and at the exit site. To facilitate insertion the&#xD;
      skin is locally infiltrated with lidocaine. Intravenous analgesia is provided if necessary&#xD;
      (alfentanil 0.5mg/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One catheter is inserted in the short-axis plane of the adductor canal using an in plane&#xD;
      technique. The second catheter is inserted in the long-axis plane using a dynamic combination&#xD;
      of in plane and out of plane techniques. 10ml of normal saline is used for hydro dissection&#xD;
      in both catheters. When the catheters are in place 15 mL of LA (lidocaine 10mg/ml) is&#xD;
      injected in each catheter. Distance from catheter orifice to artery is noted in the short&#xD;
      axis group and distance from catheter orifice to fascia penetration is noted in the long axis&#xD;
      group. After injection, the catheters are fixated to the skin with dressings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful primary placement of the catheters will be tested 30 minutes after injection by a&#xD;
      blinded investigator using a bilateral assessment of sensory function as described&#xD;
      previously. Furthermore, cutaneous mapping is performed to assess affected cutaneous area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently the volunteers are sent home with the catheter in situ and return the following&#xD;
      day. The volunteers are instructed not to exercise -i.e. running, cycling, weight training&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 2 the catheter position is assessed with US during injection of LA and the distance&#xD;
      from catheter orifice to artery/fascia is determined. A sensory assessment is performed. If&#xD;
      there is no loss of cold sensation the catheter is registered as displaced and is therefore&#xD;
      manually repositioned and injected with LA using US guidance. Assessment of cold sensation is&#xD;
      repeated. Further, two investigators will independently watch a video clip of the injection&#xD;
      procedure to assess whether the position is within the adductor canal. Total duration of&#xD;
      participation for the individual volunteers will be 2 days.&#xD;
