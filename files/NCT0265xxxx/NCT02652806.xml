    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled study of the treatment of&#xD;
      anemia in subjects with CKD on dialysis. Eligible subjects are randomized to FG-4592 or&#xD;
      epoetin alfa at a ratio of 2:1. The primary endpoint is Hb mean change from baseline averaged&#xD;
      over Weeks 23 to 27.&#xD;
