    <textblock>
      Multicenter observational survey of the presence of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) on trans&#xD;
      vaginal ultrasound (TVUS) probes, and of the behavior of professionals during US examination&#xD;
      and probe disinfection. This will allow modeling the risk of HPV transmission, and could&#xD;
      contribute establishing future guidelines for reducing the risk of transmission of&#xD;
      microorganisms and the risk of infection through TVS.&#xD;

      Prevention of infection Endo Vaginal sonography. Brief Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Trans vaginal sonography (TVS) is widely used in obstetrics and gynecology.&#xD;
      Because of the relative lack of data, there is no universal agreement on how to prevent the&#xD;
      transmission of pathogens and the risk of infection through TVS. Whereas American guideline&#xD;
      are more stringent, French health authorities recommend low-level disinfection of the probe&#xD;
      between two patients with the use of probe cover, and intermediate level disinfection at&#xD;
      least once daily and in case of visible contamination of the probe, or rupture of the probe&#xD;
      cover. For the coupling gel, guidelines do not agree on whether or not it should be sterile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transmitting infectious agents may result from a variety of causes: failure to disinfect the&#xD;
      probe, contaminated gel, contamination of the probe cover due to incorrect manipulation and&#xD;
      failure to comply with hand washing or disinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to resistance to disinfection, high prevalence, and potential oncogenic role, we will use&#xD;
      HPV as a marker for the presence of pathogens on the probe, the probe cover, and the&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary objective: to assess the presence of HPV on bare probes and on probes with&#xD;
      their probe-cover in routine practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - To assess compliance to guidelines of prevention of pathogens&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - To identify factors associated with the presence of HPV on the probe&#xD;
&#xD;
      2a Factors related to the procedure Compliance to disinfection guidelines prior to performing&#xD;
      TVS Rank of procedure since last daily midlevel disinfection Presence of HPV on the&#xD;
      ultrasound machine key board, a proxy of the environment 2b Factors related to the center in&#xD;
      which TVS is performed Compliance to daily disinfection guidelines Traceability of the&#xD;
      disinfection processes Type of center (emergency clinic /planned sessions / obstetrics /&#xD;
      gynecology /IVF monitoring) 3 - To estimate the incidence of probe cover rupture and of&#xD;
      visible probe contamination by bodily fluids 4 - To model the cost effectiveness of&#xD;
      strategies of disinfection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Type of study: observational survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentage and 95 % confidence interval of TVS procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with bare probe positive for HPV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with covered probe positive for HPV Statistical unit: each procedure surveyed Viral&#xD;
           assays HPV DNA detection will be performed on all samples (keyboard, bare and covered&#xD;
           probe) using the cobas® HPV Test Kit (Roche): This test allows to detect the presence of&#xD;
           cellular DNA and DNA of 14 high-risk HPV (genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52,&#xD;
           56, 58, 59, 66 and 68) and to specifically identify the presence of HPV16 and 18. In&#xD;
           case of positive result for both bare and covered probe, a detection of HPV complete&#xD;
           episomal genome will be performed, and circular HPV DNA will be amplified using a&#xD;
           polymerase whch selectively amplifies circular double-stranded DNA with specific&#xD;
           degenerate HPV primers. The amplicons will then be sequenced using specific HPV primers&#xD;
           GP5 + / GP6 + (MARINCEVIC Y-Zuniga et al, 2012, Virology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome criteria Percentage of procedures with keyboard positive for HPV Percentage&#xD;
      of procedures with visible rupture of probe cover Percentage of procedures with visibly&#xD;
      tainted probes Percentage of procedures with visible rupture of probe cover during previous&#xD;
      procedure Percentage of procedures with visibly tainted probes during previous procedure&#xD;
      Percentage of presence of each disinfection guideline item since last procedure and before&#xD;
      the probe is tested for the presence of HPV Percentage of centers with a written protocol&#xD;
      complying with disinfection guidelines Percentage of centers with traceability of&#xD;
      disinfection procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of observations: 1000 TVS procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criterion: Any TVS performed in a participating center during an observation&#xD;
      session Exclusion criteria: TVS with invasive procedure. Patient refusal Center selection:&#xD;
      private and public centers from the Ile de France region, performing TVS routinely, who&#xD;
      volunteered to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives Evaluating the presence of HPV on TVS probes in relation with the actual&#xD;
      behavior of professionals in routine practice will help us modeling the risk of transmitting&#xD;
      pathogens during TVS and may contribute to establishing prevention guidelines&#xD;
