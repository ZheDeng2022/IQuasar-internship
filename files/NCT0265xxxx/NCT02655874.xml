  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TROPICS1 is a randomized, observer-blind, active comparator-controlled, single-center, Phase&#xD;
      IV trial in 200 participants aged ≥65 years. The control group will receive a standard dose&#xD;
      licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine at day 1, and an active-comparator&#xD;
      (Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine) at day 180. Participants in the experimental group&#xD;
      will receive the same influenza vaccine at day 1 and day 180. Endpoints are immunological,&#xD;
      and include measures of haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titres, micro-neutralisation titres&#xD;
      and cell-mediated immunity at 4 time points after the initial vaccination up to Day 360. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis is that participants receiving an influenza booster at day 180 will&#xD;
      achieve superior influenza seroprotection (HI titre ≥1:40) at day 208, compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the global annual burden from seasonal&#xD;
      influenza as 1 billion infections, with 3-5 million severe cases and 300,000-500,000 deaths.&#xD;
      The pattern and impact of these infections varies considerably with climate. In temperate&#xD;
      countries, influenza epidemics characteristically occur during the cold winter months, while&#xD;
      in sub-tropical countries, they coincide with the rainy seasons. Closer to the equator,&#xD;
      influenza virus activity is more complex. In Singapore, biannual epidemics are usual, but&#xD;
      with continuous transmission year-round. Bi-annual epidemics, tri-annual epidemics and year&#xD;
      round virus activity have also been described in other tropical countries, from Indonesia and&#xD;
      Malaysia to Peru and Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no published data reporting year-round influenza vaccine effectiveness in the&#xD;
      elderly from countries with continuous influenza virus activity. Despite numerous studies&#xD;
      worldwide exploring the HI antibody response to influenza vaccination, the majority of these&#xD;
      do not continue follow up beyond seroconversion (21-28 days). However, of the few available,&#xD;
      HI antibody titres declined following influenza vaccination in the elderly, such that within&#xD;
      6-12 months geometric mean titres approached pre-vaccination levels. With biannual epidemics&#xD;
      and year-round transmission in tropical regions, year-round seroprotection may be important&#xD;
      to reduce influenza infections in this environment. A six-monthly vaccination cycle would&#xD;
      correspond with the decline in vaccine-induced seroprotection in the elderly, and the&#xD;
      6-monthly periodicity of outbreaks in Singapore and other tropical countries.&#xD;
