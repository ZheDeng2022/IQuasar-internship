  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of postpartum anemia is a great threat for maternal and infant health without&#xD;
      timely and effective treatment. Oral iron therapy has been used for centuries as a treatment&#xD;
      of anemia, however, it is noteworthy that treatment with oral iron might have a limited, and&#xD;
      even a harmful role in some clinical scenarios. Ejiao compound is composed with donkey-hide&#xD;
      glue, Ginseng, Codonopsis pilosula, prepared rhizome of rehmannia, and crab apple, which has&#xD;
      been widely used in the treatment of various types of anemia in China for decades and might&#xD;
      be a potentially effective therapy for postpartum anemia. Recently, studies involving animal&#xD;
      subjects have helped shed light on its mechanism of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aimed to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Ejiao compound comparing with oral iron in the treatment of mild&#xD;
      postpartum anemia with or without iron deficiency.&#xD;

      1. Study type: This is a randomized, parallel controlled and single blind study. The sample&#xD;
           ratio of the experimental group and the control group will be 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Setting and Recruitment: All participants experience vaginal delivery and are&#xD;
           diagnosed with mild postpartum anemia. They will be recruited from the obstetric&#xD;
           inpatient department in two hospitals: the first affiliated hospital of Guangzhou&#xD;
           University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Maternal and Child Health Hospital of&#xD;
           Panyu District in Guangzhou City. All assessments and interventions will occur at&#xD;
           hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization, blinded method, and allocation concealment: Patients meeting the criteria&#xD;
           were randomized into experimental group or control group, according to a&#xD;
           computer-generated list. The patients in experimental group will receive the treatment&#xD;
           of Ejiao compound while the patients in control group will be treated by Polysaccharide&#xD;
           iron complex. The study physicians will receive a sealed decoding envelope per&#xD;
           treatment, they will not know the identity of the participants, will not handle the&#xD;
           study products, will not know the assigned treatment, and will not share their own&#xD;
           examination results. After receiving the evaluation by the study physicians and&#xD;
           finishing the investigation form, the patient will take her own sealed decoding envelope&#xD;
           and go to the pharmacy of the clinical trial center to receive her medication. The staff&#xD;
           of the pharmacy of the clinical trial center is responsible for the distribution and&#xD;
           return of experimental drugs to patients. All envelopes, sealed or unsealed, will be&#xD;
           returned to the investigators at the end of the study. Patients would be required to&#xD;
           return boxes whether they are used and unused at each visit and compliance will be&#xD;
           assessed by counting the bottles and capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sample size calculation: It was reported that treatment with oral iron for anemia in&#xD;
           postpartum women increase the Hb concentration by 49.3% by day 40. Combined with&#xD;
           etiological treatment, Ejiao compound used to treat anemia in non pregnant population&#xD;
           for three months, the Hb concentration increased by 66.9%. Basing on the results of&#xD;
           literatures mentioned above, the investigators suppose that the difference of Hb&#xD;
           concentration between patients only receiving the Ejiao compound for 4 weeks and&#xD;
           patients only receiving oral iron for 4 weeks would be 25.0%. The α-value is set at 0.05&#xD;
           and the test power is 0.90. The final sample size should be 68 in each group. With an&#xD;
           anticipated dropout rate of 20% during the follow-up, the initial sample size for each&#xD;
           group should be 85, and 170 in total for two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical analysis: The statisticians will be blinded to the allocation of the&#xD;
           participants. Statistics Package for Social Science (SPSS)19.0 statistical software&#xD;
           packages will be used to analyze the data. The intention-to-treat population will&#xD;
           include all randomized patients who receive the assigned treatment at least once, and&#xD;
           who have an evaluation of outcomes. The measurement data will be analyzed by using&#xD;
           t-test or the rank sum test, and the numeration data will be analyzed by using&#xD;
           chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. P&lt;0.05 indicates statistical significance.&#xD;
