  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments are present in up to 80% of homeless individuals, and may contribute to&#xD;
      homelessness in Operation Enduring Freedom / Operation Iraqi Freedom / Operation New Dawn&#xD;
      (OEF/OIF/OND) Veterans. The investigators propose to investigate these issues in homeless,&#xD;
      treatment-seeking returning Veterans, who arguably face multiple potential barriers to&#xD;
      recovery and reintegration, and with whom there is the greatest opportunity to prevent&#xD;
      long-term homelessness. The investigators plan to conduct a 15-week randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of an evidence-based, 10-week Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) intervention vs. an&#xD;
      education control condition to examine the effects of cognitive rehabilitation in this&#xD;
      Veteran population. The investigators expect CCT-associated improvements in cognition and&#xD;
      functional skills and generalization to reduced levels of disability, along with improved&#xD;
      community reintegration outcomes. By attending to and treating cognitive impairments, the&#xD;
      investigators can potentially prevent future homelessness and its negative health&#xD;
      consequences, resulting in both healthcare cost savings and improved quality of life for&#xD;
      Veterans.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study integrates cognitive rehabilitation in residential care for homeless Veterans. In&#xD;
      a 15-week randomized controlled trial, the investigators will compare an evidence-based,&#xD;
      10-week Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) intervention to an education control condition&#xD;
      for homeless Veterans with cognitive impairment. CCT aims to improve real-world cognitive&#xD;
      performance by teaching strategies to improve prospective memory (remembering to do things),&#xD;
      attention, learning/memory, and executive functioning. Strategies to reduce stress and&#xD;
      improve sleep are also included. CCT has been shown to improve cognition, functional&#xD;
      capacity, neurobehavioral symptom severity, and quality of life in individuals with cognitive&#xD;
      impairment associated with psychiatric illness and in Veterans with traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI). During the trial, assessments will be administered at baseline, 5 weeks, 10 weeks, and&#xD;
      15 weeks, and monthly follow-up phone calls will assess housing and employment/education&#xD;
      status for one year following program discharge. The investigators expect CCT-associated&#xD;
      improvements in cognition and functional skills (co-primary outcomes) and generalization to&#xD;
      reduced levels of disability, along with improved community reintegration outcomes (better&#xD;
      housing stability, participation in work or school, and healthcare appointment attendance).&#xD;
      If effective, the CCT intervention could be exported to the 80+ residential VA programs&#xD;
      serving homeless Veterans. The investigators thus propose the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Investigate the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation in homeless returning Veterans&#xD;
      with mental health conditions and cognitive impairment by conducting a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) vs. education control for 10 weeks, with a&#xD;
      5-week follow-up, followed by 1 year of monthly post-discharge follow-up phone calls to&#xD;
      assess community reintegration outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1a: Positive CCT-associated effects on cognition, functional capacity (co-primary outcomes),&#xD;
      and disability will emerge over the 15-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1b: Positive CCT-associated effects on community reintegration outcomes (housing stability,&#xD;
      participation in employment/education, healthcare appointment attendance) will be detected at&#xD;
      the end of the 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Investigate mechanisms of CCT effects. H2: Improved cognition and cognitive strategy&#xD;
      use will mediate improvements in functional capacity, disability, and community&#xD;
      reintegration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 3. Investigate moderators of CCT effects. Presence and severity of&#xD;
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, history of substance abuse, and TBI, as&#xD;
      well as duration of homelessness and baseline cognitive functioning, will be explored as&#xD;
      potential moderators of CCT effects.&#xD;
