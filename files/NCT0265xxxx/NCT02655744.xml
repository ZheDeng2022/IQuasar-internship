  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an uncommon disease.&#xD;
      Conventional treatment has consisted of either whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or&#xD;
      methotrexate (MTX)-based combined modality therapy combining chemotherapy and cranial&#xD;
      irradiation. The treatment principles at our institute have been quite consistent in the&#xD;
      past, sticking to the treatment protocol reported by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center&#xD;
      in 1990s. No matter what the dosage of MTX is, it is well-established that the addition of&#xD;
      chemotherapy to cranial RT significantly improved survival outcomes. However, it was found&#xD;
      that delayed treatment-related cognitive sequelae emerged as a significant debilitating&#xD;
      complication of combined modality treatment in patients with PCNSL, especially when effective&#xD;
      treatment can achieve disease control and better survival rates. Furthermore, the specific&#xD;
      contribution of the disease per se and various treatment modalities to cognitive impairment&#xD;
      remains to be clarified because the neurotoxic potential of combined modality treatments is&#xD;
      difficult to differentiate when each can result in cognitive dysfunctions respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment-related neurotoxicity could be demonstrated by virtue of several meaningful&#xD;
      indicators, including neurobehavioral assessments, neuroimaging outcomes, and even measures&#xD;
      of quality-of-life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Therefore, this one-year individual research will be a prospective observational&#xD;
      cohort study with a longitudinal assessment of neurobehavioral functions, neuroimaging, and&#xD;
      quality of life for newly-diagnosed patients with primary CNS lymphoma at our institute.&#xD;
      According to our cancer center, it is estimated that there would be around 25 cases of&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma at our institute every year. By virtue of&#xD;
      multidisciplinary management and teamwork consisting of neurosurgery, hematology, radiation&#xD;
      oncology, neuroimaging expertise, and surgical pathology, investigators will attempt to&#xD;
      recruit all potentially eligible patients with newly-diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma. Most&#xD;
      importantly, the neuropsychologists will participate in our research project, in an effort to&#xD;
      integrate the neurobehavioral outcomes into this prospective study. Accordingly, a battery of&#xD;
      neuropsychological measures is used to evaluate neurobehavioral functions for the studied&#xD;
      patients. The battery is composed of ten standardized neuropsychological tests, covering four&#xD;
      domains sensitive to disease and treatment effects (executive function, attention, verbal&#xD;
      memory, psychomotor speed), and QoL questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. This prospective cohort study aims to explore and evaluate patients with&#xD;
      PCNSL who are newly-diagnosed by using a standard battery of neurobehavioral functions plus&#xD;
      neuroimaging studies. It is anticipated investigators will investigate and correlate&#xD;
      neurotoxicity indicators in newly-diagnosed patients with PCNSL who are treated with cranial&#xD;
      radiotherapy combined with or without MTX-based chemotherapy according to the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary treatment guidelines implemented at a single institute.&#xD;
