    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to confirm the target receptor occupancy of SK-1405 and to correlate&#xD;
      receptor occupancy with SK-1405 dose and plasma concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of SK-1405 in healthy,&#xD;
      Caucasian, male subjects.&#xD;
