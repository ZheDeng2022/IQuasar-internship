  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to determine whether the test product (GW483100 10 mg containing&#xD;
      montelukast sodium equivalent to 10 mg of montelukast) is bioequivalent to the reference&#xD;
      montelukast sodium 10 mg tablets (innovator product) in healthy adult volunteers under&#xD;
      fasting conditions. This is an open-label, balanced, randomized, single dose, two-way&#xD;
      crossover study, enrolling 32 healthy human subjects to ensure at least 28 subjects complete&#xD;
      the study. Each subject enrolled will participate in two treatment periods separated by a&#xD;
      washout period of at least 7 days and no more than 14 days between dosing occasions. Total&#xD;
      duration in the study for each subject will be approximately 7 weeks from screening to the&#xD;
      subject's last visit.&#xD;

             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
