      Realistic simulation is an effective teaching strategy for the acquisition and retention of&#xD;
      knowledge and increased self-confidence of students, which contribute to safety in performing&#xD;
      nursing actions.Considering the need to adopt safe practices in health since professional&#xD;
      training, there are deficiencies in health teaching and weaknesses in the acquisition of&#xD;
      practical skills guided by safety principles and critical clinical reasoning. The purpose is&#xD;
      to compare the use of high fidelity simulation with traditional education as innovative&#xD;
      method in the process of teaching and learning. This is a prospective, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      and single-blind study, of pre-test and post-test experimental type, with application of high&#xD;
      fidelity simulation in the theme of patient safety in administration of parenteral drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the issue of patient safety has been hotly debated both nationally and&#xD;
      internationally, because this is a relevant issue for the health professionals' practice and&#xD;
      to improve the quality of patient care. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report&#xD;
      released in 2000, a significant number of deaths in hospitals every year were related to&#xD;
      preventable causes and medical errors. These deaths were equal to mortality numbers due to&#xD;
      diseases such as cancer and HIV and car acidentes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this scenario, death due to errors in the process of care achieved world relevance and in&#xD;
      2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the World Health Assembly (WHA) Resolution&#xD;
      55.18, addressing the priorities related to patient safety in the quality of care. In 2004,&#xD;
      was created the World Alliance for Patient Safety on the occasion of the 57th World Health&#xD;
      Assembly. The World Alliance has defined programs for patient safety that must be adopted by&#xD;
      all member countries and therefore, by Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general actions proposed by the WHO World Alliance for Patient Safety are oriented in&#xD;
      five activities among which, the efforts to strengthen the training in patient safety&#xD;
      worldwide. It stimulates the inclusion of a curriculum guide for patient safety in health&#xD;
      professional training courses .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspects of patient safety in medicine administration involve many health professionals.&#xD;
      However, nurses have an important role because they are responsible for administration and&#xD;
      thus, occupy the last stage between the medication and the error. For all these reasons,&#xD;
      safety in medication administration is a compulsory and transversal theme in the training of&#xD;
      nursing professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context of search for improvements in health care planning, a new practice concept of&#xD;
      teaching and learning has been developed, aiming at training professionals and training the&#xD;
      health professionals who have already graduated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interests in using realistic simulation techniques have emerged lately with the objective to&#xD;
      encourage improvements in safety on patient care. The simulation technique amplifies the&#xD;
      experience of health professionals through educational actions guided by experiences that&#xD;
      happen in the real world, therefore, interactions must happen in a way that preserves the&#xD;
      most realistic aspects as possible. The adoption of simulation in health comes from&#xD;
      successful references of using this technique for industrial purposes and in the armed&#xD;
      forces. It is considered an innovative technique in health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In high fidelity simulation, students and professionals experience clinical cases that&#xD;
      replicate real-world scenarios. This strategy enables teaching innovations, improves clinical&#xD;
      thinking in stressful situations, and prevents the exposure of patients to risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The realistic simulation has been integrated in the education of nurses and doctors over the&#xD;
      last years, but is not fully implemented yet. Despite the recommendations for using&#xD;
      simulation, its increasing integration in education, and the concrete evidence that its use&#xD;
      promotes a better prepare of health professionals for performance in clinical practice, the&#xD;
      empirical evidences of its impact on patient outcomes are still under developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the realistic manikin-based simulation, virtual simulation is another way of&#xD;
      simulation that has been proven effective in learning strategies, contributing to the&#xD;
      retention of knowledge and improvement of nursing students' clinical performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the increasing use of technology in health and the complexity of patients, new ways of&#xD;
      learning have been shaped and developed as innovative teaching methods in health care . All&#xD;
      these alternatives have the promising intention of reducing the deterioration of learning and&#xD;
      of clinical performance over time, making professionals and students able to monitor patients&#xD;
      in the best possible way, establish goals, priorities and better treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An advantage is the possibility of students practicing their skills in an environment where&#xD;
      mistakes can be made and corrected without causing damages and risks to patient safety. In&#xD;
      addition, the construction of knowledge is established through representative situations of&#xD;
      day-to-day reality in professional practice, when students themselves participate as&#xD;
      patient-actors in a totally controlled environment, as well as protected from risks. At the&#xD;
      end of the activity, students and/or professionals involved in the simulation can give&#xD;
      feedback of their learning and, from group discussions and those with the teacher, is formed&#xD;
      knowledge based on self-knowledge and confidence .&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the use of high fidelity simulation with traditional education as innovative&#xD;
      method in the process of teaching and learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      To propose the creation of a high fidelity scenario related to nursing care in medication&#xD;
      administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the gains in theoretical and practical learning and in self-confidence of nursing&#xD;
      undergraduate students after undergoing high fidelity simulation in medication&#xD;
      administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of using high fidelity simulation in the process&#xD;
      of teaching and learning.&#xD;
