  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the immune response to traumatic injury and&#xD;
      subsequent infections in critically ill adults. Traumatic injuries lead to severe&#xD;
      dysregulation of the immune system, and predispose to severe infections. Diagnosing these&#xD;
      infections in a timely manner is paramount in reducing morbidity and mortality, but diagnosis&#xD;
      is made difficult by the inflammatory response to trauma. The main purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      prospectively test the diagnostic power of the expression of an 11-gene set which the&#xD;
      investigators recently published (Sweeney et al., Sci Transl Med, 2015). Since the timing of&#xD;
      an acquired infection cannot be determined a priori, this study is designed to be a&#xD;
      longitudinal examination of a cohort of traumatically injured adults. The investigators will&#xD;
      draw blood at regular intervals, as well as at day of diagnosis of infection for any patient&#xD;
      that are diagnosed with an infection. The investigators will then assay the blood for gene&#xD;
      expression levels post hoc, and correlate the molecular profiles with clinical information to&#xD;
      establish a prospective estimate of diagnostic power.&#xD;

      Consecutive patients who meet criteria (see below) will be enrolled. Whole blood will be&#xD;
      drawn and stored in PAXgene tubes. Blood will be drawn within 24 hours of ICU admission (ICU&#xD;
      day 1), and then every three days subsequently (ICU days 4, 7, 10, 13) for two weeks. In&#xD;
      addition, a tube of blood will be drawn at the time of clinical diagnosis of infection, if an&#xD;
      infection is diagnosed (see below). Patients who are discharged from the ICU prior to two&#xD;
      weeks will no longer be profiled. The hour and date of admission, and the hour and date of&#xD;
      each subsequent blood draw, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of hospital-acquired infection after severe traumatic injury run around 30-50%. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 50 patients, which should net around 20 patients with infections,&#xD;
      and 30 time-matched non-infected controls. In total, an average of 4 samples/patient, or 200&#xD;
      total blood samples, are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of Infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the study is to examine gene expression response to infections. As a&#xD;
      result, careful attention must be paid to how infections are classified. First, two systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction syndrome (SIRS) criteria are NOT necessary to be designated as&#xD;
      infected. Second, the time of diagnosis of infection (and the time of extra blood sampling)&#xD;
      will be the time of clinical diagnosis, not the later time that cultures turn positive. It&#xD;
      will thus be based on clinical judgement. Finally, post-hoc criteria for infections are&#xD;
      described elsewhere. Patients need to eventually meet these criteria to be counted as&#xD;
      infected; this will be done in the analysis phase, not the clinical phase.&#xD;
