      In haematological malignancy and in immunocompromised patients, constipation is a common&#xD;
      symptom caused by a number of factors during treatment. In current clinical practice, an&#xD;
      abdominal radiograph is the first imaging investigation for constipation and non specific&#xD;
      abdominal pain to support or exclude the clinical suspicion. Children are more sensitive to&#xD;
      radiation induced adverse effects especially in the thyroid gland and bone marrow.&#xD;
      Immunocompromised patients are at risk of developing a second malignant neoplasm. MRI is an&#xD;
      alternative imaging modality without ionizing radiation. Imaging the peritoneal cavity on&#xD;
      abdominal MRI has always been challenging primarily because of bowel motion and a long&#xD;
      acquisition time for standard T1 and T2 weighted sequences. Recent development of an&#xD;
      ultrafast 2 dimensional FIESTA sequence developed by GE (General Electric) Healthcare based&#xD;
      on the balanced steady state free precession (b-SSFP) pulse sequence has several advantages:&#xD;
      motion insensitivity ( does not interfere with peristalsis), sharp edge definition and higher&#xD;
      contrast when compared with the standard SSFSE pulse sequence. FIESTA is well suited for&#xD;
      abdominal imaging as it produces motion- free images, allowing clear delineation of&#xD;
      intra-peritoneal and retroperitoneal anatomy and is capable of depicting the vascular anatomy&#xD;
      and lymph-adenopathy.There is a wide spectrum of diseases which could cause abdominal pain in&#xD;
      our study group with constipation being the most common cause but MRI could potentially&#xD;
      detect more serious bowel-related chemotherapy induced complications such as typhlitis,&#xD;
      pneumatosis coli, veno-occlusive disease, pancreatitis and intra abdominal abscess, which&#xD;
      would not be apparent on abdominal radiograph.&#xD;

      In haematological malignancy and in immunocompromised patients, constipation is a common&#xD;
      symptom caused by a number of factors during treatment. Chemotherapy and certain analgesic&#xD;
      medications are major contributory factors in addition to inadequate fluid intake and reduced&#xD;
      mobility during treatment. In current practice, an abdominal radiograph is the first imaging&#xD;
      investigation for constipation and non specific abdominal pain to support or exclude the&#xD;
      clinical suspicion of constipation. However, there is a skin entrance dose of 1.5 msv from&#xD;
      plain film with radiation exposure to gonads. Children are more sensitive to radiation&#xD;
      induced adverse effects especially the thyroid gland and bone marrow. Immunocompromised&#xD;
      patients are also at risk of developing a second malignant neoplasm. Ultrasound is proven to&#xD;
      detect faecal loading in the rectum without ionizing radiation but it is difficult to assess&#xD;
      the entire length of colon and it largely depends on the operator's experience. MRI is an&#xD;
      alternative imaging modality without ionizing radiation. Imaging the peritoneal cavity on&#xD;
      abdominal MRI has traditionally been challenging primarily because of bowel motion and long&#xD;
      acquisition time for standard T1 and T2 weighted sequences. The recent development of an&#xD;
      ultrafast 2 dimensional FIESTA sequence by GE Healthcare based on the balanced steady state&#xD;
      free precession (b-SSFP) pulse sequence has several advantages, including motion&#xD;
      insensitivity (does not interfere with peristalsis), sharp edge definition and higher&#xD;
      contrast when compared with the standard SSFSE pulse sequence. FIESTA images allow clear&#xD;
      delineation of intra-peritoneal and retroperitoneal anatomy and are capable of depicting the&#xD;
      vascular anatomy and lymph-adenopathy. There is a wide spectrum of diseases which could cause&#xD;
