      This study aims to investigate the treatment of absolute uterine infertility (AUI) due to&#xD;
      congenital or surgical absence of a uterus or presence of a nonfunctioning uterus. The&#xD;
      investigators will follow a model based on a Swedish study to enroll 20 women with&#xD;
      functioning ovaries and successfully transplant the uterus from either a living or cadaveric&#xD;
      donor, with the goal of live birth after transplantation.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute Uterine Factor Infertility (AUI) is due to congenital or surgical absence of a&#xD;
      uterus or presence of a nonfunctional uterus. Until 2014 the only option for women affected&#xD;
      by Absolute Uterine Factor Infertility (AUI) was adoption or surrogate motherhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Successful living or deceased donor uterine transplants resulting in live birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy rate via in vitro fertilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1991 the National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry (NTPR) was established to study the&#xD;
      outcomes of female transplant recipients. In 2010 the NTPR had collected data on 2000&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes. The NTRP database includes data not just on the pregnancy but on&#xD;
      follow-up of both parents and their offspring. The first reported case of pregnancy after&#xD;
      transplant was reported in 1958.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011 25,787 solid organ transplant recipients (kidney, liver, pancreas, small bowel, heart&#xD;
      &amp; lung) of which:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  9662 were women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3505 were of childbearing age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  765 were less than 17 years old and could potentially become pregnant later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the benefits of receiving a kidney, liver, pancreas, small bowel, heart or lung&#xD;
      transplant is the underlying disease that caused the subject to have a transplant is gone,&#xD;
      therefore fertility returns. Pregnancy after transplant is increasingly common. This has led&#xD;
      to an accumulation of data and knowledge on how to best manage this subject population. These&#xD;
      pregnancies are still considered high-risk. Successful pregnancy outcomes are a result of&#xD;
      transplant and obstetrics teams working closely together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Society of Transplantation (AST) recommends for solid organs that pregnancy is&#xD;
      allowable if there has been: no rejection within the past year, there is adequate and stable&#xD;
      graft function, no acute infections that may impact fetal growth and well-being and&#xD;
      maintenance immunosuppression is at stable dosing. Both the NTPR and AST advise waiting one&#xD;
      year until after transplant before conceiving. This one year wait time is associated with&#xD;
      better maternal and neonatal outcomes and fewer obstetric complications.Based on the long&#xD;
      term data from the NPTR on transplant recipient's pregnancy outcomes and the relative safety&#xD;
      of immunosuppressive medications a new area of transplant is being developed. Uterine&#xD;
      transplant may provide an additional option for women with absolute uterine infertility&#xD;
      (AUI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical research into uterine transplant has been going on for more than a decade. There&#xD;
      have been several studies demonstrating the feasibility of Uterine Transplantation in&#xD;
      animals, both primates and non-primates. In the last year human trials have started in&#xD;
      Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Great Britain an estimated 12000 women of childbearing age are affected by AUI. In the US&#xD;
      the number of women affected by AUI may be in the millions considering that 9 million women&#xD;
      of reproductive age have had a hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital absence of the Uterus has been reported in 1/5000 women and in 2005 over 12000&#xD;
      women in reproductive age,15 years to 44 years have been diagnosed with congenital absence of&#xD;
      the Uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the US, 1000 hysterectomies are performed immediately post-partum for every 1 million&#xD;
      births.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 62 million women in the United States are in the reproductive age and&#xD;
      about 15.4% may have absolute AUI, and about 7 million women may have lost their uterus to&#xD;
      benign causes or obstetric complications. Although the statistics may offer different&#xD;
      interpretation it seems evident that thousands of women in the United States may be&#xD;
      interested in considering Uterine Transplantation as their best option to have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous Subject Experience&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were two reported attempts at uterine transplantation at other institutions, one of&#xD;
      which was able to carry two pregnancies but not at term. However, the University of&#xD;
      Gothenburg reported the first clinical trial of Uterine Transplantation as nouvelle treatment&#xD;
      for AUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this report 9 living donors and 9 recipients underwent donor hysterectomies and recipient&#xD;
      uterine transplantation. Seven out of the 9 had viable uteri at the time of the report with 1&#xD;
      recipient losing the transplanted uterus to an infection and the other one to a vascular&#xD;
      complication. One donor suffered a surgical grade IIIb complication, an ureterovaginal&#xD;
      fistula, and was successfully treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This early report was followed by a subsequent one where the 7 recipients showed regular&#xD;
      menses and 5 out of the seven recipient suffered mild rejection episodes that were all&#xD;
      successfully treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of Uterine Transplantation as a cure to AUI was finally demonstrated by the&#xD;
      first live birth after uterus transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeries have been described by the Gothenburg University Group consist of a total&#xD;
      abdominal hysterectomy and upper vaginectomy with preservation of the major feeding arteries&#xD;
      and veins to the uterus of the donor and the implantation of the uterus in the pelvis of the&#xD;
      recipient. Vascular anastomosis is achieved between the two major arteries and veins of the&#xD;
      uterus, extending to the external iliac vessels of the recipient using transplant&#xD;
      microvascular techniques. Finally the vaginal rim of the transplanted uterus is anastomosed&#xD;
      to the recipient's vaginal vault.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure can be performed also with a uterus obtained from a deceased donor. The&#xD;
      hysterectomy in the deceased donor will proceed as described above. The advantage will be&#xD;
      obtaining the vascular pedicle attached to segments of the iliac artery and vein which will&#xD;
      make the implantation in the recipient technically easier. The preservation solution will not&#xD;
      change and the ischemia time will be kept under 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective study to treat absolute uterine infertility (AUI)&#xD;
      through uterine transplantation resulting in live birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be five distinct clinical stages in the study after inclusion/exclusion met&#xD;
      criteria &amp; subject consented: Pre-transplant/Screening, Transplant/Recovery, embryo&#xD;
      transfer/Pregnancy, Delivery/Explant, Follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Clinical Sites and Subjects This trial will be conducted at the Annette C. and&#xD;
      Harold C. Simmons Transplant Institute, Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, TX. A&#xD;
      total of 10 female (biologically) subjects will receive a uterine transplant. Subjects can&#xD;
      either receive a uterus from a living donor or a cadaveric donor. Living donors will be&#xD;
      consented per the living donor research protocol. Uterus recovery from cadaveric donors will&#xD;
      follow UNOS guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT PARTICIPATION and STUDY DURATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed for a 5 year period post-transplant. Continued follow up&#xD;
      depends upon the subject status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who received a uterine transplant resulting in live birth then and have the&#xD;
           uterus removed will be followed for 12 months post explant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who received a uterine transplant resulting in live birth and desire another&#xD;
           pregnancy will be followed through the second pregnancy resulting in live birth for 12&#xD;
           months post explant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who have the uterus explanted due to infection, rejection or unable to maintain&#xD;
           pregnancy will be followed for 12 months post explant.&#xD;
