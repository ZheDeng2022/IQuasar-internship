  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this multicenter phase I/IIa trial 25 patients will be treated with non-myeloablative&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by adoptive transfer of autologous TCR transduced T cells, to study the&#xD;
      feasibility, safety and efficacy of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen consisting&#xD;
      of cyclophosphamide (60 or 30 mg/kg/day x 2 days i.v.) and fludarabine (25 mg/m2/day i.v. x 5&#xD;
      days). Following this regimen, patients will receive one single intravenous adoptive transfer&#xD;
      of transduced T cells starting with the first dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 1: 5x10^7 transduced T cells, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 1a: 1,0x10^8 transduced T cells, cyclophosphamide 30 mg/kg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 2: 2,5x10^8 transduced T cells, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 3: maximum 1x10^9 transduced T cells (depending on production yield). At time&#xD;
           points 4, 8, and 12 weeks and every 3 months thereafter patients will be evaluated for&#xD;
           response to treatment. After 3 patients have been treated in each dose level, but not&#xD;
           before 8 weeks after the last patient has been infused with transduced T cells, the DSMB&#xD;
           will be informed about the observed toxicity and efficacy within this cohort and decide,&#xD;
           based on this information, whether the trial will be continued to the next dose level or&#xD;
           will continue in the current dose level. The study will continue as the first stage&#xD;
           (2-stage Simon), until a total of 16 patients have been enrolled and treated: if less&#xD;
           than 2 responses are observed, the trial will be stopped and the conclusion will be that&#xD;
           TCR lacks efficacy. Otherwise, the trial will continue its second stage. In addition,&#xD;
           safety data after these first 16 patients will be evaluated by the DSMB. Any unexpected&#xD;
           or serious (grade 3/4 or higher) toxicities during the trial, will be reported&#xD;
           immediately to the DSMB and CCMO. Second stage: overall 25 patients will be enrolled&#xD;
           (including the first stage): if the total number of responses for the two stages&#xD;
           combined is less than 5, the trial will be stopped as soon as this is evident and the&#xD;
           conclusion will be that TCR lacks efficacy.&#xD;
