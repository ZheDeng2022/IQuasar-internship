    <textblock>
      The project targets stroke survivors to investigate the effect of augmented feedback (using&#xD;
      robotic force cues and visual feedback) on their upper limb reaching patterns and trunk&#xD;
      compensatory movements.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For stroke survivors, the use of compensatory movements can lead to a reduction of range of&#xD;
      motion, pain, and a pattern of &quot;learned non-use&quot;. A common compensatory movement present&#xD;
      during upper limb reaching is trunk displacement. Although this motion has been identified as&#xD;
      an important one to be reduced, few strategies for addressing this problem have been&#xD;
      considered. The existing strategies require physical restraint of the person to the back of a&#xD;
      chair, making them undesirable for use in unsupervised therapy. As a result, there is a&#xD;
      current need for alternate methods that promote the use of correct movement patterns both in&#xD;
      the clinic and in the home. In this sense, technology can act as an enabler to create new&#xD;
      ways of reducing trunk compensation. Still, there is a gap in the literature as trunk&#xD;
      compensation has only been investigated as a secondary theme in robotic and computer-aided&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Consequently, in this project the investigators will look into the reduction&#xD;
      of trunk compensation using robotic devices and commercially available technology, to enable&#xD;
      a focus on the quality of the movements in unsupervised therapy. The potential results from&#xD;
      this project could later be applied and generalized to other modes of compensation in stroke&#xD;
      and other neurological disabled populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to demonstrate that feedback cues could be used to reduce trunk compensatory&#xD;
      movements in unsupervised therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will the use of force cues attain similar results when compared to visual feedback to reduce&#xD;
      trunk compensation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 Kinect (Microsoft, Inc.) markerless motion capture system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 Kinova Jaco assistive robotic arms. These devices are used to assist disabled people&#xD;
           on daily tasks. The arms are designed for safe interaction (low forces) with the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 Desktop computer and a monitor to deliver the visual feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will design the force feedback cues using two Kinova Jaco robotic devices&#xD;
      to deliver them. The investigators will then investigate if the force cues could achieve&#xD;
      similar or better results when compared to visual feedback (using a computer monitor to&#xD;
      deliver the feedback) to reduce compensatory movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though robotic devices are capable of exerting force cues, these devices can be&#xD;
      difficult to implement in a home setting due to their complexity and price. Consequently, in&#xD;
      this project the investigators will study the use of commercially available technology to&#xD;
      deliver feedback about the users' compensatory movements. The investigators will compare the&#xD;
      use of force and visual feedback to study their effect on reducing compensatory levels. The&#xD;
      investigators have chosen to use visual feedback as it can be delivered by systems readily&#xD;
      available in the home (e.g. television sets and personal computers) without the need to&#xD;
      purchase more complex robotic devices. If the results from this project support the use of&#xD;
      commercially available technology, this will provide further evidence of the potential use of&#xD;
      this technology for substituting or complementing robotic devices once the users continue&#xD;
      their therapy programs at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The force feedback cues will be provided as resistance to move the robots' handles. These&#xD;
      cues will be applied when the user moves outside a certain error band, based on a &quot;normal&quot;&#xD;
      reaching pattern. In addition, the magnitude of the cue will be proportional to the magnitude&#xD;
      of trunk compensation. In this project two conditions will be compared: visual feedback and&#xD;
      force feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visual condition will use a monitor to display two cursors (empty circles) that will&#xD;
      represent the participant's hands, and the circles will fill with red ink as the user starts&#xD;
      to compensate. As the magnitude of compensation increases, the amount of red ink will&#xD;
      gradually increase to indicate the level at which the user is compensating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Total Time: 2-2.5 hours):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Introduce the study and equipment. Participants will be asked to inform the investigator&#xD;
           if they feel uncomfortable or fatigued at any point during the experiment, and will be&#xD;
           given as many breaks as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ask participants to fill out consent forms, or if their unable to provide consent due to&#xD;
           their health condition, their caregivers/guardians will provide consent and the subject&#xD;
           will provide assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participant will fill out a background questionnaire and a registered physical therapist&#xD;
           will conduct a clinical assessment based on recognized impairment scales (Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
           Upper Extremity Assessment and Reaching Performance Scale) to use the scores as a&#xD;
           baseline for the comparisons that will be performed in the statistical analyses at the&#xD;
           end of this phase. The Reaching performance Scale requires the use of video recording of&#xD;
           the assessment for scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the participant wants to know their clinical assessment results, at the end of the&#xD;
           session, the therapist will provide a photocopy of the results, and will give the&#xD;
           participant and explanation of these results and answer any questions that the&#xD;
           participant may have about these scales. In the case of the Reaching Performance Scale&#xD;
           as the scoring is done after the study, the participant could receive their scores at a&#xD;
           later date via a telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All the study sessions will be conducted at the University of British Columbia (UBC)&#xD;
           Point Grey Campus. During the test, the participants will be asked to interact with a&#xD;
           computer through the use of the following input technologies: 2 Jaco Kinova robotic arms&#xD;
           and a Microsoft Kinect. Using these technologies, the participants will perform bimanual&#xD;
           symmetric movements with their arms/hands to control a simple cursor/target videogame.&#xD;
           The Kinect will measure the participant's movement as data points for every joint, no&#xD;
           video will be recorded. The robotic devices will be used to record the hands' movements&#xD;
           and will increase their resistance to be moved based on the level of trunk compensation&#xD;
           of the participant. The monitor will be used to provide visual feedback about the&#xD;
           participant's trunk compensation and to display the target game.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Ask participants to sit in a chair and adjust footrest to have their feet fully&#xD;
           supported, their knees at a 90 degree angle, and their back against the chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Ask participants to hold on to the handles of the two robotic devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. In case participants are not able to hold the handle due to hand weakness, an adjustable&#xD;
           fabric and elastic strap will be fitted around their palm to hold the hand on top of the&#xD;
           handle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The maximum force that the user can produce to push the robots will be measured by&#xD;
           reading the robot's sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Ask the participant to perform a series of unimanual reaches to calibrate the system&#xD;
           based on the participant's arm's length.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Ask participant to perform 5 practice bimanual reaches to become familiar with the&#xD;
           system and the motion mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Ask participant to perform 15 baseline (no feedback) bimanual reaches to measure their&#xD;
           trunk compensation. The investigators will use the value of average trunk compensation&#xD;
           to set the error bands for the visual and force feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Ask participant to perform 5 practice bimanual reaches to become familiar with either&#xD;
           the visual or force feedback (depending on the randomization of subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Ask the participant to perform 60 trials of bimanual reaches to 1 target at knee height&#xD;
           with arms fully extended. Participants will receive feedback about their compensation&#xD;
           through the computer's monitor or as increased resistance to move of the robots.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. The participant will be able to rest between targets if requested. In addition there&#xD;
           will be 1 minute rests after every 15 targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. The participant will perform 15 reaches without any feedback (Post measurement)&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. The participants will have 5 minutes of break before starting the second feedback&#xD;
           condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. Repeat steps 14, 15 and 16, but with the other type of feedback (visual or force).&#xD;
&#xD;
       19. A note taker will record the occurrence of obstacles encountered by the participants&#xD;
           during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
       20. The motion tracking data and assessment videos will be saved on a computer file, backed&#xD;
           up on a UBC-based file server and on optical media.&#xD;
&#xD;
       21. At the end of the session the participant will answer a usability questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
       22. The data from the note taker, motion logs, assessment videos and questionnaires will be&#xD;
           used to conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis to gain further insight into how&#xD;
           augmented feedback can reduce compensatory trunk movements, and the ease of use and&#xD;
           functionality of the system. All the data will be identified using participants'&#xD;
           numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
       23. The video recordings will be erased/destroyed 5 years after publication of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will follow a within-subjects crossover design with the independent&#xD;
      variable being the feedback type and the levels will be: force feedback and visual feedback.&#xD;
      The primary dependent variable will be the measure of trunk compensation. The investigators&#xD;
      will follow a counterbalanced strategy to reduce the carryover effects from performing the&#xD;
      two conditions in a certain order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will include motion log files, scores from the game, discussions with&#xD;
      participants and exit surveys.&#xD;
