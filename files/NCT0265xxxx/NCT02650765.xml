    <textblock>
      A prospective validation study of the &quot;Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of&#xD;
      minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults&quot;. Enrolling a consecutive sample of 1000&#xD;
      adult head injury patients from the emergency department of the Tampere University Hospital&#xD;
      (Tampere, Finland). A venous blood sample with S100 analytics (+storage blood) is drawn from&#xD;
      every patient. The patients are head CT-scanned according to the SNC guidelines. Outcome&#xD;
      assessment (GOSE, MRS, Rivermead PCS Questionnaire) is completed as follows: 1 week, 6&#xD;
      months, 1 year, and 2 years.&#xD;

      A prospective clinical head injury study conducted at the Emergency Department of the Tampere&#xD;
      University Hospital, which is situated in Tampere, Finland. The hospital takes care of an&#xD;
      catchment area of 524 447 inhabitants both from urban and rural areas. About 100 000 patients&#xD;
      are treated in the Emergency department annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to improve the emergency evaluation of patients with an acute head injury,&#xD;
      especially a mild head injury. About 80% of head CT scan performed on head injury patients in&#xD;
      the Emergency Department of the Tampere University Hospital are negative (= no acute&#xD;
      traumatic lesion). There is an urgent need to update the head CT imaging criteria/indications&#xD;
      in the context of acute head injury in order to reduce the number of unnecessary scanning.&#xD;
      More selective head CT indications result in considerable health care savings and decreased&#xD;
      exposure to ionizing radiation, among other benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators implement the &quot;Scandinavian guidelines for initial&#xD;
      management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults&quot; criteria as part of the&#xD;
      emergency care of adults head injury patients. By enrolling a large consecutive sample of&#xD;
      patients the investigators are validating this new guideline. Emergency department assessment&#xD;
      data is combined with long-term outcome parameters and blood-based biomarkers of neurotrauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the validation of the Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild&#xD;
           and moderate head injuries in adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the examination of novel blood-based biomarkers of acute brain injury that correlate&#xD;
           with the radiological severity of the injury and the long-term outcome&#xD;
