      Objective: The primary objective of this multicenter single arm feasibility study is to&#xD;
      provide an assessment of enrollment and follow up feasibility for this patient population&#xD;
      being treated with the Apollo or Artemis Minimally Invasive Surgical Treatment (MIES).&#xD;
      Patients who do not qualify for the INVEST Feasibility Study will be referred to the INVEST&#xD;
      Registry study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This study will be a prospective, multi-centered trial that will enroll 50&#xD;
      patients at up to 10 United States (US) centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: Patients with moderate-large volume (20-80 cc) supratentorial&#xD;
      intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who present within 24 hours of symptom onset. Enrolled&#xD;
      patients will receive minimally invasive endoscopic evacuation with the Apollo system or&#xD;
      Artemis Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: The Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device is used for the controlled aspiration of&#xD;
      tissue and/or fluid during surgery of the Ventricular System or Cerebrum in conjunction with&#xD;
      a Penumbra Aspiration Pump. The Penumbra Aspiration Pump is indicated as a vacuum source for&#xD;
      the Penumbra Aspiration Systems. The Apollo system has been cleared for the controlled&#xD;
      aspiration of soft tissue and/or fluid during endoscopically guided neurosurgery of the&#xD;
      ventricular system or cerebrum. In the present study, the researchers propose to investigate&#xD;
      the feasibility of studying this patient population for eventual implementation of efficacy&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
