  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this project is to investigate the blood flow of the ophthalmic artery&#xD;
      (OA) in patients with ocular hypertension, high tension glaucoma and normal tension glaucoma.&#xD;
      It is also to study the influence of the intraocular pressure difference on OA blood flow in&#xD;
      the two first groups. Furthermore, the investigators want to understand the relationship&#xD;
      between ocular dynamics, blood flow and structural alternations of the optic nerve head&#xD;
      (ONH). The rationale behind the study is to improve knowledge of the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      glaucoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will investigate the OA blood flow, intraocular pressure (IOP) and&#xD;
      structural properties of the optic nerve. The investigators will include glaucoma patients as&#xD;
      they believe that glaucoma may be caused by or influenced by OA blood flow. The investigators&#xD;
      will include also patients with intraocular hypertension with and without pseudoexfoliation&#xD;
      in order to study how changes in IOP interact with OA blood flow and the structural&#xD;
      properties of the optic nerve in a group that does not develop glaucoma. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will investigate patients that develop glaucoma in spite of a normal IOP.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators will study three fundamentally different groups (G1, G2 and G3)&#xD;
      of patients as well as a control group of healthy subjects (G4):&#xD;
&#xD;
      G1: Newly diagnosed and untreated Glaucoma (optic and visual field damage exists).&#xD;
&#xD;
      G2: Ocular hypertension with IOP ≥ 23 mmHg (i.e. only elevated eye pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      G3: Normal Tension Glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G4: Healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will include 25 patients apart from G2 where 50 patients will be included, half of&#xD;
      which have pseudoexfoliation syndrome. The study will be performed in accordance with the&#xD;
      tenets of the Helsinki Declaration and is approved by the regional ethical board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol consists of two parts of examinations repeated with approximately one week&#xD;
      between: Each part is divided into two examinations; one at the Department of radiology&#xD;
      followed by one at the Department of ophthalmology. The measurements are repeated&#xD;
      approximately one week later for G1 and G2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: First, MRI scans on the brain to measure the blood flow of OA as well as the&#xD;
      structural and morphological properties of the ON (see method below). Second, just after MRI&#xD;
      examination, the patient will be examined at the Department of ophthalmology. Measurement of&#xD;
      intraocular pressure, ocular pulse amplitude, central corneal thickness, bulb length,&#xD;
      investigation with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and blood pressure will be performed.&#xD;
      The patients from G3 (Normal Pressure Glaucoma) will participate only in Day 1, since most&#xD;
      cases already has pressure-lowering treatment. Also subjects in G4 vill only participate in&#xD;
      Day 1. All other participants will receive pressure lowering drug (Latanoprost) in one eye&#xD;
      once daily, until the protocol is repeated at Day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2: The measurements at Day 1 are repeated approximately one week later. The measurements&#xD;
      will be made in both eyes, which is why an eye can serve as a control. That way the&#xD;
      investigators will have a good opportunity to assess how much of the change the investigators&#xD;
      see in the treated eye that may be due to normal variations in OA blood flow and how much&#xD;
      depends on the given treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings will be compared between the groups and to the normal material in G4. The&#xD;
      investigators will be able to see whether, and if so, to what extent, eyes with glaucoma&#xD;
      differ from normal eyes in terms of blood flow through OA as compared to the IOP&#xD;
      measurements, and different biomechanical parameters of the eye. Thus, determine the pressure&#xD;
      dynamics and calculate ocular compliance with the three different groups of research&#xD;
      subjects; newly diagnosed glaucoma, ocular hypertension, normal tension glaucoma.&#xD;
