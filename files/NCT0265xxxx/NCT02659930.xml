      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a cancer most often seen in people with HIV. It causes lesions. These&#xD;
      are usually on the skin but sometimes in the lymph nodes, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
      Researchers think a combination of drugs may help treat KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a combination of the anti-cancer drugs pomalidomide (CC-4047) and liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin (Doxil) in people with KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and over with KS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy: A small sample of tissue is taken from a KS lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible exam of lungs or gastrointestinal tract with an endoscope: A flexible instrument&#xD;
      examines&#xD;
&#xD;
      inside the organ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the drugs in 4-week cycles. They will take Doxil through an IV on Day&#xD;
      1 of each cycle. They will take CC-4047 tablets by mouth each day for the first 3 weeks of&#xD;
      each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have many visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      To start each cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 15 of first 2 cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits include repeats of screening tests and:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple blood draws&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographs of lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a drug diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take aspirin or other drugs to prevent blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with HIV will have combination antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have a PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue treatment as long as they tolerate it and their KS improves. After&#xD;
      treatment, they will have several follow-up visits for up to 5 years&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric angioproliferative tumor that most frequently&#xD;
           involves skin, but can also involve lymph nodes, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. It is&#xD;
           most common in people with HIV or other forms of immune compromise. Patients with&#xD;
           AIDS-associated KS have worse survival than HIV-infected patients without KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may present with advanced disease KS and/or concurrent KSHV-associated&#xD;
           multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) or an IL-6 related KSHV-associated cytokine&#xD;
           syndrome (KICS). Patients with the latter conditions have poor outcomes when treated&#xD;
           with FDA-approved cytotoxic therapies used for KS, and novel approaches are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase I/II Study demonstrated that pomalidomide 5 mg daily on days 1- 21 of a 28 Day&#xD;
           Cycle was safe and tolerable in patients with KS with or without HIV. Increased CD4+ and&#xD;
           CD8+ T-cell counts and KS regression were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination of pomalidomide with liposomal doxorubicin may offer a new approach for&#xD;
           patients with advanced KS or KS and concurrent KSHV-associated MCD or KICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of various dose combinations of pomalidomide and&#xD;
           liposomal doxorubicin in two groups of patients: Group I) KS requiring systemic therapy;&#xD;
           Group II) KS with concurrent KSHV-associated MCD or KICS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pomalidomide in combination with liposomal&#xD;
           doxorubicin; and for patients with HIV in combination with antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To preliminarily evaluate the antitumor effect of pomalidomide in combination with&#xD;
           liposomal doxorubicin against Kaposi sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with biopsy proven (confirmed in the Laboratory of Pathology, CCR) Kaposi&#xD;
           sarcoma (KS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I: KS requiring systemic therapy (no prior therapy required)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  T1 KS, KS on skin sufficiently widespread that it is not amenable to local therapy,&#xD;
                or KS affecting quality of life due to local symptoms or psychological distress&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      --KS patients with an inadequate response to pomalidomide (either progressive disease or&#xD;
      stable disease after 4 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KS patients with an inadequate response to liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or other&#xD;
           systemic chemotherapy (either progressive disease or stable disease after 6 cycles)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I will exclude patients eligible for Group II (below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A wash out period off treatment of 3 weeks will be required, except in the case of&#xD;
           patients with progressive, severe disease in which delay of treatment cannot be&#xD;
           justified (i.e. symptomatic pulmonary KS)&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Group II: KS in one of the following high-risk groups (no prior therapy required):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concurrent KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease (MCD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KSHV Inflammatory Cytokine Syndrome (KICS), including those also meeting clinical&#xD;
           criteria for KS immune reconstitution syndrome (KS IRIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with primary effusion lymphoma or a large cell lymphoma arising in&#xD;
                KSHV-associated MCD are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  At least five measurable cutaneous KS lesions with no previous local&#xD;
                     radiation, surgical or intralesional cytotoxic therapy that would prevent&#xD;
                     response assessment for that lesion; or other evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  ECOG Performance Status (PS): Group I: less than or equal to 2, Group II: less&#xD;
                     than or equal to 3, ECOG PS of 4 (with Karnofsky 20%) will be allowed in Group&#xD;
                     II only if symptoms due to pulmonary KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Measurable disease by the criteria proposed by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group&#xD;
                     Oncology Committee (for KS).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Patient or legal guardian must be willing to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Patients can be HIV positive or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  HAART for HIV+ patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase I study evaluating 2 groups of patients with KS. Patients will receive&#xD;
           pomalidomide once a day, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle, at the various dose levels&#xD;
           combined with liposomal doxorubicin IV day 1 of a 28-day cycle until optimal tumor&#xD;
           response, unacceptable toxicity, or patient request to discontinue&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with HIV will be prescribed HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients will receive thromboprophylaxis, generally with aspirin 81 mg tablet&#xD;
                daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will proceed to an antitumor activity phase to assess in a preliminary manner&#xD;
           the response of Group I patients to a fixed dose of pomalidomide and liposomal&#xD;
           doxorubicin. Up to 30 subjects (HIV positive or negative) evaluable for response will be&#xD;
           treated at the highest tolerable combination of pomalidomide and liposomal doxorubicin&#xD;
           (determined to be dose level 3: pomalidomide 4mg in combination with 20mg/m^2 liposomal&#xD;
           doxorubicin) to gain preliminary information on antitumor activity in an expansion&#xD;
           cohort. Based on the observation of positive results in the initial dose expansion of 14&#xD;
           patients evaluated in the expansion cohort, a total of 30 patients will be allowed to be&#xD;
           included in this cohort in order to gain additional safety information as well as to&#xD;
           improve the precision of the estimate of the response rate in Group I patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will also include an antitumor activity phase to assess in a preliminary&#xD;
           manner the response of Group II patients to a fixed dose of pomalidomide and liposomal&#xD;
           doxorubicin. Up to 10 total patients (HIV positive or negative) evaluable for response&#xD;
           will be treated at the highest tolerated dose of pomalidomide for this population&#xD;
           (determined to be dose level, 2mg in combination with 20mg/m2 liposomal doxorubicin) to&#xD;
           gain preliminary information on KS that occurs concurrently with KSHV-MCD or KICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will also evaluate the characteristics of 18fluoro-thymidine (FLT) positron&#xD;
           emission tomography (PET) in patients with KS and concurrent KSHV-associated MCD or&#xD;
           KICS, and correlate with markers of KSHV-lytic activation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All study participants must agree to be registered into the mandatory POMALYST REMS&#xD;
             program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the POMALYST REMS&#xD;
             program&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of reproductive potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as&#xD;
             required in the POMALYST REMSTM program&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to take aspirin 81mg daily or if intolerant of aspirin, able to take a substitute&#xD;
             thromboprophylaxis such as low molecular weight heparin at a thromboprophylactic dose&#xD;
             (such as enoxaparin 0.5mg/kg once daily)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because pomalidomide is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects, females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 14 days prior to and&#xD;
             again within 24 hours before starting pomalidomide and must either commit to continued&#xD;
             abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth&#xD;
             control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME&#xD;
             TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking pomalidomide. FCBP must also agree to&#xD;
             ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact&#xD;
             with a FCBP even if they have had a vasectomy. All subjects must be counseled at a&#xD;
             minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with primary effusion lymphoma or other concurrent malignancy, except for&#xD;
             basal cell carcinoma or squamous carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical or anal&#xD;
             dysplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignant tumors other than KS or KSHV-MCD, unless:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In complete remission for greater than or equal to 1 year for the time complete&#xD;
                  remission was first documented&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Resected basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In situ cervical or anal dysplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to thalidomide, lenalidomide, or other&#xD;
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to pomalidomide or other agents&#xD;
             used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with pomalidomide, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with pomalidomide. These potential risks may&#xD;
             also&#xD;
&#xD;
        apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
