  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter phase II study conducting in 3 medical centers&#xD;
      in Asia. Patients will receive erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab or erlotinib alone.&#xD;
      This study will enroll EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who have asymptomatic brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the systemic progression-free survival (PFS) to&#xD;
      bevacizumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who have&#xD;
      asymptomatic brain metastases.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter phase II study conducting in 3 medical centers&#xD;
      in Asia. Patients will receive erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab or erlotinib alone.&#xD;
      This study will enroll EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who have asymptomatic brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the systemic progression-free survival (PFS) to&#xD;
      bevacizumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who have&#xD;
      asymptomatic brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized, at a 1:1 ratio, into bevacizumab plus erlotinib group or&#xD;
      erlotinib alone group. Compute tomography (CT) or MRI scans will be performed every 6 weeks&#xD;
      in the first 12 months since start of investigational drugs, and then performed every 12&#xD;
      weeks. Patients will be followed until documented progression at brain and/or extra-cranial&#xD;
      lesions. Patients with intracranial progression only are allowed to continue investigational&#xD;
      drugs until a second progression of either intracranial progression or extracranial&#xD;
      progression, developed, and the time-to extracranial progression will be determined. In&#xD;
      patients with EGFR mutant advanced NSCLC who had brain metastases, it was reported that PFS&#xD;
      to erlotinib or gefitinib was 6.6 months(Park et al., 2012). In the current study, it is&#xD;
      assumed that the median PFS, both intracranial and extracranial included, is 7 months for&#xD;
      erlotinib group alone and is 12.3 months for bevacizumab plus erlotinib group (hazard ratio&#xD;
      0.57) (Seto et al., 2014). 109 patients will be required for analysis in this randomized&#xD;
      phase II study. Patients will be stratified according to the EGFR L858R mutation and the EGFR&#xD;
      exon 19 deletion mutation.&#xD;

             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate&#xD;
