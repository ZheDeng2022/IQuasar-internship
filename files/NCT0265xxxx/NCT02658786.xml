  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic liver diseases of differing etiologies are among the leading causes of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality worldwide [1]. Chronic liver disease progresses through different pathological&#xD;
      stages that vary from mild hepatic inflammation without fibrosis to advanced hepatic fibrosis&#xD;
      and cirrhosis [2]. Assessment of the stage of liver disease is important for diagnosis,&#xD;
      treatment, and follow-up both during treatment and after cessation of treatment. A liver&#xD;
      biopsy is the oldest and most accurate method used to evaluate liver histology and the&#xD;
      progression of chronic liver disease. Furthermore, different histological scoring systems&#xD;
      have been developed and modified [3]. A liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for&#xD;
      assessing liver histology [4]. During the pathological progression of liver fibrosis,&#xD;
      excessive amounts of extracellular matrix build up; furthermore, serum levels of various&#xD;
      biomarkers change, in addition to the appearance of new biomarkers in the serum during the&#xD;
      different stages of fibrosis [2, 5]. Recently many noninvasive markers (NIMs) for assessing&#xD;
      liver fibrosis have been developed, and they are frequently used in clinical practice. They&#xD;
      have been validated in different studies, and some were found to be highly accurate in the&#xD;
      assessment of liver fibrosis compared with liver biopsies [6-7], which have always been used&#xD;
      as the standard reference method for evaluating the accuracy of noninvasive methods. There&#xD;
      are limited studies documenting the cost effectiveness of non invasive markers over invasive&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most people with chronic Hepatitis B or C are unaware of their infection, putting them at&#xD;
      serious risk of developing cirrhosis or liver cancer which are life threatening. Similarly&#xD;
      patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases are unaware about fibrosis in liver. About&#xD;
      20-50% of persistent infection ends up into fibrosis and finally cirrhosis. Invasive and non&#xD;
      invasive diagnostic methods are widely used to detect the fibrosis. Clinicians use different&#xD;
      drugs and combinations to treat HBV and HCV infections. However, there is scarcity of a&#xD;
      longitudinal prospective study to assess the cost effectiveness of these diagnostic measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We planned to conduct a retrospective followed by prospective cohort study among all cases&#xD;
      that underwent biopsy in ILBS or GB Pant Hospital since 2000 till Dec 2020 with HBV&#xD;
      infection, HCV infection, or non alcoholic fatty liver disease. For retrospective cohort&#xD;
      study, we will collect data from hospital information system for all patients with HBV&#xD;
      infection, HCV infection, or non alcoholic fatty liver disease, who underwent biopsy during&#xD;
      the period of 2000-Dec 2015. The new patients with HBV infection, HCV infection, or non&#xD;
      alcoholic fatty liver disease who will undergo biopsy during the period Jan 2016- Dec 2020&#xD;
      will serve as a cohort for prospective design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect socio-demographic data, clinical data, family history, personal history,&#xD;
      medical history, anthropometry, biochemical and radiological data from each patient. We will&#xD;
      also be conducting a cost effective analysis for various non invasive markers against biopsy&#xD;
      as a gold standard in predicting fibrosis, both for retrospective and prospective cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For prospective cohort study, after evaluation of baseline biopsy results, the cases with&#xD;
      metavir fibrosis score (F0-3) will be followed for a period of 5 years to document incidence&#xD;
      of development and progression of fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional investigation or test will be asked to the patient for the study. We will also&#xD;
      develop a predicting model for development and progression of fibrosis.&#xD;
