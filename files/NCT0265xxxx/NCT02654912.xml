    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of reactive focal drug administration&#xD;
      (RFDA) using dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine (DHAP) versus reactive focal test and treat&#xD;
      (RFTAT) using artemether+lumefantrine (AL) as a routine process for identifying and&#xD;
      eliminating malaria transmission as measured through achieving zero seropositivity in&#xD;
      children under five in Southern Province, Zambia. These two strategies are potential&#xD;
      candidates for expanded malaria operational surveillance and elimination for low malaria&#xD;
      transmission areas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a cluster randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of RFDA&#xD;
      intervention against current standard of care for the impact on seropositivity in children&#xD;
      under five years, passive surveillance for confirmed malaria case incidence, and elimination&#xD;
      of transmission from hotspots. It will be conducted among a background population of ~130,000&#xD;
      people in ~30,000 households in 16 health center catchment areas across several districts in&#xD;
      Southern Province. The government of Zambia is pursuing malaria elimination as a national&#xD;
      goal on an accelerated timeline and this trial will help evaluate two treatment-based&#xD;
      strategies for supporting malaria elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study include: 1). Compare the effectiveness of RFDA using&#xD;
      DHAP with RFTAT using AL in reducing rapid diagnostic test (RDT) confirmed malaria incidence&#xD;
      through passive case detection at health facilities; 2). Compare the effectiveness of RFDA&#xD;
      using DHAP with RFTAT using AL in reducing the prevalence of malaria and preventing&#xD;
      re-infection in individuals receiving reactive responses; 3). Compare the cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of RFDA using DHAP with RFTAT using AL in reducing the burden of malaria in the community;&#xD;
      4). Measure the proportion of P. falciparum infections likely attributable to importation and&#xD;
      local transmission using parasite genotyping as well as defining genotype spatial&#xD;
      distribution; 5). Assess the utility of using serology to measure short term changes in&#xD;
      malaria transmission and evaluate malaria elimination programs; and 6). Assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of using remotely sensed malaria risk maps to identify areas with higher&#xD;
      potential for local malaria transmission.&#xD;
