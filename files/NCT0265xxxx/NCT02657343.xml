    <textblock>
      Participants that have breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, is positive&#xD;
      for a protein called HER2, and has not responded to standard treatment. This research study&#xD;
      is a way of gaining new knowledge about the combination of Ribociclib with other drugs as a&#xD;
      possible treatment for this diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase Ib/II clinical trial, which tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational intervention to use for further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribociclib is a drug that is designed to block certain proteins called Cyclin-Dependent&#xD;
      Kinases (CDKs) that are required for cells to divide. These proteins may also control the&#xD;
      ability of certain cancers to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, there will be 3 separate cohorts that are looking for the safe and&#xD;
      tolerated dose of ribociclib that can be given in combination with other HER2 directed&#xD;
      therapy. One cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with&#xD;
      trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). T-DM1 is a standard treatment for patients with HER2-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer. One Cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with&#xD;
      trastuzumab (Herceptin), which is a standard treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer. The last cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with&#xD;
      trastuzumab (Herceptin) and fulvestrant (Faslodex) for ER-positive and HER2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer. These are both standard treatments for this type of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ribociclib as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who have a history of non-compliance to medical therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Ribociclib has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             Ribociclib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             Ribociclib. These risks also apply to Trasutuzumab used in this study. Pregnancy is&#xD;
             defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of&#xD;
             gestation, confirmed by a postitive hCG laboratory test (&gt;5 mIU/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;

                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods)&#xD;
             and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception Women are considered&#xD;
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of&#xD;
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;

             drug and for 4 months after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this&#xD;
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent&#xD;
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
