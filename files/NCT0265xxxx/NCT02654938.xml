      Phase I single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single injections of ascending doses of&#xD;
      investigational drug product Mobilan (М-VM3) administered directly into the prostate of&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mobilan is a type V adenovirus carrying TLR5 receptor and its agonist, protein 502s. It's&#xD;
      mechanism of action involves activation of immune system and extensive mobilisation of&#xD;
      various immunocytes to administration locus. It's safety and tolerability is currently&#xD;
      evaluated in first-in-man phase I study in prostate cancer patients. Treatment strategy for&#xD;
      the disease (radical prostatectomy or active observation) will be determined by the&#xD;
      Investigator in accordance with routine clinical practice of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised in cohorts of 4 subjects, where 3 subjects will be administered&#xD;
      with Mobilan (М-VM3), and one patient will be administered with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose will be escalated from cohort to cohort, the decision on possible dose escalation&#xD;
      will be made by Independent Safety Review Board.&#xD;
