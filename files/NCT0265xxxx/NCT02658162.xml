      Sixty (60) adult subjects who will be recipients of a donation after brain death (DBD) donor&#xD;
      kidney and who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 within 48 hours prior to&#xD;
      transplant surgery to receive: two infusions of SANGUINATE at a dose of 320 mg/kg or placebo&#xD;
      on the day of surgery and approximately 24 hours after surgery. Patients will be hospitalized&#xD;
      for up to 5 days and the study duration will be 30 days.&#xD;
