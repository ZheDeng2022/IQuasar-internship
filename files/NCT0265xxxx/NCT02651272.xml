      This is a pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of macitentan in patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension of sickle cell disease. This study will enroll approximately 10&#xD;
      subjects. Study participation for each subject will last approximately 24 weeks from&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects 250,000 births per year worldwide, with 70-80,000 patients&#xD;
      currently residing in the US. Although classically thought of as a genetic hemoglobinopathy,&#xD;
      most of the clinical complications are vascular in etiology and pulmonary manifestations are&#xD;
      the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary hypertension (PH), one such pulmonary&#xD;
      complication, occurs in 6-10.5% of SCD adults and is associated with a 60% four-year&#xD;
      survival. No specific therapy for PH in SCD exists representing an area of intense clinical&#xD;
      need in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials of pulmonary vasodilator medications in PH of SCD have been problematic.&#xD;
      There have been no randomized placebo controlled trials of any traditional pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH) medication completed in this population to date. Three randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trials have been undertaken previously. Two compared treatment with&#xD;
      bosentan to placebo in SCD patients with right heart catheterization (RHC) -defined elevated&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) with a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)&#xD;
      (the ASSET-1 trial) or pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH) with a PVR &gt; 100 dynes.sec/cm5&#xD;
      (the ASSET-2 trial). After the randomization of only 14 subjects in ASSET-1 and 12 patients&#xD;
      in ASSET-2, the trials were prematurely terminated due to slow patient enrollment. Although&#xD;
      very few patients were enrolled, there were no apparent toxicity issues. The third trial,&#xD;
      Walk-PHaSST (Pulmonary Hypertension and Sickle Cell Disease with Sildenafil Therapy),&#xD;
      compared the safety and efficacy of sildenafil to placebo in SCD patients with a TRV ≥2.7m/s.&#xD;
      After 74 (of a targeted 132) subjects were enrolled, the study was prematurely discontinued&#xD;
      due to an increase in serious adverse events in the sildenafil group, primarily&#xD;
      hospitalization for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of possible explanations for these failed trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The hemodynamics of PH in SCD reflect a spectrum of abnormalities. Approximately 40-50%&#xD;
           of PH in SCD patients have hemodynamics similar to other forms of PAH; a mean pulmonary&#xD;
           arterial pressure &gt;25 mmHg, normal left-sided filling pressures (PCWP or left&#xD;
           ventricular end diastolic pressure &lt;15 mmHg) and an elevated PVR. But at least 50% of PH&#xD;
           in SCD patients have at least some degree of PVH usually due to diastolic dysfunction of&#xD;
           the left ventricle. How an elevated PVR is defined in PH of SCD is controversial. While&#xD;
           typically in other forms of PAH, it is defined as 3 Wood units or 240 dynes.sec/cm5,&#xD;
           this is reflective of a normal PVR of 120-160 dynes.sec/cm5. In SCD, the anemia-induced&#xD;
           elevations in cardiac output observed in these patients produce a baseline PVR of 60-100&#xD;
           dynes.sec/cm5 suggesting that a PVR of 160 dynes.sec/cm5 or 2 Wood units may be a more&#xD;
           appropriate value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SCD is considered to be a rare disease in the US according to the NIH. As PAH of SCD&#xD;
           probably only occurs in 2-4% of HbSS adults, many centers in the US will only have a few&#xD;
           (&lt;10) eligible patients for enrollment even under the best circumstances. SCD patients&#xD;
           often have co-morbidities limiting their participation in clinical trials, which often&#xD;
           decreases this number even further.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The epidemiology of PH in SCD has been evolving over the past 10-15 years. Numerous&#xD;
           studies demonstrated an elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) by&#xD;
           echocardiography reflected by an elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) was&#xD;
           present in 1/3 of HbSS and 10-28% of HbSC adults. However, an elevated TRV only has&#xD;
           approximately a 25% positive predictive value for PH in SCD. The need for a right heart&#xD;
           catheterization to confirm a diagnosis of PH in SCD has only been gaining clinical&#xD;
           acceptance over the past few years and when the prior clinical trials were conducted,&#xD;
           this was not a standard part of the PH workup in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the serious limitations of the randomized trials, our clinical guidelines committee&#xD;
      decided that its judgments regarding whether targeted PAH therapy is indicated in SCD&#xD;
      patients with an elevated PVR and normal PCWP should be informed by indirect evidence from&#xD;
      Group 1 PAH populations and our own clinical experience. In Group 1 PAH patients, it has been&#xD;
      well-established by meta-analyses of randomized trials that targeted PAH therapy consistently&#xD;
      improves exercise capacity, functional status, symptoms, cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and&#xD;
      outcome. This indirect evidence is supported by four case series in which SCD patients with&#xD;
      RHC-confirmed pre-capillary PH received targeted PAH therapy with bosentan, sildenafil,&#xD;
      and/or epoprostenol. Targeted PAH therapy was associated with improvement in exercise&#xD;
      capacity, with the six minute walk distance increasing 41 to 144 m beyond baseline. There&#xD;
      were also improvements in the mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), PVR, and cardiac index,&#xD;
      although these parameters were measured in only a few patients. The magnitude of the benefits&#xD;
      was greatest among symptomatic patients. The most common adverse effects were headache (15%)&#xD;
      and peripheral edema (21%); transaminase elevation was reported in 14% of patients during&#xD;
      endothelin receptor antagonist therapy. Based upon these results and the increased morbidity&#xD;
      associated with sildenafil use, we are weakly recommending a trial of either a prostanoid or&#xD;
      an endothelin receptor antagonist for select patients with SCD who have a RHC-confirmed&#xD;
      marked elevation of their PVR, normal PCWP, and related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA approval of macitentan for treatment of PAH represents a unique opportunity for study&#xD;
      of the use of this medication in SCD. Endothelin-1 has long been established as an important&#xD;
      mediator of vasoconstriction in SCD [19, 20] and more recent studies have implicated a role&#xD;
      for this molecule in mouse models of PH in SCD [21]. PH and an elevated TRV are both&#xD;
      independent risk factors for mortality in SCD [1, 2, 9, 22] and, as the median age of death&#xD;
      of SCD patients is in the 5th decade irrespective of a PH diagnosis, the possibility of&#xD;
      therapeutically altering this outcome is of key importance in this disease. With the&#xD;
      publication of the American Thoracic Society sponsored clinical guidelines for the diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of PH in SCD (additionally endorsed by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association&#xD;
      and the American College of Chest Physicians), the timing for re-addressing the possibility&#xD;
      of a clinical trial of a PAH therapy in this population perfect. We propose to utilize the&#xD;
      information gathered from the trials which proceeded it to specifically design a clinical&#xD;
      trial using macitentan to treat the SCD patients most likely to respond to this therapy;&#xD;
      those with PAH-like hemodynamics without co-existent left-sided heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Macitentan will be safe for treatment in patients with PAH of sickle cell disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Macitentan will improve hemodynamics, exercise capacity and quality of life in patients&#xD;
           with pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension of sickle cell disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Long-term use of macitentan will improve survival in patients with sickle cell disease&#xD;
           and pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct a 16 week prospective open-label Phase II clinical trial of macitentan in SCD&#xD;
      patients with hemodynamics consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 10 patients in this study. All enrolled patients will be treated with 10 mg&#xD;
      macitentan daily for the entire treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of the three consecutive periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period/Baseline Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This period will be up to 30 days in duration, commencing with the first screening visit and&#xD;
      completing with the start of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will begin at Visit 2, the baseline visit and will continue until the end of 16 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy or earlier in the case of premature stoppage of treatment. During this period, there&#xD;
      will be a safety assessment at the first visit followed by visits to assess safety and&#xD;
      efficacy at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Study Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will last 30 days after the completion of the treatment period and will allow for&#xD;
      additional assessment of medication safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, the patient will undergo the screening protocol which&#xD;
      includes assessment of baseline demographics (sex, age, race, ethnicity, height, and body&#xD;
      weight), as well as an assessment of why the female patients are not of child-bearing&#xD;
      potential as appropriate. The following data will be obtained:&#xD;
