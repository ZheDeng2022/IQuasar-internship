      This study is an observational study to determine predictors of sudden cardiac death or&#xD;
      appropriate ICD therapy in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 36 months for the occurrence of sudden cardiac death&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) comprises almost one half of the congestive heart failure&#xD;
      (CHF) population NICM portends an increased risk for hospitalizations due to CHF as well as&#xD;
      death. This population is also at high risk for the occurrence of tachyarrhythmias and has a&#xD;
      high incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD). The risk of SCD can be lowered by the placement&#xD;
      of an (intercardioverter defibrillator) ICD. The implantation of an ICD significantly reduces&#xD;
      the risk of SCD in patients with NICM and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35&#xD;
      percent or less. However the implantation of an ICD has short term as well as long term risk&#xD;
      associated with it. Many patients receive an ICD who never go on to have appropriate therapy.&#xD;
      Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines state&#xD;
      that &quot;ICD therapy is recommended for primary prevention of SCD to reduce total mortality in&#xD;
      selected patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or ischemic heart disease at&#xD;
      least 40 days post-myocardial infarction(MI) with LVEF of 35% or less and New York Heart&#xD;
      Association (NYHA) class II or III symptoms on chronic guideline-directed medical&#xD;
      therapy(GDMT), who have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for more than 1 year.&quot;&#xD;
      There is a need for new criteria for ICD placement in patients with NICM that are more&#xD;
      sensitive and specific than current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed enhancement imaging on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has become the gold&#xD;
      standard for myocardial scar/necrosis detection. The presence of late gadolinium enhancement&#xD;
      (LGE) on CMR which corresponds to myocardial scarring or fibrosis has been shown to be a&#xD;
      predictor of adverse outcomes in ischemic cardiomyopathy. There have been few studies&#xD;
      evaluating the significance of LGE in patients with NICM, however the results are promising.&#xD;
      The presence of LGE has been associated with the incidence of inducible tachycardia by&#xD;
      electrophysiology (EP) testing in patients with NICM. LGE has also been associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of morbidity and mortality in a general NICM population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll patients with NICM with an EF ≤ 40% who have been referred&#xD;
      for CMR and follow them for the composite endpoint of sudden cardiac death or an appropriate&#xD;
      ICD therapy (Antitachycardic pacing or shock).&#xD;
