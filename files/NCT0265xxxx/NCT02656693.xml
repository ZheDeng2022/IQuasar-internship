  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to adapt an evidence-based online weight management program and&#xD;
      integrate it with population management support from primary care practices. Investigators&#xD;
      then will conduct a three-arm, cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of 1)&#xD;
      the combined intervention (online weight management program plus population management&#xD;
      support) with 2) the stand-alone online weight management program and with 3) usual care,&#xD;
      among overweight and obese primary care patients with type 2 diabetes or hypertension. The&#xD;
      specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a. To adapt an online weight management program and integrate it with population&#xD;
           management support, incorporating input from patients, primary care clinicians, and&#xD;
           other stakeholders; afterward, investigators will acquire feedback on the positive and&#xD;
           negative aspects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. To compare the effectiveness of the combined intervention (online weight management&#xD;
           program plus population management support) with the stand-alone online program and with&#xD;
           usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1: The combined intervention will lead to greater weight loss at 12 months&#xD;
           compared with the stand-alone online program and with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify mediators of the combined intervention and the stand-alone online program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2: The effects of the combined intervention and the stand-alone online&#xD;
           program on weight loss will be mediated by patients' level of engagement, changes in&#xD;
           self-efficacy, and changes in diet and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore whether the effectiveness of the combined intervention and the stand-alone&#xD;
           weight management program varies by patient characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The interventions will be more effective among patients who are younger, white,&#xD;
      and higher socioeconomic status, although the population management strategy may help to&#xD;
      reduce these differences.&#xD;

      Focus Groups and Key Informant Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups will be conducted with 5 to 7 patients at the beginning of the study to obtain&#xD;
      their feedback about an online program and the population health management support strategy.&#xD;
      To be eligible for the focus groups, patients must have a Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH)&#xD;
      primary care clinician, be between ages 20-70 years old, and have a recent BMI (in the past&#xD;
      year) between approximately 27 and 40 kg/m2. They should also be interested in weight&#xD;
      management and/or motivated to lose weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone interviews will be conducted at the end of the study to solicit feedback on the BMIQ&#xD;
      program and the population health management intervention. Patients in the PROPS Study who&#xD;
      are assigned to the online program or combined intervention arm, reach the 18-month&#xD;
      timepoint, and complete the final study survey are eligible and will be invited to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Informant Interviews will be conducted at the beginning and the end of the study. To be&#xD;
      eligible, the key informants must be clinicians or other staff who provide services to&#xD;
      patients at one of the participating BWH primary care practices. There are a total of 165&#xD;
      clinicians in these practices, including staff physicians, residents or fellows, and nurse&#xD;
      practitioners or physician assistants. Approximately 7 clinicians at each timepoint will be&#xD;
      recruited as key informants and will also be asked to complete electronic surveys during the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After adapting the online weight management program and integrating it with the population&#xD;
      management support strategy based on our focus groups and key informant interviews,&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a three-arm cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the combined intervention (online weight management program plus population management&#xD;
      support) with the stand-alone online weight management program and with usual care. This will&#xD;
      be a pragmatic clinical trial conducted in approximately 14 BWH primary care practices. To be&#xD;
      eligible for the trial, patients must have an upcoming scheduled visit at a BWH primary care&#xD;
      practice, BMI between 27 and 39.9 kg/m2 at enrollment, and a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or&#xD;
      hypertension. They also must be between ages 20 and 70 (inclusive) at enrollment, speak&#xD;
      English or Spanish, and have access the Internet using a computer, tablet, or smart phone.&#xD;
      Finally, patients must be motivated to lose weight. Investigators plan to recruit a total of&#xD;
      840 patients for the study (280 per arm). Patients who enroll in the trial will attend&#xD;
      regular primary care visits at their practices and also will complete surveys by e-mail,&#xD;
      regular mail, or phone.&#xD;

    <description>Weight-related quality of life will be assessed using the Impact of Weight of Quality of Life (IWQOL)-Lite questionnare. The IWQOL-Lite is a brief, 31-item self-report measure that consists of scores on five scales (physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work) and a total score (sum of scale scores). Participants are asked to rate items with respect to the past week, with responses from &quot;never true&quot; to &quot;always true&quot;. Total scores range from 0 (worst possible quality of life) to 100 (best possible quality of life).</description>

          <title>Motivation to lose weight</title>
          <description>During the screening process, participants were asked about their motivation to lose weight in the next 6 months, using a 10-point Likert scale where 1= not at all motivated and 10= completely or extremely motivated. This simple measure has been used in previous studies and is associated with behavior change. Only patients who report their level of motivation to be 7 or higher were eligible to participate in the study.</description>

        <title>Changes in Self-efficacy Around Weight Loss at 12 Months</title>
        <description>Changes in self-efficacy around weight loss at 12 months Self-efficacy will be assessed by asking patients to rate their confidence in their ability to lose weight on a scale from 1 (&quot;not at all confident&quot;) to 10 (&quot;very confident&quot;). A rank of 1-7 reflects low self-efficacy, while 8-10 reflects high self-efficacy based on Bandura's theory of self-efficacy.</description>

        <description>Weight-related quality of life will be assessed using the Impact of Weight of Quality of Life (IWQOL)-Lite questionnare. The IWQOL-Lite is a brief, 31-item self-report measure that consists of scores on five scales (physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work) and a total score (sum of scale scores). Participants are asked to rate items with respect to the past week, with responses from &quot;never true&quot; to &quot;always true&quot;. Total scores range from 0 (worst possible quality of life) to 100 (best possible quality of life).</description>

          <description>Weight-related quality of life will be assessed using the Impact of Weight of Quality of Life (IWQOL)-Lite questionnare. The IWQOL-Lite is a brief, 31-item self-report measure that consists of scores on five scales (physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work) and a total score (sum of scale scores). Participants are asked to rate items with respect to the past week, with responses from &quot;never true&quot; to &quot;always true&quot;. Total scores range from 0 (worst possible quality of life) to 100 (best possible quality of life).</description>
