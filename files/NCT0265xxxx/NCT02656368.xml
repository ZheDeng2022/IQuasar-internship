      30 subjects will be enrolled to the study. After eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to sign an Informed Consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, the investigator will select a target area on the face. The target&#xD;
      area will be evaluated for erythema (redness) and desquamation (scaling) using a 5-point&#xD;
      scale: 0 = none, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate and 4 = severe. Photography of the&#xD;
      target area will be taken. For reference, a fixed object (such as a ruler) will be&#xD;
      photographed in the same frame. In addition, the investigator will assess the overall facial&#xD;
      lesions using an ISGA based on a 5-point scale. The subject will evaluate his/her pruritis&#xD;
      over the past 24 hours, using a 5-point scale: 0 = no itching, 1 = minimal and rare itching,&#xD;
      2= mild itching, (subject is aware of the itching only when relaxed), 3= moderate itching&#xD;
      (subject is often aware of the itching, which occasionally disturbs sleep), 4 = severe and&#xD;
      constant itching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to use SEBORRHEAMEDIS Face Cream twice a day, morning and&#xD;
      evening, for a consecutive period of 42 days. In addition to the baseline visit (day 0),&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to come to the clinic for two follow-up visits at days 14 and 28 and&#xD;
      for a final visit at day 42. A flexibility of ±2 days will be allowed. In case of an adverse&#xD;
      event, the subject will be asked to immediately contact the clinic, and to come to an&#xD;
      unscheduled visit if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each of the two follow-up visits and at the final visit, the investigator will evaluate&#xD;
      the overall severity of seborrhea (ISGA) and the target area's erythema and desquamation. The&#xD;
      subject will assess his/her pruritus over the past 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the final visit, the subject will also complete a product-assessment questionnaire. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will ask several questions about satisfaction attributes, using a 5-point&#xD;
      scale: -2 = very unsatisfied, -1 = unsatisfied, 0 = neutral, +1 = satisfied, +2 = very&#xD;
      satisfied. Attributes will include: overall satisfaction, speed of results, ease of use, ease&#xD;
      of spread, comfort under makeup, feel on the skin (-2 = very greasy, +2 = very moisturizing),&#xD;
      speed of absorption, texture, color and odor&#xD;
