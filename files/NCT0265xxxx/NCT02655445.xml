      Setup of comparative trial The goal of this study is to determine whether one surgical&#xD;
      treatment for chronic subdural hematoma is better than the other. Patients with a clear&#xD;
      indication for drainage of subdural hematoma (as stated under &quot;Surgical options&quot;) will be&#xD;
      randomized into three groups. One group will receive twist drill craniostomy followed by&#xD;
      drainage during 48 hours. One group will undergo burr hole drainage (single if possible,&#xD;
      double if necessary) with irrigation and drainage during 48 hours postoperatively. One group&#xD;
      will undergo a minicraniotomy with trephine or craniotome, with wide opening of all visible&#xD;
      membranes, rigorous irrigation and placement of Jackson-Pratt drain, followed by closed&#xD;
      system draining during 48 hours. Postoperative results and complications will be compared&#xD;
      between the three groups.&#xD;

      Study design The study is set up as an open randomized controlled three-arm trial. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized into three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setup and procedures The goal of this study is to determine if one surgical treatment&#xD;
      for chronic subdural hematoma is better than the other. Patients with a clear indication for&#xD;
      drainage of subdural hematoma (as stated under &quot;Surgical options&quot;) will be randomized into&#xD;
      three groups. One group will receive twist drill craniostomy followed by drainage during 48&#xD;
      to 96 hours. One group will undergo burr hole drainage (single if possible, double if&#xD;
      necessary) with irrigation and drainage during 48 to 96 hours postoperatively. One group will&#xD;
      undergo a minicraniotomy with trephine or craniotome, with wide opening of all visible&#xD;
      membranes, rigorous irrigation and placement of Jackson-Pratt drain, followed by drainage&#xD;
      during 48 to 96 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with chronic subdural hematoma on CT scan, will be operated on as soon as&#xD;
      possible. The type of operation will be determined by randomization. The duration of surgery&#xD;
      as well as presence of brain reexpansion (in case of burr hole or minicraniotomy) will be&#xD;
      recorded. Postoperatively, patients will be transferred to the neurosurgery ward with a&#xD;
      subdural drainage system in place. Drainage system is removed 48 to 96 hours postoperatively,&#xD;
      regardless of the type of operation (48 hours standard; longer period of drainage if drainage&#xD;
      less than 50cc/24h evaluated on the second 24 hours postoperatively. Maximal time of&#xD;
      continuous drainage is 4 days or 96 hours postoperatively). Drained volume will be recorded.&#xD;
      Evaluation will be performed preoperatively, 48h postoperatively, on discharge, after 6 weeks&#xD;
      and after 6 months, and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, sex, comorbidities (anticoagulation or coagulopathy, dementia, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical status (cognitive state (orientation in time, place and person), Speech&#xD;
           (aphasia/dysarthria), Motor function (hemiplegia/paresis); walking independently (y/n);&#xD;
           independence for ADL (y/n); Markwalders Scale, modified Rankin Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging characteristics (location (frontal/parietal/occipital, uni-bilateral), size (max&#xD;
           diameter), Density(Hounsfield units, age of hematoma), membranes (y/n). An approximate&#xD;
           total of five CTscans will be performed, totaling (5x2=)10mSv of radiation exposure&#xD;
           Length of hospital stay will be recorded. The primary endpoint will be the reoperation&#xD;
           rate at 40 days. We hypothesize that subdural hematomas treated by minicraniotomy will&#xD;
           require less reoperation (reduced to 5%) than burr hole craniostomy or twist drill&#xD;
           craniotomy (15 to 25% according to literature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Clinical endpoints: Duration of operation, technical difficulties during&#xD;
      operation. Duration of hospital stay. Improvement of Clinical status and speed thereof,&#xD;
      Improvement of CT-imaging characteristics, complication rate (bleeding, local or systemic&#xD;
      infection, epilepsy,…). We expect that subdural hematomas operated on by minicraniotomy and&#xD;
      large opening of membranes will lead to quicker improvement of CT-imaging than burr hole&#xD;
      treatment or twist drill craniotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory endpoints To determine which type of intervention can be beneficial to which type&#xD;
      of patients. Hypothesis is that in case of homogenous chronic subdural hematoma, twist drill&#xD;
      craniostomy would pose the least risks, whereas in multiloculated mixed-density hematomas,&#xD;
      minicraniotomy would be the best option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects Number of subjects A total of 150 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria All consecutive patients with chronic subdural hematoma with indication&#xD;
      for surgical intervention: clinical symptoms as a result of the subdural collection, or&#xD;
      important mass effect (as indicated by a midline shift of more than 5mm) Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      Patients under the age of 18 will be excluded Patients who have undergone previous cranial&#xD;
      surgery which would limit surgical options (for example bone flap already in place)&#xD;
      Replacement of subjects Dropout, in the case of this trial, would only signify loss to&#xD;
      follow-up since patients will be operated on after consenting to participation in the trial.&#xD;
      In case of dropout, the available data will be evaluated and included in the analysis when&#xD;
      possible. If dropout occurs after the scheduled six weeks postoperative visit, data is still&#xD;
      usable for analysis of primary endpoint. Data from earlier on in treatment (for example&#xD;
      duration of surgery, hospital stay, etc) will be usable for analysis of secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restrictions and prohibitions for the subjects Antiaggregant drugs (Aspirin, Asaflow,&#xD;
      Cardioaspirine, Plavix, Clopidogrel, Ticlid,…) will be stopped for at least 5 days (ideally&#xD;
      10days) before surgery when possible and, if necessary (this will be discussed with the&#xD;
      treating physician/cardiologist), replaced by short acting low molecular weight heparins&#xD;
      given subcutaneously (no administration on the day of surgery). Anticoagulants (Sintrom,&#xD;
      Marcoumar, Marevan) will be replaced by short acting low molecular weight heparins given&#xD;
      subcutaneously (no administration on the day of surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study analysis Sample size calculation Power and sample size estimations are based on data&#xD;
      from the literature indicating that the reoperation rate at 40 days for burr hole craniostomy&#xD;
      or twist drill craniotomy ranges from 25% to 15% (control groups), and our assumption that&#xD;
      minicraniotomy would decrease the reoperation rate at 40 days to 5%. In a test for trend in&#xD;
      proportions, sample sizes of 49, 49, and 49 are obtained from 3 groups with proportions equal&#xD;
      to 0.25, 0.15, and 0.05. The total sample of 147 subjects achieves 81% power to detect a&#xD;
      linear trend using a two-sided Z test with continuity correction and a significance level&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will be implemented using Research Randomizer (Urbaniak, G. C.,&#xD;
      Plous, S. (2011). Research Randomizer (Version 3.0) [Computer software]) Data for&#xD;
      randomization was retrieved on September 25th, 2011, from http://www.randomizer.org. Three&#xD;
      treatments will be randomized for 50 reps (totaling 150 patients) Analysis of the samples&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by Patrick Haentjens (Uz Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101&#xD;
      1090 Jette; tel 024777909) Statistical analysis Data will be presented as number of cases&#xD;
      including nominator and denominator values (and percentages) for categorical variables and as&#xD;
      mean values and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables. Differences between&#xD;
      treatment arms will be presented as absolute between-group differences with corresponding 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals (95% CI). Differences between treatment arms will be assessed by one-way&#xD;
      ANOVA for continuous variables and the test for trend in proportions for categorical&#xD;
      variables. All tests will be two-sided, and a P-value of less than 0.05 will be considered to&#xD;
      indicate statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control and quality assurance Continuous ad-hoc analysis of clinical results and of&#xD;
      data acquisition and data management will take place in a weekly meeting with all cooperating&#xD;
      neurosurgeons; this clinical analysis is independent of statistical analysis. In case of&#xD;
      aberrant results from one procedure or another, results will be evaluated and measures will&#xD;
      be taken.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention: twist drill burr hole &lt;5mm, placement of Integra basket-type drain&#xD;
A stab incision to the scalp is made, at the approximate location of the thickest diameter of hematoma. The twist-drill hole &lt;5mm is placed obliquely to the surface of the skull, at an angle of about 45° until perforation of the dura. No irrigation is performed. A basket-type drain (Integra) is placed in the subdural space and tunneled underneath the skin</description>

    <description>Intervention: 2 Burr Holes &gt;5mm and &lt;30mm, placement of Jackson-Pratt drain&#xD;
First burr hole at the site of maximal diameter, second anterior and superior to that point. The scalp incisions are so planned that they can be incorporated into a craniotomy if necessary. Visible membranes are opened with a sharp hook until the pia is visualized. Gentle irrigation is performed and continued until the returning liquid is clear. Two burr holes are placed to facilitate drainage. A closed system subdural drain (Jackson-Pratt catheter) is inserted after irrigation until clear liquid return</description>
