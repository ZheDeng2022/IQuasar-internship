    <textblock>
      Developing more effective and faster acting antidepressant is of outmost clinical importance.&#xD;
      Available antidepressant therapies have a delayed therapeutic effect. It typically takes&#xD;
      several weeks before symptom relief is evident. Furthermore, antidepressants are relatively&#xD;
      ineffective - as many as 30% of patients do not respond to any medication at all. In this&#xD;
      study the investigators evaluate the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine as a potentially new&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment for severely depressed patients and compare its effectiveness with&#xD;
      that of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In line with the PICO model, patient selection and procedures for experimental and control&#xD;
      treatments and outcome measures are rigorously defined. Inpatients, aged 18-85, diagnosed&#xD;
      with major depressive disorder (MDD, according to DSM-IV), that have been offered and have&#xD;
      accepted ECT, are eligible to participate. Patients must be proficient in spoken and written&#xD;
      Swedish, and score ≥ 20 points on the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are known allergy to the active substance; co-morbid conditions that could&#xD;
      interfere with the treatment (e.g. primary psychosis); habitual difficulties to speak, hear,&#xD;
      remember or reason; on-going or recent (6 months) drug abuse; treatment according to LPT&#xD;
      (Lagen om psykiatrisk tvångsvård; Compulsory Psychiatric Care Act); and a number of&#xD;
      cardiovascular conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the experimental treatment receive intravenous infusions of racemic&#xD;
      ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), delivered over a period of forty minutes thrice weekly (Monday,&#xD;
      Wednesday, Friday). Patients in the control group receive ECT in line with standard&#xD;
      procedures (including anesthesia, muscle relaxation and oxygenation) thrice weekly. ECT was&#xD;
      chosen as the reference treatment as it is the most effective treatment for patients&#xD;
      suffering from moderate to severe depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the proportion of patients in remission after 4 weeks of treatment in each&#xD;
      arm. Remission is defined as a MADRS ≤ 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses a non-inferiority design. Demonstrating superiority of ketamine was not an&#xD;
      option based on the number of patients needed to gain sufficient power with such a design.&#xD;
      Also, the investigators do not believe that ketamine treatment needs to be more effective, at&#xD;
      least not in terms of the primary outcome. ECT is associated with side effects (in particular&#xD;
      amnesia during the treatment period, but some patients also report persistent memory&#xD;
      problems) and patients need to be anaesthetised under the supervision of a anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
      The treatment is thus fairly demanding and expensive. A significant amount of patients are&#xD;
      also unwilling to undergo ECT. Given non- inferiority of ketamine regarding the primary&#xD;
      outcome, and given that it is associated with fewer side effects or shorter time to remission&#xD;
      and does not involve the need for anaesthesia, in a risk-benefit analysis the scale might be&#xD;
      tipped in favour of ketamine, even if it is not superior per se.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include proportion of patients in re mission and /or response and&#xD;
      symptomatic relief at follow-up time points (3, 6 and 12 months after treatment cessation).&#xD;
      Also addressed is how the two treatments affect cognition. A computerized test battery, the&#xD;
      Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) is administered prior&#xD;
      to the first treatment, after two weeks, shortly after remission and at three additional time&#xD;
      points (3, 6 and 12 months) after conclusion of the treatment. See figure for specification&#xD;
      and description of cognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are drawn before the first treatment and 2-3 months after finishing treatment.&#xD;
      Apart from plasma and serum samples (which will be used for later analysis of potential&#xD;
      biomarkers such as IL 6 and D-serine), additional blood is collected for genomic DNA&#xD;
      analysis. A total of 4 x 6 mL are taken at each occasion. Blood samples are stored at the&#xD;
      regional biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to response will be analysed with parametric survival analysis (for changes in MADRS&#xD;
      score) or with non-parametric analysis of two-way ordinal data with repeated measurements34&#xD;
      (for ordinal data). Cognitive data and biological samples will be analysed with t-tests&#xD;
      (paired or unpaired as appropriate) or with analysis of variance ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample size was calculated based on actual or assumed remission rates, the primary&#xD;
      outcome parameter of the study. A remission rate of 60% was set for the reference treatment&#xD;
      (ECT). A non-inferiority limit of 40% was set for the experimental intervention (ketamine).&#xD;
      This is an arbitrary level, based on an assumption of fewer and milder side effects, faster&#xD;
      antidepressant effect and the fact that the patients do not need to be anaesthetized and&#xD;
      given muscle relaxants. With the above limits, a power of 80% and a significance level of 5%,&#xD;
      97 patients are required in each arm, according to: n = (2 * 8,4 * p(1-p) / difference2),&#xD;
      where &quot;2&quot; and &quot;8,4&quot; are derived from significance and power levels, p are the (actual and&#xD;
      assumed) levels for the proportion of patients reaching remission for ECT and ketamine (60%&#xD;
      and 40% respectively). The size of the cohort is calculated to be sufficiently large to&#xD;
      detect ECT-associated cognitive side effects.&#xD;

Each participating clinic decides for each patient whether the treatment is given uni- or bilateral, as well as the exact stimulation parameters. Choice of anesthetic drug (e.g. thiopental of propofol) and muscle relaxant is done by local anesthesiologist.
