  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the systemic exposure of Granexin® gel after&#xD;
      topical application to human subjects' diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to ascertain the systemic exposure of the active ingredient in&#xD;
      Granexin® gel (aCT1 peptide) after topical application to diabetic foot ulcers using&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic analysis. It is planned that a total of 16 patients with diabetic foot ulcers&#xD;
      will receive Granexin® gel treatment plus standard of care in this one arm study. The study&#xD;
      includes a screening period (1 week) and a treatment period (1 week) which occur sequentially&#xD;
      for a given patient. The baseline day, which demarcates the beginning of the treatment&#xD;
      period, is the designated as Day 0. Screening procedures are initially conducted on Day -7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A target foot ulcer is identified at screening and patient eligibility is confirmed at&#xD;
      screening and then again at the beginning of the Day 0 (baseline) visit. A patient enrolled&#xD;
      in the study may have multiple ulcers on the same or either foot; in this case, all ulcers&#xD;
      will be treated with Granexin® gel, but only ulcer(s) meeting the following criteria will be&#xD;
      designated as the target ulcer(s) and will determine eligibility: &gt;4cm2 in post debridement&#xD;
      of at least 4 weeks duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment period for a given patient begins on Day 0 and ends one week later; the last&#xD;
      scheduled day of the treatment period is designated as Day 7. During the treatment period,&#xD;
      each patient is scheduled to receive topical treatment with study drug gel (3 applications&#xD;
      total) administered by study staff at scheduled study site visits at each of the following&#xD;
      time points: Day 0, Day 3, and Day 7. All patients, regardless of treatment assignment, also&#xD;
      receive standard-of-care treatment at scheduled study visits during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug pre-application blood samples will be collected from each patient at Day 0, Day 3,&#xD;
      and Day 7. Study drug post-application blood samples will be collected at Day 0 and Day 7 at&#xD;
      time points specified in the protocol. These blood samples will be shipped to a designated&#xD;
      laboratory for pharmacokinetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed during the treatment period by monitoring adverse events, measuring&#xD;
      vital signs at each visit, performing physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECG), as&#xD;
      well as pharmacokinetic (PK) blood analysis.&#xD;
