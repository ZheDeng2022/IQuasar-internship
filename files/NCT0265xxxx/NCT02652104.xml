      This study reviews the outcome of deep brain stimulation treated patients in Helsinki and&#xD;
      Uusimaa University Hospital between 2006 and 2014. The aim of the study is to investigate the&#xD;
      outcome and possible side effects of deep brain stimulation treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation is a FDA approved method in treating patients with advanced&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease when the best medical treatment is insufficient. In this study the aim is&#xD;
      to investigate the outcome of deep brain stimulation treated patients in Helsinki and Uusimaa&#xD;
      University hospital between 2006 and 2014. This study is a retrospective study based on&#xD;
      existing patients' medical records and does not include an intervention in the treatment of&#xD;
      an individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep brain stimulation carries the risks of major surgery. A complication risk for a&#xD;
      hemorrhage is 1-2 % and for an infection is 3-10%. The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      complications that have occurred and the possible benefit of deep brain stimulation in deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation treated patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gathered data will be processed anonymously and an individual patient cannot be&#xD;
      identified. The data will be processed with an appropriate statistical program (SPSS). No&#xD;
      data will be given to external parties.&#xD;
