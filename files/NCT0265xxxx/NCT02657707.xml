      A prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open label clinical study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of MicroVention, Inc. Roadsaver™ Carotid Stent System used in conjunction with&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Up to 295 patients will be enrolled for this study. All potential patients being considered&#xD;
      for the study should have been diagnosed with significant carotid artery stenosis and be&#xD;
      considered a high perioperative risk for carotid endarterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated through screening, pre-procedure, index procedure, post-procedure.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be completed at 30 days, 6 months, and 12, 24, and 36 months&#xD;
      post-procedure.&#xD;
