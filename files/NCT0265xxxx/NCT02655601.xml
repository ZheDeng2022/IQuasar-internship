  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study of newly diagnosed patients with high grade glioma (HGG) undergoing&#xD;
      standard radiation therapy and temozolomide treatment. BMX-001 added to radiation therapy and&#xD;
      temozolomide has the potential not only to benefit the survival of high grade glioma patients&#xD;
      but also to protect against deterioration of cognition and impairment of quality of life.&#xD;
      BMX-001 will be given subcutaneously first with a loading dose zero to four days prior to the&#xD;
      start of chemoradiation and followed by twice a week doses at one-half of the loading dose&#xD;
      for the duration of radiation therapy plus two weeks. Both safety and efficacy of BMX-001&#xD;
      will be evaluated. Impact on cognition will also be assessed. Eighty patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to the treatment arm that will receive BMX-001 while undergoing chemoradiation and&#xD;
      80 patients randomized to receive chemoradiation alone. The sponsor hypothesizes that BMX-001&#xD;
      when added to standard radiation therapy and temozolomide will be safe at pharmacologically&#xD;
      relevant doses in patients with newly diagnosed high grade glioma. The sponsor also&#xD;
      hypothesizes that the addition of BMX-001 will positively impact the overall survival and&#xD;
      improve objective measures of cognition in newly diagnosed high grade glioma patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      160 patients will be enrolled and randomized with a treatment arm allocation ratio of 1:1 in&#xD;
      the Phase 2 study. At enrollment, patients will be assessed with medical history,&#xD;
      physical/neurological examinations, standard laboratory evaluations (CBC with differential&#xD;
      and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)), baseline brain MRI with and without gadolinium,&#xD;
      cognitive testing and patient-reported outcome questionnaires of HRQoL. On the first day of&#xD;
      BMX-001 (loading dose), patients will be evaluated with medical history, patient&#xD;
      physical/neurological examinations, and standard laboratory evaluations (CBC with&#xD;
      differential and CMP), and ECG. Patients in Arm A will be administered BMX-001 subcutaneously&#xD;
      first as a loading dose before the start of chemoradiation and then at maintenance dose (50%&#xD;
      of the loading dose) twice a week for 8 weeks. Because oxidative stress continues to occur&#xD;
      for up to several weeks following RT, the proposed protocol includes administering BMX-001&#xD;
      both before the start of RT and continuing for 2 weeks after the completion of RT and TMZ.&#xD;
      TMZ will be dosed at 75 mg/m2 orally daily for 42 days and RT will be delivered in daily&#xD;
      fractions of 1.8-2 Gy given 5 days a week for 6 weeks for a total of 59.4-60 Gy. During&#xD;
      standard RT and TMZ, CBC with differential and CMP will be obtained weekly. Two weeks after&#xD;
      the completion of standard RT and TMZ and every 8 weeks during adjuvant TMZ, patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated with the following: medical history, physical/neurological examinations, Brain MRI&#xD;
      with and without gadolinium, cognitive testing and patient-reported outcome questionnaires of&#xD;
      HRQoL. Two weeks after the completion of chemoradiation, patients will transition to adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy with TMZ dosed at 150-200 mg/m2 orally for 5 days of a 28-day cycle for a total&#xD;
      of 12 cycles. In light of the findings that BMX-001 can spare radiation-induced hair loss in&#xD;
      a mouse model [41], we will evaluate and describe hair loss as an exploratory outcome in HGG&#xD;
      patients by evaluating hair at baseline and then every 8 weeks. Patients will be discontinued&#xD;
      from the study if they experience progression of disease, death or withdraw informed consent.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of overall survival. With standard treatment, the median survival of Grade IV patients is expected to be 14.6 months, and the median survival of Grade III is approximately 36 months.

    <description>Neurocognitive testing will be done using Brief Assessment of Cognition (BAC) through the NeuroCog app. This battery consists of the six tests listed below.&#xD;
Verbal memory &amp; learning test will assess verbal learning, memory for words, and recall.&#xD;
Working memory test will assess digital sequencing when presented with auditory clusters of numbers.&#xD;
Motor function test will assess motor skills using manipulation of tokens.&#xD;
Verbal fluency test includes both semantic fluency (number of words generated in a given category) and letter fluency (number of words beginning with a given letter).&#xD;
Speed of processing will be tested using ability to match corresponding numbers with a series of symbols.&#xD;
Executive function will be assessed by a Tower of London subtest. Cognitive testing will be obtained at screening, 2 weeks after the completion of standard RT and TMZ, and every 8 weeks during adjuvant TMZ.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic response to tumor.</measure>

    <description>The guidelines and criteria for radiographic response will be based on the updated RANO criteria for newly diagnosed GBM. MRI brain with and without contrast will be obtained at enrollment, 2-4 weeks after standard RT and TMZ, and every 8 weeks during adjuvant TMZ. Since this is a study in newly diagnosed patients with HGG, the baseline imaging will be designated as the imaging obtained 2 to 4 weeks after the completion of standard RT and TMZ. At each time point, based on RANO criteria, the subject response will be characterized as Complete Response, Partial Response, Progressive Disease, Stable Disease, or Not Evaluable.</description>

    <description>BMX-001 consists of a porphyrin ring with pyridyl groups attached at each of the four methane bridge carbons. The nitrogen in the pyridyl ring is at the 2 position and has a side chain consisting of six carbons with an ether linkage. A manganese atom is chelated into the porphyrin ring and is the active center of the molecule. This molecule is an enzymatic scavenger of free radical species operating at close to diffusion-limited rates.</description>
