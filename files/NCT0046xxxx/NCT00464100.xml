    <textblock>
      We believe that how a baby with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)does after a major open&#xD;
      heart operation, measured by things like blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate and&#xD;
      others, may have an impact on development. Studying how post-operative condition impacts&#xD;
      outcomes may help us to protect babies better when they undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at some of the long-term outcomes of children with HLHS, including both&#xD;
      mental development and quality of life. We will use information from your child's medical&#xD;
      record to see if early oxygen delivery has an impact on later development.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Over the past twenty years, the field of congenital heart disease has been marked by globally&#xD;
      improved survival after complex congenital heart surgery. These improved results are clearly&#xD;
      multi-factorial and include advances in diagnostic technologies, surgical techniques,&#xD;
      perfusion strategies, pharmacologic therapies and perioperative monitoring of tissue oxygen&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) represents an extreme form of complex congenital heart&#xD;
      disease in which the infant has prolonged cyanosis and a single systemic right ventricle.&#xD;
      Staged palliation beginning with surgery in the neonatal period is the most common approach&#xD;
      to infants with HLHS. After initial surgical palliation, infants are critically ill due to&#xD;
      ischemia/reperfusion injury from cardiopulmonary bypass, coronary ischemia attributed to&#xD;
      diastolic runoff, reduced total ventricular mass, continued hypoxemia during a time of&#xD;
      increased metabolic demands, and finally, the inherent inefficiency of parallel circulation.&#xD;
      The presence of any one of these physiologic derangements places the infant with HLHS at&#xD;
      great risk for ischemia, organ dysfunction, circulatory collapse and, even, death.&#xD;
      Postoperative monitoring of venous oximetry and, more recently, near infrared spectroscopy,&#xD;
      have identified periods of impaired oxygen delivery and ischemia, allowed for interventions&#xD;
      that enhance oxygen delivery and improved survival after cardiac surgery. Although, an&#xD;
      apparent relationship exists between oxygen delivery and survival after cardiac surgery,&#xD;
      little data is available on the relationship between oxygen delivery and neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes (inclusive of neurocognitive and neuropsychologic outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from our center has recently identified that reduced venous oximetry was&#xD;
      associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. These initial findings warrant further&#xD;
      investigation of neurologic injury, specifically, how such morbidity relates to perioperative&#xD;
      ischemia and cerebral oxygen delivery. Hence, the purpose of this study is to understand the&#xD;
      relationship of perioperative tissue dysoxia and long-term neurodevelopmental morbidity in&#xD;
      children subject to oxygen delivery at which neurodevelopment is compromised. Identification&#xD;
      of a critical threshold that may be devastating to a child's neurodevelopment and quality of&#xD;
      life would allow for early intervention, goal-directed therapy and ultimately, improve&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
