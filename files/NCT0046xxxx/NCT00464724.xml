      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to: 1) evaluate the feasibility of 3T MRSI of prostate in&#xD;
      improving the spectral resolution, using a PFC-filled endorectal coil, 2) develop a&#xD;
      systematic metabolic grading system for tumor detection by identifying the abnormal peak&#xD;
      areas of Cho, Cr, Po, and Ci for the prostate carcinoma, specifically from PFC-filled&#xD;
      endorectal 3T MRSI, and 3) evaluate the efficacy of the metabolic grading system in tumor&#xD;
      detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of the study is to provide an early prognostic indicator and means of&#xD;
      monitoring the biologic status of the prostate cancer during the course of the disease.&#xD;

      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer tissue has certain differences in its metabolism (chemical makeup) that are&#xD;
      not seen in normal tissue. MRSI is a type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that uses the&#xD;
      same type of scanner as a standard MRI. Unlike standard MRI, which takes pictures of the body&#xD;
      regions, MRSI shows the metabolic features of the prostate cells. MRSI exams that use a&#xD;
      &quot;coil&quot; behind the prostate (inside of the rectum) have been used to measure the metabolic&#xD;
      features of prostate cancer tissue. This has been shown to improve the accuracy of finding&#xD;
      prostate tumor using standard scanners called &quot;1.5T&quot; scanners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coil works like an antenna, and air is normally used inside the coil to inflate it. The&#xD;
      accuracy of endorectal MRSI exams still needs improvement. Use of PFC instead of air inside&#xD;
      of the coil has been shown to greatly improve the quality of MRSI images at 1.5T scanners. At&#xD;
      first, researchers want to learn if the newer, stronger (3T) scanners will improve the&#xD;
      quality of endorectal MRSI exam when combined with PFC within the coil. PFC is a clear and&#xD;
      odorless liquid that, as opposed to air, is physically very similar to human tissue (such as&#xD;
      prostate tissue). This makes the MRSI images much clearer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study (Part 1) and are found to be eligible, you will have&#xD;
      2 MRSI exams (one with air and one with PFC) using an endorectal coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being inserted, the coil will be inflated with air to check for a possible leak. You&#xD;
      will lie on one side, inside of a 3T MRI scanner, and the coil (covered with protective&#xD;
      nonlatex or latex) will be inserted into your rectum. Having the coil inserted is similar to&#xD;
      having an enema tip inserted. The coil will be filled with air, and you will lie on your back&#xD;
      so the first MRSI exam can be completed. Once the first MRSI exam is completed, as much of&#xD;
      the air as possible will be removed from the coil using a syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coil will then be filled with PFC, and the second MRSI exam will be repeated in the same&#xD;
      manner. At the end of the exam, the PFC will be removed in the same manner, and then the coil&#xD;
      will be removed from the rectum. There will be no direct contact between the PFC or air&#xD;
      inside the coil and your body. In total, the 2 MRSI studies should take about 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate) within 3 months of having&#xD;
      the MRSI exams performed. After the operation, your participation in this study will be over.&#xD;

      Prostate cancer tissue has certain differences in its metabolism (chemical makeup) that are&#xD;
      not seen in normal tissue. MRSI is a type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that uses the&#xD;

      anatomy (body regions), MRSI shows the metabolic features of the prostate. MRSI exams that&#xD;
      use a &quot;coil&quot; behind the prostate (inside of the rectum) have been used to measure the&#xD;
      metabolic features of prostate cancer tissue. This has been shown to improve the accuracy of&#xD;
      prostate tumor detection at standard scanners called &quot;1.5T&quot; scanners.&#xD;

&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study (Part 2) and are found to be eligible, you will have&#xD;
      an MRSI exam with PFC using an endorectal coil. Only PFC will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being inserted, the coil will be inflated with air to check for a possible leak, and&#xD;
      as much as possible of the air will be removed. You will lie on one side, inside of a 3T MRI&#xD;

      coil and your body. The procedure should take about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate) within 3 months of having&#xD;
      the MRSI exam performed. After the operation, your participation in this study will be over.&#xD;
