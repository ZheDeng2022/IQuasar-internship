  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a registry of individuals affected by Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and/or family&#xD;
      members of individuals affected by SMA. The purpose of the registry is to allow researchers&#xD;
      studying the biological basis of SMA and potential therapies in SMA access to individuals&#xD;
      interested in participating in research and/or experimental therapies. The International SMA&#xD;
      Patient Registry is supported by CureSMA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is supported by CureSMA (http://curesma.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry functions as a liaison between patients and families interested in participating&#xD;
      in research and researchers interested in studying SMA. The Registry contains information&#xD;
      from 2,500 families and over 3,000 individuals with SMA from all over the world and continues&#xD;
      to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry has helped recruit participants for clinical trials and has provided data for&#xD;
      important SMA research studies. The Registry helps centralize information on this rare&#xD;
      genetic disease, provides families a way to learn about research studies and provides&#xD;
      researchers a way to find research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals and families affected by SMA are invited to join the Registry. Participants are&#xD;
      asked to complete questionnaires about the symptoms, treatment, medications, and other&#xD;
      experiences with SMA. Visit the Participant Portal for more information on how to sign up for&#xD;
      the Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant information is stored in a secure database. Researchers who are interested in&#xD;
      studying SMA can request two types of data from the Registry, de-identified information and&#xD;
      identifiable information. De-identified information does not contain any names or personal&#xD;
      identifiers, and can be given to researchers without having to contact Registry families.&#xD;
      Identifiable information includes information that can identify you and will never be&#xD;
      released without getting your written permission to do so. Identifiable information includes&#xD;
      data such as names and dates of birth. Some researchers may also request contact with&#xD;
      families to obtain specific information or to request participation in a research study. In&#xD;
      these instances, the Registry will contact each potential participant to ask if they are&#xD;
      willing to share their identifiable information for a research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry recognizes the importance of global collaboration. Working together with&#xD;
      researchers from all over the world is very important in the investigation of SMA. In 2008&#xD;
      the Registry joined the group, Translational Research in Europe for the Assessment and&#xD;
      Treatment of Neuromuscular Diseases (TREAT-NMD) in a global collaboration to further the&#xD;
      research goals of the neuromuscular disease community. TREAT-NMD has developed a global&#xD;
      database that compiles deidentified data transferred from participating registries around the&#xD;
      world. The main objective of the TREAT-NMD database is to assess the feasibility of clinical&#xD;
      trials, to facilitate the planning of clinical trials and to support the enrollment of&#xD;
      patients in clinical trials. This international database will also be used to answer&#xD;
      questions regarding the prevalence of particular neuromuscular disorders and assessing the&#xD;
      support of other activities such as assessing standards of care and diagnosis.&#xD;
