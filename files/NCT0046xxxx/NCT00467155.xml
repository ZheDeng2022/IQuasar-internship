      The purpose of this study is to examine Helicobacter pylori bacteria in the stomach fluids of&#xD;
      children who are hospitalized and receiving nutritional care via nasogastric feeding (tube&#xD;
      from the nose to the stomach) to treat malnutrition. The H. pylori strains from Gambian&#xD;
      children may differ genetically from the strains found in the stomachs of adults from the&#xD;
      same community. The fluid samples will be examined for H. pylori bacterial infections that&#xD;
      may make children sick and unable to absorb food. Ninety hospitalized Gambian children, less&#xD;
      than 2 years of age, requiring a nasogastric feeding tube will have stomach fluid samples&#xD;
      taken via the gastric tube. Thirty mothers of children who are positive for H. pylori&#xD;
      bacteria will provide a sample of stomach fluid. This study may help develop treatments to&#xD;
      heal the stomach and improve child growth. This study will be conducted at the Medical&#xD;
      Research Council of Great Britain Research Laboratories and Clinical Facility in Fajara.&#xD;

      This preliminary descriptive study is aimed at providing the first data that will evaluate&#xD;
      differences and similarities in genotype between isolates of H. pylori obtained from children&#xD;
      and adults living in The Gambia, West Africa, and to assess the likely magnitude of these&#xD;
      differences. This protocol describes the application of minimally invasive techniques for H.&#xD;
      pylori isolation (developed in the first part of this project and described in a separate&#xD;
      protocol, DMID protocol 06-0053) in a population study. Study subjects will be residents of&#xD;
      The Gambia, West Africa. Ninety children, aged less than 2 years, requiring therapeutic&#xD;
      nasogastric intubation and 30 healthy mothers of these children will be studied. Subjects&#xD;
      will be studied at the Medical Research Council (MRC) of Great Britain Research Laboratories&#xD;
      and Clinical Facility in Fajara, The Gambia, West Africa. Investigators propose that the&#xD;
      transition from childhood colonization to adult disease state is affected by multiple factors&#xD;
      including evolution of genotypes of colonizing H. pylori strains themselves, driven in part&#xD;
      by the host response to infection. Researchers hypothesize that H. pylori strains from&#xD;
      Gambian children will differ genetically from the strains of chronically colonized adults&#xD;
      from the same community. The investigators' genetic and phenotypic characterization of&#xD;
      pediatric and adult isolates will test for fundamental differences between strains&#xD;
      circulating in these 2 age groups, which may help to evaluate the importance of strain&#xD;
      selection and/or genome evolution in such high risk societies. The specific aim of this study&#xD;
      is to assess the relatedness of child strains and those from close adult relatives. Study&#xD;
      procedures will include aspirating gastric juice through a nasogastric tube used for infant&#xD;
      feeding purposes in children who are undergoing intensive in-patient re-nutrition, and&#xD;
      culturing H. pylori from these aspirates, and also from parents who accept the invitation to&#xD;
      donate a sample of gastric juice for culture through a nasogastric tube inserted temporarily&#xD;
      for this purpose. Most genotyping will entail arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      DNA fingerprinting, limited (focused) DNA sequencing, especially in cases of isolates with&#xD;
      closely related but non-identical fingerprints, and metronidazole susceptibility tests.&#xD;
      Genetic and phenotypic characterization of pediatric and adult isolates will test for&#xD;
      fundamental differences between strains circulating in these two age groups, and thereby help&#xD;
      evaluate the importance of strain selection and/or genome evolution in such high risk&#xD;
      societies. Subjects will be studied only once during this 2-year project. If H. pylori are&#xD;
      isolated from gastric aspirates, the mother of that child will be asked if they would agree&#xD;
      to have a nasogastric tube passed on one occasion to obtain an aspirate of gastric juice for&#xD;
      H. pylori culture. The isolates obtained will be subject to DNA analysis and genotyping.&#xD;
      Specific points to be addressed by these comparative studies will include direct comparison&#xD;
      of strains isolated from children and adults from within the same family or village. This&#xD;
      will be the first study to be performed in a society with a high early incidence of naturally&#xD;
      acquired H. pylori colonization, and will allow direct comparison between isolates from&#xD;
      children and adults from within the same families or village environment, which will provide&#xD;
      information about intra-familial and intra-community transmission of infection. The main&#xD;
      outcome measure is the degree of relatedness between the bacterial isolates. This will be&#xD;
      assessed by visual comparison between random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) results,&#xD;
      by comparison of genotype for alleles of interest, and definitively by sequencing of&#xD;
      housekeeping genes to construct phylogenetic trees of relatedness using the STAR program and&#xD;
      multiple locus sequence typing (MLST) database. There are no outcome measures for human&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

        The study population will consist of rural subsistence farmers and semi-urban dwellers&#xD;
        attending the clinic at the MRC research laboratories in Fajara, The Gambia. Subjects will&#xD;
        comprise; i) children who have a nasogastric tube inserted for nutritional rehabilitation&#xD;
        on the ward at Fajara; ii) mothers of children who are found to be H. pylori positive.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children: All children under the age of 2 years who are inpatients on the MRC ward and who&#xD;
        have a nasogastric tube in situ for the purposes of re-nutrition or other medical&#xD;
        management, will be eligible for inclusion. Children must be positive for H. pylori. No&#xD;
        lower age limit is specified for the purposes of this study, but an audit of clinical cases&#xD;
        shows that all children admitted to the MRC ward who would be eligible for inclusion are&#xD;
        aged over 3 months. Children aged under 3 months will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults: Mothers of H. pylori positive children will be eligible for inclusion. In The&#xD;
        Gambia subjects aged 18 years and above are considered as adult.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be sampled only once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects cannot be included if they do not agree to provide Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The use of antibiotics during the 2 weeks prior to recruitment will exclude subjects from&#xD;
        the study. Subjects who have participated in any other clinical trial within the last 30&#xD;
        days will be excluded&#xD;
