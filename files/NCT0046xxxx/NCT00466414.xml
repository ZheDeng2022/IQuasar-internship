  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown through research that alveolar ridges (Part of jaw bone holding teeth) tend&#xD;
      to lose width and height after extraction of teeth. Lost in height and width of the ridge can&#xD;
      cause problems in the restoration of missing teeth with bridges and implants. Hence, this&#xD;
      study is proposed to assess the use of polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds for alveolar ridge&#xD;
      preservation following extraction of teeth in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients will be divided into 2 groups. In one group, patients will have a PCL scaffold&#xD;
      placed into the socket after extraction. In other group, no scaffold will be placed. After a&#xD;
      healing period of 6 months, changes in width and height from baseline is measured for both&#xD;
      groups. A bone biopsy is also taken at this time from both groups. Hardness of bone,&#xD;
      histologic (microscopic) features of cells, percentage of living bone, radiographic density&#xD;
      of alveolar ridge and mechanical properties of the bone biopsy are then assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will attempt to show that a resorbable (can be removed by body) material like a&#xD;
      PCL scaffold can be used to maintain physical dimensions of the alveolar ridge after&#xD;
      extraction and will not interfere with osseointegration (fusion with bone). It will avoid the&#xD;
      necessity for additional corrective surgeries for patients when alveolar ridges presented&#xD;
      with inadequate width and height for placement of aesthetically pleasing and functionally&#xD;
      sound restorations. This would improve chances of success for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study successfully shows that the PCL scaffold can be accepted by the body with good&#xD;
      bone growth, uses for the PCL scaffold can be extended to other areas of clinical medicine&#xD;
      and dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PCL scaffold to be used in this study is designed and developed by a local company&#xD;
      (Osteopore International Pte Ltd). With the success of this product, Singapore's standing as&#xD;
      a biomedical hub will be further enhanced.&#xD;
