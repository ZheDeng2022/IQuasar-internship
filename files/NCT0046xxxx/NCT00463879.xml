      The purpose of this study is to determine the acute effects of the nicotinic receptor&#xD;
      allosteric modulator galantamine (0, 4 and 8 mg) on neurocognitive function in schizophrenic&#xD;
      smokers (n=20) versus schizophrenic nonsmokers (n=10) in an outpatient human laboratory&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will entail a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of acute doses of&#xD;
      the nAChR allosteric modulator galantamine hydrochloride (0, 4 and 8 mg) on neurocognitive&#xD;
      measures in schizophrenic smokers (n=20) and schizophrenic non-smokers (n=10) in a human&#xD;
      laboratory paradigm. After training on a battery of neurocognitive assessments, all subjects&#xD;
      will be studied during three separate test weeks where they will complete the neurocognitive&#xD;
      batter at baseline, and then again after acute administration of the three doses of&#xD;
      galantamine in a counterbalanced order across subjects in each experimental group.&#xD;
      Specifically, smokers would be randomized into one of two groups: 1) those who undergo&#xD;
      overnight smoking abstinence prior to the study cognitive sessions in order to determine&#xD;
      galantamine's effects on abstinence-induced cognitive impairment, and 2) those who may smoke&#xD;
      as usual prior to the study cognitive sessions. The inclusion of nonsmokers will allow for&#xD;
      the assessment of galantamine's effects on cognitive deficits in schizophrenia independent of&#xD;
      cigarette smoking. Finally, genetic variations in key metabolic genes involved in&#xD;
      catecholamine metabolism (COMT and DBH) would be evaluated as determinants of&#xD;
      galantamine-related improvements in cognitive performance in schizophrenic smokers and&#xD;
      nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We predict that galantamine will dose-dependently improve selected cognitive deficits&#xD;
      associated with schizophrenia (e.g., spatial working memory, sustained attention and prepulse&#xD;
      inhibition) which we have previously shown are selectively improved by cigarette smoking in&#xD;
      smokers with schizophrenia [18], and that this effect would be more pronounced in nonsmokers&#xD;
      with schizophrenia. If our results are positive, they would support the rationale for&#xD;
      controlled clinical trials using nAChR agonists like galantamine to treat selected domains of&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction in this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following experimental groups will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Schizophrenic Smokers under abstinence conditions (n=10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Schizophrenic Smokers in the smoking condition. (n=10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Schizophrenic Nonsmokers (n=10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three acute doses of galantamine (GAL) will be tested (0, 4 and 8 mg) in all subjects during&#xD;
      three separate test sessions separated by at least 3 days, with study medication doses across&#xD;
      sequential subjects given in a randomized, counterbalanced manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smokers (n=20) and nonsmokers (n=10) with schizophrenia will be recruited from the outpatient&#xD;
      division of The Connecticut Mental Health Center (CMHC) in New Haven, CT, and it's affiliated&#xD;
      satellite centers (Hispanic Clinic, West Haven Mental Health Center, and Yale Behavioral&#xD;
      Mental Health Center).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential subjects would meet with study staff over 2-3 intake and evaluation sessions to&#xD;
      determine study eligibility, which would typically take place within 4 weeks of study&#xD;
      enrollment. A description of the evaluation measures is given below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening evaluation will include completion of informed consent forms, a urine&#xD;
      toxicology screen to screen for recent use of illegal substances, a urine pregnancy test for&#xD;
      female subjects, a psychiatric evaluation using the SCID for DSM-IV disorders, PANSS, AIMS,&#xD;
      Webster, Barnes, BDI, Tiffany Questionnaire for Smoking Urges (T-QSU), Minnesota Nicotine&#xD;
      Withdrawal Scale (M-NWS), Shipley Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ), a blood draw for&#xD;
      plasma nicotine, plasma cotinine, as well as CBC and LFT's, and a physical examination&#xD;
      conducted by Dr. George. Subjects will be separately consented for the genetics portion of&#xD;
      the study and blood will be taken for genotyping purposes. Finally, a pre-study&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing session would be performed in order to orient and train&#xD;
      participants on the laboratory procedures. Subjects who are pregnant or planning on becoming&#xD;
      pregnant will not be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compensate all subjects who complete the screening and evaluation process ($25.00)&#xD;
      and the neurocognitive training session ($25.00) for a total of $50.00. In addition, subjects&#xD;
      would be paid $25.00 for donating a blood sample for genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood for genotyping will be obtained for COMT and DBH polymorphisms in smokers and&#xD;
      nonsmokers in schizophrenia participating in this study. The genotyping for these studies&#xD;
      will be done in collaboration with the Psychiatric Genetics laboratory of Joseph F. Cubells,&#xD;
      M.D., Ph.D. at Emory University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Procedures: Smokers will be tested on the cognitive battery at baseline (Day 1,&#xD;
      with periodic smoking breaks to minimize nicotine withdrawal), and then again 24 hours later&#xD;
      after overnight smoking abstinence (Day 2). Non-smokers will be tested at baseline (Day 1)&#xD;
      and again 24 hours later (Day 2). Study medications will be given as a single dose before the&#xD;
      Day 2 session which will produce ascending plasma drug levels (t= Â½ 5/7 h) during the two&#xD;
      hour testing session, in a counterbalanced dosing schedule of galantamine hydrobromide (0, 4,&#xD;
      and 8 mg) within each test group. If systolic blood pressure is below 90 mm Hg, the&#xD;
      galantamine study medication will be held. Before and after each session (Day 1 and Day 2),&#xD;
      clinical ratings using the PANSS, HDRS, extrapyramidal ratings, and adverse event ratings&#xD;
      would be completed. For smokers, pre-session tobacco craving and withdrawal ratings, expired&#xD;
      breath carbon monoxide, and plasma cotinine and nicotine levels would be obtained. Smokers&#xD;
      randomized to the abstinence condition would receive $150.00 for successful completion of&#xD;
      each of the subsequent three test session procedures requiring overnight abstinence ($50.00&#xD;
      for successful abstinence, and $100.00 for subsequent testing session completion). Smokers&#xD;
      randomized to the non-abstinence condition would be also receiving $150.00 for successful&#xD;
      completion of each of the three test session procedures in order to maintain consistency.&#xD;
      Nonsmokers would receive $100.00 for completion of each of the three test sessions beyond the&#xD;
      training session. In addition, a completion bonus of $50.00 will be paid to all subjects who&#xD;
      complete all study procedures. Thus, smokers with schizophrenia could earn $575.00, and&#xD;
      nonsmokers $425.00 for their completion of the entire study. The proposed single subject&#xD;
