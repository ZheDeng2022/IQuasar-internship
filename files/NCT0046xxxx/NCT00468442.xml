  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells&#xD;
      are destroyed, resulting in poor blood sugar control. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety and effectiveness of islet transplantation, combined with the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications and medications to support islet survival for treating type 1&#xD;
      diabetes in individuals experiencing hypoglycemia unawareness and severe hypoglycemic&#xD;
      episodes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is commonly treated with the administration of insulin, either by multiple&#xD;
      insulin injections or by a continuous supply of insulin through a wearable pump. Insulin&#xD;
      therapy allows long-term survival in individuals with type 1 diabetes; however, it does not&#xD;
      guarantee constant normal blood sugar control. Because of this, long-term type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      survivors often develop vascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease&#xD;
      that can cause poor vision and blindness, and diabetic nephropathy, a kidney disease that can&#xD;
      lead to kidney failure. Some individuals with type 1 diabetes develop hypoglycemia&#xD;
      unawareness, a life-threatening condition that is not easily treatable with medication and is&#xD;
      characterized by reduced or absent warning signals for hypoglycemia. For such individuals,&#xD;
      pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation are possible treatment options. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      insulin independence among islet transplant recipients tends to decline over time. New&#xD;
      strategies aimed at promoting engraftment of transplanted islets are needed to improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes associated with this procedure. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of islet transplantation, when combined with an immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medication regimen containing rituximab. This regimen is intended to treat type 1 diabetes in&#xD;
      individuals experiencing hypoglycemia unawareness and severe hypoglycemic episodes. This&#xD;
      study will also seek to improve the understanding of determinants of success and failure of&#xD;
      islet transplants for type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to this study or the Phase 3 islet&#xD;
      transplantation study (DAIT CIT-07). Participants in this study will receive up to three&#xD;
      separate islet transplants and a regimen of immunosuppressive medications consisting of&#xD;
      antithymocyte globulin (ATG), sirolimus, and rituximab. They will begin receiving ATG,&#xD;
      sirolimus, and rituximab 2 days prior to the first islet transplant. ATG will continue to be&#xD;
      given until Day 2 post-transplant, and sirolimus will be given for the duration of the study.&#xD;
      They will receive additional rituximab on Days 5 and 12 post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplantations will involve an inpatient hospital stay and infusion of islets into the&#xD;
      portal vein. Participants who do not achieve or maintain insulin independence by Day 75&#xD;
      post-transplant will be considered for a second islet transplant. Participants who remain&#xD;
      dependent on insulin for longer than 1 month after the second transplant and who show partial&#xD;
      graft function will be considered for a third islet transplant. Daclizumab or basiliximab&#xD;
      will be used in place of ATG for the second and third transplants, if they are necessary.&#xD;
      Participants who do not meet the criteria for a subsequent transplant and do not have a&#xD;
      functioning graft will enter a reduced follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be approximately 15 study visits following each transplant. A physical exam,&#xD;
      review of adverse events, and blood collection will occur at most visits. A chest x-ray,&#xD;
      abdominal ultrasound, electrocardiogram, quality of life questionnaires, urine collection,&#xD;
      and glomerular filtrating rate (GFR) testing will occur at some visits. Participants will&#xD;
      also test their own blood glucose levels at least four times per day throughout the study. A&#xD;
      12-month follow-up period will take place after the participant's last transplant.&#xD;
