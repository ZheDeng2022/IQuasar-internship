      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the effects of 0.12 ppm ozone&#xD;
      exposure on humans. We know from other studies that exposure to levels of ozone that are seen&#xD;
      on bad air pollution days, can cause an increased risk of illness and even death in some&#xD;
      people with certain health problems like asthma and heart disease. We also know from studies&#xD;
      we have done in our lab that even healthy people can have an inflammatory (an increase in the&#xD;
      amount of bacteria fighting cells) response to high levels of ozone. We suspect that exposure&#xD;
      to low levels of ozone makes the body more susceptible to things like allergens. For&#xD;
      instance, in persons allergic to pollen, exposure to ozone in the environment may cause them&#xD;
      to have more allergy symptoms when they are around pollen than they would have if they were&#xD;
      not exposed to ozone first. In this study we are looking to find the lowest level of ozone to&#xD;
      which healthy people can be exposed without seeing that increased immune response. We will&#xD;
      use 0.12 ppm ozone; this is roughly the amount of ozone you would be exposed to on a &quot;yellow&quot;&#xD;
      ozone day in the triangle area in the summer if you spent the entire day out of doors and&#xD;
      exercising moderately.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Low levels of both endotoxin and O3 have been reported to prime airway responses for other&#xD;
      stimuli, with a notable example being the immediate and late phase response to allergen.&#xD;
      Likewise, epidemiological studies indicate that levels of O3 below the current air quality&#xD;
      standards for ozone are still linked with exacerbation of respiratory tract disease. On a&#xD;
      cellular level, both endotoxin and oxidants can prime inflammatory cells such that response&#xD;
      to subsequently inhaled stimuli is enhanced. This has led to the idea that ozone may also&#xD;
      enhance response to endotoxin and the reverse. As shown in our preliminary data, we have&#xD;
      carefully examined the response to low levels of inhaled endotoxin and have found that a dose&#xD;
      of 10,000 EU enhances the phagocytic function of macrophages, monocytes and PMNs and modifies&#xD;
      the expression of cell surface receptors (CD11b, CD14), and alters IL-13 levels in sputum&#xD;
      without causing PMN influx to the airway. This study is similar in design, but will evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of ozone at a lower exposure level instead of endotoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been thought that monocytes and macrophages did not mediate response to ozone because&#xD;
      macrophages recovered from the airways of persons exposed to ozone had blunted responses to&#xD;
      stimuli such as opsonized zymosan or other ligands, and in vitro, exposure of macrophages to&#xD;
      ozone likewise renders them hypo-responsive to other stimuli, including endotoxin. There is&#xD;
      general agreement that the airway response to endotoxin is mediated primarily by actions on&#xD;
      macrophages and monocytes. However, monocytes undergo adaptation to endotoxin with previous&#xD;
      challenge with endotoxin, and the chronic presence of endotoxin (i.e. in sepsis) also induces&#xD;
      tolerance to the effect of additional exposure to endotoxin. Thus, suppression of&#xD;
      monocyte/macrophage function by ozone may not be adequate evidence that these cells do not&#xD;
      participate in ozone-induced airway inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been argued that because ozone causes epithelial cells to generate mediators like&#xD;
      IL-8 which is a potent chemoattractant for PMNs, the response to ozone was primarily&#xD;
      orchestrated through these cells. However, there are data supporting a role for macrophages&#xD;
      in response to ozone. Also, epithelial cells produce stress-induced endogenous ligands, many&#xD;
      of which are known to be generated following exposure to ozone, which could interact with&#xD;
      innate immune (e.g.CD14, TLR4), complement (e.g. CR3) or other receptors on airway&#xD;
      mononuclear cells. An initial experiment by our group shows that ozone challenge of primary&#xD;
      epithelial cell cultures (developed from nasal epithelial samplings of volunteers) yield&#xD;
      supernatants which activate COX2 and induce IL-6 secretion from peripheral blood monocytes,&#xD;
      indicating the potential for an O3-induced, epithelial-derived monocyte ligand. To approach&#xD;
      the question of whether low level exposure to ozone modifies airway phagocyte biology (as&#xD;
      determined primarily by cell surface marker expression, phagocyte function and endotoxin&#xD;
      responsiveness), this study will be similar to the one detailed for endotoxin only volunteers&#xD;
      are asked to undergo low level ozone exposure to determine if a priming dose can be&#xD;
      identified that modifies monocyte biology but that is sub-threshold for inducing a neutrophil&#xD;
      response in the airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to ozone as low as 0.12 ppm for 1 hour without exercise may prime response to&#xD;
      allergen, yet is not an otherwise very effective dose for induction of inflammatory or lung&#xD;
      function changes. 0.12 ppm O3 for 2 hours with 1 hour of intermittent exercise also does not&#xD;
      yield airways inflammation but does result in generation of a salicylate product in&#xD;
      volunteers dosed with aspirin which has been proposed as a marker of O3 exposure. Using these&#xD;
      and similar studies as a guide, we will perform a study in which volunteers will undergo 0.12&#xD;
      ppm ozone exposure for 2 hours with moderate, intermittent exercise (to yield 35L/min&#xD;
      ventilation for a total exercise duration of 1hr). We will examine sputum neutrophil levels&#xD;
      (% PMNs and PMN/mg sputum), cell surface marker expression (CD11b, CD14) on sputum and blood&#xD;
      inflammatory cells (monocytes, macrophages (sputum), phagocytosis and cytokine response to&#xD;
      endotoxin stimulation, 6hr following exposure to ozone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will carry out an interim analysis after we have completed study in 6 volunteers to&#xD;
      determine if we have identified a level of ozone that is likely to modify mononuclear cell&#xD;
      function without significant neutrophilia. If 0.12 ppm of ozone for 2 hours appears to induce&#xD;
      a priming response, no change in the PMN response and some modification of monocyte biology,&#xD;
      we will continue with that dose. If we see an increase in PMNs, then we will refocus the&#xD;
      protocol to challenge volunteers with 0.08 ppm O3 for 2 hours with moderate exercise. If&#xD;
      there is no response at the macrophage level, then we would challenge volunteers with 0.2 ppm&#xD;
      for 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have linked ozone with increased morbidity and mortality. One possible&#xD;
      explanation is decreased heart rate variability (HRV). In hospitalized patients, decreased&#xD;
      HRV has been directly correlated with increased mortality under multiple conditions. Recent&#xD;
      studies completed here have linked particulate matter to decreased HRV. In this study we will&#xD;
      evaluate each subject's heart rate variability using ambulatory ECG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Low level ozone will prime airway macrophages/monocytes such that they will be more&#xD;
           responsive to inflammatory stimuli, including endotoxin and opsonized zymosan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low level ozone will enhance airway and blood monocyte and macrophage function, and&#xD;
           induce some alterations in some cell surface markers.&#xD;
