      Nutritional deficiencies are a major problem in school children in India and have a variety&#xD;
      of adverse effects on their cognitive development and growth, and increase susceptibility to&#xD;
      infections. There is strong evidence for beneficial effects of iodine, iron and&#xD;
      protein-energy on cognitive development in children, while evidence for vitamin B6, vitamin&#xD;
      B12, folate, zinc and, omega-3 fatty acids and in particular docosahexanoic acid (DHA) is&#xD;
      limited and inconclusive. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2x2 factorial design&#xD;
      will be conducted to assess the effect of a micronutrient with or without omega-3 fatty acids&#xD;
      on cognitive development and performance and other selected outcome variables such as growth,&#xD;
      morbidity and immune response in children of 7-9 years of age in India.&#xD;

      Nutritional deficiencies are a major problem in school children in India and have a variety&#xD;
      of adverse effects on their cognitive development and growth, and increase susceptibility to&#xD;
      infections. There is strong evidence for beneficial effects of iodine, iron and&#xD;
      protein-energy on cognitive development in children, while evidence for vitamin B6, vitamin&#xD;
      B12, folate, zinc and, omega-3 fatty acids and in particular docosahexanoic acid (DHA) is&#xD;
      limited and inconclusive. The present study will investigate the efficacy of foods fortified&#xD;
      with omega-3 fatty acids including DHA and a micronutrient mix (iodine, iron, vitamin B2,&#xD;
      vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folate, zinc, calcium, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin E) on&#xD;
      improving cognitive development and performance in school children in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2x2 factorial design in&#xD;
      which children aged 7-9 years will be randomised to one of four treatment groups and&#xD;
      prospectively followed for a period of twelve months to assess cognitive development and&#xD;
      performance and other selected outcome variables such as growth, morbidity and immune&#xD;
      response. Intervention will take place in primary schools, where children will receive three&#xD;
      intervention products daily. The products will contain omega-3 fatty acids with&#xD;
      micronutrients, or micronutrients only, or omega3 fatty acids only or a placebo. At baseline,&#xD;
      6 and 12 months cognitive tests will be administered and blood samples will be drawn to&#xD;
      assess nutritional status and immune response to hepatitis B vaccination. Compliance will be&#xD;
      measured daily and morbidity will be monitored weekly by means of a questionnaire.&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements will be carried out monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that, after 12 months of intervention, children consuming products containing&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acids with micronutrients will have statistically significant higher scores and&#xD;
      higher improvement in scores on cognitive tests, will grow taller and have a better immune&#xD;
      response than children consuming control products.&#xD;
