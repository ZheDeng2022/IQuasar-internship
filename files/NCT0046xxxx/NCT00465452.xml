    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposal is to determine if switching PD patients treated with&#xD;
      pramipexole to ropinirole CR reduces the non-motor side effects frequently experienced by&#xD;
      these patients. Side effects that we will monitor in particular include somnolence,&#xD;
      peripheral edema, cognitive decline with and without hallucinations. PD patients followed in&#xD;
      the MUO Neurology Clinic who are being treated with pramipexole and have evidence of at least&#xD;
      one of the following symptoms: somnolence, cognitive impairment with or without&#xD;
      hallucinations, or peripheral edema will be offered the opportunity to participate in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      pramipexole to ropinirole CR reduces the non-motor side effects frequently experienced by&#xD;
      these patients. Side effects that we will monitor in particular include somnolence,&#xD;
      peripheral edema, cognitive decline with and without hallucinations. PD patients followed in&#xD;
      the MUO Neurology Clinic who are being treated with pramipexole and have evidence of at least&#xD;
      one of the following symptoms: somnolence, cognitive impairment with or without&#xD;
      hallucinations, or peripheral edema will be offered the opportunity to participate in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen subjects who are currently receiving pramipexole therapy (monotherapy or adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy) who are experiencing one or more of the following symptoms: somnolence, cognitive&#xD;
      decline with/without hallucinations, and peripheral edema will be asked if they are willing&#xD;
      to participate at the time of their clinic visit at the PDMDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The crossover from pramipexole to ropinirole CR will be performed over a 2 week interval.&#xD;
      During the first week, the initial drug dose will substitute ½ of the pramipexole with ½ of&#xD;
      the target dose of ropinirole CR. If subjects are tolerating the drug change, then 100% of&#xD;
      the target dose of ropinirole CR (and no pramipexole) will be started in the second week.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each subject must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to qualify for entrance into&#xD;
        the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are male or female and are aged 55 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects and/or their legal guardians must be able and willing to give informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be on stable doses of pramipexole for greater than 4 weeks duration&#xD;
             prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

             screening. Women are considered to not be of child-bearing potential if they have been&#xD;
             surgically sterilized (physician-documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation) or if they&#xD;
             are post-menopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's based on the presence of at&#xD;

             obvious history of head trauma, stroke, infectious, structural, or metabolic&#xD;
             abnormality consistent with an alternative diagnosis to Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of one or more of the following symptoms: somnolence (ESS score ≥ 9),&#xD;

        A subject who meets any of the following criteria will NOT qualify for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be receiving any treatments for excess somnolence such as&#xD;
             amphetamine derivatives, other stimulants or Provigil.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with actively treated malignancies, clinically significant heart disease,&#xD;
             kidney, liver, or pulmonary disorders will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with clinical depression who are not receiving stable doses of antidepressant&#xD;
             therapy in excess of 4 weeks duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with history of orthostatic hypotension (&gt;30mm drop in systolic pressure&#xD;
             and/or &gt;20mm drop in diastolic pressure) associated with syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects started within the last 14 days on any drug known to substantially inhibit&#xD;
             CYP1A2 (e.g., cimetidine, fluvoxamine) or induce CYP1A2 (e.g.omeprazole) (Note:&#xD;
             Subjects already on these agents may be enrolled but must remain on the stable doses&#xD;
             of the agents from 14 days prior to the beginning of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have other medical conditions that are considered clinically unstable or&#xD;
             that may compromise the safety of the patient during this study.&#xD;
