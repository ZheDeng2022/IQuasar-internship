  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth commonest cancer in the world with poor&#xD;
      prognosis, as the annual mortality is almost equivalent to the incidence. This is mainly due&#xD;
      to late diagnosis and co-morbid liver dysfunction. HCC is prevalent in our region than in the&#xD;
      West due to prevalent Hepatitis B infection and carriers. At the time of diagnosis, only 10 -&#xD;
      20% of HCC patients are candidates for liver resection or transplantation. Almost 40-50% of&#xD;
      patients have such poor liver function and co-morbid conditions that only supportive cares&#xD;
      are offered. Thus the median survival time is 18-24 months for resectable disease, 6 months&#xD;
      for unresectabe disease and 3 months for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current screening methods for HCC in high risk patients depend on alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and&#xD;
      ultrasound of the liver. Neither test is sensitive or specific enough for early detection.&#xD;
      Therefore, early diagnosis with novel protein biomarkers is needed urgently and may provides&#xD;
      hope to improve treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary study in 49 HCC patients have identified several proteins such as truncated&#xD;
      complement C3a, albumin, B2 microglobulin, may be potentially helpful in early diagnosis. We&#xD;
      have started a large prospective and longitudinal study in July 2006, with nearly 100&#xD;
      patients accrued. This application is to extend and expand our current study. We aim to (i)&#xD;
      identify and validate novel protein biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC (ii) conduct&#xD;
      longitudinal proteomics with most up-to-date methods to discover new biomarker for early&#xD;
      detection and prognostication of HCC (iii) set up gene and plasma depository and clinical&#xD;
      database for HCC in collaboration with Singapore Tissue Network.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40% of HCC patients have normal AFP. Moreover, AFP can also be elevated in patients&#xD;
      with cirrhosis or exacerbation of chronic hepatitis. Prospective studies evaluating the value&#xD;
      of AFP in HCC surveillance have reported sensitivities of 39-64%, specificity of 76-91% and&#xD;
      positive predictive values of 9 -32% 9-11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a small handful of biomarkers were identified in the blood of 49 HCC patients by&#xD;
      SELDI / MS proteomic analysis of their blood with specificity and sensitivity both at 90% 12,&#xD;
      13. These were truncated complement C3a, albumin, B2 microglobulin, and histidine-rich&#xD;
      glycoprotein. In addition, insulin growth factor (IGF) and its binding protein have been&#xD;
      shown to be novel biomarkers of HCC 14-17. A larger prospective study is necessary to&#xD;
      validate these findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other investigators have also used Surface-enhanced laser desorption / ionization&#xD;
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI) to study proteomics in HCC. Most of the studies&#xD;
      included small numbers of patients and did not include independent test set or report on&#xD;
      reproducibility most of the time. Thus, controversies continue on both the technology of&#xD;
      SELDI and validation of the findings. Nevertheless, Ward et al reported that Kappa and Lumda&#xD;
      immunoglobulin light chains were elevated by an average pf 50% in the serum of HCC patients&#xD;
      (p &lt; 0.001, sensitivity 94%, specificity 86%) with Hepatitis C related cirrhosis 18.&#xD;
      Schwegler et al reported that SELDI-TOF MS profiling of serum can distinguish chronic&#xD;
      Hepatitis C from HCV- related HCC with a sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 76%.&#xD;
      Sensitivity and specificity can be improved with the addition of AFP, des-gamma&#xD;
      carboxyprothrombin, and GP73 19. Other reports also indicated potential marker of heat-shock&#xD;
      protein 27 20 and complement C3a 21. However, all studies lack prospective and longitudinal&#xD;
      follow-up with multiple serum samples from same patient. Our trial is designed to test the&#xD;
      changes of proteomic overtime to identify the earliest possible biomarkers for HCC.&#xD;
