  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for patients with metastatic or locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&#xD;
      is poor. The role of conventional systemic chemotherapy has been very limited because most&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents are in-effective and relative toxic to HCC patients who tend to have&#xD;
      poor organ function reserves due to liver cirrhosis. The molecular-targeted therapy, which&#xD;
      aims at deranged signaling pathways of cancer cells or their microenvironment, holds promise&#xD;
      for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), a novel bi-aryl urea, is a potent inhibitor of VEGFR2 and Raf&#xD;
      kinase. The clinical activity of sorafenib in HCC has been tested in a phase II study (Bayer&#xD;
      study 10874), which enrolled a total of 137 advanced HCC patients. There were 4% of&#xD;
      documented partial response, 5% of minor response, and 55% of stable disease. The 6- month&#xD;
      progression -free for the cohort was 40%. Currently, there are two on-going large-scale&#xD;
      randomized trials of sorafenib in advanced HCC patients worldwide.&#xD;

      Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), a novel bi-aryl urea, is a potent inhibitor of VEGFR2 and Raf&#xD;
      kinase. The clinical activity of sorafenib in HCC has been tested in a phase II study (Bayer&#xD;

      progression -free for the cohort was 40%. Currently, there are two on-going large-scale&#xD;
      randomized trials of sorafenib in advanced HCC patients worldwide.In this study proposal, we&#xD;
      propose to combine sorafenib with metronomic chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced HCC&#xD;
      patients. It has been recently demonstrated that cytotoxic chemotherapy, when given in a&#xD;
      low-dose, continuous, and uninterrupted way (i.e. the &quot;metronomic&quot; chemotherapy), inhibits&#xD;
      tumor angiogenesis. The anti-angiogenesis effect of metronomic chemotherapy can be&#xD;
      potentiated by combining the inhibitors of VEGF/VEGFR pathway. UFUR®, a composite drug&#xD;
      composed of tegafur and uracil, is an orally active 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) preparation. The&#xD;
      activity of tegafur/uracil in HCC has been tested in two relatively small-scale phase II&#xD;
      studies, with objective tumor response rates ranging from 0~18%. Interestingly, tegafur and&#xD;
      its metabolites, including γ-hydroxybutyric acid and γ-butyrolactone, have been shown to be&#xD;
      potent inhibitors of angiogenesis in several preclinical models. Therefore, tegafur/uracil&#xD;
      (UFUR®), which has potential anti-HCC activity and interesting anti-angiogenesis activity, is&#xD;
      an ideal candidate drug to improve the efficacy of sorafenib in HCC.&#xD;
