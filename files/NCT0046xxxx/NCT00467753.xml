      The proposed study is designed to assess the effectiveness of treatment with Oxcarbazepine&#xD;
      vs. placebo in childhood/adolescent autism. This is a twelve-week study involving twenty&#xD;
      subjects between the ages of five and seventeen with a diagnosis of autism. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive a psychiatric and medical evaluation by the study psychiatrist to see if she/he has&#xD;
      any psychiatric or medical illnesses that would interfere with their ability to participate&#xD;
      in this study. These evaluations may take up to an hour to complete. In addition, subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in a psychiatric interview designed to determine the child's&#xD;
      diagnosis and current problem areas. The subject's parent will also be asked to fill out&#xD;
      psychiatric questionnaires. The interview and questionnaires may take up to 4 hours to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;

    <measure>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated during Baseline and Termination</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland Scale is a semi-structured informant interview that assesses subjects' functioning. It is administered to a caretaker/family member. The scale has been revised and standardized in all populations. This scale has been found to assess social deficits in autism and strengths in daily living skills. Items are classified under four major adaptive domains: communication, daily living skills, socialization and motor skills. The items are scored 0-2 (yes/sometimes/never). Each domain is summed, and the domain scores are converted to standardized scores. The normative score is 100, with standard deviation of 15. The standardized score is used in this study. A higher score (above 100) means better adaptive behavior. Minimum value is 0, maximum value is infinity.</description>

    <measure>Aberrant Behavior Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Bi weekly</time_frame>
    <description>Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)-Community Version (Irritability Subscale) (Aman et al. 1985). It is designed to objectively identify five behavior subscales through observation by the primary caregiver. The five behavior subscales include (ranges show no problem to severe problem): irritability (range 0-45), lethargy (range 0-48), stereotypy (range 0-21), hyperactivity range 0-48), and inappropriate speech (range 0-12), all possible signs and symptoms of affective instability in autistic individuals (Lainhart &amp; Folstein, 1994). Improvement is shown with scores decreasing over time. Total score is not used. Inter-rater reliability for the ABC-CV is moderate to high across subscales with a mean of .63. Test-retest reliability correlations are .98 -Irritability, .99 -Lethargy, .98 -Stereotypy, .98 -Hyperactivity, and .96 -Inappropriate Speech. The ABC will be filled out by an informant (teacher/parent), and then reviewed by the IE. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated during Baseline and Termination</time_frame>
    <description>The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule is primarily used as a diagnostic tool providing a standardized assessment for observation of social and communicative behavior in children and adults. It is composed of four modules for assessing children/adults of varying language ability (Module 1 for nonverbal individuals, to Module 4 fluent individuals). The instrument provides a series of structured and semi-structured presses for social interaction and communication, which are then scored. The scores are 0 (no behavior) to 3 (markedly abnormal). Subcategories are Language/communication, 8 scores, Social interaction, 12 scores, Stereotyped Behavior/restricted interests, 4 scores and Play, 2 scores, as well as other behavior, 3 scores. The maximum score is 87, minimum is 0, with cutoff scores to determine diagnosis. Higher scores indicate a more severe behavioral disorder.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-AD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered weekly Administered weekly</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI)-AD (Guy, 1976). This is a standard rating scale with 7-point global severity and change scales which has been modified for Autistic Disorder. A rating of 2 is given when there is a substantial reduction in symptoms so that a treating clinician would be unlikely to change treatment. A rating of 1 is reserved for patients who become virtually symptom-free. A rating of 3 (minimally improved) on the CGI is defined as slight symptomatic improvement that is not deemed clinically significant. Administration time is approximately 2 minutes.</description>

    <description>Oxcarbazepine is available in a 300mg/5ml solution. Dosage will start at 150 mg (2.5ml) at night for 3 days and will be increased to 150 mg in the am and pm. For children who are able to tolerate the 150 mg BID dose, the oxcarbazepine will be increased to 300 mg at night and 150 mg in the morning for 3 days and 300 mg BID for the next week. The children will remain on this dose until week 3, at which time if they are tolerating the medication and do not have a Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI) of 1 (very much improved) they will be increased to 600 mg twice a day in a method similar to the above increases. After week 4, the child will remain on the same stable dose.</description>

        <title>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales</title>
        <description>The Vineland Scale is a semi-structured informant interview that assesses subjects' functioning. It is administered to a caretaker/family member. The scale has been revised and standardized in all populations. This scale has been found to assess social deficits in autism and strengths in daily living skills. Items are classified under four major adaptive domains: communication, daily living skills, socialization and motor skills. The items are scored 0-2 (yes/sometimes/never). Each domain is summed, and the domain scores are converted to standardized scores. The normative score is 100, with standard deviation of 15. The standardized score is used in this study. A higher score (above 100) means better adaptive behavior. Minimum value is 0, maximum value is infinity.</description>

            <description>Oxcarbazepine is the active drug to be given to subjects in the experimental arm&#xD;
Oxcarbazepine: Oxcarbazepine is available in a 300mg/5ml solution. Dosage will start at 150 mg (2.5ml) at night for 3 days and will be increased to 150 mg in the am and pm. For children who are able to tolerate the 150 mg BID dose, the oxcarbazepine will be increased to 300 mg at night and 150 mg in the morning for 3 days and 300 mg BID for the next week. The children will remain on this dose until week 3, at which time if they are tolerating the medication and do not have a Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI) of 1 (very much improved) they will be increased to 600 mg twice a day in a method similar to the above increases. After week 4, the child will remain on the same stable dose.</description>

        <title>Aberrant Behavior Checklist</title>
        <description>Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)-Community Version (Irritability Subscale) (Aman et al. 1985). It is designed to objectively identify five behavior subscales through observation by the primary caregiver. The five behavior subscales include (ranges show no problem to severe problem): irritability (range 0-45), lethargy (range 0-48), stereotypy (range 0-21), hyperactivity range 0-48), and inappropriate speech (range 0-12), all possible signs and symptoms of affective instability in autistic individuals (Lainhart &amp; Folstein, 1994). Improvement is shown with scores decreasing over time. Total score is not used. Inter-rater reliability for the ABC-CV is moderate to high across subscales with a mean of .63. Test-retest reliability correlations are .98 -Irritability, .99 -Lethargy, .98 -Stereotypy, .98 -Hyperactivity, and .96 -Inappropriate Speech. The ABC will be filled out by an informant (teacher/parent), and then reviewed by the IE. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.</description>

        <title>Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule</title>
        <description>The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule is primarily used as a diagnostic tool providing a standardized assessment for observation of social and communicative behavior in children and adults. It is composed of four modules for assessing children/adults of varying language ability (Module 1 for nonverbal individuals, to Module 4 fluent individuals). The instrument provides a series of structured and semi-structured presses for social interaction and communication, which are then scored. The scores are 0 (no behavior) to 3 (markedly abnormal). Subcategories are Language/communication, 8 scores, Social interaction, 12 scores, Stereotyped Behavior/restricted interests, 4 scores and Play, 2 scores, as well as other behavior, 3 scores. The maximum score is 87, minimum is 0, with cutoff scores to determine diagnosis. Higher scores indicate a more severe behavioral disorder.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-AD)</title>
        <description>Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI)-AD (Guy, 1976). This is a standard rating scale with 7-point global severity and change scales which has been modified for Autistic Disorder. A rating of 2 is given when there is a substantial reduction in symptoms so that a treating clinician would be unlikely to change treatment. A rating of 1 is reserved for patients who become virtually symptom-free. A rating of 3 (minimally improved) on the CGI is defined as slight symptomatic improvement that is not deemed clinically significant. Administration time is approximately 2 minutes.</description>
