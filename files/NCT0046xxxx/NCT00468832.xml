    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the largest long-term assessment of people with&#xD;
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In this study, the investigators associated with the&#xD;
      Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group CINRG) will take a detailed look (for&#xD;
      a minimum of eight years) at DMD participant's physical abilities, the medical problems they&#xD;
      experience, and how they use health care services. Physical abilities will be compared to a&#xD;
      group of healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second purpose of this study is to find out whether small, normal differences in the&#xD;
      genetic makeup of people with DMD (called &quot;single nucleotide polymorphisms&quot; or &quot;SNPs&quot;) affect&#xD;
      how their disease progresses and relates to muscle strength/size and steroid response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third purpose of this study is to study genetic variations associated with DMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final purpose of this study is to determine whether certain biomarkers are present in&#xD;
      people with DMD and not in healthy controls.&#xD;

      Phenotyping Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Longitudinally assess body function and body structure (impairment) through the&#xD;
      measurement of anthropometrics, muscle strength and pulmonary function in subjects with DMD&#xD;
      through the multicenter CINRG network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Longitudinally assess activity limitations in subjects with DMD through CINRG with&#xD;
      timed motor performance, burden of care, and functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Longitudinally assess secondary conditions in subjects with DMD, and relative risks of&#xD;
      developing those conditions based on exposure to preventive interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Longitudinally assess participation, life satisfaction, service utilization and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life in subjects with DMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: Determine appropriate outcome measurements for impairment, activities (activity&#xD;
      limitations), participation and quality of life to determine the effect of prednisone and&#xD;
      other therapeutic interventions on these factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 6: Using the most robust impairment, activity, participation and quality of life outcome&#xD;
      measures, determine the sample size, power and statistical methods for the analysis of the&#xD;
      effect size for future planned randomized-controlled rehabilitation interventions in DMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 7: Examine the associations between interventions and incidence and severity of secondary&#xD;
      conditions, achievement of disease milestones and measures of motor function and mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 8: To assess the validity and responsiveness of novel clinical outcome measures in DMD,&#xD;
      including the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), the 9-hole peg test (9-HPT) Egen Klassification&#xD;
      Scale(EK), the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), and quantitative key and pinch grip&#xD;
      strength testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 9: To assess the reliability, validity and responsiveness of novel patient-reported&#xD;
      outcome(PRO) measures in DMD, including the NeuroQOL and PedsQL Neuromuscular Module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 10: To assess the clinical meaningfulness of novel objective clinical outcome measures by&#xD;
      assessing their ability to predict milestones of loss of ability to stand from supine, to&#xD;
      stand from a seated position, to climb stairs, to ambulate independently and to raise a hand&#xD;
      to the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 11: To determine the impact of development and growth on outcome measure performance,we&#xD;
      will assess physical function on a group of healthy, typically developing male children and&#xD;
      adults between 6 and 30 years of age for outcome measures of motor function and strength&#xD;
      including the9-HPT, 6MWT, NSAA, timed function tests and quantitative muscle strength (QMT).&#xD;
      Test results from this cohort will be used to develop initial percent predicted for age&#xD;
      values for these assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SNP Genotyping Study Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal of the proposed study is to define polygenic modifiers of disease progression, and&#xD;
      also response to treatment with glucocorticoids (prednisone and deflazacort). The most common&#xD;
      type of human genetic variation is the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, a base position&#xD;
      at which two alternative bases occur at an appreciable frequency (&gt;1%) in the population.&#xD;
      SNPs are 90% of variation in the human genome. SNPs occur on the average of 1 per 1000 to&#xD;
      2000 bp throughout the 3.2 billion bp of the human genome while coding region SNPs (cSNPs)&#xD;
      occur on the average of 1 per 346 bp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genome-wide Association Study Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal of the proposed study is to isolate genomic DNA and find possible correlations of&#xD;
      clinical phenotypes with gene loci associated with mild vs. severe clinical presentation,&#xD;
      progression, or response to steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Biomarkers Study Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to discover and validate sensitive and specific serum biomarkers for DMD.&#xD;

        The incidence of DMD is considered equal across racial and ethnic groups. At the start of&#xD;
        the CINRG program, it was assumed by investigators that the aggregate subject populations&#xD;
        of the participating US sites should closely mirror the racial and ethnic distribution of&#xD;
        the US population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        DMD is an X-linked recessive disease affecting only males. However, female carriers of the&#xD;
        disease can be symptomatic due to skewed X-inactivation, a secondary genetic event. We have&#xD;
        opted to study the most commonly affected population, males, to ensure subject homogeneity.&#xD;
        As such, there are no outreach programs planned for women in this study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        DMD Subject Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Affected subjects must be male and between the ages of 2 and 30&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Affected subjects between the ages of 2 and 4 must have a diagnosis of DMD confirmed&#xD;
             by at least one the following OR have an older male sibling that meet at least one of&#xD;
             the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Dystrophin immunofluorescence and/or immunoblot showing complete dystrophin&#xD;
                  deficiency, and clinical picture consistent with typical Duchenne dystrophy OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gene deletion test positive (missing one or more exons) in the central rod domain&#xD;
                  exons 25-60) of dystrophin, where reading frame can be predicted as&#xD;
                  'out-of-frame',and clinical picture consistent with typical Duchenne dystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Complete dystrophin gene sequencing showing an alteration (point mutation,&#xD;
                  duplication, other) that is expected to preclude production of the dystrophin&#xD;
                  protein(i.e. nonsense mutation, deletion/duplication leading to a downstream stop&#xD;
                  codon),with a typical clinical picture of DMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Affected subjects between the ages of 5 and 30 must either fulfill the above criteria&#xD;
             OR show evidence of a dystrophinopathy and clinical picture consistent with Duchenne&#xD;
             Muscular Dystrophy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants who have documented clinical symptoms referable to a&#xD;
                  dystrophinopathy and direct support of the diagnosis by either (1) a positive DNA&#xD;
                  analysis for dystrophin mutation, (2) a muscle biopsy demonstrating abnormal&#xD;
                  dystrophin, or (3) an elevated CK (&gt;5X normal), and X-linked pedigree and an&#xD;
                  affected family member who meets either criterion (1) or (2) as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Determination of the appropriate clinical symptoms consistent with DMD will generally&#xD;
        be the responsibility of the clinician. At a minimum this will include progressive loss of&#xD;
        function, with additional consideration for other clinical features such as a&#xD;
        characteristic gait, a positive Gower sign and calf pseudohypertrophy. When immunostaining&#xD;
        of muscle biopsy is used to determining case definition, the clinical reviewer (site PI)&#xD;
        should confirm that appropriate testing has ruled out a secondary deficiency of dystrophin.&#xD;
        Affected subjects that do not exhibit the above symptoms consistent with DMD should be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        o Muscle weakness prevalent by 5 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Non-affected adult subjects must be Parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of an eligible&#xD;
        affected subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        DMD Serum Biomarker Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet eligibility criteria for the DMD phenotyping portion of this&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the GC-treatment response cohort, participants must initiate GC treatment within&#xD;
             the first year of study participation (i.e. between their first study visit and their&#xD;
             one year follow-up visit)&#xD;
