  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of Abraxane and Carboplatin&#xD;
      together will improve the chances of controlling recurrent ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      Current best practice recommends Carboplatin combined with Taxol in the treatment of Ovarian&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taxol is paclitaxel in the solvent Cremophor-El and the solvent has been associated with&#xD;
      significant side effects e.g. anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity. this requires the routine use&#xD;
      of premedication with antihistamines and steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abraxane by contrast is Cremophor-El free and is protein bound. This has 2 advantages over&#xD;
      Taxol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No need for routine premedications&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increased drug entry into cells facilitating greater potential for anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule: Carboplatin day1 every 28days. Abraxane day1,8,15 every 28days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent epithelial ovarian or primary&#xD;
             peritoneal carcinoma. Patient will have been staged at diagnosis according to FIGO&#xD;
             Classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Measurable Disease by RECIST Criteria (defined by the presence of at least 1&#xD;
             measurable lesion (see Section 7.7.1 for definition of measurable lesions) or elevated&#xD;
             CA-125 in the absence of measurable disease. A pre-treatment sample of CA-125 will be&#xD;
             collected within 2 weeks before treatment is started. A pre-treatment sample of CA-125&#xD;
             should be at least twice the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have disease recurrence 6 months or more after completion of front-line&#xD;
             platinum and paclitaxel-containing regimen. Duration of response from prior therapy&#xD;
             and prior consolidation therapy will be documented in case report forms for&#xD;
             descriptive analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have received at least 3 cycles of a front-line taxane and&#xD;
             platinum-containing regimen prior to entry on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have a documented complete clinical response on front-line therapy.&#xD;

          6. Patients must be disease-free from prior malignancies for more than 5 years with the&#xD;
             exception of curatively-treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.&#xD;
