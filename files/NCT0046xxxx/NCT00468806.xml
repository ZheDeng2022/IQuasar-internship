&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new chemical entity&#xD;
             within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of any&#xD;
             drug(whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A screening ECG outside of ranges specified in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulse rate &lt;55 or &gt;100 bpm OR a systolic blood pressure &gt;140 and &lt;100 OR a diastolic&#xD;
