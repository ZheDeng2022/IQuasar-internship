      This study analyzes the safety and efficacy of off-label Subconjunctival Injection of&#xD;
      bevacizumab (Avastin) versus 0.02% mitomycin C (MMC) for preventing bleb failure following&#xD;
      glaucoma filtration surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glaucoma Filtration Surgery (GFS) remains the definitive surgical management for elevated IOL&#xD;
      uncontrolled by medical management. Bleb failure is a major factor limiting the longterm&#xD;
      success of trabeculectomy surgery. Bleb failure involves vascularization with fibroblast&#xD;
      migration and eventual scarring of the fistula tract. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) is a unique mitogen specific to vascular endothelial cells and the signal cascade&#xD;
      leading to fibroblast migration and proliferation involves dynamic interaction between many&#xD;
      proteins. Blocking the neovascular signal cascade with anti-VEGF molecules like Bevacizumab&#xD;
      may lead to a decrease in fibroblast proliferation by decreasing the supply of mitogenic&#xD;
      cytokines such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) carried in by new vessel formation and&#xD;
      decreasing the known synergism that exists between VEGF and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)&#xD;
      The study is designed as an off-label, randomized, parallel, comparative study. Patients who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and sign the informed consent will be included. After&#xD;
      enrollment, patients will be randomized into two groups: trabeculectomy with off-label&#xD;
      subconjunctival bevacizumab or trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C.This study aims to compare the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of off-label subconjunctival bevacizumab and subtenon Mitomycin C in&#xD;
      glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS). The primary endpoint is to prove the effectiveness via the&#xD;
      reduction of IOP and grading of bleb photographs according to the Moorfields Bleb Grading&#xD;
      Protocol, and the secondary endpoint is to prove the safety via the incidence of&#xD;
      complications and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Surgical technique Trabeculectomy will be performed after the administration of&#xD;
      retrobulbar or peribulbar anesthesia with lidocaine. For the limbus-based procedure, a bridle&#xD;
      suture (4-0 silk) will be placed under the superior rectus muscle tendon, and the conjunctiva&#xD;
      and Tenon's capsule will be incised in the superior quadrant 8 to 10 mm posterior to the&#xD;
      surgical limbus. The conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule will be dissected anterior to the&#xD;
      limbus. Meticulous hemostasis will be achieved with bipolar cautery. In cases randomized to&#xD;
      MMC usage, a cellulose sponge (approximately 6 × 12 mm × 1 mm) soaked with mitomycin C (0.2&#xD;
      mg/ml) will be applied over the intended site of the scleral flap for 1 to 3 minutes. The&#xD;
      duration of mitomycin C application will be based on the preoperative evaluation of each&#xD;
      patient's risk factors for failure. Copious irrigation with balanced salt solution will be&#xD;
      performed to wash away residual MMC. A ½ to 2/3 thickness square scleral flap (approximately&#xD;
      3.5 × 3.5 mm) will be then dissected into the clear cornea. After resection of an anterior&#xD;
      trabecular block (approximately 2.5 × 1 mm), an iridectomy will be performed. The scleral&#xD;
      flap will be sutured with two or three 10-0 nylon sutures at its corners. The conjunctiva and&#xD;
      Tenon's capsule will be closed in a single continuous layer with 8-0 Vicryl suture. In the&#xD;
      subjects randomized to receive Injection Bevacizumab, 0.05 ml of reconstituted bevacizumab&#xD;
      drug (1.25 mg) will be injected subconjunctivally adjacent to the bleb. Atropine eye ointment&#xD;
      will be placed in the fornix and the eye will be patched. In the early postoperative period,&#xD;
      all patients will be treated with topical corticosteroids (four times daily) for two weeks,&#xD;
      which will be tapered-off slowly over six to eight weeks. Suture-lysis with argon laser will&#xD;
      be performed under topical anesthesia when, in the opinion of the surgeon, filtration is&#xD;
      judged to be too low and the IOP too high for the patient to meet the target pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab Avastin (Avastin) is available in a sterile vial (100 mg in 4 ml) preservative&#xD;
      free and in order to ensure safety the vial injection will be administered within one day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subconjunctival Injections (1.25mg drug in 0.05ml) will be given at the end of the surgery&#xD;
      adjacent to the bleb raised using a single-use 30-gauge needle and a tuberculin syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up: The following demographic and clinical data will be extracted from the medical&#xD;
      records of eligible patients: race, age of the patient at the time of surgery, gender, eye&#xD;
      laterality, preoperative visual acuity, refractive error, average of IOP readings during&#xD;
      three months before surgery, number of medications recorded during the three months preceding&#xD;
      trabeculectomy, concurrent ocular diseases before or at the time of surgery, history of&#xD;
      intraocular or extraocular surgery that involved the conjunctiva, previous laser surgery for&#xD;
      glaucoma (argon laser trabeculoplasty, iridoplasty, or peripheral iridotomy), visual field&#xD;
      mean deviation of the last field before surgery, date of surgery, type of conjunctival flap,&#xD;
      concentration and duration of mitomycin C application, site and dose of subconjunctival&#xD;
      Bevacizumab injection and intraoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative IOP, number of medications, visual acuity, complications, postoperative suture&#xD;
      lysis, and surgery performed after trabeculectomy will be recorded. At each visit, the&#xD;
      examination will include measurement of Snellen best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), IOP&#xD;
      using a calibrated applanation tonometer, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, Seidel testing, and&#xD;
      ophthalmoscopy. Humphrey perimetry (24-2 or 10-2) will be done prior to surgery, at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months post intervention to assess for objective disease progression. There will be 7&#xD;
      post-operative and follow-up visits within 6 months of surgery: postoperative days 1, 7, 14,&#xD;
      30, 60, 90 and 180. A window of ± 7 days is allowed for the 30, 60, 90 day visits and ± 14&#xD;
      days for the 180 day visits. On each visit Bleb photographs would be recorded and graded&#xD;
      according to the Moorfields Bleb Grading Protocol by a single observer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete success will be defined as an IOP &lt; 18mmHg without anti- glaucoma medications at 6&#xD;
      months follow up after surgery or at least a 20% reduction from baseline IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified Success will be defined as an IOP of &lt;18mmHg with one anti-glaucoma medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure will be defined as IOP &gt;21 mmHg or not reduced by 20% below baseline on two&#xD;
      consecutive follow-up visits after three months despite medication, IOP ≤5 mmHg on two&#xD;
      consecutive follow-up visits after three months, additional glaucoma surgery, or loss of&#xD;
      light perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eyes that will be Seidel positive within the first month of follow-up will be classified as&#xD;
      wound leaks, and those occurring after one month will be categorized as bleb leaks. Cataracts&#xD;
      will be considered to have progressed if there is loss of ≥2 lines of Snellen BCVA that is&#xD;
      attributed to the cataract at the six-month follow-up visit or after, or if cataract surgery&#xD;
      is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Univariate comparisons between treatment groups will be made by the&#xD;
      two-sided Student t test, χ2 test, or Fisher exact test. The association of surgical&#xD;
      complications with treatment outcome, vision loss, and cataract progression will be assessed&#xD;
      for statistical significance with the χ2 test or Fisher exact test. A p value of .05 or less&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
