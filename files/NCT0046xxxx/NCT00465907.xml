  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cancer death in many countries of the world including Singapore.&#xD;
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consists of 80-85% of lung cancers, and is a major health&#xD;
      problem. The main etiology of lung cancer is well recognized and established to be cigarette&#xD;
      smoking which accounts for up to 80% of the cases in the western countries. Due to success of&#xD;
      anti-smoking campaign, we anticipate to see less smoking related lung cancer and more&#xD;
      non-smoking related lung cancer which is rising rapidly. For eg, currently in Singapore,&#xD;
      smoking only accounts for 50-60% of all lung cancers, this is particularly true in female&#xD;
      patients, as smoking occured in 30-40% of female lung cancer patients only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear if there is any significant difference in the fundamental biology between&#xD;
      smoking and non-smoking related lung cancers, particularly in areas of natural course of&#xD;
      disease, genetic changes of tumor cells, clinical presentation, response to treatment or&#xD;
      survival. These are potential aspects for further investigation.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignant pleural effusion proven by cytological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have stage IIIB or IV disease with malignant pleural effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We plan to recruit 16 patients who have smoked cigarettes of at least 20 pack per&#xD;
             year, 16 patients who do not smoke but have been exposed to second hand smoking by&#xD;
             living with a person who has smoked 20 pack per year cigarette in the same household&#xD;
             and 16 patients who are non-smokers (never smoked) and no second hand smoking exposure&#xD;
             in the same household. The accrual will be stopped once the number of patients is&#xD;
             reached in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG PS 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease (in addition to malignant pleural effusion).&#xD;
