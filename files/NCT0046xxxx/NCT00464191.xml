      Funding: An investigator-initiated trial funded by H. Lundbeck AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel-group multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To investigate efficacy and side effects (especially mood switches) of escitalopram,a&#xD;
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Escitalopram, given in addition to mood stabilising medications, is significantly more&#xD;
           efficacious, measured by response and remission rates than placebo in bipolar depression&#xD;
           (the acute phase study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Continuation therapy with escitalopram gives significantly longer mean time to&#xD;
           depressive relapse and fewer depressive relapses compared to placebo (the continuation&#xD;
           study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The incidence of &quot;mood switching&quot; (defined as development of mixed episodes, mania, or&#xD;
           hypomania according to DSM-IV criteria) do not differ significantly between escitalopram&#xD;
           and placebo in either the acute or the continuation phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: In- and outpatients receiving care in the specialised psychiatric services of&#xD;
      Western Norway. The population is intended to be representative of the patients treated for&#xD;
      bipolar depression in ordinary specialist care. Patients must have a MADRS score of at least&#xD;
      20 at baseline. Patients with ongoing substance abuse or dependence, organic mental illness,&#xD;
      and non-affective psychotic symptoms are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication: Escitalopram 10-20 mg daily or placebo in addition to mood stabilisers. The dose&#xD;
      of mood stabilisers must have been constant for the last six weeks prior to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Phase 1 is a eight-week acute treatment trial with six clinical assessments. Patients&#xD;
      treated with escitalopram who have not responded after eight weeks (defined by at least 50%&#xD;
      reduction of MADRS score compared to baseline) leave the study. Placebo non-responders are&#xD;
      treated openly with escitalopram and repeat phase 1. Responders are re-randomised to 32 weeks&#xD;
      of maintenance treatment (phase 2). Phase 2 has nine clinical assessments. Patients who&#xD;
      develop hypomania, mania or depressive episodes (defined as episodes meeting DSM-IV criteria&#xD;
      for Major Depressive Episode with MADRS scores of at least 20 points) leave the study in this&#xD;
      phase. Patients leaving the study prematurely will be offered alternative treatment.&#xD;

      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two main aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the efficacy and the risk of &quot;mood switching&quot; of escitalopram and placebo in&#xD;
           the acute phase treatment of bipolar depression in patients already taking mood&#xD;
           stabilising medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the efficacy of escitalopram and placebo in continuation phase therapy for&#xD;
           bipolar depression using a placebo-controlled discontinuation design. The study will&#xD;
           compare the occurrence of syndromal and subsyndromal relapses, mixed states, mania,&#xD;
           hypomania, and &quot;rapid cycling&quot; in a seven months' maintenance study following response&#xD;
           to acute phase treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Escitalopram, given in addition to mood stabilising medications, is significantly more&#xD;
           efficacious, measured by response and remission rates than placebo in bipolar depression&#xD;
           (the acute phase study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Continuation therapy with escitalopram gives significantly longer mean time to&#xD;
           depressive relapse and fewer depressive relapses compared to placebo (the continuation&#xD;
           study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The incidence of &quot;mood switching&quot; (defined as development of mixed episodes, mania, or&#xD;
           hypomania according to DSM-IV criteria do not differ significantly between escitalopram&#xD;
           and placebo in either the acute or the continuation phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This is a multi-center RCT with parallel-group design. The study compares the efficacy&#xD;
      of placebo and escitalopram, given as add-on to mood stabilising medications in patients with&#xD;
      bipolar depression without non-affective psychotic symptoms according to DSM-IV, and with a&#xD;
      baseline MADRS score of ≥ 20 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two phases. The acute phase study lasts for eight weeks and compares the&#xD;
      efficacy of escitalopram and placebo on depressive symptoms in bipolar depression. Response&#xD;
      is defined as at least 50% improvement on the MADRS compared to the baseline score.&#xD;
      Responders to escitalopram are re-randomised to escitalopram or placebo for the continuation&#xD;
      phase while placebo responders continue taking placebo for the continuation phase. Patients&#xD;
      on escitalopram who do not respond in the acute phase leave the study, whereas placebo&#xD;
      non-responders are treated openly with escitalopram and repeat phase 1. Responders to this&#xD;
      open-label treatment are then re-randomised double blind to escitalopram or placebo for the&#xD;
      continuation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuation phase study lasts for 32 weeks. Patients who responded to placebo in the&#xD;
      acute phase continue placebo and their usual mood stabilising medication for the remainder of&#xD;
      the study. Those who responded to escitalopram are re-randomised to continue taking placebo&#xD;
      or escitalopram in unchanged doses. Patients who develop new mood episodes (DSM-IV-defined&#xD;
      major depressive episode, mania, hypomania, or mixed episodes) or MADRS score ≥ 20 points&#xD;
      leave the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Screening includes sociodemographic variables, medical and psychiatric history,&#xD;
      diagnosis made on the basis of clinical interview and verified by the MINI, symptom intensity&#xD;
      measured by the MADRS,), results of medical examination and laboratory tests (ECG, height,&#xD;
      weight, blood pressure and blood tests). Sociodemographic variables include age, gender,&#xD;
      previous and concomitant disorders, course and treatment of mental disorders, bipolar&#xD;
      disorder type (I or II), age of onset and history of psychotropic medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure As soon as the blood samples are analysed, eligible patients can be&#xD;
      randomised. They are rated on the MADRS, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), Inventory of&#xD;
      Depressive Symptoms - Self Report (IDS-SR), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12 (SF-12),&#xD;
      Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Sheehan Disability Inventory (SDI) at the baseline&#xD;
      visit. Study medication is dispensed. The patients will return to further visits as shown&#xD;
      below. Patients will receive study medication for a maximum of 40 weeks. Adverse events and&#xD;
      concomitant medications are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be carried out::&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MADRS, GAF, IDS-RS, and CGI-I at week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 34 and&#xD;
           40&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SDI and QLDS at week 8 and 40&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnostic criteria for Mania and Hypomania at week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 20,&#xD;
           24, 28, 34 and 40&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Episode at week 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28,&#xD;
           34 and 40&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the acute study, response and remission rates as assessed by the MADRS are the primary&#xD;
      outcome measures. CGI-Improvement and IDS-SR are secondary outcome measures. In the&#xD;
      continuation study, primary outcome measures include emergence of major depressive episodes&#xD;
      and mania/hypomania, while time spent at different depressive symptom levels as assessed by&#xD;
      the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria are secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Response: at least a 50% reduction of the baseline MADRS score at the end of&#xD;
      phase 1 if the patient has completed at least four weeks of the study. CGI-I 1 or 2 at the&#xD;
      end of phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remission: MADRS score of 12 or less at the end of the acute phase if the patient has&#xD;
      completed at least four weeks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New episode: A patient who has previously responded to treatment meets the DSM-IV criteria&#xD;
      for Major Depressive Episode. The patient must score at least 15 points on the MADRS and have&#xD;
      a CGI-S score of 3 or more during this episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mania and hypomania: by DSM-IV criteria.&#xD;
