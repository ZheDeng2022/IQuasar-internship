      Cystoid macular edema (CME) is the most common cause of suboptimal post-operative visual&#xD;
      acuity in uncomplicated cataract extractions. Over two million cataract extractions are&#xD;
      performed each year, with a reported incidence ranging from 1.5 to 6.9%, resulting in an&#xD;
      estimated 20,000-130,000 new cases of CME annually. Clinical CME historically was associated&#xD;
      with visual acuity of 20/40 or worse with fluorescein angiographic evidence of macular edema&#xD;
      in a classic petaloid pattern. Angiographic CME physiologically signals an inflammatory&#xD;
      process causing distortion of the outer plexiform layer, which if not resolved quickly could&#xD;
      result in non-repairable visual loss. Topical, periocular, or intravitreal corticosteroids,&#xD;
      despite their associated side effects, are the mainstay for pharmacologic treatment for&#xD;
      patients with CME. Their efficacy has never been demonstrated in a randomized, controlled and&#xD;
      blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, Phase II study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab in subjects&#xD;
      with cystoid macular edema secondary to non-ischemic retinopathy, as seen following cataract&#xD;
      surgery with intraocular lens implantation.&#xD;

      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to be induced by hypoxia and has been&#xD;
      implicated in the development of iris and retinal vascularization. VEGF, however, is also&#xD;
      known to be a potent mediator of vascular permeability in other tissues and may perform this&#xD;
      function in retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemical VEGF staining has been identified in patients with disorders such as&#xD;
      aphakic and pseudophakic cystoid macular edema, ocular inflammatory disease and infection.&#xD;
      VEGF was primarily localized within retinal neurons and within the retinal pigment epithelium&#xD;
      in these cases. In addition or in association with its role of inducing neovascularization&#xD;
      (Wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, VEGF may contribute to the breakdown of the blood-retinal&#xD;
      barrier in a variety of disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ranibizumab is a pan-VEGF A blocker that has been proven highly effective for the treatment&#xD;
      of wet macular degeneration. The underlying pathophysiology of both cystoid macular edema and&#xD;
      wet AMD is VEGF overproduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date ranibizumab has been approved only for treating wet ARMD. In this study we will&#xD;
      explore ranibizumab for the treatment of cystoid macular edema It is hypothesized that this&#xD;
      population will show dramatic improvement as the initial cause of VEGF production can be&#xD;
      isolated to the surgical procedure and due to the fact that the retinal pigment epithelium is&#xD;
      healthier in this population as compared to the macular degeneration counterparts.&#xD;
