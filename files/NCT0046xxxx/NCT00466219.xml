      The aim of the study is to assess whether patients with recurrent hepatitis C after liver&#xD;
      transplantation will benefit from a treatment with ribavirin/PEG-IFN-alpha combined treatment&#xD;
      for 48 weeks.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to assess whether patients fulfilling the criteria as defined in&#xD;
      section 3 will benefit from a treatment with ribavirin/PEG-a-IFN combined treatment. This&#xD;
      study will be open to all patients with histologically documented hepatitis C recurring after&#xD;
      LT, provided that all inclusion and exclusion criteria, as defined below, are met, and&#xD;
      irrespectively of the pattern of response to a previous antiviral treatment (if any).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit will be assessed in terms of biochemical (normalization of serum transaminases&#xD;
      levels), virological (disappearance of HCV RNA from serum) and histological (amelioration of&#xD;
      the histological signs of hepatitis) response. The presence of a sustained virological&#xD;
      response, as defined below in section 6, will also be studied in relation to the early&#xD;
      kinetics of serum HCV RNA, in keeping with recent data obtained in chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      patients, which suggest that an early rapid decrease of HCV viremia is associated with a&#xD;
      durable response.&#xD;
