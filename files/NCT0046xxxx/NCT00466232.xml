      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib&#xD;
      up to the full active dose when combined with standard weekly dosing of topotecan in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent small cell lung cancer and to characterize the toxicities associated with the&#xD;
      combination of topotecan and sorafenib in this patient population&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises approximately 15 percent of all lung cancers in the&#xD;
      United States. It is highly correlated with tobacco use and occurs almost exclusively in&#xD;
      smokers. SCLC is a particularly virulent malignancy characterized by rapid growth and a&#xD;
      tendency to metastasize early in the disease course. In first line treatment, SCLC has a high&#xD;
      response rate to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the disease develops drug resistance&#xD;
      in almost all cases resulting in recurrence. In second line treatment, the likelihood of&#xD;
      response to treatment is considerably less. Multiple agents have been used in this setting&#xD;
      with response rates typically around 25% and median survival of less than 6 months1-3. There&#xD;
      is clearly a great need for more effective treatments in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan is a semi-synthetic, water soluble derivative of camptothecin, a cytotoxic alkaloid&#xD;
      extracted from plants of the genus Camptotheca. Its mechanism of action is inhibition of&#xD;
      topoisomerase I, an enzyme necessary to relieve torsional strain of DNA which is necessary to&#xD;
      carry out replication. This results in DNA double-strand breaks and ultimately cell death.&#xD;
      Topotecan has demonstrated activity in a number of malignancies and is currently indicated&#xD;
      for the treatment of ovarian cancer, cervical cancer and recurrent small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan has demonstrated single agent activity in recurrent small cell lung cancer in a&#xD;
      number of trials. Reported response rates range from 2 to 31%3-7. A phase III trial compared&#xD;
      topotecan to CAV (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine) in treatment of recurrent&#xD;
      SCLC5. Response rate, survival and time to progression were similar in both groups. The&#xD;
      topotecan group demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms including anorexia, fatigue&#xD;
      and dyspnea. This led to FDA approval of topotecan for treatment of recurrent SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose limiting toxicity of topotecan is hematologic. The approved schedule of&#xD;
      administration is 1.5mg/m2 daily x 5 every 21 days. A modified schedule of weekly&#xD;
      administration at 4mg/m2 has been shown to have similar efficacy with less toxicity8 and has&#xD;
      been widely adopted in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation and tumor&#xD;
      angiogenesis. It has several biochemically important mechanisms including inhibition of Raf-1&#xD;
      and B-Raf which are pivotal components of the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk signaling pathway. It also has&#xD;
      inhibitory activity against the tyrosine kinases for VEGF and PDGFR as well as Flt-3 and&#xD;
      c-kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib has been safely combined with full dose cytotoxic chemotherapy in several Phase I&#xD;
      trials9-11. There is no data on the combination of topotecan and sorafenib to date. Sorafenib&#xD;
      is metabolized in the liver undergoing oxidation via CYP3A4 and glucuronidation via UGT1A9.&#xD;
      There is no evidence that topotecan affects activity of the cytochrome P450 pathways&#xD;
      suggesting low likelihood of a drug-drug interaction. There are no significant overlapping&#xD;
      toxicities making this an ideal drug combination to investigate.&#xD;
