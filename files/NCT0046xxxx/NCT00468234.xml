      The proposed study will evaluate biomarkers measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) for&#xD;
      the purpose of assessing clinical strategies of harm reduction. It will take advantage of a&#xD;
      recently developed device that permits collection of exhaled breath condensate reproducibly,&#xD;
      with minimal subject effort and with no oral contamination. The major goal of the trial is to&#xD;
      provide evidence to validate biomarkers in EBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be accomplished by collecting samples from asymptomatic smokers before and after&#xD;
      inducing a change in their smoking habit (cessation or reduction) with the aid of partial&#xD;
      nicotine replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures to be made in EBC include H2O2, the most widely explored biomarker in this &quot;body&quot;&#xD;
      fluid. Methods that reliably can quantify levels in normal non-smokers and in asymptomatic&#xD;
      smokers will be used. Two fold increases in smokers have been reported by in several reports&#xD;
      and confirmed in preliminary data by the investigators. In addition, other biomarkers of&#xD;
      oxidant stress: TBARs, 8-isoprostane and nitrotyrosine will be quantified using standard&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers quantified in EBC will be assessed for reliability (i.e. reproducibility and for&#xD;
      sensitivity) to change and for validity (by comparison to clinically defined endpoints and&#xD;
      previously validated measures of exposure). Reproducibility will be assessed by making&#xD;
      repeated measurements in the same subjects on different occasions. Sensitivity to change will&#xD;
      be assessed by comparing values before and after changing smoking habit. Finally, the&#xD;
      validity of the biomarkers will be assessed by comparing them to previous measures of smoke&#xD;
      exposure (CO, NNAL and NNAL-glc) and to clinically defined endpoints: symptoms, the St.&#xD;
      George's Respiratory Questionnaire and post bronchodilator lung function. With regard to the&#xD;
      latter measures, preliminary data indicate that symptoms can be detected in &quot;asymptomatic&quot;&#xD;
      smokers and that these can change with a harm reduction strategy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be 19 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a stable smoking habit greater than three months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have smoked for at least 5 pack years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing to make a serious quit attempt and be willing to use nicotine replacement&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  regular use of anti-inflammatory medication; presence of any inflammatory *disease of&#xD;
             the respiratory tract including moderate or worse COPD (FEV1 &lt; 80% predicted and&#xD;
             FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.7) or PFT criteria for asthma (improvement in FEV1&gt;12% of predicted&#xD;
             and &gt;200ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with normal lung function who meet criteria for diagnosis of chronic&#xD;
             bronchitis will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with stable medical conditions, excluding inflammatory lung disease, will be&#xD;
             permitted to participate, providing anti-inflammatory therapies are not used regularly&#xD;
             and providing there has been no change in their clinical status in the two months&#xD;
             prior to beginning the study.&#xD;
