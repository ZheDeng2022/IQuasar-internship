  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: (1) Aripiprazole treatment will be superior to placebo in reducing aggression and&#xD;
      irritability in autistic individuals as shown by reductions in the Aberrant Behavior&#xD;
      Checklist-irritability subscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) Aripiprazole treatment will be superior to placebo in the acute treatment of global&#xD;
      autism severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the possible benefit of the medication Aripiprazole&#xD;
      in autistic individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic medication which is currently approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Multiple clinical trials in both children and adults&#xD;
      have shown the effectiveness in the treatment of autism with medications like Aripiprazole.&#xD;
      This study aims at assessing the effect of aripiprazole vs. placebo treatment on symptoms of&#xD;
      irritability and aggression associated with autism, as well as the effect on the global&#xD;
      severity of child and adolescent autistic disorder. Children or adolescent outpatients, with&#xD;
      age ranges from 5-17, will be enrolled into an 8-week placebo controlled, double blind&#xD;
      treatment study. During the 8 weeks, patients will be monitored by the treating psychiatrist.&#xD;
      Study assessments will be administered at designated time points.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-AD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered weekly</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI)-AD (Guy, 1976). This is a standard rating scale with 7-point global severity and change scales which has been modified for Autistic Disorder. A rating of 2 is given when there is a substantial reduction in symptoms so that a treating clinician would be unlikely to change treatment. A rating of 1 is reserved for patients who become virtually symptom-free. A rating of 3 (minimally improved) on the CGI is defined as slight symptomatic improvement that is not deemed clinically significant. Administration time is approximately 2 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Aberrant Behavior Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered biweekly</time_frame>
    <description>Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) (irritability section) (Aman et al, 1985). The Aberrant Behavior Checklist assesses drug and other treatment effects on mentally retarded individuals. It consists of a five-factor scale comprising 58 items. We will use the Stereotypic Behavior section to assess compulsive/repetitive behavior. While the internal consistency, validity and test-retest reliability were reported to be very good, inter-rater reliability was moderate (Aman et al, 1985). The ABC will be filled out by an informant, and then reviewed by the psychiatrist. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.</description>

    <description>Subjects under 40 kg will be started on 2.5mg per day of aripiprazole for the first week and increased to 5 mg at week 2. If clinically indicated (partial improvement with minimal or no side effects), the dosage will be increased each week by 2.5 mg until they reach a maximum of 10 mg at week 4. Medication will not be increased after week four but may be lowered in the case of adverse effects. Subjects over 40 kg will start at 5 mg and be increased to 10 mg at week 2. If clinically indicated, they will be increased each week by 5 mg until they reach a maximum of 20 mg at week 4. After week 4, the subject will remain on the same stable dose, unless the dose needs to be decreased due to adverse effects</description>
