  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells&#xD;
      are destroyed, resulting in poor blood sugar control. The purpose of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the benefit of islet transplantation in type 1 diabetic (T1D) kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is commonly treated with the administration of insulin, either by multiple&#xD;
      insulin injections or by a continuous supply of insulin through a wearable pump. Insulin&#xD;
      therapy allows long-term survival in individuals with type 1 diabetes; however, it does not&#xD;
      guarantee constant normal blood sugar control. Because of this, long-term type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      survivors often develop vascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease&#xD;
      that can cause poor vision and blindness, and diabetic nephropathy, a kidney disease that can&#xD;
      lead to kidney failure and thus kidney transplant. Some individuals with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      develop hypoglycemia unawareness, a life-threatening condition that is not easily treatable&#xD;
      with medication and is characterized by reduced or absent warning signals for hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      For such individuals, pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation are possible treatment&#xD;
      options. The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of islet transplantation in type&#xD;
      1 diabetic kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be type I diabetics who have received a kidney transplant for&#xD;
      ESRD.. If subjects have not received ITT in the 12 months prior to enrollment, they must&#xD;
      undergo a period of standardized diabetes care by an experienced diabetologist at the&#xD;
      transplant center using the current ADA's standards of medical care in diabetes. Throughout&#xD;
      the study, all participants will remain on the immunosuppressive therapy intended for their&#xD;
      kidney. Participants will receive up to three separate islet transplants and a regimen of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications consisting of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and etanercept. They&#xD;
      will begin receiving ATG 2 days prior to transplant and will continue to receive ATG until&#xD;
      Day 2 post-transplant. Etanercept will be given on the day of transplant and on Days 3, 7,&#xD;
      and 10 post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplantations will involve an inpatient hospital stay and infusion of islets into a branch&#xD;
      of the portal vein. Participants who do not achieve or maintain insulin independence by Day&#xD;
      30 post-transplant will be considered for a second islet transplant. Participants who remain&#xD;
      dependent on insulin for longer than 30 days after the second transplant and who show partial&#xD;
      graft function will be considered for a third islet transplant. Daclizumab will be used in&#xD;
      place of ATG for the second and third transplants, if they are necessary. Participants who do&#xD;
      not meet the criteria for a subsequent transplant will enter a reduced follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be approximately 15 study visits. A physical exam, review of adverse events, and&#xD;
      blood collection will occur at most visits. A chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, quality of life questionnaires, and urine collection will occur at some&#xD;
      visits. Participants will also test their own blood glucose levels throughout the study. A&#xD;
      36-month follow-up period will take place after the participant's last transplant, consisting&#xD;
      of 8 additional visits.&#xD;
