      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Daptomycin given for treatment of&#xD;
      catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) due to gram positive bacteremia in the&#xD;
      context of standard of care antimicrobial therapy consisting mainly of Vancomycin with or&#xD;
      without initial treatment with beta lactam antibiotics.&#xD;

      THE STUDY DRUG:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daptomycin is an antibiotic designed to treat a variety of bacterial infections that are&#xD;
      difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be given daptomycin by&#xD;
      vein over 30 minutes every 24 hours for at least 7-14 days, depending on the type of bacteria&#xD;
      that you have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central venous catheter (CVC) will either be removed, or it will be exchanged over a&#xD;
      guide wire. The decision to remove or exchange the CVC and timing of the placement of the CVC&#xD;
      will be decided by your primary physician and the willingness of you to remove or exchange&#xD;
      your infected CVC. This will be done within 96 hours after your first positive blood culture&#xD;
      (first blood drawn that showed bacteria). A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be&#xD;
      placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this&#xD;
      procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for&#xD;
      this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study doctor and/or your primary doctor suspects that you have a mixed infection (2 or&#xD;
      more certain types of bacteria) or pneumonia, you will also be treated with different types&#xD;
      of antibiotics, by vein or mouth, in combination with the study drug. These antibiotics may&#xD;
      include aztreonam, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, bactrim,&#xD;
      and/or amoxicillin/clavulanate (a combination antibiotic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are discharged from the hospital before completing the study medication, arrangements&#xD;
      will be made to provide infusions on an outpatient basis (by a nurse, yourself, or a family&#xD;
      member). You and/or a family member will be taught (by a nurse) how to take the study&#xD;
      medication at home. Before you are discharged from the hospital, you will receive the kits&#xD;
      that include enough supplies for you and/or a family member to give daptomycin by vein. If&#xD;
      medication will be given at home, a prescription will be given to you to pick up your&#xD;
      medication from the pharmacy before you discharge from the hospital. If possible, your&#xD;
      primary doctor may arrange for you to receive medication at the M. D. Anderson outpatient&#xD;
      treatment center, or a nurse will be scheduled to visit you at home to give you the&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TESTS/PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each week of treatment, you will have the following exams/procedures performed once a&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) for routine tests. It may be drawn from&#xD;
           the CVC, if the CVC is still in place. The CVC exit site will be examined at each visit&#xD;
           until you have no more signs or symptoms of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) for a blood culture every other day&#xD;
           until it no longer shows signs of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any symptoms or illnesses that you may have experienced since&#xD;
           your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LENGTH OF STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation on this study will last for no more than 60 days (about 2 months).&#xD;
