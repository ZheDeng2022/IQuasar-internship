  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to count the number of white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood&#xD;
      at the beginning and end of treatment with firategrast and at 4 and 12 weeks after stopping&#xD;
      firategrast. Cerebrospinal fluid flows through and protects the brain and spinal cord. It is&#xD;
      important to understand what happens to the number of white blood cells because they are&#xD;
      important in preventing infections.&#xD;

    <description>The number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The cumulative number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions at 24 weeks of treatment was derived as the sum of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions counted at all visits from Week 4 up to Week 24. In the event that a participant had missing MRI data for a gadolinium enhanced lesion parameter during the on-treatment period (scans at Weeks 4-24 inclusive), the missing value was imputed using the mean value for that parameter for all non-missing scans during the treatment period.</description>

    <description>Participants were assessed for the presence of A allele of rs887829 which is associated with Gilbert's syndrome. Gilbert's syndrome is benign and characterized by transient increases in bilirubin levels (&gt;1.5XUpper limit of normal [ULN]). Participants who were carrying two copies of A allele of rs887829, suggested that elevations in bilirubin (maximum total bilirubin [MTB] &gt;1.5xULN, &gt;1.0 to 1.5xULN and less than or equal to 1.0xULN) were due to benign Gilbert's syndrome. Genotypes AA, AG and GG were analyzed.</description>

             of or a substrate (with a low therapeutic index) for Organic Anion Transporter Protein&#xD;
             (OATP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with clinically significant renal laboratory values: subjects with a&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with local urinalysis findings of 1) proteinuria, defined as ³1+ protein on&#xD;
             urine dipstick or 2) renal tubular cell casts or 3) ³5 red blood cells / high power&#xD;
             field will be excluded from the study if the result is still present on a repeat&#xD;
             urinalysis during the Screening Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinically significant hepatic laboratory values: Alanine Amino&#xD;
             Transferase (ALT), Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST), Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any findings at Screening on the MRI of the brain other than MS, except for benign&#xD;
             findings that (in the opinion of the central MRI reading site and local site&#xD;
             investigator) require no further evaluation or treatment and do not impact patient's&#xD;
             neurological health (e.g. small arachnoid cysts, venous angiomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled or any active bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. Any previous serious&#xD;
             infections should be discussed with the GSK medical monitor (e.g. opportunistic or&#xD;
             atypical infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of tuberculosis (TB) or positive chest X-ray for TB at Screening (prior chest&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Recent history or suspicion of current drug abuse (including analgesic abuse) or&#xD;
             alcohol abuse within the last 6 months prior to Screening. Alcohol abuse is defined as&#xD;
             an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units for men and 14 units for women or an&#xD;
             average daily intake of greater than three units for men and two units for women. One&#xD;
             unit is equivalent to approximately 250mL of beer or one measure of spirits or one&#xD;
             glass of wine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of an investigational drug for a condition other than MS within 30 days or 5&#xD;
             half-lives (whichever is longer) preceding Screening. Prior use of an investigational&#xD;
             drug for MS should be discussed with the GSK medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent illness, disability or clinically significant abnormality (including&#xD;
             laboratory tests) that may affect the interpretation of clinical efficacy or safety&#xD;
             data or prevent the subject from safely completing the assessments required by the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications, in the opinion of the investigator, to lumbar puncture, e.g.&#xD;
             congenital or acquired spine or CNS conditions that may render LPs unsafe, platelet&#xD;
             count of less than 50 GI/L and/or an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 1.5 (by history), known history of clotting/bleeding disorder, needle&#xD;
             phobia.&#xD;
