  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-to three center study. The study&#xD;
      will consist of 2 treatment groups (Betahistine 48 mg/day or matching placebo). Approximately&#xD;
      30 subjects (15 per treatment group) will be randomized into this 6-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single blinded placebo treated period of up to 14 days will be used to determine subjects&#xD;
      suitability for inclusion in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order that a patient will be defined as valid for inclusion in the study, patients should&#xD;
      be able to present consistent LDL-C values, taken prior to randomization (at screening visit&#xD;
      1 and screening visit 2), without deviation of more than 12% of each value from their mean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within one week from the second screening visit, subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      none of the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of the following treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Betahistine 24 mg BID (48 mg/day total), or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matching placebo BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind treatment will continue for 4 weeks. Study medication (betahistine and/or&#xD;
      matching placebo) will be administered BID (before lunch and before dinner).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, subjects will undergo dietary assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy parameter is change in LDL-C from baseline (randomization) to Week 4 and&#xD;
      the percentage of patients that reduce their LDL-C by 10% or more.&#xD;
