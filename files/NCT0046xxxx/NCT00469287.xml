      Rationale: The global prevalence of diabetes, along with its devastating effects on life&#xD;
      expectancy and quality of life, continues to increase. Worldwide, the total number of people&#xD;
      with diabetes is projected to rise from about 171 million in 2000 to 336 million in the year&#xD;
      2030. Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 85 percent to 95 percent of all diagnosed cases of&#xD;
      diabetes and is associated with a number of serious long-term complications, which are a&#xD;
      major cause of morbidity, hospitalization and mortality in diabetic patients. More evidence&#xD;
      is becoming available that both lifestyle and clinical intervention in the pre-diabetic&#xD;
      condition are effective in slowing down progression of pre-diabetes to overt diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over many centuries, several forms of traditional medicine have developed which are often&#xD;
      based on fundamental principles that differ from those of &quot;Western&quot; medicine. One of the most&#xD;
      prominent characteristics of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is a more holistic approach&#xD;
      to the functioning and disfunctioning of living organisms. Every healthy organism is in a Yin&#xD;
      Yang balance and is considered to be a complex interplay between body and mind. Western&#xD;
      medicine relies on detailed classification of diseases, empirical investigations and&#xD;
      treatments targeting those disorders. However, &quot;Western medicine&quot; is showing an increased&#xD;
      interest in traditional forms of medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of the present study is to determine consistency in&#xD;
      classification of DM type 2 in three categories as defined by Traditional Chinese Medicine&#xD;
      (TCM) in pre-diabetic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to find relationships between diagnosis according to TCM and risk&#xD;
      profile according to Western approach (fasting glucose and HbA1c in plasma, age, BMI, waist&#xD;
      circumference). Another objective is to find relationships between classification of risk for&#xD;
      DM type 2 according to TCM and objective parameters.&#xD;

      based on fundamental principles that differ from those of &quot;Western&quot; medicine. One of the most&#xD;
      prominent characteristics of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is a more holistic approach&#xD;

      treatments targeting those disorders. However, &quot;Western medicine&quot; is showing an increased&#xD;
      interest in traditional forms of medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progress in research, especially metabolomics, as the ultimate phenotyping, has been&#xD;
      shown to enable the efficacy study of complex mixtures such as Traditional Chinese Medicine&#xD;
      (TCM) in complex biological systems, bridging it with molecular pharmacology. The present&#xD;
      study is especially designed to explore biomarkers and tools for early diagnosis of diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus type 2 with objective Western markers and TCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of the present study is to determine consistency in&#xD;
      classification of DM type 2 in three categories as defined by Traditional Chinese Medicine&#xD;
      (TCM) in pre-diabetic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to find relationships between diagnosis according to TCM and risk&#xD;
      profile according to Western approach (fasting glucose and HbA1c in plasma, age, BMI, waist&#xD;
      circumference). Another objective is to find relationships between classification of risk for&#xD;
      DM type 2 according to TCM and objective parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This study is designed as an explorative study. Study population: In the study&#xD;
      50 pre-diabetic male volunteers, with a fasting blood glucose ≥ 6.1 and ≤ 6.9 mmol/L, 30-70&#xD;
      years old, and having a BMI ≥ 26 and ≤ 35 kg/m2 will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: No administration of a study substance will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TCM Diagnosis:Identification of DM type 2 based on TCM, diagnosed independently by 3&#xD;
      physicians and classified in Upper Xiao, Middle Xiao and Lower Xiao.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General measurements as BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure and heart rate variability&#xD;
      will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next to these measurements also the following parameters will be established. Biophoton&#xD;
      emission: a recording of the energy field and balance based on analysis of intensity and&#xD;
      quantum stochastic nature of light from both hands (ventral and dorsum), in combination with&#xD;
      both right-left and dorsal-ventral symmetry of both hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance Meridian Measurements (MERID measurements): The 'MERID' meridian method is based&#xD;
      on the change of skin impedance after a given IR (infrared) stimulus to a Biological Active&#xD;
      Point (BAP) which gives a reliable and reproducible measure for the energy status of that&#xD;
      particular meridian and consequently of the related organ or organ system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate variability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate is affected by both sympathetic and parasympathetic input. These two branches of&#xD;
      the autonomic control system affect both heart rate and changes in heart rate. Cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic balance, also called sympatho-vagal balance, is the combined effect of&#xD;
      parasympathetic (inhibitory) and sympathetic (excitatory) innervation of the heart and can be&#xD;
      considered the main determinant of the regulation of heart rate and can be quantified by&#xD;
      means of electrocardiography (ECG) measurements and spectral analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomics to be applied in this study consists of a number of methods based on LC-MS and&#xD;
      GC-MS technology to determine (relative) concentrations of endogenous metabolites in&#xD;
      biological samples (blood and urine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is set up as a study with an explorative character. No administration of&#xD;
      substances will take place. All subjects will be subjected to seven non-invasive&#xD;
      measurements, filling in a number of questionnaires and subjected to three physical&#xD;
      examinations. Blood sampling, in the fasting state, will be done at two determined time&#xD;
      points (pre-study and in study) and will not exceed 30 mL. Furthermore, one (spot) urine&#xD;
      sample will be collected in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above mentioned assessments and the fact that no administration of substances&#xD;
      will take place, the discomfort for the subjects in the study is minimal and the risk for&#xD;
      participating subjects is negligible.&#xD;
