    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells&#xD;
      are destroyed, resulting in poor blood sugar control. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety and effectiveness of islet transplantation using a steroid-free,&#xD;
      calcineurin-inhibitor-free belatacept based immunosuppressive medication, for treating type 1&#xD;
      diabetes in individuals experiencing hypoglycemia unawareness and severe hypoglycemic&#xD;
      episodes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is commonly treated with the administration of insulin, either by multiple&#xD;
      insulin injections or by a continuous supply of insulin through a wearable pump. Insulin&#xD;
      therapy allows long-term survival in individuals with type 1 diabetes; however, it does not&#xD;
      guarantee constant normal blood sugar control. Because of this, long-term type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      survivors often develop vascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease&#xD;
      that can cause poor vision and blindness, and diabetic nephropathy, a kidney disease that can&#xD;
      lead to kidney failure. Some individuals with type 1 diabetes develop hypoglycemia&#xD;
      unawareness, a life-threatening condition that is not easily treatable with medication and is&#xD;
      characterized by reduced or absent warning signals for hypoglycemia. For such individuals,&#xD;
      transplantation of pancreatic islets is a possible treatment option. Unfortunately, insulin&#xD;
      independence among islet transplant recipients tends to decline over time. New strategies&#xD;
      aimed at promoting engraftment of transplanted islets are needed to improve the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes associated with this procedure. The purpose of this study is determine the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of islet transplantation, when combined with an immunosuppressive medication&#xD;
      regimen containing belatacept, for treating type 1 diabetes in individuals experiencing&#xD;
      hypoglycemia unawareness and severe hypoglycemic episodes. This study will also seek to&#xD;
      improve the understanding of determinants of success and failure of islet transplants for&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to this study or a site-specific Phase 3&#xD;
      islet transplantation study (CIT-07). Participants in this study will receive up to three&#xD;
      separate islet transplants and a regimen of immunosuppressive medications consisting of&#xD;
      belatacept, basiliximab (an IL-2 monoclonal antibody receptor blocker), and mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil. Participants will begin receiving all three drugs on the day of the first islet&#xD;
      transplant. Belatacept will also be administered again on Days 4, 14, 28, 56, and 84&#xD;
      post-transplant and then every 4 weeks for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant receives daclizumab, it will also be given again on Days 14, 28, 42, and&#xD;
      56 post-transplant; if the participant receives basiliximab, it will also be given again on&#xD;
      Day 4 post-transplant. Mycophenolate mofetil will also be given for the duration of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplantations will involve an inpatient hospital stay and intraportal infusion of islet&#xD;
      cells. Participants who do not achieve or maintain insulin independence by Day 75&#xD;
      post-transplant will be considered for a second islet transplant. Participants who remain&#xD;
      dependent on insulin for longer than 1 month after the second transplant and who show partial&#xD;
      graft function will be considered for a third islet transplant. Participants who do not meet&#xD;
      the criteria for a subsequent transplant and do not have a functioning graft will enter a&#xD;
      reduced follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be up to 25 study visits following each transplant. A physical exam, review of&#xD;
      adverse events, and blood collection will occur at most visits. A chest x-ray, abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound, electrocardiogram, quality of life questionnaires, urine collection, and more&#xD;
      extensive blood testing will occur at some visits. Participants will also test their own&#xD;
      blood glucose levels at least five times per day throughout the study. A 24-month follow-up&#xD;
      period will take place after the participant's last transplant.&#xD;
