      The main goal of the GENEPARK consortium is to employ innovative haemogenomic approaches to&#xD;
      determine gene expression profiles specific for genetic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD) patients. These gene expression signatures will be utilised clinically as non-invasive&#xD;
      diagnostic tests for PD. The sensitivity of the newly developed diagnostic test will be&#xD;
      determined by extensive validations on an independent cohort of PD patients, whereas the&#xD;
      specificity will be assessed by testing patients with atypical parkinsonisms, including&#xD;
      multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and diffuse Lewy body disease. In&#xD;
      order to test the specificity of the diagnostic set in other disorders that affect basal&#xD;
      ganglia, Huntington's disease and dopa responsive dystonia patients will be analysed. The&#xD;
      second objective of the proposal is to determine correlations between gene expression&#xD;
      signatures and different stages of PD and thus provide the basis for early diagnosis and&#xD;
      monitoring of disease progression. These changes in blood gene expression will be correlated&#xD;
      with alterations detected by neuroimaging in the brain of PD patients. Such combinations of&#xD;
      molecular and morphological markers of disease may ultimately facilitate the selection and&#xD;
      monitoring of neuroprotective therapies for PD. Finally, GENEPARK aims to develop new&#xD;
      bioinformatic software tools for selection of genomic biomarkers using microarray data. A set&#xD;
      of established computational tools will be applied and novel methods, some of them based on&#xD;
      mechanistic modelling of the neurodegenerative diseases, will be developed in order to study&#xD;
      the advantages and limitations of the different methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With special emphasis on the careful clinical selection of patients and sufficient power&#xD;
      regarding patient numbers, as well as extensive quality control and validation of the data,&#xD;
      GENEPARK aims to develop a standardised approach to development and validation of&#xD;
      haemogenomic biomarkers of disease.&#xD;

      Employ innovative haemogenomic approaches to determine gene expression signatures specific&#xD;
      for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). There is currently no specific clinical or&#xD;
      laboratory diagnostic test available for PD. In GENEPARK, blood samples from patients with&#xD;
      genetic PD and idiopathic PD will be analysed by microarrays to identify gene expression&#xD;
      signatures specific for PD. The specificity of the new biomarkers for PD will be tested by&#xD;
      the analysis of patients with atypical parkinsonisms, including multiple system atrophy&#xD;
      (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), as well as&#xD;
      in patients with other basal ganglia disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD) and dopa&#xD;
      responsive dystonia (DRD). The validated gene expression signatures will be utilised to&#xD;
      develop a new test for diagnosis of idiopathic PD. Determine correlation between gene&#xD;
      expression signatures and different stages of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene expression in presymptomatic and symptomatic patients with genetic forms of PD as well&#xD;
      as patients in various stages of idiopathic PD will be analysed to identify gene expression&#xD;
      signatures specific for various stages of the disease. It should be emphasised that since no&#xD;
      clinical measures are present in presymptomatic genetic PD such molecular markers could serve&#xD;
      as surrogate markers to monitor therapeutic efficacy of possible preventive treatments in PD.&#xD;
      Determine correlations between gene expression signatures and morphological evidence of&#xD;
      neurodegenerative process in PD brain as determined by neuroimaging. Gene expression&#xD;
      signatures identified in blood samples will be correlated with changes in brain as detected&#xD;
      by neuroimaging in PD patients. Such correlations of molecular and morphological markers of&#xD;
      disease will facilitate the selection of blood markers in relation to disease progression.&#xD;
      Moreover, molecular and morphological markers of disease progression could be utilised in&#xD;
      combination for monitoring the effects of new neuroprotective therapies for PD. Develop&#xD;
      standardised approaches to development and validation of haemogenomic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This objective will be achieved by the special emphasis on careful clinical selection of&#xD;
      patients, sufficient power regarding patient numbers, as well as extensive quality control&#xD;
      and validation of the data. Develop new bioinformatic software tools for selection of genomic&#xD;
      biomarkers using microarray data. The aim of the GENEPARK is to develop the theoretical&#xD;
      foundations and to build the software tools for sample classification and selection of&#xD;
      genomic biomarkers using microarray data. The established computational tools and novel&#xD;
      methods developed within the GENEPARK will be applied to the patient data to study advantages&#xD;
      and limitations of different methodologies.&#xD;
