  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least 20% of patients hospitalized in the general medical and surgical wards at any given&#xD;
      time suffer from diabetes. It has been demonstrated that poor clinical outcome correlates&#xD;
      with the degree of hyperglycemia in these patients. Strict glucose control in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients improves clinical outcomes in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, cardiac&#xD;
      surgical procedures, infection and critical illness in patients hospitalized in intensive&#xD;
      care units if insulin is applied intravenously. It is, however, complex to obtain strict&#xD;
      glucose control in the general surgical and medical wards. These wards are usually&#xD;
      understaffed as compared to intensive care units and therefore are incapable to perform the&#xD;
      necessary close monitoring essential in patients treated with intravenous insulin. We intend&#xD;
      to test the feasibility of glucose control by multiple daily subcutaneous injections with&#xD;
      long acting basal glargine insulin and pre-meal insulin analogues. If good glucose control&#xD;
      can be achieved, this would be a valid, more convenient and acceptable alternative to&#xD;
      intravenous insulin infusions to obtain good glucose control in diabetic patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in general internal medicine wards.&#xD;

      Location of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal Medicine Wards C of Assaf Harofe Medical Center, Zerifin, Israel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult (&lt;18 years) Male and female T1 &amp; T2DM patients who can sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin treatment (at least one injection a day) prior to hospitalization for at least&#xD;
           half a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetic ketoacidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyperosmolar state due to hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fertile women who do not use oral contraception or IUD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â· The hospital staff will determine the initiation or continuation of oral and intravenous&#xD;
      medications as indicated by the patient's medical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission Blood tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine: CBC, Creatinine, Urea, Na, K, GOT, GPT, Alp, Albumin, Glu&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HbA1C &amp; Fructosamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation and Titration of Insulin dosage:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glargine insulin will be initiated as a function of the first fasting glucose level and&#xD;
           the patients body weight (0.3 - 0.8 U/kg). Up- or down titration will occur every&#xD;
           morning by 10 - 20% according to capillary am fasting glucose (goal 130 mg%). The dosage&#xD;
           of premeal insulin analogues will be based according to a sliding scale and calculated&#xD;
           as a percentage of the amount of am glargine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capillary blood glucose levels were measured seven times a day: before and two hours&#xD;
           after breakfast, lunch and dinner and at bedtime. Additional measurements were performed&#xD;
           according to clinical needs such as suspected hypoglycemia or unexplained deterioration&#xD;
           of clinical condition&#xD;
