    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and acceptance of using a microbicide&#xD;
      (product that kills germs) gel to clean the genital area. Microbicide gel is used by hospital&#xD;
      workers to clean their hands to kill germs. Researchers hope to use information from this&#xD;
      study to conduct a larger study to determine if the microbicidal gel protects men against&#xD;
      sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Thirty healthy uncircumcised Kenyan men, 18&#xD;
      years and older, working in the fishing industry in Kisumu will be recruited. Participants&#xD;
      will complete a questionnaire about their background and sexual practices. A researcher will&#xD;
      conduct a detailed examination of the genital area with a magnifying glass. A blood and urine&#xD;
      sample will be collected to test for infection. Each participant will use both the&#xD;
      microbicidal gel and a placebo (contains no active ingredient) gel at different times during&#xD;
      the study, and the results will be compared. Volunteers will participate up to 8 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Kenya, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has significantly increased adult and child mortality.&#xD;
      Current prevention options, including the ABC model (Abstinence, Be faithful and correct and&#xD;
      consistent Condom use) have not been sufficient to curb the generalized HIV epidemic. The&#xD;
      development of topical microbicides provides a potential new prevention option against&#xD;
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. Despite widespread use of topical&#xD;
      microbicides among U.S. servicemen during World Wars I &amp; II to prevent STI, the current HIV&#xD;
      agenda has thus far focused almost exclusively on microbicide research for intravaginal use&#xD;
      by females. Research on use of topical microbicides on the male genitalia has only examined&#xD;
      potential adverse effects on the penis of microbicides intended for intravaginal or rectal&#xD;
      use. Further research is necessary to determine what formulations, what doses, and what types&#xD;
      of topical antimicrobials might prove acceptable, and tolerable for external genital use by&#xD;
      male sub-populations, and effective for preventing HIV/STI in men. This Phase 1 safety trial&#xD;
      is the culmination of a stepwise series of studies examining male genital hygiene and safety&#xD;
      and acceptance of an alcohol-based topical microbicide among Kenyan men. The purpose of this&#xD;
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      acceptability of 62% ethanol in emollient gel (intervention) and 15% ethanol in emollient gel&#xD;
      (placebo), applied to the penis by men each morning and after every sexual exposure. The&#xD;
      study population will include 30 healthy, uncircumcised Kenyan men working in the fishing&#xD;
      industry. Participants will be randomly assigned to initial use of 1 of the 2 products for a&#xD;
      2-week interval. After a subsequent 2-week wash out period in which no topical gel will be&#xD;
      used, the men will then cross over to use of the second product. The primary study objective&#xD;
      is to assess the safety and toxicity of 62% and 15% ethanol in emollient gel on the penile&#xD;
      epithelium and urethral mucosa. The secondary study objective is to assess the acceptability&#xD;
      and compliance with the topical microbicide (62% ethanol) and placebo (15% ethanol) by men&#xD;
      each morning and after each act of sexual intercourse. The primary study outcome measures&#xD;
      include: self-reported urethral pain, urethral burning, penile itching, penile rash, penile&#xD;
      blisters, penile ulceration or penile discharge at follow-up clinic visits on days 7, 14, 28,&#xD;
      35, 42 or 56; erythema (with or without induration), vesiculation, bullous reaction, and&#xD;
      ulceration, of the penile shaft, foreskin, and glans, as observed by visual exam at follow-up&#xD;
      clinic visits on days 7, 14, 28, 35, 42, or 56; erythema or ulceration of the urethral&#xD;
      meatus, as observed by visual exam at follow-up clinic visits on days 7, 14, 28, 35, 42 or&#xD;
      56; and adverse events other than those listed as primary endpoints judged related to product&#xD;
      use. The secondary study outcome measures are reported positive attributes (ease of use,&#xD;
      increased pleasure during sex, positive feedback from primary sex partner) or negative&#xD;
      attributes (difficulty of use, decreased pleasure during sex, negative feedback from primary&#xD;
      sex partner) of the study products; reported willingness to use and recommend the products;&#xD;
      and reported adherence with use of condoms and of the topical microbicide. Each participant&#xD;
      will take part in the study for up to 8 weeks, including the screening period. The entire&#xD;
      study should be completed within 5-6 months.&#xD;
