      The primary objectives of this study is to determine whether use of a negative pressure&#xD;
      external soft-tissue expansion system pre-operatively and post-operatively improves and&#xD;
      secures graft survival in autologous fat micro grafting breast augmentation and&#xD;
      reconstruction procedures.&#xD;

      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine pregnancy test will be performed before each designated procedure in the study.&#xD;
      Patients will be questioned about underlying renal disease and excluded if existent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative/baseline digital or 35mm photos will be obtained utilizing the standard&#xD;
      criteria as performed routinely by plastic and reconstructive surgeons before any surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Oblique, frontal and sagittal views will be stored in protected files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional: Patients will have a preoperative breast MRI with the contrasting agent Gadolinium,&#xD;
      utilizing a 1.5 Tesla MRI machine and breast coils unless status post breast cancer where no&#xD;
      pre-operative MRI is needed. All readings will be performed by board certified radiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brava domes will be worn bilaterally 3-4 weeks before surgery for 10-12 hours per day, 7 days&#xD;
      a week with 24 hour wear for the final 72 hours (3 days) before surgery. Patients will be&#xD;
      required to adhere to the dome cleaning process specified by the manufacturer. This is&#xD;
      prudent for hygienic reasons and to reduce skin irritation and infections. The domes are for&#xD;
      single patient use only. Pressure will range from 15 mmHg to 105mmHg and will be achieved and&#xD;
      regulated by either SmartBox, bulb syringe and/or Brava Turbo devices. This will open up the&#xD;
      tissue planes and maximally expand the recipient breast in preparation for graft insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board approval will be obtained and all patients will be properly&#xD;
      advised of their rights via signed Informed Consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assessed by board certified plastic and reconstructive surgeons for&#xD;
      autologous fat harvesting sites. Preoperative sedation with IV sedation and/or oral sedation&#xD;
      is recommended. Preoperative antibiotics, such as Keflex or similar drug, will be&#xD;
      administered before surgery. Sterile drape and prep of the fat harvesting sites will be&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumescent anesthetic solution will be prepared by diluting 50cc's of 1% lidocaine with&#xD;
      1/100,000 units of epinephrine with 1000cc's of Ringers Lactate solution and will be&#xD;
      instilled with a 14-gauge infusion infiltration cannula into the areas of fat harvesting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gentle, low vacuum pressure manual liposuction will be performed to avoid damaging the fat&#xD;
      cells. Liposuction will be performed in a standard fashion using 12G &amp; 12 side holes&#xD;
      harvesting cannulas and connected to syringes that maintain a controlled constant low vacuum&#xD;
      pressure of 300 mmHg (preferably using the K-VAC (Vacuum Assisted Device) syringe). The&#xD;
      aspirate will be purged from the syringes into collection bags using atraumatic nonclogging&#xD;
      valves (preferably the AT-Valve) or 3 way stopcocks. Once filled, the bags will be spun at&#xD;
      low speed (&lt;1000 rpm) to separate fat from serum (and free of oil, if any). The infranatant&#xD;
      serum will be drained and the cellular fat supernatant will be concentrated in the bags and&#xD;
      directly re-injected into the breasts. Depending upon the volume correction required and the&#xD;
      recipient space available, 100 to 500 ml of gently centrifuged (non-packed) fat will be&#xD;
      injected per breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recipient breast will be marked carefully prior to infiltration of anesthetics to&#xD;
      determine the preferred graft distribution pattern and to select 9-18 graft insertion sites&#xD;
      (circumareolar, inframammary, axillary and at the circumference of the breast). The skin will&#xD;
      be infiltrated at the graft insertion sites with Naropin 2% (ropivacine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the recipient site is anesthetized, puncture sites will be made with a 14-gauge needle.&#xD;
      A 14-gauge blunt tip cannula or similar cannula connected to a 3 ml syringe is used to gently&#xD;
      inject small droplets distally first and then subsequently proximally as the cannula is&#xD;
      withdrawn. Repeated passes at multiple levels in a radial fashion are performed through each&#xD;
      of the puncture sites such that the grafts droplets are laid down in a criss-crossing pattern&#xD;
      and at multiple planes. Avoid the glandular tissue by remaining in the subcutaneous plane and&#xD;
      if more volume is needed and is available proceed to fill the subglandular, intramuscular and&#xD;
      submuscular planes. Incision sites are covered with sterile band aids applied to skin. Gentle&#xD;
      conforming dressings will be applied to breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elastic garments will be placed on harvest site. Postoperative instructions are handed to&#xD;
      each patient. Patient will begin wearing the Brava System, with the SmartBox device only, 18&#xD;
      hours post-operative as a stabilization device. For the first three (3) days the system is&#xD;
      worn 24 hours a day or as to the maximum tolerated. If the patient notes pain, the system may&#xD;
      be removed and replaced a few hours later. The System is then worn 10 to 12 hours a day for&#xD;
      one additional week (7 days). Then the patient may choose to proceed with a prolonged&#xD;
      intermittent wear of 10 hours per day for 10 - 14 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will include: A call from the surgical team within 24 hours after surgery. An&#xD;
      office follow up visit within 48-72 hours of surgery and follow-up appointment in 6 months.&#xD;
      More office follow up visits in the interim are recommended but not mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-year post grafting mammogram will be recommended to all women over the age of 40.&#xD;
