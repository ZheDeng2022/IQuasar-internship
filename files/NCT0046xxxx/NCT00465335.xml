      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of performing a &quot;cat scan&quot; of the&#xD;
      heart arteries in patients (without a known history of heart disease) seen by their physician&#xD;
      for chest pain. We plan to evaluate this test in patients who have already undergone stress&#xD;
      testing. On occasion, stress test results are equivocal or suspected to be inaccurate. In&#xD;
      these cases, depending on the overall clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      physicians may recommend cardiac catheterization to determine whether or not patients have&#xD;
      blockages in their heart's arteries. We plan to evaluate whether a Cat Scan of the heart&#xD;
      arteries will provide your physician with important information to assist in this decision.&#xD;
      If the results of this test are normal, the patient may not require a heart catheterization;&#xD;
      alternatively, if the test is abnormal, a physician may proceed with catheterization after&#xD;
      review of the data. There will 200 patients enrolled into the study. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed by their usual cardiologist, and all decisions will be made by their cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT; &quot;cat scan&quot;) is an x-ray test routinely used for diagnostic purposes.&#xD;
      Cardiac computed tomography using the newer generation multislice CT (MSCT) scanners is an&#xD;
      improved way of using CT scanning techniques to look at the heart and blood vessels of the&#xD;
      body. The images of the coronary arteries obtained by MSCT scanners (during a 5-10 minute&#xD;
      procedure) are highly accurate, when compared to the conventional invasive cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization procedure. This procedure will provide a calculation of a coronary artery&#xD;
      calcium score as well as an accurate depiction of the coronary anatomy. The accuracy of this&#xD;
      test is similar to that achieved with traditional stress test imaging, but has some inherent&#xD;
      advantages over this traditional stress testing. Therefore, we believe that in patients with&#xD;
      intermediate, inconclusive, or suspected inaccurate stress tests, MSCT of the coronary&#xD;
      arteries may provide helpful information to your physician to help guide their decision&#xD;
      regarding the need (or lack of) for possible invasive cardiac catheterization. This procedure&#xD;
      is considered an ideal &quot;screening test&quot; to exclude the presence of coronary artery disease in&#xD;
      patients with suspected coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of your procedure, the patient will be given intravenous (&quot;IV dye&quot;) contrast&#xD;
      during their Cat Scan. We will also draw a blood sample to assess your kidney function and/or&#xD;
      pregnancy status (if necessary). The contrast is what creates the pictures of one's arteries.&#xD;
      The intravenous contrast used is the same dye as that used for routine cat scans of other&#xD;
      parts of the body, as well as for cardiac catheterization. Prior to the Scan patients may be&#xD;
      prescribed a medicine called a beta blocker The beta blocker typically used is called&#xD;
      Atenolol. This medication slows your heart rate and is one that is commonly used to treat&#xD;
      high blood pressure. Dosing will be based upon your current medications and vital signs. If a&#xD;
      patient's heart rate is greater than 60 beats per minute an intravenous beta-blocker may be&#xD;
      given to optimize their heart images. Patient's will have to hold your breath twice, for up&#xD;
      to 30 seconds each time. The imaging part of the test takes about 10 minutes. Patient's will&#xD;
      be observed after the test for about 20 minutes, followed by discharge home. Physicians will&#xD;
      called with the patient's results of the study, and they will contact their patient's&#xD;
      regarding the results, as well as the &quot;next step.&quot; If a patient is a diabetic (taking&#xD;
      metformin/glucophage), we will request a follow up (the next day) kidney test. Patient's will&#xD;
      also will be called at 3 months to asked a few brief questions regarding your health (any&#xD;
      recent hospitalizations, any new medical illnesses, any follow up heart testing, etc.)&#xD;

      The purpose of this observational study is to prospectively evaluate the impact of multi&#xD;
      detector CT angiography (MDCT) in patients with equivocal/intermediate post exercise stress&#xD;
      test probability of coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of MDCT in patients with equivocal/&#xD;
           intermediate post test probability of CAD and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the accuracy of MDCT in prediction of 30 day major adverse events.&#xD;
