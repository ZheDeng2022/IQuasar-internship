  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a case-controlled study using an innovative, non-invasive, FDA approved technology to&#xD;
      measure the autonomic nervous system. Detection of unsuspected DPN or ANS dysfunction may&#xD;
      allow physicians to re-assess current treatment and develop new dietary or pharmacological&#xD;
      strategies. This also is an immense public health concern since there are currently 18&#xD;
      million diabetics in the United States and 220 million worldwide.&#xD;

      A consecutive cohort of 20 neurologically asymptomatic (absence of numbness, tingling,&#xD;
      burning or pain in the feet) patients with Type I from the practice of Dr. Richard Noto&#xD;
      (gatekeeper) and associates will be asked with their legal guardians to enroll in this&#xD;
      case-controlled study using a battery of safe, neurological tests which are unlikely to be&#xD;
      painful. A second group of 20 subjects who are nondiabetic and healthy (age/sex matched) will&#xD;
      also be enrolled and undergo the same battery of neurological tests. The battery of tests is&#xD;
      highly accurate, objective and safe. Subjects will be referred and enrolled from the private&#xD;
      practices of community pediatricians. A BMI derived from the subject's height and weight will&#xD;
      be assessed by Dr. Noto. Subjects who are felt to be acceptable by the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will then receive consecutive numbers from 1 to 40 and their initials will follow their&#xD;
      specific number for each study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cooperation of the subject and guardian are required for this 60-120 minute&#xD;
             evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of understanding and complying with study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Twenty (20) male/females with juvenile diabetes [of at least 3 years duration and no&#xD;
             longer than 7] (Type I) who are neurologically asymptomatic without numbness,&#xD;
             tingling, burning or pain in the feet, ages 10-18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting blood glucose greater than 120 mg at the time of initial diagnosis or a HbA1C&#xD;
             greater than 6.0 at the time of the initial diagnosis will indicate that individual is&#xD;
             to be considered a diabetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI ranges of acceptability are greater than 5th percentile and less than 85th&#xD;
             percentile.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic with neurological symptoms of numbness, tingling, burning or pain in the&#xD;
             feet of either controls or diabetic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On medications that can produce peripheral neuropathy, i.e. statins (Lipitor),&#xD;
             Dilantin, anti-neoplastic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to understand informed consent, i.e. mental retardation, psychosis,&#xD;
             communicative impairment, language barrier.&#xD;
