  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty, house dust mite (HDM)-allergic non-smoking subjects with or without mild asthma&#xD;
      between the ages 18-50 will be recruited. The primary endpoint will be nasal eosinophilia.&#xD;
      Each volunteer will be screened with skin testing, pulmonary function testing and induced&#xD;
      sputum. If eligible they will return for baseline nasal allergen challenge and lavage.&#xD;
      Approximately two weeks later they will return for gamma tocopherol (gT) dosing visit. After&#xD;
      completing 14 days of daily high dose (1200mg) gT, they will return for a second nasal&#xD;
      allergen challenge. This visit will also include pulmonary function testing and blood draw.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if high dose gamma tocopherol therapy can reduce&#xD;
      allergen induced nasal inflammation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be done using a single-group, prospective, descriptive proof of concept study&#xD;
      design (Phase I) in which HDM-allergic adults will undergo baseline nasal allergen challenge&#xD;
      and nasal lavage, then receive 2 weeks of treatment with gT followed by a second challenge&#xD;
      and nasal lavage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Post-treatment change in concentration of house dust mite-induced&#xD;
      eosinophils in nasal lavage fluid (NLF), compared to pre-treatment baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: (a) NLF inflammatory mediators including eicosanoid products of COX-2&#xD;
      pathway, inflammatory cytokines relevant to innate immunity and allergic inflammation, cells&#xD;
      other than eosinophils including neutrophils, total protein; (b) similar endpoints in induced&#xD;
      sputum; (c) sub-analysis of all data for subjects with mild asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety outcomes: Post-treatment change in coagulation markers (PT, PTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1(Screening): Study subjects consenting for the protocol will be scheduled for an&#xD;
      initial baseline screening visit which will include urine pregnancy test, medical history and&#xD;
      physical exam, immediate-hypersensitivity skin testing for D. farinae and other common&#xD;
      allergens, baseline spirometry, nasal lavage for cell differentials and cytokines, induced&#xD;
      sputum for cell differentials and cytokines, venipuncture for up to 30ml of blood for&#xD;
      complete blood, count coagulation factors, cytokines and vitamin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Allergen challenge visit will occur within 2 months of screening. Medical history&#xD;
      including medications will be reviewed. Urine pregnancy test, physical exam, baseline nasal&#xD;
      symptom score will be obtained prior to challenge. Study volunteer will undergo graded nasal&#xD;
      allergen challenge with D. farinae using left naris with symptom score recorded after each&#xD;
      dose. Nasal allergen challenge will be provided in a graded dose fashion 0 AU, 100 AU, 500 AU&#xD;
      and then 1,000 AU separated by 15 minutes. Dilutions will be provided by the University of&#xD;
      North Carolina Hospitals Investigational Drug Service. Over 10 minutes, symptoms will be&#xD;
      monitored and scored, based on symptoms in the allergen challenge nostril. If there are no&#xD;
      positive clinical symptoms, increasing concentrations of dust mite allergen dilution are&#xD;
      deposited into the nose. Nasal challenge with saline will be given in the contralateral&#xD;
      nostril with similar volumes as used for allergen challenge followed by spirometry and vital&#xD;
      signs. Subjects will remain in the research lab and undergo vital signs and spirometry 4&#xD;
      hours post challenge and at the investigator's discretion. Nasal lavage will occur 4 hours&#xD;
      after allergen challenge for measurements as noted above. If volunteer was a sputum producer&#xD;
      in the first visit, sputum induction will be performed, also 4 hours after nasal allergen&#xD;
      challenge. Venipuncture for complete blood count coagulation factors, cytokines and vitamin&#xD;
      levels will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2a: This visit will occur within 24 hr after Visit 2. Volunteer will have vital signs&#xD;
      recorded, review of symptoms, physical examination and spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3(Initial dosing visit): This visit will occur at least 2 weeks after Visit 2. Any&#xD;
      changes in medical history, medications or adverse events (AE's) since prior visit will be&#xD;
      reviewed. Urine pregnancy test will be performed for females of child bearing potential.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a 14 day supply (28 softgel capsules, approximately 600 grams of gT&#xD;
      each) dispensed by the University of North Carolina Hospitals Investigational Drug Service&#xD;
      and provided by YASOO Medical. Subjects will be observed while taking the initial oral dose&#xD;
      of 2 softgel capsules (approximately 1200 grams) of gT and will be discharged home with&#xD;
      individual oral doses of study drug for the following 13 days. Subjects will be given a daily&#xD;
      medication diary to record when the dose was taken and any changes in health or medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: This visit is a safety visit after 6-8 days of gT therapy. The subjects will undergo&#xD;
      vital signs measurements, spirometry and physical exam specifically focused on signs of&#xD;
      bruising or bleeding. Venipuncture (approximately 10ml) will be performed to obtain CBC and&#xD;
      coagulation factors since high dose gT theoretically may affect platelet function and&#xD;
      coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: After two weeks of daily gT the subject volunteer will return for another nasal&#xD;
      allergen challenge. Medical history will be updated, any AE's or new medications since visit&#xD;
      4 will be reviewed. Pregnancy testing, spirometry and vital signs will be performed. After&#xD;
      baseline nasal symptom score is obtained a graded nasal allergen challenge will be performed&#xD;
      as in visit 2. Spirometry will be performed after challenge to assure volunteer has tolerated&#xD;
      allergen challenge. Nasal lavage will be performed 4 hours after allergen challenge for&#xD;
      measurements as noted above. If a volunteer was a sputum producer in previous visit, sputum&#xD;
      induction 4 hours after allergen challenge for measurements as above. Venipuncture for blood&#xD;
      studies (including safety labs) as indicated in visit above will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5a: This visit will occur within 24 hours of Visit 2. Volunteer will undergo vital&#xD;
      signs measurement, review of symptoms, physical exam and spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6: Five to ten days after challenge, volunteer will return for discontinuation visit&#xD;
      which will include vital signs, physical exam and spirometry.&#xD;
