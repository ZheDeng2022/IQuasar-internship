    <textblock>
      The Primary objective is to reduce the incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction in a&#xD;
      high-risk subset of patients undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass with&#xD;
      Fenolopam, a selective dopamine-1 receptor agonist. Perioperative renal function will be&#xD;
      observed in 3 randomly selected groups of patients-Fenoldopam infusion at 0.03 cg/kg/min,&#xD;
      Fenoldopam at 0.1 mcg/kg/min or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: will be to correlate Fenoldopam usage with postoperative clinical&#xD;
      outcomes such as ICU stay, hospital stay, need for inotropes/vasopressors, need for&#xD;
      diuretics, requirements for ECF at discharge, and overall perioperative cost reduction&#xD;
      through decreased ICU and hospital length of stay.&#xD;

      Although all patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk for renal dysfunction, there are&#xD;
      certain preoperative clinical parameters which have been shown to place patients at&#xD;
      particularly high risk for postoperative renal demise. These factors include age greater than&#xD;
      70 (with those patients greater than 80 years being at particular high risk), history of New&#xD;
      York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, previous coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grafting, pre-operative creatinine level 1.24-1.77 mmol/dL, type I diabetes, preoperative&#xD;
      glucose &gt;166 mmol/dL, cardiopulmonary bypass time &gt;3 hours, and low cardiac output states&#xD;
      (those states requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or with cardiac index of less than&#xD;
      1.5 or requiring more than 3 inotropic drugs).1 Recently, there has been interest in the&#xD;
      pharmacologic manipulation of peripheral dopamine receptors (DA1 and DA2) in an attempt to&#xD;
      augment and preserve renal function. Goldberg and colleagues localized DA1 receptors to&#xD;
      vascular smooth muscle postsynaptic membranes in renal, coronary, cerebral, mesenteric, and&#xD;
      peripheral artery vasculature, in the proximal convoluted tubule, and in the cortical&#xD;
      collecting ducts of the nephron.6,7 Stimulation of the DA1 receptor activates adenylate&#xD;
      cyclase causing vascular smooth muscle vasodilation and naturesis with increased urinary&#xD;
      sodium excretion by inhibiting sodium-potassium ATPase-dependent processes at the proximal&#xD;
      convoluted tubule and the thick portion of the ascending loop of Henle.6,8,9 The greatest&#xD;
      effect of DA1 receptor activation occurs in the renal vasculature (mostly at afferent&#xD;
      arteriole)9, causing an increase of renal blood flow up to 35% in normal patients and up to&#xD;
      77% in those patients with renal vascular disease.10,11 DA2 receptors are found in the renal&#xD;
      parenchyma, presynaptic nerve terminals of adrenergic nerves and sympathetic ganglia, and in&#xD;
      the adrenal cortex.10 DA2 receptor activation leads to inhibition of norepinephrine release&#xD;
      (as part of a negative feedback loop) and inhibition of angiotensin II mediated release of&#xD;
      aldosterone.10,12 With activation of DA2 receptors in the kidney, a resultant decrease in&#xD;
      renal blood flow, decrease in glomerular filtration rate, and decrease in diuresis and&#xD;
      naturesis is observed, effects that are opposite to and may offset DA-1 receptor agonism.&#xD;
      Mayes and colleagues showed no improvement in renal function in patient undergoing CABG with&#xD;
      &quot;renal-dose&quot; dopamine.6, 13 It is theorized that dopamine's inability to provide renal&#xD;
      protection may be due to its lack of specificity for DA-1 receptors and resultant&#xD;
      dose-dependent agonism for DA-2 receptors and alpha1-adrenergic receptors.6, 14, 15 As&#xD;
      mentioned, dopamine's activation of these receptors results in decreased renal blood flow,&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate, and sodium excretion6, 16, thereby offsetting the effects of DA-1&#xD;
      receptor agonism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fenoldopam is the first commercially available selective DA1 receptor agonist. Fenoldopam is&#xD;
      a selective agonist for DA1 receptors with no activity at DA2 receptors, alpha adrenergic&#xD;
      receptors, or beta adrenergic receptors. Currently, Fenoldopam is used as an intravenous&#xD;
      infusion for hypertensive emergencies. When given to hypertensive patients in doses of&#xD;
      0.025-0.5 mcg/kg/min, a reduction in blood pressure is seen in a linear and dose dependent&#xD;
      manner.9, 17, 18, 19, 20 Despite reductions in perfusion pressure, glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      and renal blood flow are equivalent or even increased.9, 20, 21 When given to normotensive&#xD;
      patients at doses of 0.03-0.3 mcg/kg/min, Vandana and colleagues have shown that Fenoldopam&#xD;
      significantly increased renal blood flow in a dose-dependent manner when compared with&#xD;
      placebo with no change in systolic blood pressure and minimal changes in diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (1 mmHg @ 0.3 mcg/kg/min dose) and heart rate (14 bpm @ 0.3 mcg/kg/min dose). In&#xD;
      addition, there were no serious or severe side effects even at the highest doses.9 These&#xD;
      observations are consistent with prior studies of Fenoldopam in both normotensive22 and&#xD;
      hypotensive23 patients. Fenoldopam's lack of effects on venous capacitance as well as the&#xD;
      lesser role that resistance plays in determining blood pressure in normotensive patients may&#xD;
      further explain the negligible effect that Fenoldopam has on blood pressure in normotensive&#xD;
      subjects. This leads to a theoretic &quot;renal protection&quot; provided by Fenoldopam at doses which&#xD;
      elicit negligible deleterious effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned, Fenoldopam is a selective DA1 receptor agonist created through modification of&#xD;
      the dopamine molecule with the addition of chloride, sulfur, and a benzene ring.10 These&#xD;
      changes result in agonistic effects exclusively on the DA-1 receptor with no DA2 receptor&#xD;
      activation and no direct or indirect actions on both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors.10&#xD;
      Fenoldopam has a short half-life of 5-10 minutes, a linear relationship between plasma&#xD;
      concentration and infusion rate, and a small volume of distribution allowing rapid&#xD;
      intravenous titration.24 These characteristics make Fenoldopam ideal for intravenous infusion&#xD;
      with a steady-state plasma concentration being achieved within 30-60 minutes, steady-state&#xD;
      concentrations remaining constant during infusion, and with a negligible concentration (&lt;0.2&#xD;
      mcg/L) 2 hours after discontinuation as demonstrated by Allison and colleagues.24 Hepatic&#xD;
      clearance of Fenoldopam occurs through conjugation via sulfation or glucuronidation.10&#xD;
      Klecker and colleagues demonstrated that drug-drug interactions are negligible due to&#xD;
      parallel pathways of metabolism.25 Recent studies by Garwood and colleagues and Caimmi and&#xD;
      colleagues have shown preservation of renal function by perioperative infusion of Fenoldopam&#xD;
      as indicated by lower creatinine level at discharge in those patients at high risk for&#xD;
      perioperative renal demise.26, 27 However, a prospective randomized control trial has yet to&#xD;
      be performed. There is also uncertainty that these reductions in serum creatinine levels at&#xD;
      discharge are of any practical benefit in terms of reduced morbidity, reduced length of stay,&#xD;
      reduced cost, or improved clinical performance. In addition, an optimal dose for Fenoldopam&#xD;
      for this clinical indication has yet to be determined. For this pilot study, Fenoldopam will&#xD;
      be infused at 0.03 mcg/kg/min or 0.1 mcg/kg/min. These doses were chosen due to their proven&#xD;
      effectiveness to significantly increase renal blood flow with minimal effects on blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate.9 The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Fenoldopam, a new selective dopamine-1 receptor agonist, in the reduction of postoperative&#xD;
      renal dysfunction in a high-risk subset of patients undergoing cardiac surgery in a&#xD;
      prospective randomized control pilot study. This will be accomplished through infusion of&#xD;
      Fenoldopam at 0.03 mcg/kg/min, 0.1 mcg/kg/min, or placebo in a double blinded, randomized,&#xD;
      prospective trial where postoperative creatinine, urine output, and progression to renal&#xD;
      dysfunction will be observed. Renal dysfunction will be defined as an increase in serum&#xD;
      creatinine by greater than 50% of the preoperative value or a serum creatinine that exceeds&#xD;
      2.0 mg/dL at any time postoperatively prior to discharge.. In addition, length of ICU stay,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, ventilator requirements, need for diuretics, need for perioperative&#xD;
      inotropes/vasopressors, and need for discharge to extended care facilities will be examined&#xD;
      for each group. The null hypothesis is that Fenoldopam will not reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative renal dysfunction.&#xD;
