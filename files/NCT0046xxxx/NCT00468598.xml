  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This survey has two aims. First, we would like to be informed about the health condition of&#xD;
      our patients two years following heart surgery at University Hospital, Basel. Second, we are&#xD;
      interested in determining whether a patient's long-term outcome can be predicted by the&#xD;
      analysis of blood samples taken shortly after heart surgery.Troponin T, the blood parameter&#xD;
      that we are interested in, is routinely assessed in the Intensive Care Unit. The purpose of&#xD;
      this survey is to determine whether or not it is also possible to infer the long-term outcome&#xD;
      from this blood parameter.&#xD;

      Hypothesis and purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that the amount of troponin T release after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery is associated with mortality and cardiac morbidity within 1 year after surgery.&#xD;
      Patients undergoing coronary procedures using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (i.e., CABG,&#xD;
      valvular and combined on-pump procedures) will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further purpose of the study is to evaluate the outcome of patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      procedures at our institution, as this is currently not quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ethical approval, we will conduct our study in two parts. In the first part, we will&#xD;
      perform a retrospective cohort study at the University Hospital Basel to assess the 1 year&#xD;
      outcome in all patients who have undergone cardiac surgery at our institution between January&#xD;
      1, 2005 and December 31, 2006. In addition, we will identify the best cut-off value of&#xD;
      postoperative troponin T for predicting morbidity and mortality 1 year after open-heart&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study will be performed between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008.&#xD;
      We will continue the quality control study and will prospectively test the clinical value of&#xD;
      elevated troponin T values, according to the risk model developed in the first part, for&#xD;
      predicting for long-term (1 year) morbidity and mortality. The prospective part of the study&#xD;
      can include patients operated on as early as January 1, 2007 because the prospective&#xD;
      follow-up will take place 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: all patients who underwent or will undergo cardiac surgery using&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary bypass at the University Hospital Basel between January 1, 2005 and December&#xD;
      31, 2008 will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first part of the study, patients who had cardiac surgery between January 1, 2005 and&#xD;
      December 31, 2006 will be analysed retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the prospective part of the study, all patients will be studied who will have surgery&#xD;
      between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac surgery without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedures requiring circulatory arrest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Penetrating cardiac trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant patient data including: history, functional state, medication, EuroSCORE8, and&#xD;
      haematological, basic renal, hepatic and metabolic chemistry findings (the routinely&#xD;
      performed preoperative laboratory tests in our institution, including preoperative C-reactive&#xD;
      protein and troponin T in the presence of a recent (&lt;7 days) ACS will be collected in the&#xD;
      retrospective as well as in the prospective cohorts. Pre-operative 12-lead ECG will only be&#xD;
      analysed in the prospective cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-operative surgical and clinical variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures and techniques, operative data (operating time, blood loss,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary and cross-clamp time, number of arterial and venous grafts and number of&#xD;
      distal anastomoses) will be assessed. Early postoperative therapy or events in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit, including total time on mechanical ventilation, postoperative inotropic support,&#xD;
      blood transfusion and renal replacement therapy, lengths of intensive care unit and hospital&#xD;
      stay, re-operation, new onset ventricular arrhythmia and Q-wave PMI will be recorded in both&#xD;
      parts of the study study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac marker analyses and 12-lead ECG:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Troponin T levels, routinely measured on the first and second postoperative day, will be used&#xD;
      for analysis in both parts of the study. Also, the routinely registered 12-lead ECG at&#xD;
      discharge will be compared with the preoperative baseline ECG and evaluated for ischemic&#xD;
      changes according to the Minnesota criteria for Q- and R-waves as well as for ST-deviation&#xD;
      and T-wave changes in the prospective cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: All-cause mortality within one year after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: Major adverse cardiac events, defined as cardiac mortality, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, congestive heart failure requiring hospitalisation and need for surgical or&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention within 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures will be obtained by reviewing hospital charts and by direct telephone&#xD;
      contact with the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the retrospective part, we anticipate a sample size of 1000 patients for the planned&#xD;
      study period of 24 months. Estimating a 1-year mortality of 6%, we expect 60 adverse events.&#xD;
      This number of adverse events will allow for a statistically robust multivariate risk model&#xD;
      based on 6 variables. We assume that a sample size of 660 patients will allow for retesting&#xD;
      of the model in the prospective part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be performed for the whole cohort as well as separately for patients with each&#xD;
      type of cardiac surgery, i.e., for patients undergoing CABG, aortic valve surgery, mitral&#xD;
      valve surgery, combined surgeries (CABG plus valve surgery) and for patients with a recent(&lt;7&#xD;
      days) ACS before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous data will be presented as mean ± SD and comparison between groups calculated by an&#xD;
      unpaired t-test. Categorical data will be presented as absolute numbers and percentages and&#xD;
      comparisons calculated by Pearson's χ2 test. Receiver operating characteristics curves will&#xD;
      be computed to establish cut-off values of troponin T and its likelihood ratio for the&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate logistic regression will be used to adjust the association of troponin T&#xD;
      elevation and outcome for established clinical risk parameters. This risk model, developed in&#xD;
      the retrospective first part of the study, will thereafter be retested in the prospective&#xD;
      second part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A p value &lt;0.05 will be defined as pointing to significance. All analyses will be calculated&#xD;
      by SPSS Version 14.&#xD;
