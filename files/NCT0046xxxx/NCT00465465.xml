  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dose of recombinant MVA used in the TB trials to date is relatively low compared with&#xD;
      other trials using recombinant MVAs which have used up to 2.5 x 108pfu (A Hill, personal&#xD;
      communication). Having demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of 5 x 107pfu of MVA85A, we now&#xD;
      need to perform a dose optimization study, prior to commencing larger scale Phase II and III&#xD;
      studies in South Africa. We will vaccinate 12 volunteers with a dose half a log lower than&#xD;
      the dose we are currently using, i.e. 107pfu MVA85A, and 12 volunteers with a dose half a log&#xD;
      higher, i.e. 108pfu.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MVA85A (at a dose of 5 x 107pfu) has been administered to 41 healthy volunteers in the UK and&#xD;
      17 healthy volunteers in The Gambia, with no serious adverse events. We have designed our&#xD;
      Phase I studies to allow for a vaccination of volunteer groups sequentially with a step-wise&#xD;
      increase in mycobacterial exposure, in order to minimize the possibility of a Koch reaction.&#xD;
      A Koch reaction describes the development of immunopathology in a person or animal with&#xD;
      tuberculosis, when an exaggerated immune response to M.tb is stimulated. It was described in&#xD;
      patients with TB disease when Koch performed his original studies employing mycobacteria as a&#xD;
      type of therapeutic vaccination. It has now been demonstrated in the mouse model of&#xD;
      therapeutic vaccination (Taylor, 2003). Available animal data suggest that these reactions do&#xD;
      not occur in mice latently infected with M.tb, suggesting that such reactions may correlate&#xD;
      with high bacterial load and that the Koch phenomenon may not pose a problem for vaccination&#xD;
      of healthy albeit latently infected humans. We started these studies in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      who were as mycobacterially na√Øve as possible. They were skin test negative and Elispot&#xD;
      negative for PPD, ESAT 6 and CFP10, and had not had previously been vaccinated with BCG. We&#xD;
      have now completed studies in the UK vaccinating volunteers previously vaccinated with BCG&#xD;
      (McShane, 2004). These volunteers are excluded if their Mantoux test is greater than 15&#xD;
      millimeters. These studies are ongoing in The Gambia. The group we are currently recruiting&#xD;
      for on this increasing mycobacterial spectrum are healthy volunteers who are latently&#xD;
      infected with M.tb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision matrix for selecting MVA85A dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If reducing the dose of MVA85A results in reduced immunogenicity, we could use either&#xD;
           the 5x107 or 108 dose, and would select the lower of these on the grounds of safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If increasing the dose of MVA85A increases the incidence of side-effects, we could use&#xD;
           either the 5x107 or 107 dose, and we would use the higher of these on the grounds of&#xD;
           immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If increasing the dose of MVA85A results in increased immunogenicity and no increase in&#xD;
           side-effects, we could use either the 5x107 or 108 dose in subsequent trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If reducing the dose of MVA85A results in no reduction in immunogenicity we could use&#xD;
           either the 107 or 5x107 dose in subsequent trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If all three doses are equally safe and immunogenic we will use either the low or 5x107&#xD;
           dose.&#xD;
