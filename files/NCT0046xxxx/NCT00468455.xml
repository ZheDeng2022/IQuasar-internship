      The purpose of this study is to produce a user-friendly tool- in the form of a questionnaire&#xD;
      - to accurately assess early quality of life in patients after abdominal colorectal surgery&#xD;
      from the first day after surgery to 6 months after. The study will also compare this&#xD;
      questionnaire to the other currently available assessment tools. Patients are invited to&#xD;
      participate if they are undergoing abdominal colorectal surgery at University Hospitals of&#xD;
      Cleveland.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to produce a user-friendly tool to accurately assess early&#xD;
      quality of life in postoperative patients following abdominal colorectal surgery in the early&#xD;
      postoperative period (from surgery to 6 months) that is practical for routine application.&#xD;
      The study will also compare this tool to the current available tools, namely the Short Form&#xD;
      (SF-36), the short form inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ), the Cleveland Clinic&#xD;
      Global Quality of Life (CGQOL). Patients will be invited to participate if they are&#xD;
      undergoing abdominal colorectal surgery at University Hospitals of Cleveland.&#xD;
