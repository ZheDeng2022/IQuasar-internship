    <textblock>
      Creatine (CR) supplementation is commonly used by athletes. However, its effects on renal&#xD;
      function remain controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of creatine&#xD;
      supplementation on renal function and oxidative stress in healthy sedentary males (18-35&#xD;
      years old) submitted to exercise training. Our hipothesis is that creatine supplementation&#xD;
      does not affect renal function in this population.&#xD;

      Creatine (CR) supplementation is commonly used by athletes. However, its effects on renal&#xD;
      function remain controversial. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      creatine supplementation on renal function and oxidative stress in healthy sedentary males&#xD;
      (18-35 years old) submitted to exercise training. Methods: Subjects (n = 18) were randomly&#xD;
      divided in two groups and were allocated to receive treatment with either creatine (CR) (~10g&#xD;
      • day-1 over three months) or placebo (PL) (dextrose). All subjects undertook moderate&#xD;
      intensity aerobic training, in three 40-minute sessions per week, during 3 months. Serum&#xD;
      creatinine, TBARS, serum and urinary sodium and potassium were determined at baseline and at&#xD;
      the study endpoint. Furthermore, cystatin C was also assessed prior to training (PRE), after&#xD;
      4 (POST 4) and 12 weeks (POST 12). Results: There were decreased in both oxidative stress&#xD;
      (evaluated by TBARS - µM/24 h) (PRE CR: 8.2  4.4; PL: 6.4  0.8 vs. POST 12 CR: 2.5  1.8;&#xD;
      PL: 2.1  1.6, p=0.0001) and cystatin C levels (mg/L) (PRE CR:0.82  0.09; PL: 0.88  0.07&#xD;
      vs. POST 12 CR: 0.71  0.06; PL: 0.75  0.09, p=0.0001) over the time, suggesting an increase&#xD;
      in glomerular filtration rate. There were no significant differences between groups in other&#xD;
      renal parameters investigated. Conclusions: These data indicate that high-dose creatine&#xD;
      supplementation throughout three months does not provoke renal dysfunction in sedentary&#xD;
      healthy males urdergoing aerobic training. Moreover, our results suggest that moderate&#xD;
      aerobic training per se could improve renal function.&#xD;
