      The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is safe to receive an injection of your&#xD;
      own bone marrow adult stem cells (autologous BM-MNC) to your heart wall during coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass graft (CABG).&#xD;

      The experimental design will be a Phase I safety trial in which all subjects from the VA Salt&#xD;
      Lake City Health Care System presenting with CAD and associated depressed LV function&#xD;
      requiring myocardial surgical revascularization will be eligible for enrollment. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study will receive autologous BM-MNC as adjunct to CABG. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure will be safety as measured by the incidence of postoperative Serious Adverse Events&#xD;
      (SAE) and Adverse Events (AE). The secondary outcome measures will be LV function, myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion, and clinical improvement. The trial will have one experiment with one patient&#xD;
      group. Group 1 (n=15) will follow standard Phase I dose escalation curve on a magnitude of&#xD;
      0.5 log increase after every third patient. Dose escalation will continue until a dosage of 1&#xD;
      x108 cells/pt is reached or maximum tolerated dose equivalent (MTDE) is identified. Cellular&#xD;
      therapeutic products such as BM-MNCS do not possess the same pharmacologic profile as small&#xD;
      molecule drugs, and thus, do not possess predictable metabolic activity and metabolite&#xD;
      production, as do traditional pharmaceuticals. This can make the identity of a maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose somewhat difficult. We are therefore using the term MTDE instead of MTD to&#xD;
      indicate a cell dosage that is consistent with clinical morbidity beyond obvious clinical&#xD;
      benefit. The characteristics identifying a MTDE could be any adverse event felt to be related&#xD;
      to the actual cell dosage or its escalation. Although unlikely, MTDE events could include&#xD;
      microembolic phenomena, hematoma at the injection site, obvious myocardial congestion or&#xD;
      ischemia at the injection site.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have documented CAD and depressed LV function (EF &lt;40%) that is felt to be&#xD;
             appropriately treated with surgical revascularization by the VA Salt Lake City Health&#xD;
             Care System Cardiothoracic Surgery team and in accordance with the published 2004&#xD;
             ACC/AHA Guideline Update for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery; specifically, in&#xD;
             accordance with the described indication for CABG in patients with Poor LV Function&#xD;
             (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Class I&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. CABG should be performed in patients with poor LV function who have significant left&#xD;
             main coronary artery stenosis. (Level of Evidence: B)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. CABG should be performed in patients with poor LV function who have left main&#xD;
             equivalent:&#xD;
&#xD;
             significant (greater than or equal to 70%) stenosis of the proximal LAD and proximal&#xD;
             left circumflex artery. (Level of Evidence: B)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. CABG should be performed in patients with poor LV function who have proximal LAD&#xD;
             stenosis with 2- or 3-vessel disease. (Level of Evidence: B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Class IIa&#xD;
&#xD;
        CABG may be performed in patients with poor LV function with significant viable&#xD;
        noncontracting, revascularizable myocardium and without any of the above anatomic patterns.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  NHYA/CCA Class I or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal cardiac wall segment on preoperative data&#xD;

             significant revascularizable viable myocardium. (Level of Evidence: B) Evidence of&#xD;
             intermittent ischemia is defined clinically by Cardiovascular Disease Classification&#xD;
             (see chart above). Objectively, this can be demonstrated by various modalities that&#xD;
             can demonstrate ischemic myocardium. Such modalities include SCA, Echo, CMRI, and&#xD;
