      Problem and Objectives: There is currently no pharmacological treatment for curing post&#xD;
      traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The investigators will test whether propranolol when given&#xD;
      immediately after trauma evocation is able to decrease the strength of the traumatic memory,&#xD;
      and by extension, the severity of PTSD symptoms associated with that memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The subjects will show a significant pre/post decrease in PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Those gains will be maintained at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Open pharmacological trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: On the first visit (V1), the subjects will describe their traumatic experience in&#xD;
      writing and will receive the propranolol. A script describing this experience will be&#xD;
      constructed to be used in the subsequent encounters to elicit the trauma memory. A week later&#xD;
      (V2), before receiving the propranolol, subjects will be asked to read aloud their trauma&#xD;
      script while imagining it as vividly as possible for 10 minutes. This weekly treatment will&#xD;
      be repeated 6 times (from V1 to V6). A total of 6 doses of propranolol will be given. A&#xD;
      self-report measure will be used to monitor improvement in PTSD symptomatology on the&#xD;
      following visits: V1, V4, V6, V7 and V8 (3 month follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses: A repeated measure ANOVA (pre-test, post-test, and 3-month follow-up)&#xD;
      using the PTSD symptom score will be conducted.. Three t-tests will be performed to examine&#xD;
      simple effects. The alpha level will be set at p = .05 (two-tailed). Fisher's exact test will&#xD;
      be used to examine whether Ss still meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Implications: If this treatment is effective, a randomized controlled trial will be&#xD;
      launched. This treatment has the potential to become the first pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      designed to cure PTSD.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18-65 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suffer from AZF-related PTSD (PCL score more than 44)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sign consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have health coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not diagnosed with current, chronic AZF-related PTSD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt; 18 or &gt; 65&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical condition that contraindicates the administration of propranolol, e.g.,&#xD;
             history of congestive heart failure, heart block, insulin-requiring diabetes, chronic&#xD;
             bronchitis, emphysema, or asthma. With regard to asthma, because many persons who say&#xD;
             they have had an asthma attack, especially as a child, may only have had hay fever,&#xD;
             another allergy, or another non-asthmatic episode, a blanket exclusion criterion may&#xD;
             be overly restrictive. Therefore, asthma attacks will only be exclusionary if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  occurred within the past ten years,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  occurred at any time in life if induced by a β-blocker, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  are currently being treated, regardless of the date of last occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cardiological consultation will be obtained as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous adverse reaction to, or non-compliance with, a β-blocker&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of medication that may involve potentially dangerous interactions with&#xD;
             propranolol, including, other β-blockers, antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers,&#xD;
             and potent P450 2D6 inhibitors, e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, miconazole, sulconazole,&#xD;
             metoclopramide, quinidine, ticlopidine, and ritonavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindicating psychiatric condition, including lifetime or current psychotic,&#xD;
             bipolar, melancholic, or substance dependence or abuse disorder; suicidality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initiation of, or change in, psychotropic medication within the previous two months.&#xD;
             For subjects receiving stable doses of pharmacotherapy, they and their providers will&#xD;
             be asked not to change the regimen except in clinically urgent circumstances; if this&#xD;
             becomes necessary, a decision will be made on a case-by-case basis with regard to&#xD;
             retaining the subject or terminating participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in any psychotherapy (other than strictly supportive). Subjects&#xD;
             will be asked not to initiate psychotherapy during the course of the proposed study&#xD;
             except in clinically urgent circumstances; if this becomes necessary, a decision will&#xD;
             be made on a case-by-case basis with regard to retaining the subject or terminating&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to understand the study's procedures, risks, and side effects, or to&#xD;
             otherwise give informed consent for participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Does not understand French&#xD;
