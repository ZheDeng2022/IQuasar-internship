      The objective of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of topiramate (250mg/day)&#xD;
      versus placebo in decreasing aggression and reducing alcohol consumption in patients with&#xD;
      borderline personality disorder (BPD) and alcohol dependence (AD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) affects about 2% of the American adult&#xD;
      population. It is a very serious psychiatric disorder that places heavy demands on mental&#xD;
      health resources. Behavior dysregulation (impulsivity, self-injurious acts, drinking or&#xD;
      aggressive behavior) is considered one of the main features of BPD and is associated with&#xD;
      significant clinical morbidity. Alcohol abuse is common among patients with BPD, and the&#xD;
      co-morbid rates of alcoholism in BPD patients are estimated to be 30%. It has been&#xD;
      hypothesized that alcohol misuse may be a manifestation of BPD's behavioral dysregulation.&#xD;
      Also, BPD and alcohol dependence (AD) share a common underlying neurobiology. The&#xD;
      co-occurrence of these disorders has been associated with increased rates of alcohol relapse,&#xD;
      impulsive behaviors, greater resistance to treatment, and suicidal behavior. Effective&#xD;
      treatment for patients with BPD and AD would result in markedly reduced health care costs and&#xD;
      a substantial reduction in human distress and suffering. Despite dramatic advances in the&#xD;
      treatment of BPD, to date, no single medication or types of medications have been uniquely&#xD;
      identified as effective in treating BPD. Studies treating patients with co-morbid BPD and AD&#xD;
      are expressly lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methodology: This is an 8-week double-blind outpatient clinical trial of&#xD;
      oral topiramate (250mg) vs placebo in individuals with BPD and AD. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at the West Haven, CT VA. Thirty men and women with a current diagnosis of BPD and&#xD;
      AD will be enrolled. The State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAEI) will be used to&#xD;
      assess 5 aspects of aggression: state anger, trait anger, anger expressed inwardly, anger&#xD;
      expressed outwardly, and anger control before and during treatment (weeks 0-8). The Timeline&#xD;
      Follow-Back (TLFB) method will be used to document the degree of daily alcohol consumption&#xD;
      before and during treatment (90 days before treatment, and weeks 0 - 8). Emergent side&#xD;
      effects will be assessed using the modified version of the Systematic Assessment for&#xD;
      Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE).&#xD;
