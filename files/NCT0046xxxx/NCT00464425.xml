  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus remains a significant medical problem after colorectal surgery that&#xD;
      adversely influences patients' recovery and prolongs hospital stay. In fact, a substantial&#xD;
      portion of the overall hospitalisation period after colorectal surgery is attributed to the&#xD;
      time it takes for ileus to resolve. Although laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been proven&#xD;
      to be associated with better short-term clinical outcomes including faster return of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal function than open surgery, the duration of postoperative ileus in the&#xD;
      laparoscopic arm is still reported to be as long as 4 days in most of the randomised trials.&#xD;
      Additional measures are thus necessary to further enhance the gastrointestinal recovery after&#xD;
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery in order to maximise its benefits, and acupuncture may be one&#xD;
      of the options. Acupuncture is widely accepted in China as well as throughout the world as an&#xD;
      effective treatment option for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting and&#xD;
      various functional gastrointestinal disorders. Its role in treating postoperative ileus,&#xD;
      however, is less clear, and data from the Chinese as well as the Western literature are&#xD;
      scarce. We therefore propose to carry out a prospective randomised sham-controlled pilot&#xD;
      study to assess the efficacy of electroacupuncture in treating postoperative ileus after&#xD;
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The acupoints relevant to the treatment of abdominal&#xD;
      distension and constipation, including Zusanli (stomach meridian ST-36), Sanyinjiao (spleen&#xD;
      meridian SP-6), Hegu (large intestine meridian LI-4), and Zhigou (triple energizer meridian&#xD;
      TE-6) will be used.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus remains a significant medical problem after colorectal surgery that&#xD;
      adversely influences patients' recovery and prolongs hospital stay. In fact, a substantial&#xD;
      portion of the overall hospitalisation period after colorectal surgery is attributed to the&#xD;
      time it takes for ileus to resolve. Different treatment modalities including thoracic&#xD;
      epidural analgesia, pharmacological therapy, early enteral feeding, and early mobilisation&#xD;
      have been attempted, but none has an established role as a specific remedy for postoperative&#xD;
      ileus. Although laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been proven to be associated with better&#xD;
      short-term clinical outcomes including faster return of gastrointestinal function than open&#xD;
      surgery, the duration of postoperative ileus in the laparoscopic arm is still reported to be&#xD;
      as long as 4 days (which is just about 1 day earlier than that in the open arm) in most of&#xD;
      the randomised trials. Additional measures are thus necessary to further enhance the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal recovery after laparoscopic colorectal surgery in order to maximise its&#xD;
      benefits, and acupuncture may be one of the options. Acupuncture is widely accepted in China&#xD;
      as well as throughout the world as an effective treatment option for the management of&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting and various functional gastrointestinal disorders. Its role&#xD;
      in treating postoperative ileus, however, is less clear, and data from the Chinese as well as&#xD;
      the Western literature are scarce. Besides, the heterogeneity of the study designs and flaws&#xD;
      in methodology of the reported studies have made interpretation of these data difficult.&#xD;
      Results of the present study can provide evidence-based clarification of the role of&#xD;
      acupuncture in treating postoperative ileus after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. If the&#xD;
      hypothesis is proven to be correct and substantiated by further studies, the incorporation of&#xD;
      electroacupuncture into any fast-track recovery programmes after laparoscopic, open, or even&#xD;
      emergency colorectal surgery should be considered. As laparoscopic colorectal surgery has&#xD;
      been shown to have higher direct cost than the open counterpart, a faster postoperative&#xD;
      recovery may help to reduce the financial burden to the hospital and improve the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled into the study if all the inclusion and exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      satisfied after the laparoscopic surgery. Randomisation will be done shortly after surgery.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to receive either electroacupuncture (EA group), sham acupuncture&#xD;
      (SA group), or no acupuncture (NA group). The medical acupuncturist is the only individual&#xD;
      who is aware of the treatment allocation; patients of the EA and SA groups are blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment. The patients randomised to the EA and SA groups will undergo 1 session of&#xD;
      acupuncture daily from postoperative day 1 till day 4. Adverse events associated with&#xD;
      acupuncture including bleeding, dizziness, excessive pain, and allergic reaction will be&#xD;
      closely monitored. The acupuncture needle will be immediately withdrawn if these events&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative management of all patients will be standardised. Pethidine 1mg/kg as&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia will be given every 4-hourly on demand. Early ambulation will be&#xD;
      encouraged. Oral feeding will be resumed as soon as gastrointestinal function returns&#xD;
      clinically (no nausea or vomiting, no abdominal distension, passage of flatus or stool). No&#xD;
      gum chewing will be allowed. Patients will be discharged when they tolerate diet and are&#xD;
      fully ambulatory.&#xD;
