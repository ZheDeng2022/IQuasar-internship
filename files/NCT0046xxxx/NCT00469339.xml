  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine what methods work best for encouraging Mexican-American family&#xD;
      members to talk about their risk for diabetes, heart disease, breast cancer and colon cancer.&#xD;
      Within the Mexican-American community, the family culture provides an important setting in&#xD;
      which individuals interpret and share their health information and formulate strategies to&#xD;
      engage in health-promoting behaviors. The information from the study will be used to design&#xD;
      risk communication approaches for Mexican-American households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of households with at least three adults 18 to 70 years of age who are part of the&#xD;
      existing Mexican-American households recruited by the University of Texas M.D. Anderson&#xD;
      Cancer Center may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are interviewed about their medical history, family history of disease, health&#xD;
      behaviors, beliefs about disease and disease risk, experiences living in the United States,&#xD;
      and relationships with family members and close friends. They are then provided information&#xD;
      about their family risk for diabetes, heart disease, breast cancer and colon cancer, based on&#xD;
      the information they provided in the interview. Two additional interviews are conducted over&#xD;
      the telephone that include questions about how the participants communicate with family&#xD;
      members about their risk and health behaviors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current project aims to understand the mechanisms underlying communications about&#xD;
      familial risk for common, complex diseases and the development of strategies by Mexican&#xD;
      American families to address this risk. For the Mexican American community, the family&#xD;
      culture provides an important setting within which individuals will interpret their health&#xD;
      information, share health information, and formulate strategies to engage in health promoting&#xD;
      behaviors. This family culture can be defined by the family social structure, the degree of&#xD;
      acculturation represented by household members, as well as socio-economic factors.&#xD;
      Participants for the current project will be recruited from an ongoing population-based&#xD;
      cohort of Mexican American households initiated by the Department of Epidemiology at the&#xD;
      University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC). At least three adults, two of which&#xD;
      are biological relatives, living within the same residence from 160 multigenerational Mexican&#xD;
      American households will participate in this study. Medical risk information (feedback) will&#xD;
      be provided to participants based upon family history information that they provide about&#xD;
      four complex diseases: diabetes, heart disease, breast cancer and colon cancer. The feedback&#xD;
      will be randomized in two ways varying who within the family is provided the feedback&#xD;
      (Receiver of the Feedback) and what information is provided (Content of Feedback). The data&#xD;
      will allow us to examine whether the family-centered feedback approach (where all&#xD;
      participating family members receive feedback), rather than the individual-focused feedback&#xD;
      approach (where only one participating family member receives feedback), encourages&#xD;
      communications regarding disease risk among family members. The medical risk feedback will&#xD;
      also be randomized as to whether they receive disease risk information only (predisposing&#xD;
      risk feedback) or disease risk information coupled with personalized recommendations for&#xD;
      behavior change to reduce risks (predisposing plus enabling feedback). These data will allow&#xD;
      us to examine the impact of the content of risk feedback based on the CDC s family health&#xD;
      history tool Family Healthware on beliefs concerning the underlying causes and&#xD;
      controllability of common diseases. Cross comparisons between the data obtained from who&#xD;
      receives the medical risk information and the content of that information will help in&#xD;
      understanding the role of beliefs about disease and communication about family risk for&#xD;
      disease in the development of shared perceptions of risk and strategies to adopt health&#xD;
      promoting behaviors within the family. The role of the familial and cultural context in the&#xD;
      communication and strategy development process will also be investigated.&#xD;
