  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will identify symptoms and other characteristics of Parkinson s disease that may&#xD;
      be associated with changes in a gene called leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Changes in&#xD;
      this gene have been found in patients with and without a family history of Parkinson s&#xD;
      disease. This study will examine people with Parkinson s disease to try to identify how&#xD;
      symptoms develop over time. First-degree relatives of patients will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age or older with Parkinson s disease or people who have a first-degree&#xD;
      relative with Parkinson s disease may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants visit the NIH Clinical Center every other year for 10 years for some or all of&#xD;
      the procedures listed below. Each visit requires 3-4 days of testing, which may be done on an&#xD;
      inpatient or outpatient basis. Telephone interviews are conducted during the alternate years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smell testing: Subjects are asked to identify 40 different scents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensory testing: Objects with grooves and ridges are touched to subjects fingertips.&#xD;
           With their eyes closed, the subjects are asked to say which way the grooves and ridges&#xD;
           run on the objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological evaluation: Subjects are asked about their memory and thinking and&#xD;
           may be asked to complete some pen and paper tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric evaluation: Subjects are asked about psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety&#xD;
           and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood drawing: Blood is drawn through a needle in the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans of the brain: MRI uses a strong magnetic field&#xD;
           and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. During the test, subjects&#xD;
           lie on a table that can slide in and out of the MRI scanner (a metal cylinder surrounded&#xD;
           by a strong magnetic field). The procedure lasts about 30 minutes, during which the&#xD;
           subjects may be asked to lie still for up to 5 minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial sonography (TCS): TCS uses sound waves to obtain images of the brain.&#xD;
           Subjects lie on their back and an ultrasound device is moved around the scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep study (1-2 night hospital admission): Subjects brain waves are recorded during&#xD;
           sleep using electroencephalography (EEG). Their breathing rate, pulse and oxygen level&#xD;
           are also monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire: Subjects complete several questionnaires designed to obtain information&#xD;
           on symptoms or traits that have been reported to be associated with Parkinson s disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Parkinson s disease is a common neurological condition that was originally thought to develop&#xD;
      from environmental factors. More recently, genetic factors have been implicated. In this&#xD;
      study, we are interested in studying the phenotypic presentation of patients with Parkinson s&#xD;
      disease due to a specific defect in a gene called the Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 gene&#xD;
      (LRRK2) found in some patients with Parkinson s disease. In addition, we plan to study family&#xD;
      members whose genetic status is unknown to develop a pre-clinical description of Parkinson s&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a pre-clinical description in first-degree family members of patients with&#xD;
           Parkinson s disease who have the LRRK2 mutation. The first-degree relative may or may&#xD;
           not carry the LRRK2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To phenotypically characterize Parkinson s disease patients who have the LRRK2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 adult subjects including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with a diagnosis of PD due to LRRK2 mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. First degree family members of patients with PD who have the LRRK2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a longitudinal prospective natural history study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-clinical signs of disease in first degree relatives of Parkinson s disease patients&#xD;
           who have the LRRK2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterization of a pre-clinical phenotype in first degree relatives of LRRK2 positive&#xD;
           Parkinson s disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Progression of Parkinson s disease patients who have the LRRK2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Genotypic characterization of first-degree relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. RNA expression profile determination comparing mutation carriers to non-mutation&#xD;
           carriers in search for early biomarkers&#xD;
