  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether statines (rosuva- and pravastatin) induce tubular&#xD;
      proteinuria.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proximal tubular cells of the kidney are responsible for reabsorption of proteins from&#xD;
      the tubular lumen. In a study using Opossum kidney (OK) cells, receptor-mediated protein&#xD;
      endocytosis was reduced by statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA)&#xD;
      reductase, which are widely used for therapeutic reduction of plasma cholesterol levels (1).&#xD;
      In a subsequent in vitro study protein endocytosis in human mixed proximal/distal kidney&#xD;
      tubular cells was investigated in the presence and absence of statins to explore the possible&#xD;
      clinical relevance of the observations in OK cells (2). The uptake of FITC-labeled albumin in&#xD;
      these cultures occurred selectively into proximal tubular cells while it was absent in distal&#xD;
      tubular/collecting duct cells. Three statins (simvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin)&#xD;
      significantly inhibited the uptake of protein in a concentration-dependent way. This&#xD;
      inhibitory effect of statins could be prevented by the co-addition of mevalonate, the product&#xD;
      of HMG-CoA reductase. This effect was not the result of a statin-induced cytotoxicity since&#xD;
      cell-viability was unaffected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data suggest that statins have the potential to inhibit albumin uptake by the human&#xD;
      proximal nephron as a result of inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in the proximal tubule cells.&#xD;
      A reduced prenylation of some proteins critically involved in endocytosis has been put&#xD;
      forward as the underlying mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing these data it has been suggested that the occurrence of proteinuria in some patients&#xD;
      treated with high statin doses is the result of a reduced tubular reabsorption/endocytosis of&#xD;
      normally filtered proteins. To further explore the clinical relevance of such a mechanism,&#xD;
      the composition of the urinary proteome under statin treatment will be investigated in normal&#xD;
      healthy volunteers by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis based proteomics analysis.&#xD;
