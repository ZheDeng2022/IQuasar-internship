      -  To assess the efficacy of medial-wedge insole in valgus knee osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesized that medial-wedged insoles are biomechanically effective and should&#xD;
           reduce lateral compartment loading in persons with valgus knee osteoarthritis with a&#xD;
           consequent symptomatic improvement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thirty females fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis with bilateral valgus deformity greater than or equal to 8° were consecutively&#xD;
      will be selected from the Rheumatology Outpatient Clinic of University of São Paulo.&#xD;
      Radiographic grading of OA was defined according to Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) and analyzed&#xD;
      blind by the same rheumatologist. Inclusion criteria were knee osteoarthritis with lateral&#xD;
      compartment involvement detected on X-Ray (KL class II or more); absence or minimal (KL class&#xD;
      0 or I) for medial compartment involvement; and pain on movement &gt; 2 measured by Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were: body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40, scoliosis, lower limbs length difference&#xD;
      exceeding 1 cm, knee surgery, hallux rigidus, previous history of rheumatologic disease&#xD;
      (rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissue disease, microcrystalline arthropathy, and&#xD;
      soronegative arthropathy), soft tissue involvement (anserine, patellar, and calcaneal&#xD;
      tendinopathy), and foot/lower leg symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid infiltrations were not allowed 3 and 6 months prior to&#xD;
      entry, respectively. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesics or slow action&#xD;
      drugs (DMARDs) were allowed if prescribed at least four weeks and eight weeks before entry&#xD;
      and remained unchanged throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee and all patients signed informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned into 2 groups: CASES with 16 patients and CONTROLS with&#xD;
      fourteen patients. The CASES wore 8 mm high, medial-wedged insoles for the hind foot inserted&#xD;
      into a new shoe for 8 weeks. The CONTROLS will use an insole resembling the former group,&#xD;
      only without raised wedges (FIGURE 1-B) for 8 weeks. Patients of both groups will receive the&#xD;
      same new shoe and were blind to the insole use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethylene-vinyl-acetate (EVA - density 50) insoles were provided by the AACD Institute&#xD;
      (Handicapped Child Care Association). A commercial neoprene with elastic banding will be used&#xD;
      for ankle support. Both groups will use similar standard shoes supplied by the hospital. Each&#xD;
      participant will be instructed to use the splints (shoes and elastic banding) for 3 to 6&#xD;
      hours daily. The correct use of the splints will be checked every two weeks. Undesirable&#xD;
      side-effects will be recorded at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, disease duration, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and sedentarism (only daily&#xD;
      activities) will be recorded for all patients at entry. In order to assess symptoms, Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS) will be used for night pain, pain at rest and on movement. Lequesne index&#xD;
      score and the WOMAC questionnaire will be applied at baseline and after 8 weeks by a blinded&#xD;
      examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antero-posterior conventional X-ray of knees and ankles will be performed under monopodalic&#xD;
      load with and without insoles in order to measure femorotibial, talocalcaneal, and talus tilt&#xD;
      angles. Femorotibial angle is formed by the intersection of femur and tibia axes, obtained&#xD;
      through lines drawn at distal one-third of the femur and proximal one-third of the tibia,&#xD;
      both equidistant from external limits of the cortical bones. Talocalcaneal angle is formed by&#xD;
      a first line connecting the midpoints between the trochanter talus to the lateral and medial&#xD;
      malleoli, and a second line perpendicular to the floor identified by inferior border of&#xD;
      X-ray. Tilt angle of talus is formed by a line parallel to floor and the tilt of the&#xD;
      trochanter talus. All angles will be measured blind by the same rheumatologist.&#xD;
