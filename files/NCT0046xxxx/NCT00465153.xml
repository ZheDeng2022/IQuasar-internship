  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of muscle mass and functional ability is a major concern for older individuals. Aging is&#xD;
      associated with increased inflammation caused by release of hormone-like compounds termed&#xD;
      &quot;cytokines&quot; which are involved in muscle protein degradation. Diets rich in ω-3 fatty acids&#xD;
      decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, possibly by inhibiting production of&#xD;
      lipids involved in cytokine synthesis. Our purpose is to assess the effect of dietary&#xD;
      supplementation with an ω-3 fatty acid, α-linolenic acid (ALA) commonly found in flaxseed,&#xD;
      combined with resistance training on pro-inflammatory cytokines, strength, and muscle mass in&#xD;
      older adults. Progressive resistance training is considered to be the standard for increasing&#xD;
      strength and muscle mass in older adults. We hypothesize that combining the two interventions&#xD;
      will improve strength and muscle mass more than resistance training alone by modulating the&#xD;
      inflammatory process associated with aging. Our proposed research will compare older&#xD;
      individuals supplementing with ALA and placebo during a resistance training program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim is to determine the effect of progressive resistance training and&#xD;
      α-linolenic acid supplementation for decreasing markers of inflammation and improving muscle&#xD;
      mass and strength in older adults. This will be done by comparing older adults who will&#xD;
      participate in the same resistance training program while supplementing their diet with&#xD;
      either α-linolenic acid or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of this research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance training combined with α-linolenic acid supplementation will decrease the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and&#xD;
      increase strength and muscle mass more than resistance training and placebo supplementation&#xD;
      in older individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty untrained males and females over 60 years of age will be recruited by newspaper ads.&#xD;
      Subjects will be matched for sex and age and randomly assigned to supplement with 15 g/day&#xD;
      α-linolenic acid (ALA) from flaxseed oil or placebo (corn oil) while participating in&#xD;
      resistance training, 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The 15 g dose was chosen because it was&#xD;
      effective for reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines in healthy adults over 4 weeks (Caughey et&#xD;
      al., 1996). Twelve weeks of resistance training was chosen because it is effective for&#xD;
      increasing muscle mass and strength in older adults (Chrusch et al., 2001). Our sample size&#xD;
      of 30 subjects per group will be sufficient for detecting the expected changes in cytokines&#xD;
      (Caughey et al., 1996) with a power of 80% and alpha level of 0.05. The primary dependent&#xD;
      variables will be the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. Secondary dependent&#xD;
      variables are chest press and leg press strength, lean tissue mass, and muscle thickness. A 2&#xD;
      (groups) x 2 (time, baseline and 12 weeks) ANOVA with repeated measures on the 2nd factor,&#xD;
      will be used for analyses with alpha level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Exercise Training: The exercise training will consist of a progressive&#xD;
      resistance training program designed to increase skeletal muscle hypertrophy by having&#xD;
      participants complete 12 different machine-based resistance exercises. The exercises will&#xD;
      include: chest press, shoulder press, lat pulldown, bicep curl, triceps extension, leg press,&#xD;
      knee flexion, knee extension, hip flexion/extension, and hip abduction/adduction. The&#xD;
      subjects will complete between 3-4 sets of 6-12 repetitions at intensities between 65-80% of&#xD;
      their 1 repetition maximum in a progressively overloaded fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical Measures: Assessment of markers of inflammation will be done by biochemical blood&#xD;
      analysis at baseline and after 12 weeks supplementation combined with resistance training.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn after an overnight night fast in the morning to account for changes due&#xD;
      to diurnal variation. Approximately 10 mL of blood will be drawn from the antecubital vein of&#xD;
      the arm. Serum will be assessed for the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha using ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitness Testing: One repetition maximum (RM) strength tests will be done using chest press&#xD;
      and leg press at baseline and 12 weeks. Subjects will complete a standardized warm-up of&#xD;
      cycling and stretching before the strength test. The testing protocol will allow subjects to&#xD;
      become familiar with the movement patterns of the resistance training machines before&#xD;
      initiating the strength testing trials. Subjects will be gradually progressed to the maximal&#xD;
      load that they can lift for the chest press and leg press. Once the subject is unable to&#xD;
      complete a full repetition, the last successful attempt will be recorded as their 1RM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition: Lean tissue and fat mass will be assessed by dual energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry, and muscle thickness of the extensors and flexors of the elbows and knees&#xD;
      will be determined by ultrasound at baseline and 12 weeks.&#xD;
