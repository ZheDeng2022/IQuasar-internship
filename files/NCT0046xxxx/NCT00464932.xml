      This study, a new immunomodulatory therapy of COPD with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)&#xD;
      was evaluated. Based on preliminary unpublished clinical and experimental results, the course&#xD;
      of disease under VIP treatment and the molecular mechanisms involved were assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      34 patients with severe COPD were treated either with VIP inhalation in addition to&#xD;
      conventional therapy or inhalation of placebo plus conventional therapy for a period of 3&#xD;
      months. The trial was conducted as a double blind, comparative study with two parallel&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive bronchitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, which&#xD;
      affects as many as 8% of individuals in industrialized nations. There is an increase in the&#xD;
      number of woman and men suffering from COPD. Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale are&#xD;
      common sequelae of chronic airflow obstruction, but the precise mechanisms of increased&#xD;
      vascular resistance are unclear. Potential causes of pulmo-nary hypertension in COPD include&#xD;
      emphysematous destruction of the capillary bed, remodeling of pulmonary vessels and hypoxic&#xD;
      pulmonary vasoconstriction. This proposal, a new immunomodulatory therapy of COPD with&#xD;
      vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was evaluated. Based on preliminary unpublished clinical&#xD;
      and experimental results, the course of disease under VIP treatment and the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms involved were assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      34 patients with severe COPD were treated either with VIP inhalation in addition to&#xD;
      conventional therapy or inhalation of placebo plus conventional therapy for a period of 3&#xD;
      months. The trial was conducted as a double blind, comparative study with two parallel&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of acute infection or acute worsening of the disease due to other conditions,&#xD;
      2 transbronchial biopsies were collected before treatment, and after 3 months of treatÂ¬ment&#xD;
      for assessment of the regulation of a) the immune response, b) the extracellular matrix and&#xD;
      c) the epithelial growth. This assessment will be performed in fully equipped and experienced&#xD;
      laboratories at the University of Vienna.&#xD;
