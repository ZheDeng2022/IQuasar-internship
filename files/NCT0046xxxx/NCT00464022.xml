    <textblock>
      Double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is a novel endoscopic procedure for visualising the entire&#xD;
      small bowel. In any GI endoscopy procedure it is mandatory to insufflate gas into the bowel&#xD;
      to secure good visualisation. All endoscopes used for GI endoscopy provide a gas insufflation&#xD;
      unit. Currently, air is used for this purpose in more than 90% of centres throughout the&#xD;
      world. The use of air, however, is far from ideal to use for insufflation in GI endoscopy.&#xD;
      After GI endoscopy, significant amounts of air are usually retained in the bowel segment&#xD;
      inspected (5). This air has to pass the GI tract and exit physiologically through the rectum.&#xD;
      Thus, abdominal pain and discomfort during and after the examination due to the retention of&#xD;
      air has been shown to be very common during and after endoscopic procedures (5-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbon dioxide gas (CO2), unlike air, is rapidly absorbed from the bowel. Within minutes,&#xD;
      several litres of CO2 can be absorbed from the GI tract. The use of CO2 has been shown to&#xD;
      result in more comfortable examinations in both colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy in&#xD;
      several randomised trials (6-9). In these studies, CO2 insufflation almost completely reduced&#xD;
      procedure-related pain and discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no research has been performed investigating the use of CO2 in DBE. DBE is&#xD;
      a long-lasting procedure (mean examination time 75 minutes (4)). Large volumes of air are&#xD;
      insufflated during the procedure, leading to significant distension of the small bowel during&#xD;
      and after the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main technical difficulties in DBE is the formation of small bowel loops and scarp&#xD;
      angels during deep intubation of the endoscope. These loops and angels are the major&#xD;
      restriction to deep intubation of the endoscope. Loops and scarp angels are more pronounced&#xD;
      in air-distended bowel segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to examine whether CO2 insufflation leads to a reduction of&#xD;
      abdominal pain in DBE patients. Furthermore, we want to investigate if CO2 insufflation&#xD;
      facilities a deeper intubation of the endoscope and thus a more complete examination of the&#xD;
      small bowel mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a two-centre randomised controlled trial. Randomisation to the two&#xD;
      treatment groups (CO2 or air insufflation) is performed on basis of the individual&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background The small bowel has been a large blind spot for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy&#xD;
      as, until recently, the small bowel was not accessible with conventional endosocopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is a novel endoscopic procedure for visualising the entire&#xD;
      small bowel. The method was first described by Yamamoto et al. and May et al in 2001 and&#xD;
      2003, respectively (1,2). Since then, DBE has spread to a rising number of centres around the&#xD;
      world. Both endoscopic diagnosis (e.g. by biopsy) and treatment can be easily performed using&#xD;
      DBE. The first larger series, recently published, demonstrate that DBE is feasible in scoping&#xD;
      large parts of the small bowel, with total small intubation possible in about 30-40% of cases&#xD;
      (3,4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any GI endoscopy procedure it is mandatory to insufflate gas into the bowel to secure good&#xD;
      visualisation. All endoscopes used for GI endoscopy provide a gas insufflation unit. The gas&#xD;
      is pumped on demand into the area examined by the endoscopist via a gas tube incorporated in&#xD;
      the endoscope. Currently, air is used for this purpose in more than 90% of centres throughout&#xD;
      the world. The use of air, however, is far from ideal to use for insufflation in GI&#xD;
      endoscopy. After GI endoscopy, significant amounts of air are usually retained in the bowel&#xD;
      segment inspected (5). This air has to pass the GI tract and exit physiologically through the&#xD;
      rectum. Thus, abdominal pain and discomfort during and after the examination due to the&#xD;
      retention of air has been shown to be very common during and after endoscopic procedures&#xD;
      (5-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbon dioxide gas (CO2), unlike air, is rapidly absorbed from the bowel. Within minutes,&#xD;
      several litres of CO2 can be absorbed from the GI tract. The use of CO2 has been shown to&#xD;
      result in more comfortable examinations in both colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy in&#xD;
      several randomised trials (6-9). In these studies, CO2 insufflation almost completely reduced&#xD;
      procedure-related pain and discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no research has been performed investigating the use of CO2 in DBE. DBE is&#xD;
      a long-lasting procedure (mean examination time 75 minutes (4)). Large volumes of air are&#xD;
      insufflated during the procedure, leading to significant distension of the small bowel during&#xD;
      and after the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main technical difficulties in DBE is the formation of small bowel loops and scarp&#xD;
      angels during deep intubation of the endoscope. These loops and angels are the major&#xD;
      restriction to deep intubation of the endoscope. Loops and scarp angels are more pronounced&#xD;
      in air-distended bowel segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to examine whether CO2 insufflation leads to a reduction of&#xD;
      abdominal pain in DBE patients. Furthermore, we want to investigate if CO2 insufflation&#xD;
      facilities a deeper intubation of the endoscope and thus a more complete examination of the&#xD;
      small bowel mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The use of CO2 in DBE leads to a reduction in abdominal pain for the patient when&#xD;
           compared with the use of air.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The use of CO2 in DBE leads to deeper intubation when compared to air insufflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design The study is designed as a two-centre randomised controlled trial. The&#xD;
      participating centres are Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway and University&#xD;
      Hospital Muenster, Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation to the two treatment groups (CO2 or air insufflation) is performed on basis of&#xD;
      the individual participant. Equally large groups are randomised, using block randomisation&#xD;
      (blocks of six patients) for each of the participating centres. Randomisation (using SPSS&#xD;
      statistical software package) is performed by an independent researcher, who is not part of&#xD;
      the DBE team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals eligible for inclusion are patients referred for DBE at the trial centres who do&#xD;
      not fulfil one of the following exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age under 16 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to understand information for participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refusal of participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible individuals are informed about the nature of the study. All individuals provide&#xD;
      written informed consent before entering the trial. Patients who do not wish to participate&#xD;
      in the present trial are treated according to standard procedures (using air insufflation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures are performed by experienced endoscopists. Both patients and endoscopists are&#xD;
      blinded with regard to type of gas used for any particular patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation is performed according to current standards at the centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-balloon procedure DBE is performed using the DBE endoscope system (Fujinon Inc,&#xD;
      Japan), as described in the literature (1-4). The DBE endoscope consist of a 200-cm long&#xD;
      video endoscope with an outer diameter of 8.5 mm and a flexible overtube with a length of 145&#xD;
      cm and an outer diameter of 12 mm. Latex balloons are attached to both the endoscope and the&#xD;
      overtube. These balloons are inflated and deflated during insertion, as described elsewhere&#xD;
      in detail (1,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gas insufflation CO2 is insufflated using Fujinons equipment (or other, to be specified) Air&#xD;
      is insufflated using the ordinary air inlet system of the endoscope rack. The air inlet&#xD;
      button is hidden from the view of the endoscopist to prevent unblinding (technical details to&#xD;
      be specified in cooperation with company).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of pain and discomfort A questionnaire is used to classify patient pain during and&#xD;
      after the procedure. Visual analogue scales (100-mm) are used to quantify abdominal pain&#xD;
      during the examination and at 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours after the procedure, as validated in&#xD;
      recent studies (7,8). The questionnaire is given to every participant after the procedure, to&#xD;
      be filled in the next day, and mailed back to the respective trial centre using prepaid&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of ERCP examination parameters All procedure parameters of interest (e.g.&#xD;
      duration, depth of insertion, use of sedatives) are registered by the endoscopist immediately&#xD;
      after the examination using the existing GI lab databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The regional ethics committees of the participating centres will be asked for approval&#xD;
      of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis A 15% reduction in mean pain score on VAS is considered to be clinically&#xD;
      important to detect. There are no studies available regarding this outcome in DBE. Therefore,&#xD;
      pilot study will be performed with 20 included patients in every group (air/CO2). The results&#xD;
      of the pilot study will estimate the standard deviation needed to calculate power and thus&#xD;
      size of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ownership Data are owned by the respective centres. Publication of the study results is&#xD;
      planned in a peer-reviewed journal. Michael Bretthauer and Dirk Domagk will co-ordinate study&#xD;
      design, data generation and analysis and a first manuscript draft. Michael Bretthauer and&#xD;
      Dirk Domagk will be the first authors of the planned publication, the other members of the&#xD;
      study groups will be co-authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Budget All procedures in the present study are performed in ordinary patients, with ordinary&#xD;
      staff and endoscopists. Therefore, no extra costs occur for personal. For the purpose of the&#xD;
      present study, however, some technical equipment has to be purchased (to be specified).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial funding is needed for meetings of the study group and prepaid envelopes.&#xD;

      Dear patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are hereby kindly invited to participate in a research study while undergoing your&#xD;
      planned endoscopic investigation of the small bowel (DBE, double balloon enteroscopy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this examination, it is common practice to insufflate gas into the small bowel to&#xD;
      provide the examiner with an adequate view. At the vast majority of hospitals around the&#xD;
      world, ordinary room air is used for insufflation. However, the insufflated air can produce&#xD;
      pain and abdominal discomfort for patients during and in the hours after the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence that the use of carbon dioxide gas (CO2) instead of air can reduce&#xD;
      abdominal pain after examination. In this study, we would like to find out if this is true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be divided by random into a group that receives CO2 during the DBE&#xD;
      examination and one group that receives air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the endoscopist and you as a patient do not know which gas is being used. Only the&#xD;
      endoscopy assistant knows the type of gas used during your examination. After the&#xD;
      examination, you will receive a short questionnaire about any complaints or discomfort, which&#xD;
      we would like to ask you to fill in at home and mail back to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you decide not to participate in the study, your examination will be performed with the&#xD;
      use of air insufflation (standard method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study has been approved by the ethics committee. All information will be treated&#xD;
      strictly confidential and only for research purposes within this study. Participation is free&#xD;
      of charge and not mandatory. You may decline your participation at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yours sincerely&#xD;
