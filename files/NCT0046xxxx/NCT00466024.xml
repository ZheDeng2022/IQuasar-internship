  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of a&#xD;
      combination of HEPA room air cleaners plus an ETS reduction behavior training as compared to&#xD;
      either HEPA air cleaners plus standard asthma education or delayed HEPA air cleaners and&#xD;
      standard asthma education (control group).&#xD;

      150 children aged 6-12 years who reside in Baltimore and have a smoker in the household are&#xD;
      to be enrolled in this study. All children will be randomized into three groups: HEPA air&#xD;
      cleaners plus ETS/Indoor particulate behavior management, HEPA air cleaners and a standard&#xD;
      asthma education and a standard asthma education group with delayed HEPA filter use. The HEPA&#xD;
      air cleaner plus ETS/Indoor particulate behavior management intervention group will receive&#xD;
      four home visits by a health coach to assess motivation for parental behavior change and then&#xD;
      assist the parent to reduce/eliminate their child's exposure to ETS in the home. The&#xD;
      intervention is based on the social cognitive theory that utilizes behavior modification&#xD;
      techniques (e.g., modeling, reinforcement, self-monitoring, feedback and rehearsal) to change&#xD;
      health behaviors. Families in this group and the HEPA air cleaner only group will receive two&#xD;
      HEPA air cleaners to use over the 6-month follow-up period and three home visits for standard&#xD;
      asthma education. Use of air cleaners will be electronically monitored to determine level or&#xD;
      &quot;dose&quot; of air cleaning used by families. The standard asthma education group (delayed HEPA&#xD;
      Filter group) will receive three home visits to deliver basic asthma education. All children&#xD;
      receive a baseline home inspection, 7-day home PM exposure monitoring, home dust allergen&#xD;
      collection, skin testing, urine cotinine, spirometry, serum eosinophilia and exhaled NO&#xD;
      testing. Caregivers of each child will be interviewed at baseline and at the 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up regarding ETS reduction behaviors in the home, symptom frequency, asthma control,&#xD;
      other environmental exposures and health care utilization outcomes. The primary outcome for&#xD;
      this study is reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 over the 6 month follow-up. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include ETS reduction behavior change (i.e. smoker is smoking outside of home, child not&#xD;
      sitting with smoker, reduction in number of household smokers), symptom free days and health&#xD;
      care utilization measures. If successful, this intervention could have significant clinical&#xD;
      and public health applications for pediatric asthma management in children with persistent&#xD;
      asthma and high ETS home exposure.&#xD;
