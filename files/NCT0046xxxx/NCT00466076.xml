  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the project is to investigate in eyes with dry AMD, the efficacy and safety as&#xD;
      preventive therapy of the immunomodulatory substance named copaxone which had been proven as&#xD;
      safe and effective agent for a neurodegenerative disease, in arresting the progression as&#xD;
      well as the conversion of dry AMD to wet AMD. The hypothesis that the immunomodulatory agent&#xD;
      copaxone proven for a neurodegenerative disease may work in the eye is revolutionary and may&#xD;
      open a new avenue of preventive treatment for the disease which is the major cause of legal&#xD;
      blindness in the industrial world&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The formation of insoluble extracellular deposits consisting of misfolded, aggregated protein&#xD;
      is the hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is&#xD;
      a degenerative disease in the eye associated with extracellur deposits named drusen. Recent&#xD;
      evidence suggests that drusen formation and AMD share some similarities with another&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease named Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is associated with amyloid&#xD;
      deposits. AMD and AD are strongly correlated with advancing age and the formation of amyloid&#xD;
      deposits. In addition, inflammatory mediators and in particular activated microglia are&#xD;
      present in amyloid deposits as well as in drusen, suggesting a possible common role for the&#xD;
      inflammatory pathway in AMD and amyloid diseases. Moreover, Ambati et al described a new&#xD;
      model of AMD in transgenic mice when an absence of normally functioning macrophages led to&#xD;
      the development of clinical AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Michal Schwartz and her group have recently shown that aggregated b-amyloid (Ab) induces&#xD;
      microglia to become cytotoxic and block neurogenesis from adult rodent neural progenitor&#xD;
      cells (NPCs). IL-4, reversed the impediment, attenuated TNF-a production and overcame&#xD;
      blockage of insulin like growth factor (IGF)-I production caused by Ab. The significance of&#xD;
      microglia for in-vivo neural cell renewal was demonstrated by enhanced neurogenesis in the&#xD;
      rat dentate gyrus after injection of IL-4-activated microglia intracerebroventricularly and&#xD;
      by the presence of IGF-I-expressing microglia in the dentate gyrus of rats kept in an&#xD;
      enriched environment or in the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Using&#xD;
      double-transgenic mice expressing mutant human genes encoding presenilin 1 and chimeric&#xD;
      mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (mice Alzheimer's disease model), the group of Michal&#xD;
      Schwartz showed that modulation of microglia into dendritic-like cells, achieved by a T&#xD;
      cell-based vaccination with Copolymer-1 (Copaxone), resulted in reduction of cognitive&#xD;
      decline, elimination of plaque formation, and induction of neuronal survival and&#xD;
      neurogenesis. These results introduce a new microglia phenotype as necessary players in&#xD;
      fighting off neurodegenerative conditions such as AD and AMD.&#xD;
