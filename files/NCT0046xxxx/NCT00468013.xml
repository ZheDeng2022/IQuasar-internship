      In this study 60 people with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) will receive&#xD;
      either a 6-session resilience skill building intervention provided fully online or a weekly&#xD;
      computerized journaling assignment. Both programs can be completed from home. Participants&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires both before and after the intervention and changes in symptoms,&#xD;
      mood and satisfaction with life will be assessed.&#xD;

      SUBJECTS: Sixty patients between the ages of 18 and 80 will be recruited from primary care&#xD;
      clinics affiliated with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey - Robert Wood&#xD;
      Johnson Medical School (UMDNJ-RWJMS). Qualified patients will be primary care patients who&#xD;
      meet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: Patients between the ages of 18 and 75&#xD;
      seeking medical care for physical symptoms (i.e., persistent fatigue, pain complaints, and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal, cardiovascular or musculoskeletal symptoms). No major medical illness to&#xD;
      explain symptom(s) is found after detailed physical and laboratory assessment. Patients with&#xD;
      common disorders such as hypertension, asthma, diabetes, low back strain, etc., will be&#xD;
      included if in the opinion of the physician the presenting physical symptoms are not due to&#xD;
      the underlying disorder. In order to enter the study, patients must meet criteria for at&#xD;
      least 4 medically unexplained symptoms out of the 42 somatic symptoms listed in the Composite&#xD;
      International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) rated as currently present if males and at least 6&#xD;
      symptoms if females (Escobar's abridged criteria). Patients without ready access to a&#xD;
      computer and the Internet will be excluded from participating. Also excluded will be&#xD;
      individuals with life threatening medical illness, communicative disorder, lack of fluency in&#xD;
      English, illiteracy, and major psychiatric conditions including psychoses, bipolar disorder,&#xD;
      and alcohol or drug abuse. Patients will be required to add no medications to their regimen&#xD;
      during the study period (approximately 6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE ASSESSMENT. After reading and signing the informed consent, all participants will&#xD;
      complete a baseline assessment consisting of questionnaires and a measure delivered by&#xD;
      structured interview. Questionnaires will include the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ),&#xD;
      Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS), the PRIME-MD Somatic Symptoms Scale only&#xD;
      (SSS), Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and a&#xD;
      demographics questionnaire. The structured interview will consist of the Composite&#xD;
      International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES: Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups. The psychological resilience&#xD;
      building group's exercises will be posted on a state-of-the-art website known as &quot;Authentic&#xD;
      Happiness&quot;. Participants will be provided with the web address and shown how to access the&#xD;
      site and the Research Portal where the 6 exercises that are the focus in this and other&#xD;
      ongoing studies can be found. The journaling group will be instructed to write weekly for&#xD;
      60-minutes about how they used or plan to use their time over slightly varying time frames:&#xD;
      1) over the previous 24 hours, 2) over the previous week, 3) over the previous year, 4) in&#xD;
      the next 24 hours, 5) in the next week and 6) in the next year. The journaling participants&#xD;
      will use &quot;PowerJournal&quot;. PowerJournal 0.2 for Windows is a downloadable program; once&#xD;
      downloaded and installed on the computer, there is no further need for an Internet&#xD;
      connection. This is a simple word-processing program, similar in style to Microsoft Word.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP ASSESSMENT. After the intervention is complete, participants will be sent the same&#xD;
      questionnaires (plus the Follow-Up Form) as used in the pre-intervention battery by mail and&#xD;
      asked to return the questionnaires in the self-addressed, stamped envelope included. We&#xD;
      estimate that these questionnaires will take about 30 minutes to complete. This will&#xD;
      concluded their participation in the study.&#xD;
