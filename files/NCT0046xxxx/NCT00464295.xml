  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with unresectable/advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma receiving Capecitabin, we&#xD;
      anticipate that the proposed chemotherapy will have a delay in progression of the disease .&#xD;
      It is also expected that proposed chemotherapy will have acceptable toxicity and Quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

           IV. PATIENT REGISTRATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients entering this study must be registered by contacting:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drs. Kashif Anis/Zaigham Abbas -Research Co-ordinators The Aga Khan University Hospital,&#xD;
           Dept of Medicine/ Medical Oncology. Stadium Road, P.O. Box: 3500, Karachi, 74800,&#xD;
           Pakistan Tel (021) 493-0051&#xD;
&#xD;
           V. THERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a Phase II trial studying chemotherapy with CAP in non-resectable HCC. Prior&#xD;
           chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery is permitted. Staging is required with a CAT&#xD;
           scan/Ultrasound of abdomen and bone scan if necessary. Pre study evaluation should&#xD;
           include CBC, renal functions assessment, and liver function tests. Patients will require&#xD;
           independent evaluation with medical oncologist/gastroenterologist prior to being&#xD;
           included in the study. Chemotherapy would be given in cycles of 21 days. CAP would be&#xD;
           given as oral tablets twice daily starting from day 1 to day 14. Medication with&#xD;
           standard anti-emetics, which may include serotonin antagonist, may be used before&#xD;
           administration of chemotherapy. Duration of chemotherapy administration would be&#xD;
           determined by the patient's response. A patient who has progressive disease, is not able&#xD;
           to tolerate chemotherapy and has unacceptable toxicity would be taken off the study.&#xD;
           Patients, who have a response, will continue on chemotherapy till progression of disease&#xD;
           or inability to tolerate chemotherapy is documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VI. DOSE MODIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hematologic Toxicity:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chemotherapy will be held if ANC &lt; 1,500/uL, and/or platelet count is &lt; 50,000/uL.&#xD;
           Treatment will resume when counts recover. Growth factors can be used in subsequent&#xD;
           cycles if delay is secondary to neutropenia. If there is no recovery after 3 weeks of&#xD;
           delay, the patient will be taken off the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Renal dysfunction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Creatinine Clearance mL/min Dose &gt;50 100% 30-50 75% &lt;30 0%(no treatment is given)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Elevated Liver Function Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the event that bilirubin is elevated during the study, the next cycle will be delayed&#xD;
           by a maximum of 2 weeks. (The following dose modification in the dose of capecitabine&#xD;
           will be made if the AST and/or ALT and/or alkaline phosphatase levels are elevated:&#xD;
&#xD;
           AST/ALT Alkaline Phosphatase Recommended dose (%) &gt; 1.5- &lt; 2.5 x normal &lt; 2.5 x normal&#xD;
           75% &gt; 2.5- &lt; 5 x normal &gt; 2.5- &lt; 5 x normal 50% &gt; 5 x normal &gt; 5 x normal Dose delay by&#xD;
           a maximum of 2 weeks. If no recovery is noted; the patient should go off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cardio toxicity:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Significant drop in left ventricular ejection fraction and/or clinical signs and&#xD;
           symptoms of cardiac failure will result in discontinuation from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dose Modification:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dose reduction is planned if significant (Grade III/IV) hematologic or non-hematologic&#xD;
           toxicities are observed. CAP shall be reduced by 25% with grade III/IV toxicity occur.&#xD;
           Patient should be taken off study if a life threatening complication occurs. All grade&#xD;
           III/IV toxicities should be recorded in detail including the dates of onset and&#xD;
           resolution/outcome. GI toxicity of grade II including severe diarrhea, nausea, vomiting&#xD;
           and stomatitis, dose modification will be done as, it will be held for 1 week along with&#xD;
           symptomatic treatment , if no improvement for 2 weeks then patient will be taken off the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VII. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING&#xD;
&#xD;
           All serious events (as defined in Appendix E of protocol) must be reported, as soon as&#xD;
           you are aware of them to:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drs. Kashif Anis/Zaigham Abbas , at the Aga Khan University Hospital VIII. EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation before Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient should have evaluation by gastroenterology/oncology to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All Patients should have:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diagnosis of hepatoma with the help of Biopsy if possible, or by the help of CT Scan or&#xD;
           Serum alpha fetoprotein level, fulfilling 2 out of 3 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Complete history and physical examination. CBC, differential, platelet count, serum&#xD;
           sodium, potassium, glucose, calcium, creatinine, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST,&#xD;
           ALT ,alpha fetoprotein(AFP), prothrombin time PT and Serum Albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CT scan of the abdomen with contrast. Cardiac evaluation of LVEF CT scans and plain&#xD;
           x-rays if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation during Chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           CBC, differential, platelets count, sodium, potassium, creatinine, glucose, bilirubin,&#xD;
           alkaline phosphatase, AST/ALT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CBC should be repeated prior to every chemotherapy course.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Re-evaluation of response after every 3 courses of chemotherapy would be done radio&#xD;
           logically by repeating a CT scan/x rays as indicated by sites of disease involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation After chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be followed thereafter cessation of chemotherapy due to progression of&#xD;
           disease, every three to six months until a total of five years for evaluation of&#xD;
           five-year disease free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation of toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This should be based either on the NCIC common toxicity criteria (attached at the end),&#xD;
           or any other major toxicity criteria (e.g. NCI), and documented in the attached form.&#xD;
