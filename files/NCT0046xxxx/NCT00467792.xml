  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how long the skin lesions usually last and what&#xD;
      kind of symptoms and signs children with urticaria pigmentosa may develop over the years.&#xD;
      This information will allow physicians to better care for patients who have been diagnosed&#xD;
      with this disease and to provide their parents with more complete information regarding what&#xD;
      to expect for the future of their child. This research is being done because many unanswered&#xD;
      questions remain regarding children with urticaria pigmentosa and its course.&#xD;

      This study involves children, of age 0-18 years old who are diagnosed with urticaria&#xD;
      pigmentosa during their visit at the Pediatric Dermatology Clinic. Parents and child will be&#xD;
      interviewed to gain medical and family history, in addition, the doctor will perform a&#xD;
      physical exam and take a photograph. Children older than 4 years of age will complete the&#xD;
      &quot;Children Dermatology Life Quality Index.&quot; Children less than 4 years of age with an active&#xD;
      disease will have laboratory tests requiring a sample of blood (1 teaspoon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive $50 for their first office visit as financial reimbursement for&#xD;
      participating in the study.&#xD;
