  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls and osteoporosis-related fractures cause substantial morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
      elderly, and are an increasingly important public health concern. A comprehensive&#xD;
      multidisciplinary and integrated community-based approach is needed to identify and manage&#xD;
      the population at highest risk of these complications. Unfortunately, current gaps in&#xD;
      continuity of care and health intervention result in a sub-optimal state of health service&#xD;
      for these individuals. The Falls, Fracture and Osteoporosis Risk Control and Evaluation&#xD;
      (FORCE) Study is a two-year randomized controlled trial evaluated on the effect of&#xD;
      coordinated community-based, multidisciplinary approach for fall and fracture prevention in&#xD;
      Sault Ste. Marie.&#xD;

      The FORCE partners are a broad collaboration of interested consumers, stakeholders and&#xD;
      providers, led by the Algoma Health Unit (AHU) and the Group Health Centre (GHC) - a&#xD;
      community-based, not-for-profit, multidisciplinary health organization. Other partners&#xD;
      include the multi-agency, consumer-orientated Algoma District Slips, Trips and Falls&#xD;
      Committee, the Sault Area Hospital (SAH), the Algoma Community Care Access Centre (ACCAC),&#xD;
      and Pharma Companies Alliance (Aventis and Proctor &amp; Gamble), Merck Frosst and Lilly. The&#xD;
      Green Shield Foundation has also provided sponsorship.The results of this study might&#xD;
      directly benefit up to eight thousand seniors in the district by providing the impetus to&#xD;
      integrated, evidence-based health services. Qualitative and quantitative research during this&#xD;
      time will also be a unique opportunity to identify the modifiable barriers to the continuity&#xD;
      and quality of care in this high-risk population. By involving the community, the project&#xD;
      will also educate those at future risk and hopefully prevent disease and complications.&#xD;
      Evaluation and research should provide nationally suggestions for better health service&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
