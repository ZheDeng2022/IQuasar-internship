    <textblock>
      Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that selectively&#xD;
      targets CD20+ B cells and induces a transient depletion of the CD20+ mature B cell&#xD;
      subpopulation.The objective of our study was to assess the effect of rituximab on the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of influenza virus vaccine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&#xD;

      The study population comprised RA patients treated with conventional disease modifying drugs&#xD;
      with or without rituximab. Split-virion inactivated vaccine containing 15 mcg&#xD;
      hemagglutinin/dose of B/Shanghai/361/02 (SHAN), A/New Caledonia A/New Caledonia/ 20/99 (NC)&#xD;
      (H1N1) and A/California/7/04 (CAL) (H3N2) was used. Disease activity was assessed by number&#xD;
      of tender and swollen joints, morning stiffness duration, and evaluation of pain on the day&#xD;
      of vaccination and 4 weeks later. CD20 positive cell levels were assessed in rituximab&#xD;
      treated patients. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies were tested and response was&#xD;
      defined as &gt;4-fold rise 4 weeks post vaccination or seroconversion in patients with a&#xD;
      non-protective baseline level of antibodies (&lt;1/40). Geometric mean titers (GMT) were&#xD;
      calculated in all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The participants were divided into 3 groups: RA (n=29, aged 64±12 years),&#xD;
      rituximab-treated RA (n=14, aged 53±15 years) and healthy controls (n=21, aged 58±15 years).&#xD;
      All baseline protective levels of HI antibodies and GMT were similar. Four weeks after&#xD;
      vaccination, there was a significant increase in GMT for NC and California antigens in all&#xD;
      subjects, but not for the Shanghai antigen in the rituximab group. Similarly, the percentage&#xD;
      of responders was low for Shanghai and NC, but significantly lowers in rituximab treated&#xD;
      patients for the California antigen compared with the other groups. Parameters of disease&#xD;
      activity remained unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Influenza virus vaccine generated a humoral response in all RA study patients and&#xD;
      controls. Although the response was significantly lower among rituximab-treated patients,&#xD;
