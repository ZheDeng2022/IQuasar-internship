      Mesothelioma is an incurable cancer involving the lining of the lung. Patients usually suffer&#xD;
      progressive symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain, until they ultimately succumb to&#xD;
      the disease. While a very small number of patients qualify for aggressive treatment with&#xD;
      surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, and enjoy long-term survival, the vast majority of&#xD;
      patients have incurable disease. The treatment options currently available, including&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation treatment, are only modestly effective at alleviating symptoms and&#xD;
      improving life expectancy. This trial explores the use of new radiation technology&#xD;
      (tomotherapy), to treat mesothelioma more aggressively than has been possible before.&#xD;
      Tomotherapy's ability to treat unusual shaped tumours, particularly when they are wrapped&#xD;
      around sensitive normal tissues (the lung), enable higher doses of radiation to be used and&#xD;
      this may improve its effectiveness. We will treat 17 patients with tomotherapy and assess the&#xD;
      breathing, symptoms, and quality of life of the patients before and after treatment&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malignant mesothelioma of the pleura is one of the most challenging diseases to treat in&#xD;
      oncology. It is often associated with previous exposure to asbestos many years in the past&#xD;
      with the mean latency period between asbestos exposure and the development of mesothelioma&#xD;
      being approximately 48 years. The disease most commonly presents in the fifth to seventh&#xD;
      decade of life, and the natural history is one of relentless progression and eventual death&#xD;
      in nearly all patients. It can metastasize to regional nodes and/or distant sites, but most&#xD;
      of the morbidity and mortality comes from local disease in the chest, causing progressive&#xD;
      constriction, and death from pulmonary insufficiency or infection. Common clinical&#xD;
      manifestations can include pleural effusions, superior vena cava obstruction, dysphagia, and&#xD;
      laryngeal nerve palsy. Median survival rates are generally less than one year from the time&#xD;
      of diagnosis, although there may be a small subset of patients with more indolent disease&#xD;
      that have longer survival durations. Patients generally suffer from significant symptoms over&#xD;
      the course of their illness, particularly progressive dyspnea and chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options with mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of mesothelioma has been characterized by disappointment. The only form of&#xD;
      &quot;curative&quot; treatment that has been attempted is a combination of surgery (extrapleural&#xD;
      pneumonectomy), chemotherapy, and radiation treatment to the hemithorax. This was described&#xD;
      by Sugerbaker, who reported 5-year survival rates of 22% of 120 patients treated.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, this approach is only possible for early stage disease (clinical stage I with&#xD;
      no nodal involvement) in the absence of comorbid medical illness, and the vast majority of&#xD;
      patients present with disease too advanced to consider this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of radiotherapy in malignant mesothelioma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy has been used with both radical and palliative intent. Radical treatment&#xD;
      with tumoricidal doses is difficult to achieve with conventional treatment machines due to&#xD;
      the dose limitations of normal tissues. The liver, heart, stomach, and normal lung tissue is&#xD;
      routinely encompassed within the planning target volumes and all of these tissues have&#xD;
      tolerances below the doses necessary to control disease. Curative (adjuvant) treatment has&#xD;
      also been given after extrapleural pneumonectomy, which does not have the problem of&#xD;
      underlying lung to deal with, but the other nearby normal structures are still difficult to&#xD;
      avoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A main component of the problem in both curative and adjuvant radiotherapy is the presence of&#xD;
      chest wall and diaphragm motion during radiotherapy. Breathing motion affects the chest wall&#xD;
      and diaphragm primarily, two of the principal targets in mesothelioma. Maneuvers such as&#xD;
      breath holding and respiratory gating, which have shown limited success in lung cancer&#xD;
      radiotherapy, are more difficult in mesothelioma due to the presence of significant dyspnea&#xD;
      and pain in a majority of patients. Clearly any attempt to treat the thoracic pleura with&#xD;
      high-dose radiotherapy must either limit or at least account for this organ motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The published results from treating mesothelioma with primary radiotherapy have been&#xD;
      suboptimal. High dose treatment to the hemithorax using conventional linear accelerators has&#xD;
      typically resulted in complete loss of function of the underlying lung, with no survival&#xD;
      benefit over palliative radiotherapy or no treatment. However, studies have suggested that&#xD;
      specific symptoms can be effectively palliated with focused radiation treatment. Gordon et al&#xD;
      reviewed 29 courses of palliative radiotherapy in 19 patients, with varying&#xD;
      dose/fractionation schedules. Overall 11/29 treatment courses resulted in complete,&#xD;
      &quot;substantial&quot;, or partial relief of symptoms. Furthermore, palliation of symptoms strongly&#xD;
      correlated with doses over 40 Gy, suggesting a dose-response relationship. Other&#xD;
      investigators have shown effective palliation with lower doses. Davis et al treated patients&#xD;
      with 20-30 Gy in 4-10 fractions, with response rates of 60-68%. De Graaf-Strukowska showed&#xD;
      50% pain response rates in patients treated to a mean dose of 36 Gy at a minimum of 4 Gy per&#xD;
      fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies suggest that although radiation is an effective treatment modality against&#xD;
      mesothelioma, the technical difficulties in treating the pleural space effectively limit the&#xD;
      risk-benefit ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helical tomotherapy as a technique to treat mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tomotherapy is a relatively new technology which delivers intensity modulated radiation in a&#xD;
      helical fashion, much like a spiral CT scan. Because treatment is given from all angles&#xD;
      around a patient, the resulting dose distributions are highly conformal and effectively&#xD;
      reduce nearby normal tissues. Mesothelioma was identified early in tomotherapy's development&#xD;
      as an ideal site for this technology, since the target volume is extremely difficult to treat&#xD;
      using conventional techniques but well suited to the tangential beams of tomotherapy. A test&#xD;
      plan using tomotherapy to &quot;treat&quot; a sample patient resulted in excellent dose coverage of the&#xD;
      pleural disease with acceptable dose delivered to the ipsilateral and contralateral lungs&#xD;
      [unpublished data]. Nevertheless, these test plans were designed on static systems in the&#xD;
      absence of respiratory motion, so the feasibility of treatment on breathing patients remains&#xD;
      unproven. Tomotherapy is currently in routine clinical and research use in several centres&#xD;
      across North America, including the Cross Cancer Institute where it was commissioned in 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is disease-specific symptom control rate post-treatment, based on&#xD;
      Palliation Index [Gordon 1982].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival Radiographic response rate at 3 months post-treatment Quality of life scores&#xD;
      (QLQ-L30) at 1-, 3- and 6-months post-treatment Acute and subacute toxicity of treatment&#xD;
      Feasibility of using cine-MR, using 3T-MRI, to define target volumes in mesothelioma&#xD;
      Performance status at 1-, 3- and 6-months post-treatment Pulmonary function test results at&#xD;
      1-, 3- and 6-months post-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single institution single-arm phase II study, assessing the efficacy of&#xD;
      tomotherapy-delivered radiation in patients with symptomatic mesothelioma. Patients are&#xD;
      treated with radiation alone (no concurrent chemotherapy), and assessed for symptoms and&#xD;
      performance status post-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our statistical analysis (see below), we will require 14 analyzable patients. With a&#xD;
      potential drop-out rate of 20%, we will accrue 17 patients in total. Assuming a possible&#xD;
      accrual rate of one patient every 1-2 months, it may take 24-34 months to complete the&#xD;
      accrual process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologic diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma Age&gt;18 Life expectancy &gt; 4 months Able to&#xD;
      breathe comfortably in a supine position for periods of approximately 20 minutes (with or&#xD;
      without supplemental O2) Has denied treatment with pemetrexed chemotherapy, or has evidence&#xD;
      of progressive or refractory disease on treatment with pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not eligible or has declined aggressive multimodality (surgical) management for early-stage&#xD;
      disease Signed informed consent CT scan of chest performed within 6 weeks of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ineligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any contraindications to thoracic radiotherapy In the judgment of the treating physician,&#xD;
      inadequate pulmonary reserve to tolerate the proposed radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unable to perform shallow breathing in a manner to make tomotherapy delivery possible&#xD;
      Presence of symptomatic distant metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-simulation imaging is required as part of this study in order to quantify the extent of&#xD;
      chest wall and diaphragm movement during the breathing cycle. Two approaches to this analysis&#xD;
      are acceptable: MR imaging (using the 3T MRI in the CBIAR facility) or CT/fluoroscopy (using&#xD;
      equipment in the radiation oncology department). The decision on which technique to use will&#xD;
      depend on the status of the MRI equipment for breathing assessment at the time of patient&#xD;
      accrual.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients required is based on the estimated efficacy of the proposed treatment&#xD;
      regimen and the desired level of statistical significance. The table below indicates the&#xD;
      relationship between these factors and the number of patients required:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response rate Required &quot;n&quot; P-value 0.05 59 0.048 0.10 29 0.047 0.15 19 0.046 0.20 14 0.044&#xD;
      0.25 11 0.042 0.30 9 0.040&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the estimated response rate of the proposed treatment (ability to achieve some&#xD;
      relief of symptoms), if &quot;n&quot; patients are treated then at least one patient will demonstrate a&#xD;
      measurable response more than 95% of the time. In this study, an efficacy of 20% was chosen&#xD;
      as a worst-case scenario, below which the treatment would likely not be offered for&#xD;
      palliation. Therefore, 14 evaluable patients will be required to refute the null hypotheses&#xD;
      of the treatment being ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the true efficacy rate is higher, then the likelihood of a false negative result is lower,&#xD;
      and an estimate of the true response rate can be learned.&#xD;
