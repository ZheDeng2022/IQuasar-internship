      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the VeinViewer® near infrared&#xD;
      device to facilitate the placement of intravenous catheters in children who require&#xD;
      intravenous cannulation in the pediatric emergency department. This clinical protocol is&#xD;
      designed to determine whether using the VeinViewer increases the ease and efficiency of IV&#xD;
      cannulation (as perceived by the operator), decreases the time to effective cannulation,&#xD;
      decreases the number of sticks and extravasations, and decreases the child's and the parents&#xD;
      perception of the pain of IV cannulation.&#xD;

      Needle sticks are part of many standard treatments in the pediatric emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      and are frequently a source of pain and anxiety for children. Intravenous catheters (IVs)&#xD;
      have been shown to be among the leading causes of pain in hospitalized children 1 and&#xD;
      venipucture is commonly seen as one of the most painful and frequently performed invasive&#xD;
      procedures by nurses. 2 (Jacobson et al.) Children recording VAS pain scores in response to&#xD;
      IV catheter placement in the Emergency Department rated the pain as 3.23/5.0 and their parent&#xD;
      rated their children's pain as 3.4/5.0. 3 (Skarbek et al.) The placement of intravenous&#xD;
      catheters would be more efficient and less stressful if the clinician had a clear roadmap or&#xD;
      picture highlighting the location of the vein. The lack a clear visual guide to IV placement&#xD;
      often leads to multiple painful attempts at catheter placement as well as delays urgent in&#xD;
      treatment ( I.V. fluid and medication administration) and increased use of human resources.&#xD;
      The current average number of catheter punctures needed in order to achieve successful&#xD;
      catheter placement is 2.4 with a range of 1-14. 4 ( Larue, GD ) The VeinViewer by Luminetx™&#xD;
      allows the clinician to clearly see the child's accessible vasculature or the lack thereof in&#xD;
      real time, directly on the surface of the skin. The clinician can be trained to operate the&#xD;
      VeinViewer in minutes and use does not require any additional job or skills certification.&#xD;
      The VeinViewer is free standing and hands-free allowing the clinician the freedom to use both&#xD;
      hands to carry out the work of placing the catheter (unlike ultrasound which requires one&#xD;
      hand to hold the probe and the other hand to place the catheter, unless two people are&#xD;
      available and able to coordinate their work efforts thus doubling the resources necessary for&#xD;
      I.V. placement. The VeinViewer is non-invasive and causes no tissue damage. There is no&#xD;
      patient contact with the device and therefore no risk of infectious disease contamination&#xD;
      with blood products. The VeinViewer uses near-infrared light to locate subcutaneous veins and&#xD;
      project their location onto the surface of the skin thus creating a visible roadmap for I.V&#xD;
      catheter placement. This protocol describes a prospective, randomized, study, evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of VeinViewer in increasing the ease of intravenous cannulation in children&#xD;
      receiving intravenous cannulation in the pediatric emergency department. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that cannulation using VeinViewerâ will require fewer sticks and will result in&#xD;
      fewer missed or repeated IV starts, fewer extravasating (&quot;blown vein&quot;) IV placements,&#xD;
      increased perceived ease of placement by the operator, and decreased pain associated with the&#xD;
      IV placement as perceived by the child, the parent, and the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Background Intravenous cannulation is a routine and common part of treatment for children&#xD;
      receiving care in the Pediatric Emergency Department. Intravenous cannulation is painful and&#xD;
      often challenging in children. Peripheral IV's are generally placed using visual and/or&#xD;
      tactile cues. These may be minimal or deceptive in children who often have small peripheral&#xD;
      veins and increased subcutaneous fat with opaque, elastic skin. Health care workers often&#xD;
      struggle to place these IV's successfully making multiple sticks, infiltrating subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissues, requiring extensive operator time, and, most importantly, causing the patient and&#xD;
      the parent distress. A number of approaches have been tried, attempting to decrease the pain&#xD;
      of these cannulations. Most of these involve the cutaneous application of lidocaine in an&#xD;
      attempt to numb the skin and decrease the pain of the stick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMLA and more recently, LMX (lidocaine in liposomal delivery system) are effective topical&#xD;
      agents but there is a 30 minute dwell time - inappropriate in the Emergency Medicine setting.&#xD;
      A number of devices have been tested which decrease the barrier of the stratum corneum thus&#xD;
      allowing the lidocaine to anesthetize the skin in 3-5 minutes. These include a hand held&#xD;
      laser (effective but burns and pigments the skin), a small ultrasound (effective but bulky&#xD;
      and difficult to use), and gas pressure driven powdered lidocaine (effective but not approved&#xD;
      by the FDA yet for general sales and distribution). These devices depend on identifying the&#xD;
      vein and then successfully cannulating the identified vein through the anestethized skin.&#xD;
      Missed sticks force the operator to begin the anesthesia process all over again in a&#xD;
      different site. This process is time consuming and ineffective in the ED setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other centers have begun to employ ultrasound to identify the veins for peripheral&#xD;
      cannulation to cannulate under indirect visualization. This process is difficult for small&#xD;
      mobile pediatric veins and requires extensive operator training and practice. It also&#xD;
      requires an extra set of operator hands when children, often less than cooperative, are&#xD;
      involved. It is unclear that this approach will be effective in the Pediatric ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vein Viewerâ is a hands off device that projects a map of the subcutaneous veins onto the&#xD;
      surface of the skin. It allows the operator to insert the IV catheter under direct&#xD;
      visualization. It can be used by one operator who can insert the catheter and restrain the&#xD;
      child's arm while using the device. Direct visualization is accurate and decreases the blind&#xD;
      sticks, missed &quot;fishing expeditions&quot;, and extravasations of IV fluid and medication (often&#xD;
      not benign) that can occur with IV cannulation, especially in children. Decreasing the number&#xD;
      of sticks and the time to successful catheterization will decrease the child's and the&#xD;
      parents perceived pain of the procedure and the operator time to effective catheterization&#xD;
      thus increasing the efficiency of the operator and the ED in general, and speeding the&#xD;
      initiation of therapy (IV hydration or medication). The Vein Viewer has no side effects and&#xD;
      is visually interesting to children and parents. It has the potential to revolutionize the&#xD;
      effectiveness and efficiency, of IV cannulation in the Pediatric Emergency Department and&#xD;
      decrease substantially the child's and the parent's perceived pain from the procedure and&#xD;
      fear of the procedure.&#xD;
