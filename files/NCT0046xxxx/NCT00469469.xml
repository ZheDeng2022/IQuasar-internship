  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of intravenous Bevacizumab in patients with pathologically confirmed&#xD;
      nonresectable primary adrenocortical cancer (ACC). Patients must have received no prior&#xD;
      therapy. They will receive Bevacizumab as a single agent every 2 weeks intravenously until&#xD;
      disease progression. This study will be open at multiple sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adrenocortical carcinoma(ACC)is a rare malignancy with an incidence of 1.5 to 2 per million&#xD;
      per year in the United states. Surgery is the only therapeutic option that can prolong&#xD;
      survival. Currently there are no therapies that have been proven to prolong survival for&#xD;
      patients with nonsurgically resectable disease. ACC has been shown to be highly resistant to&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy, therefore, it is important that we test agents with mechanisms of&#xD;
      action. This is a single arm phase II study of Bevacizumab, an angiogenesis inhibitor, given&#xD;
      as a single agent at 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks in patients with unresectable ACC. Bevicizumab&#xD;
      will be used as first line therapy. The study will test if Bevacizumab will be able to&#xD;
      prolong the time to progression. If a delay in time to progression of 4 months or greater is&#xD;
      seen, this will be considered clinically meaningful and further studies will be considered.&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at multiple institutions (see below).&#xD;

             Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have inoperable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This is a first and/or second line study. Patients must have completed only one or&#xD;
             fewer regimes of systemic therapy. They may have received one prior systemic therapy&#xD;
             either: a) mitotane, or b)chemotherapy, or c) experimental therapy, or d) concurrent&#xD;
             chemotherapy and mitotane, or e) no prior systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a life expectancy of three or more months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If subjects have received some form of systemic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy or&#xD;
             mitotane), they should have completed that systemic therapy at least 28 days before&#xD;
             beginning Bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects of child-bearing potential(men and women) must agree to the use of&#xD;
             effective means of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years wtih&#xD;
             the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any unresolved chronic toxicity greater than CTC grade 2 from previous anticancer&#xD;
