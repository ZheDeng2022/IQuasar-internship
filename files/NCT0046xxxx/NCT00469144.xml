      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving busulfan in a dose based on&#xD;
      blood levels, along with a fixed (unchanging) dose of fludarabine, is more effective and&#xD;
      causes fewer side effects for AML or myelodysplastic syndrome patients than the standard&#xD;
      method of giving a fixed busulfan dose based on body size, along with a fixed dose of&#xD;
      fludarabine. The safety of dosing based on blood levels will also be studied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Busulfan is a chemotherapy drug that kills cancer cells by binding to DNA, and is commonly&#xD;
      used in stem cell transplantation. Fludarabine is an antimetabolite drug which has&#xD;
      anti-leukemia and immunosuppressive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss&#xD;
      of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. One group will receive a fixed dose of busulfan, while the&#xD;
      other group will receive an adjusted dose of busulfan based on blood levels of the drug. Both&#xD;
      groups will receive fludarabine treatment as well as a stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the adjusted-dose group will first receive a low-level &quot;test&quot; dose of busulfan to&#xD;
      check how their blood levels change over time; this information will be used to decide the&#xD;
      next dose needed to reach the target blood level that matches your body size. Patients in the&#xD;
      fixed-dose group will receive a fixed dose of busulfan without the test dose. If you are&#xD;
      assigned to the fixed-dose group, this measurement will only affect your dose level if you&#xD;
      have an unusually high or low drug level in your blood. Patients in both groups will have a&#xD;
      total of about 20 teaspoons (less than 7 tablespoons) of blood drawn over time to check their&#xD;
      busulfan blood levels following one or more of the busulfan treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 11 samples of blood will be drawn to check your blood levels of busulfan over time&#xD;
      following the test dose and the first high-dose busulfan treatment; each sample is about 1&#xD;
      teaspoon of blood. A heparin lock will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle&#xD;
      sticks needed for these draws. If it is not possible for these blood level tests to be&#xD;
      performed for technical or scheduling reasons, you will receive the standard fixed dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups of patients receive fludarabine through a central venous catheter (CVC--a small&#xD;
      tube inserted into one of your major veins, usually in the chest or shoulder blade) over 1&#xD;
      hour, once a day, for 4 days. After each dose of fludarabine, the high-dose Busulfan will be&#xD;
      infused through the CVC over 3 hours. These drugs are given to try to kill malignant cells&#xD;
      and suppress your immune system in order to reduce the risk of stem cell transplant&#xD;
      rejection. If you are going to be receiving a transplant from an HLA-type-nonidentical or&#xD;
      unrelated donor, you will also receive Thymoglobulin (ATG) over 4 hours on the 3 days prior&#xD;
      to the transplant to further suppress your immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 days of rest, the allogeneic stem cells (bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells)&#xD;
      will then be given intravenously (IV--through a needle in your vein). You will receive the&#xD;
      drug G-CSF (Neupogen) as an injection under the skin daily starting 1 week after the&#xD;
      transplant until your blood cell levels return to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients usually remain in the hospital for about 4 weeks after stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
      After you are released from the hospital, you will continue as an outpatient in the hospital&#xD;
      area to be monitored for infections and transplant-related complications for a minimum of 100&#xD;
      days after the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who previously had leukemia involvement in the nervous system may need to receive&#xD;
      spinal taps, with injection of cytosine arabinoside and hydrocortisone, several times over&#xD;
      the year after transplantation to try to keep the leukemia from coming back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will undergo blood tests and bone marrow biopsies at 3, 6, and 12 months after the&#xD;
      transplant, to check if the disease is in remission. Your health status will be followed&#xD;
      along with their local physician to find out if the leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      comes back, as well as to check the length of your survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. All of the drugs used in this study are approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for treatment of cancer. Up to 230 patients will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

        <description>Time to failure (TTF) defined as either disease recurrence or death, from the time of bone marrow transplant (BMT) and reported as TRM at 100 days and 1 year.&#xD;
Treatment period defined as BMT Day -9 for patients treated on the PK-guided treatment arm, and day -7 for patients receiving the fixed-dose busulfan treatment through BMT Day +28. The post study surveillance period is defined as BMT Day +29 through BMT Day +100. Bone marrow aspirate with cytogenetics at approximately one (1) month and three (3) months, or as clinically indicated.&#xD;
Response Criteria is measured by the bone marrow aspirate to determine it has leukemic blast. Bone marrow blast less than 5% is considered to be a complete response.</description>
