      The purpose of this study is to find new ways to control malaria by looking at mosquitoes&#xD;
      infected with the disease. Knowledge of the genetics that affect the spread of malaria by&#xD;
      mosquitoes will help in developing control strategies. A small amount of blood from infected&#xD;
      humans will be used to infect the mosquitoes. No contact will occur between the human subject&#xD;
      and the mosquito. Study participants will be divided into 2 groups of 20, for a total of 40&#xD;
      children, ages 5-10, in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Each subject will be screened by&#xD;
      finger-prick once per month, from June through October, until they reach a maximum age of 10.&#xD;
      Two positive subjects of the 40 screened will be asked to donate about 1 teaspoon of blood,&#xD;
      which will be used to feed and infect the mosquitoes. Study participants will be involved in&#xD;
      study related procedures for a maximum of 5 years.&#xD;

      Malaria is a blood-borne human disease, and is transmitted to mosquitoes in the bloodmeal, an&#xD;
      obligatory step in human malaria transmission. This is a study of malaria parasites in the&#xD;
      major mosquito vector of human malaria in Africa, Anopheles gambiae. The intent of the study&#xD;
      is to develop modern forms of vector control that would specifically decrease disease&#xD;
      transmission by targeting the vector. Genetic linkage mapping of the mosquito vector&#xD;
      (Anopheles gambiae) in Africa has identified a small genomic region in the mosquito that&#xD;
      controls most of the natural genetic variation for resistance to mosquito infection with the&#xD;
      human malaria parasite (Plasmodium falciparum). In order to study the influence of mosquito&#xD;
      vector genetics on transmission of malaria parasites, mosquitoes are exposed to malaria&#xD;
      parasites and then the efficiency of parasite development within the mosquito is measured.&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to promote and expand this non-transmitting subset of the vector&#xD;
      population in order to decrease or interrupt human malaria transmission. The study focuses on&#xD;
      the mosquito vector, not the human subjects infected with malaria. The reason for the use of&#xD;
      human subjects is that 5cc of blood from human subjects naturally infected with malaria will&#xD;
      be used to infect the mosquitoes by an indirect feeding method that involves a membrane&#xD;
      feeding device. There will be no contact of human subjects with the mosquitoes. The blood-fed&#xD;
      mosquitoes are the primary focus of this study, not human subjects. DNA extracted from&#xD;
      mosquitoes that fed on the blood of human study subjects will be analyzed genetically by&#xD;
      microsatellites and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify mosquito genes that&#xD;
      control mosquito resistance to malaria parasites. The genetic analysis is of mosquito DNA,&#xD;
      not DNA of the human subjects. At the time mosquitoes are analyzed, one week after the&#xD;
      bloodmeal, there is no residual genetic, DNA, cellular, or any material of the human subject&#xD;
      remaining within the mosquito, and thus no genetic or other information can derive from the&#xD;
      human source, even accidentally. A secondary objective will be to identify&#xD;
      naturally-occurring mechanisms of mosquito resistance to malaria infection in Burkina Faso.&#xD;
      Mosquitoes that are not infected by malaria parasites do not transmit malaria. Research that&#xD;
      identifies these genes for resistance may lead to a method for blocking the transmission of&#xD;
      malaria. A total enrollment of 40 healthy volunteers, 5-10 years old, is planned at one site&#xD;
      in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Malaria transmission occurs during the rainy season (June&#xD;
      through October). There will be 2 experimental cycles per month from June through October (10&#xD;
      cycles per year). There will be two such groups of 20, for a total study size of 40. Each&#xD;
      group of 20 will be screened for malaria in an alternating pattern, so each group of 20 is&#xD;
      screened no more frequently than once per month during the malaria transmission season, for a&#xD;
      total study duration of 5 years. One human subject with mature malaria gametocytes (the&#xD;
      transmission stage infective to mosquitoes) will be identified the day before the projected&#xD;
      experimental infection of mosquitoes. Blood (5 cc) will be drawn from the subject, which will&#xD;
      occur no more frequently than once per month. Twenty subjects are screened for malaria&#xD;
      parasites (by standard diagnosis) to insure finding at least one positive donor per cycle.&#xD;
      The 5cc of blood is used to feed and infect mosquitoes, which are the subject of this study.&#xD;
      Subject participation is approximately 5 months per year, for the total study duration of 5&#xD;
      years. A target sample size of 200 mosquitoes with a set of 150 markers will be analyzed in&#xD;
      this study. A successful outcome of this study is genetic identification of mosquito genes&#xD;
      controlling resistance and susceptibility to P. falciparum infection of the mosquitoes.&#xD;
