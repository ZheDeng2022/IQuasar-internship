      The overarching aim of STILL is assessment of IV LEV in the management of seizures in the ED&#xD;
      setting. The main study endpoints are considered in the two patient groups of interest (SE&#xD;
      and non-SE):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For non-SE patients, STILL will compare IV LEV vs. the current standard-care of placebo,&#xD;
           with respect to the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does IV LEV administration result in lower seizure duration and/or recurrence rate than&#xD;
           does administration of placebo? (Ho: No difference in seizure duration or recurrence&#xD;
           rates between the two groups.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is IV LEV associated with a different rate of significant side effects than placebo?&#xD;
           (Ho: No difference in significant side effect rates between the two groups.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For SE patients, STILL will compare [IV LEV + lorazepam 2mg] vs. [lorazepam 3 mg], with&#xD;
           respect to the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does addition of IV LEV to a BZD allow for a BZD-sparing effect (i.e. achievement of&#xD;
           seizure control with lower dose of BZD)? (Ho: No difference in seizure duration and/or&#xD;
           recurrence rates between the two groups.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is IV LEV + lower-dose BZD associated with a different rate of significant side effects&#xD;
           than the higher-dose BZD administered as monotherapy? (Ho: No difference in significant&#xD;
           side effect rates between the two groups.)&#xD;

      The study will enroll adults (age at least 18 years) in the EDs of MGH or BWH. Patients will&#xD;
      be classified, depending upon their clinical presentation, into the SE group or the non-SE&#xD;
      group. The total enrollment projected for non-SE patients is 150; the total enrollment&#xD;
      projected for SE patients is 200. It is expected that at least 3 years may be required to&#xD;
      enroll the requisite number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible for study enrollment if they have had a seizure, and if they do not&#xD;
      have known pregnancy or renal failure, and if they are not known to be breastfeeding.&#xD;
      Hypotension is the only other exclusion criteria for the study. There are no other&#xD;
      contraindications to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients evaluated at the MGH/BWH EDs for seizures may arrive by private vehicle or&#xD;
      ambulance. A &quot;STILL&quot; pager will be activated by ED physicians upon notification of impending&#xD;
      ambulance arrival with a suspected seizure patient (SE or non-SE); the pager can also be&#xD;
      activated after patient arrival at the ED by ambulance or private vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon patient arrival to the ED, standard stabilization will be provided. If the patient is&#xD;
      determined to have had a seizure, or if the patient is currently seizing, an IV will be&#xD;
      placed (if not already present) in line with standard ED care. For the patient to be eligible&#xD;
      for STILL, the seizure must have occurred within an hour of ED arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care providers will make a determination as to whether patients are eligible, using a&#xD;
      checklist readily available in the ED. For patients who are determined to be eligible, the&#xD;
      care providers will indicate whether patients are in the &quot;SE&quot; or &quot;non-SE&quot; arm - the study&#xD;
      groups are hereafter denoted SE and non-SE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STILL medications will be stored in the ED with other medications, so that they are readily&#xD;
      available to care providers. The STILL medications will be in a separate section of the&#xD;
      automated drug dispenser units in the ED. STILL medications will be subdivided as to whether&#xD;
      patients are in the SE or non-SE arms. In each of the two subsections (SE and non-SE) of the&#xD;
      EDs' automated drug dispensers will be one box of study medications. Thus, the ED will always&#xD;
      have on hand, sufficient study medications to enroll one patient in either the SE or non-SE&#xD;
      arm. The randomization procedures to determine the contents of the study medication boxes&#xD;
      will be done in the Research Pharmacy, so no randomization needs to occur prior to treatment&#xD;
      in the ED. The study boxes will have unique identifier numbers, which will then be reported&#xD;
      back to the Research Pharmacy after the study medications have been administered; the&#xD;
      Research Pharmacy thus will have track of which study patients received which study boxes&#xD;
      (and which medication regimens). This approach to patient allocation and drug dispensing and&#xD;
      tracking is consistent with current mechanisms for enrolling patients in Partners&#xD;
      IRB-approved studies in the MGH/BWH EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inside the SE partition in the ED box will be a syringe containing lorazepam (concentration:&#xD;
      2 mg/mL) in either a 2 mg or 3 mg dose; an extra volume of inactive diluent will be added to&#xD;
      the 2 mg dose so that the volume (1.5 mL) is that same in each syringe. In a manner&#xD;
      consistent with previous/ongoing Partners IRB-approved studies in the ED, the syringe will be&#xD;
      labeled &quot;lorazepam - 2mg or 3mg.&quot; Also in the SE compartment of the drug dispenser will be an&#xD;
      infusion set labeled &quot;levetiracetam 1.5g or placebo.&quot; Thus, for SE patients, care providers&#xD;
      will administer two agents from the medication dispenser; patients will receive either&#xD;
      [lorazepam 2mg + levetiracetam 1.5 g] or [lorazepam 3mg + placebo]. Care providers will be&#xD;
      instructed (by information included with the study drugs) to administer the lorazepam over&#xD;
      1.5-2 minutes (this is in line with standard recommendations that lorazepam be administered&#xD;
      at a rate not to exceed 2 mg/min).28, 38 The infusion (i.e. levetiracetam or placebo) will be&#xD;
      administered over 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inside the non-SE partition in the ED box will be an infusion set labeled &quot;levetiracetam 1.5g&#xD;
      or placebo.&quot; Thus, for non-SE patients, care providers will administer one agent from the&#xD;
      medication dispenser; patients will receive either levetiracetam 1.5 g or placebo. Care&#xD;
      providers will be instructed (by information included with the study drugs) to administer the&#xD;
      infusion over 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contents of the partitions in the ED drug dispenser will be determined in advance, by a&#xD;
      randomization scheme that prevents the need for care providers to make a phone call or&#xD;
      otherwise spend time (which they do not have) randomizing patients. When the EDs use study&#xD;
      drug from either arm of STILL, they will contact the Research Pharmacy which will replace the&#xD;
      used materials and note the patient's medical record number along with the true identity of&#xD;
      the study agent(s) administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adjunctive medication may be administered at the discretion of the treating physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints for SE and non-SE patients are outlined in the Detailed Protocol. Briefly, SE&#xD;
      analysis will focus on whether seizure recurrence is reduced, and whether respiratory&#xD;
      depression and other post-medication vital signs changes occur less frequently in patients&#xD;
      receiving LEV and the smaller dose of lorazepam, as compared to those receiving the&#xD;
      higher-dose lorazepam alone. For non-SE patients, endpoints will include seizure recurrence&#xD;
      as well as quality of the examination and occurrence of side effects.&#xD;
