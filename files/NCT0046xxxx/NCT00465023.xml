  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine if high doses of radiation using proton beam&#xD;
      can be given safely with low and acceptable side effects. We will also gather information to&#xD;
      determine the ability of proton beam to destroy cancer cells in the liver. There are two&#xD;
      types of external radiation treatments (proton beam and photon beam). Proton beam radiation&#xD;
      is a very accurate kind of treatment that has been shown to affect less normal tissue than a&#xD;
      regular radiation beam. The accuracy allows us to more safely increase the amount of&#xD;
      radiation delivered to eliminate cancer and may potentially reduce the side effects normally&#xD;
      experienced with standard radiation therapy.&#xD;

      -  Participants will receive treatment as an outpatient at the Northeast Proton Treatment&#xD;
           Center located at the Massachusetts General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of proton beam radiation that can be given to&#xD;
           people safely, not everyone who participates in this study will be receiving the same&#xD;
           amount of radiation. Small groups of people will be enrolled and given a certain dose of&#xD;
           radiation. If they tolerate it well, the next small group of people enrolled will&#xD;
           receive a higher dose. This will continue until we find the highest dose that can be&#xD;
           given without causing serious or unmanageable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation treatment to the liver will be given once a day, 5 days a week&#xD;
           (Monday-Friday), for 3 weeks. Each treatment takes about 10-20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical examination, medical history, and blood tests will be taken once a week for 3&#xD;
           weeks during radiation therapy. Follow-up visits will occur every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
           and every 6 months thereafter for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
