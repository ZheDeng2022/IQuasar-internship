      RATIONALE: Using T cells from the patient that have been treated in the laboratory may help&#xD;
      the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving laboratory-treated T cells&#xD;
      together with cyclophosphamide may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This is a two-stage protocol, consisting of a single-institution phase I safety&#xD;
      study and multi-institution phase IIa extension study.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: The primary objective is to assess the safety of autologous T cells genetically&#xD;
      modified to express chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting CD19 antigen (19-28z) with or&#xD;
      without conditioning chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Phase IIa: The primary objective is to compare the relative engraftment and persistence of&#xD;
      the two CAR modified CD19-targeted T cells expressing different co-stimulatory signaling&#xD;
      domain CD28 (19-28z) and 4-1BB (CART-19:CD3z-4-1BB) in the CAR construct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the in vivo survival of genetically modified 19-28z CAR+ T cells after T cell&#xD;
      infusion alone or in combination with conditioning chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the gene transfer/expression efficiency of the two viral vectors (retrovirus&#xD;
           vs. lentivirus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the anti-leukemic activity of adoptively transferred CD19-targeted modified T&#xD;
           cells linked to the CD28 (19-28z) and 4-1BB signaling domains (CART-19:CD3z-4-1BB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage is a standard 3-step phase I dose escalation trial to assess the safety of&#xD;
      19-28z CAR expressing autologous T cells with or without prior conditioning chemotherapy. In&#xD;
      Step 1, a cohort of patients will receive the lowest planned dose of 19-28z+ modified T&#xD;
      cells. In Step 2, a cohort of patients will receive cyclophosphamide conditioning&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by the lowest planned dose of 19-28z+ modified T cells. If less than&#xD;
      33% of patients in the cohort (Step 2) experience unanticipated dose-limiting toxicity. In&#xD;
      Step 3, a cohort of patients will be treated with the investigator's choice conditioning&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by the higher dose of 19-28z+ modified T cells. If less than 33% of&#xD;
      patients in the initial cohort (Step 3) experience unanticipated dose-limiting toxicity, the&#xD;
      cohort in Step 3 may be be expanded to include up to 15 patients. In Step 3, an additional&#xD;
      cohort of Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) patients will be treated with the&#xD;
      investigator's choice conditioning chemotherapy followed by 19-28z+ T cells. However, to&#xD;
      maximize safety for WM patients, they will be treated at the lower dose of modified T cells&#xD;
      (1x106 19-28z+ T cells/kg). If no toxicity is observed in the initial cohort, the dose may be&#xD;
      increased in a standard 3-step dose-escalation scheme as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase IIa extension part of the trial, 12 patients from MSKCC will be enrolled, and&#xD;
      will be treated with co-infusion of 19-28z and CART-19:CD3z-4-1BB+ modified T cells mixed at&#xD;
      1:1 ratio at the MTD of T cells determined from the phase I trial.&#xD;
