  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the amount of nicotine that is absorbed into the blood&#xD;
      stream following the use of a new Electronic Cigarette device called the CN electronic&#xD;
      cigarette. The amount of nicotine delivered via the CN electronic cigarette will be compared&#xD;
      to the amount of nicotine delivered from smoking a regular cigarette and from using the&#xD;
      Nicorette® Inhalator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic cigarettes aim to mimic the experience of cigarette smoking, by delivering&#xD;
      nicotine rapidly. Unlike cigarettes however, they do not contain all of the many harmful&#xD;
      combustion products contained in tobacco smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic cigarettes are readily available in many markets, and may contain significant&#xD;
      quantities of nicotine. However, they are not regulated as medicines, and their manufacturers&#xD;
      can make no medicinal claims about them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such products are unregulated, having not been subjected to regulatory review by either the&#xD;
      Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) or any Notified Body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the intention of CN Creative (makers of the CN electronic cigarette) to submit an&#xD;
      application to the MHRA for the CN Electronic Cigarette, in order to make a high quality,&#xD;
      regulated product available. Males aged 18-65, who smoke and who have no intention of&#xD;
      stopping smoking during the trial are eligible to take part in this study. The study consist&#xD;
      of a screening visit, a treatment period with 5 overnight stays with nicotine treatment on&#xD;
      days 1, 2, 3 and 4 with a post study visit on day 5.&#xD;
