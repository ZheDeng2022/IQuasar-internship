    <textblock>
      This study investigates single injection adductor canal block (ACB) with or without&#xD;
      intravenous dexamethasone and adductor canal catheter for pain management of total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty. This is a non-inferiority trial seeking to determine whether single injection&#xD;
      ACB with dexamethasone is &quot;no worse&quot; than a continuous catheter.&#xD;

      1. Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine whether single shot adductor canal nerve blocks with intravenous&#xD;
           dexamethasone are non-inferior to continuous adductor canal blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of adductor canal nerve block with intravenous dexamethasone will not be&#xD;
           inferior to continuous adductor canal blockade for opioid requirements 24h post&#xD;
           operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The single injection adductor canal block without dexamethasone will have the most&#xD;
           opioid consumption. The dexamethasone and catheter groups will be superior to single&#xD;
           injection alone in terms of 12 and 48h opioid consumption, length of stay, anti-emetic&#xD;
           usage, pain score and quality of recovery score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
           Total knee arthroplasty is a very commonly performed operation in North America, with a&#xD;
           high propensity for postoperative pain. Inadequate analgesia limits functional recovery&#xD;
           and leads to delays in hospital discharge, as a result of poor mobility. Effective&#xD;
           analgesia allows for earlier mobilization and improved postoperative recovery, with a&#xD;
           multi-modal regime being the ideal method to achieve this.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Currently a multi-modal regime is provided to patients: intraoperatively with a&#xD;
           neuraxial technique (spinal anesthesia), along with surgeon infiltrated local anesthetic&#xD;
           at the end of the operation, and then postoperatively using systemic opioids via patient&#xD;
           controlled analgesia (PCA). Opioids have many side effects, including nausea and&#xD;
           vomiting, sedation, respiratory depression and urinary retention. These all lead to&#xD;
           delay in ambulation and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Many centers now incorporate peripheral nerve blocks as part of the multi-modal&#xD;
           analgesic regime, with continuous femoral nerve blockade being commonly used for&#xD;
           analgesia. This does decrease the amount of postoperative opioid used, but has the&#xD;
           downside of causing quadriceps muscle weakness leading to an increased risk of falls and&#xD;
           delayed ambulation. For this reason, there has been an increase in the use of the&#xD;
           adductor canal block, a nerve block of the distal femoral nerve at the mid-thigh level,&#xD;
           that has been shown to preserve quadriceps function better than a femoral nerve block,&#xD;
           whilst still ensuring decreased opioid use. To date, no studies have compared single&#xD;
           shot adductor canal block with continuous adductor canal blockade, but both have been&#xD;
           shown to be comparable to femoral nerve blockade, whilst decreasing the likelihood of&#xD;
           quadriceps muscle weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Further to this, it has been shown that the addition of dexamethasone, administered via&#xD;
           the intravenous or perineural route to peripheral nerve blockade, prolongs the duration&#xD;
           of analgesia. Perineural administration of dexamethasone is an off label use and there&#xD;
           is also a theoretical risk of neurotoxicity from dexamethasone itself. Findings to date&#xD;
           indicate that the efficacy of dexamethasone administered intravenously is non-inferior&#xD;
           to perineural injection. Both routes prolong the analgesic benefit of peripheral nerve&#xD;
           blocks with similar reductions in opioid requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Opioid PCA is the most commonly used modality for postoperative analgesia following&#xD;
           total knee arthroplasty. The information from this study will enable ascertainment of&#xD;
           the best method for allowing patients good functional recovery, whilst minimizing opioid&#xD;
           side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of adductor canal nerve block,&#xD;
           with and without intravenous dexamethasone, and continuous adductor canal blockade with&#xD;
           a catheter to ascertain cumulative opioid consumption post-operatively. Specifically,&#xD;
           the trial seeks to answer whether the adductor canal block with dexamethasone fares no&#xD;
           worse (non-inferior) than a continuous catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary aims are to compare the quality of anesthesia recovery using the QoR-40&#xD;
           questionnaire administered at 48 hours postoperatively, pain score, length of hospital&#xD;
           stay, complications of nerve blockade, incidence of catheter dislodgement and opioid&#xD;
           side effects (nausea/vomiting) with the different techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Research Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Trial Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This will be a randomize controlled, non-blinded, non-inferiority trial, involving&#xD;
           patients having primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty. There are three arms:&#xD;
           adductor canal single injection (baseline control), adductor canal single injection plus&#xD;
           dexamethasone (test intervention) and adductor canal catheter (active control).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
           This will be a single-centre trial at UBC Hospital (UBCH).&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior to surgery, for each consented patient, a sealed unmarked opaque envelope will be&#xD;
           opened to determine the modality of analgesia that the patient will receive. The&#xD;
           patients will either receive an adductor canal block postoperatively, an adductor canal&#xD;
           block postoperatively along with intravenous dexamethasone, or have an adductor canal&#xD;
           catheter placed postoperatively for continuous adductor canal blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
           D. Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographic data including patient age, sex, height, weight, BMI, and medications&#xD;
           including analgesics, comorbidities and American Society of Anesthesia (ASA)&#xD;
           classification will be determined from the anesthetic record.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores from 0-10 as well as cumulative opioid&#xD;
           consumption in oral morphine equivalents will be determined at set time points of 12,&#xD;
           24, 48 hours. The data will be determined from the patient's pain flow sheet and&#xD;
           medication administration record (MAR), which are part of the standard charting found on&#xD;
           the hospital ward. Opioid data from PCA will be obtained from the hospital database&#xD;
           which electronically logs usage. The patient's chart will also be used to note&#xD;
           anti-emetic medication usage. At 48 hours, all participants will be provided with a&#xD;
           QoR-40 questionnaire, a validated 40 item questionnaire on the quality of recovery from&#xD;
           anesthesia. The time of discharge will be recorded from the hospital data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Complications from adductor canal catheters will be recorded, such as catheter&#xD;
           dislodgement and site infection. For patients unable to complete the study, the reason&#xD;
           will be noted and data will be included in an intention to treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           E. Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators do not have institutional data of standard deviation (SD) of morphine&#xD;
           equivalent consumption for primary total knee arthroplasty. Based on previous studies,&#xD;
           the standard deviation of morphine equivalent consumption at 24h is estimated to be 20&#xD;
           mg IV. We consider a reduction of 10 mg to be clinically relevant at this time point and&#xD;
           therefore set it as the non-inferiority margin. Using the following online calculator:&#xD;
           https://www.sealedenvelope.com/power/continuous-noninferior/ based on a power of 80% and&#xD;
           significance level of 5%, the number of patients required per group is 50. The aim is to&#xD;
           recruit 60 patients per group to account for potential drop outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data Analysis: Categorical data will be analysed with chi-squared tests. Numeric&#xD;
           variables will be compared with independent T-tests if distributions were normal. If&#xD;
           Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test for normality of distribution was significant non-parametric&#xD;
           Mann Whitney U tests will be utilized. Statistical significance will be assumed if P&#xD;
           &lt;0.05.&#xD;
