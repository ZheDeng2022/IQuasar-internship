      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-center, non-randomized study to assess the mass balance&#xD;
      of a single oral dose of DS-8500a in healthy male subjects, 18 years (y) to 60 y of age,&#xD;
      inclusive. The radiolabeled investigational medicinal product will be administered to 12&#xD;
      healthy male subjects in 2 cohorts of 6 subjects each.&#xD;

             outside the range, not clinically significant and agreed with Sponsor and primary&#xD;
             investigator (PI).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Laboratory results (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) must not be outside&#xD;
             the normal range or if outside the normal range, then the PI considers the value not&#xD;
             clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must agree not to participate in any other investigational study until the&#xD;

             contraceptive, injectables, or subdermal hormonal implant) from the first dose until&#xD;
