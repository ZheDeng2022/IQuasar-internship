      The pain is very common complaint, and the neck is one of the most affected spots, mainly due&#xD;
      to muscle contracture of the cervical and scapular region, triggered by emotional stress&#xD;
      associated with muscle retraction involved resulting from postoperative scarring or&#xD;
      post-radiotherapy.O fear fibrosis move the limb and inactivity postoperative lead to gradual&#xD;
      impairment of muscle strength and flexibility, and loss of ADM, which also predisposes to the&#xD;
      appearance of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals Study the effectiveness of acupuncture in rehabilitation of physical and functional&#xD;
      disorders of women undergoing surgery for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presence of pain by Visual Analog Scale of Pain (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Shoulder Range of Motion (ROM) by active goniometry of flexion movements, extension,&#xD;
           adduction, abduction, internal rotation and external rotation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. lymphedema presence through top member perimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. upper limb function through the DASH questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Depressive symptoms through BECK questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Quality of life through the EORTC questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Muscle strength of flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, internal rotation and&#xD;
           shoulder external rotation with the Hand Held Dynamometer 01,163 model of Lafayette&#xD;
           Instrument Company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into three randomized groups with 30 patients per group, who will&#xD;
      receive weekly treatment for 10 weeks, and the group I treated with standard therapeutic&#xD;
      exercise, pre-defined, based on stretching the neck muscles, shoulder girdle and exercises&#xD;
      for ADM upper limb lasting 30 minutes; group II is treated com30 minutes classical&#xD;
      acupuncture using pre-defined spots, and finally, grupoIII be used in the same acupuncture&#xD;
      points of the group II, but using the Stiper® in place of the needles. If the patients in&#xD;
      groups II and III still of pain at the end of 10 sessions will be treated complementarily&#xD;
      with kinesiotherapy.&#xD;

      Objectives General Study the effectiveness of acupuncture in rehabilitation of physical and&#xD;
      functional disorders of women undergoing surgery for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the (the):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presence of pain by Visual Analog Scale of Pain (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Shoulder Range of Motion (ROM) by active goniometry of flexion movements, extension,&#xD;
           adduction, abduction, internal rotation and external rotation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. lymphedema presence through top member perimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. upper limb function through the DASH questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Depressive symptoms through BECK questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Quality of life through the EORTC questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Muscle strength of flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, internal rotation and&#xD;
           shoulder external rotation with the Hand Held Dynamometer 01,163 model of Lafayette&#xD;
           Instrument Company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rationale The increased incidence of breast cancer and successful treatment result in greater&#xD;
      survival. These patients may have chronic condition of pain in the area of the shoulder&#xD;
      girdle and upper limb, including the thoracic and cervical spine. Knowing that in our&#xD;
      previous project in which the group treated only with kinesiotherapy showed good results and&#xD;
      when joined acupuncture no superiority, the investigators created new research study in order&#xD;
      to determine whether acupuncture and Stiper® in isolated groups, would present equivalence&#xD;
      results when compared to kinesiotherapy.The investigators propose then treat with acupuncture&#xD;
      and analyze the rehabilitation of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      methodology This study will be performed at the Clinic of the Department of Mastology the&#xD;
      Department of Gynecology, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) - Paulista School of&#xD;
      Medicine (EPM). Patients will be recruited, selected and informed about the study objectives,&#xD;
      relevance, activities to be developed and the possibility of improvement, as well as answer&#xD;
      your questions and concerns about the disease. Later the patients who wish to participate in&#xD;
      the study protocol will sign a consent form and specific savy for this project.&#xD;
