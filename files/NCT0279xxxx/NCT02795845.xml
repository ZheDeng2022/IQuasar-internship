  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis (BV), abnormal vaginal flora (AVF) and vulvovaginal&#xD;
      candidiasis (VVC) are associated with serious complications and discomfort. Yet, treatment&#xD;
      options are limited. Lactobacilli administration was suggested to treat and prevent vaginal&#xD;
      infections. However, this has not been examined in pregnant women, the information regarding&#xD;
      oral treatment is scarce, and the mechanisms in which oral ingestion of probiotics induce&#xD;
      vaginal lactobacilli proliferation are not well established. In the present study we will&#xD;
      examine if oral probiotics are effective in prevention of vaginal infections by migration of&#xD;
      lactobacilli from the digestive system to the vagina in pregnant women.&#xD;

      During pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis (BV), abnormal vaginal flora (AVF) and vulvovaginal&#xD;
      candidiasis (VVC) are associated with serious complications and discomfort. Yet, treatment&#xD;
      options are limited. Lactobacilli administration was suggested to treat and prevent vaginal&#xD;
      infections. However, this has not been examined in pregnant women, the information regarding&#xD;
      oral treatment is scarce, and the mechanisms in which oral ingestion of probiotics induce&#xD;
      vaginal lactobacilli proliferation are not well established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis: Oral probiotics will be effective in prevention of vaginal infections by&#xD;
      migration of lactobacilli from the digestive system to the vagina in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of research and methods of data collection: randomized placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant patients with symptoms consisted with vaginal infection will be examined and vaginal&#xD;
      smear will be obtained, according to which the patients will be allocated to the following&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary prevention - women with normal vaginal flora Secondary prevention - women positive&#xD;
      for AVF/BV and/or VVC- those women will be treated with antibiotic and/or antimycotic&#xD;
      treatment. Following treatment, another smear will be taken to confirm infection eradication.&#xD;
      If infection is still present, additional antibiotic and/or antimycotic treatment will be&#xD;
      administered after which additional smear will be taken. Women with normal vaginal flora&#xD;
      (after one of two treatments) will be recruited for the secondary prevention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group the patients will be divided into two subgroups, which will receive one capsule&#xD;
      twice a day of either the Probiotic Femina ׀׀ capsules or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial examination and once a month all the study groups will be tested for the&#xD;
      presence of AVF/BV and candida. Additional vaginal samples will be taken to evaluate the&#xD;
      presence of lactobacilli from the capsule and semi-quantitative assessment of vaginal&#xD;
      lactobacilli.&#xD;
