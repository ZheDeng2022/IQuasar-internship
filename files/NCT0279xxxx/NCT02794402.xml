    <textblock>
      Combat-JUDO (Combating Juvenile Diabetes and Obesity through normalization of beta-cell&#xD;
      function) is part of a collaborative project funded by the Seventh Framework Programme of the&#xD;
      European Commission aiming to develop innovative therapeutic strategies by increasing&#xD;
      pharmacology-based alternatives targeting insulin hypersecretion for the treatment of young&#xD;
      obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of childhood obesity is ranging between 5-25% in Europe. The reason behind&#xD;
      these alarming figures is mostly a changing environment with a more sedative lifestyle and&#xD;
      supply of excess food. However, specific gene mutations have also been linked to obesity and&#xD;
      new genes are continuously being discovered. There are very few effective means of&#xD;
      intervention in children with obesity available today. Obesity is closely associated with a&#xD;
      number of related metabolic diseases and some children with obesity develop the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome at an early stage in life. Individuals with obesity have an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and with the current increase in childhood&#xD;
      obesity, some children will develop T2DM already in their adolescent years with huge impact&#xD;
      on their long-term health and life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle modification interventions, including behavioural treatment, diet modification and&#xD;
      physical activity, are cornerstones of primary and secondary prevention/treatment of&#xD;
      pediatric obesity today. Exenatide is a GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonist&#xD;
      approved for use in adults with T2DM to improve glycemic control. A pilot study with&#xD;
      exenatide treatment in non-diabetic children and adolescents with severe obesity showed a&#xD;
      reduced BMI of approximately 5% and improved markers of insulin resistance and β-cell&#xD;
      function were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Combat-JUDO study is a parallel, double-blind, randomized study comparing lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention + exenatide 2 mg vs lifestyle and intervention + placebo in adolescents with&#xD;
      obesity. The lifestyle intervention includes regular nutritional and psychological support at&#xD;
      4 occasions during the study as well as physical activity on a weekly basis.&#xD;
      Exenatide/placebo is given as a subcutaneous injection once weekly for 24 weeks. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to compare the change in BMI-SDS (according to WHO) from baseline&#xD;
      to the 6 months visit between the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes males and females of age 10-18 years and 5 months with BMI SDS &gt;2.0 or&#xD;
      age-adapted BMI &gt;30 kg/m2.&#xD;
