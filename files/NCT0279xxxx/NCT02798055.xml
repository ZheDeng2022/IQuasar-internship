      GRegistry is a significant collection of data and information on the clinical practice of&#xD;
      systemic scleroderma finger ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GRegistry study is a nationwide (Greece) prospective study recording, which includes&#xD;
      consecutive patients with SC-DU diagnosis in clinical management departments of different&#xD;
      hospitals, selected in such a way as to reflect a representation of the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Bosentan in the treatment of patients suffering from systemic sclerosis with&#xD;
      digital ulcer disease is supported by data from large, placebo-controlled, randomized&#xD;
      studies. The beneficial effect of Bosentan in digital ulcers, a vascular event of systemic&#xD;
      sclerosis consistent with its beneficial effect on pulmonary arterial hypertension associated&#xD;
      with connective tissue disease and its beneficial effect on vascular remodeling.&#xD;

      The existence and use of Patient Registries, represents one of the foundations of the&#xD;
      progressing medical science, both for studying the natural history of diseases as well as to&#xD;
      critically evaluate the therapeutic methods, the collection and analysis of the data from a&#xD;
      large number of hospital units, is essential. Furthermore, the assessment of the&#xD;
      effectiveness and adequacy of health services should be based on long-term monitoring of&#xD;
      large groups of patients, and the assessment of the efficient functioning of the individual&#xD;
      units, is only possible only with the availability of information for the patients of these&#xD;
      units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the record of health services distribution data is a prerequisite for the design of&#xD;
      their future development. The above led to growth of many national and international patient&#xD;
      logs, diseases and specific treatments, the operation of which has contributed to the&#xD;
      advancement of medical science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scleroderma or Systemic Sclerosis (SC) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the connective&#xD;
      tissue with an incidence of 1: 10000- 1: 30000. In Greece it is estimated that there are&#xD;
      approximately 2,500 patients. The disease usually affects women aged 40-60 years, and the&#xD;
      incidence is four women to one man. The pathogenesis of the disease is unknown, while the&#xD;
      main causes are considered genetic and environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two of the most critical complications of the disease, are the Pulmonary Arterial&#xD;
      Hypertension, which occurs in patients with SC approximately 8-12% of patients, being the&#xD;
      main cause of death, and digital ulcers that occur in 30-60 % of patients and are painful&#xD;
      sores on the fingers. Digital ulcers, i.e. painful sores on the fingers, as a consequence of&#xD;
      the limited blood supply of vessels are seen in approximately 30-60 % of patients with&#xD;
      scleroderma. The digital ulcers adversely affect the quality of life of patients, even the&#xD;
      simple daily activities and can lead to serious complications, such as amputation. The&#xD;
      symptoms of scleroderma can vary between patients and may not be typical of this disease, at&#xD;
      least in the early stages, making it difficult to diagnose. Two of the early symptoms are&#xD;
      disturbance of blood supply to the extremities by a color change of the skin of the fingers,&#xD;
      alternately pallor-cyanation-redness (Raynaud phenomenon) and rigid edematous fingers.&#xD;
