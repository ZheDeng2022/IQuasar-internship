      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of different doses of specially prepared T&#xD;
      cells collected from the blood. The investigators want to find a safe dose of these modified&#xD;
      T cells for patients who have metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.&#xD;

    <description>We have designed the dose-escalation using a standard 3+3 design. In this design, patients will be treated in sequential groups of 3 to 6 patients per T cell dose. With 4 dose levels, the projected trial size for this study is a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 24 patients.</description>

    <description>A single blood volume leukapheresis for harvesting of PBMCs will be performed, As the transduced T cells will be frozen, the timing of leukapheresis is not defined &amp; can vary from patient to patient. Subsequently, a single dose of mesothelin-targeted T cells will be infused via intravenous catheter or central line (i.e., mediport). Patients will be monitored in the hospital and discharged home after a minimum of 48 hours. Patients will be monitored closely as outpatients for the next 2 months. Patients will be followed weekly as outpatients for the first 8 weeks after treatment. All patients will be hydrated intravenously, premedicated with acetaminophen &amp; diphenhydramine, &amp; administered cyclophosphamide at 1.5 g/m2 2 to 7 days (Day -7 to Day -2) before administration of mesothelin-targeted T cells.</description>
