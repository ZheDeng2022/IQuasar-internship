  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is a rare and often misdiagnosed cause of Acute&#xD;
      Coronary Syndrome (ACS) affecting predominantly young women without cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors. The origin of SCAD remains uncertain but a strong and frequent association with&#xD;
      Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) has been recently reported based on imaging evidence only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to assess the presence of FMD and its genetic determinants i in a&#xD;
      sample for haematoma or spontaneous coronary artery dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From May 2016 to 2018 we plan to include prospectively and retrospectively 200 patients&#xD;
      admitted for ACS with confirmed diagnosis of SCAD. This study will be conducted in more than&#xD;
      30 French interventional cardiology centers. Coronary angiograms or intracoronary imaging&#xD;
      data will be reviewed by two experienced interventional cardiologist experts in SCAD&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient a genetic analysis will be performed. A systematic screening for FMD will be&#xD;
      realized by computed tomographic or MRI angiography of renal, cerebrovascular and iliac&#xD;
      arteries and reviewed by two experienced radiologists. A one year follow-up is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to confirm the presumed association of FMD and SCAD through the exploration&#xD;
      of several artery beds and the study of confirmed genetic determinants, which has never been&#xD;
      described previously to our knowledge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The recruitment of patients takes place in each interventional cardiology department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients can be included in a retrospective way (for SCAD occurred from 2010) or&#xD;
      forward-looking way. The patients are informed about this study by the investigator. After a&#xD;
      reflection period and an answer to the possible questions, the patient is included. The&#xD;
      informed consent is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient included with a SCAD or hematoma, will systematic benefit a tomographic or MRI&#xD;
      angiography of renal, cerebrovascular and iliac arteries, to look for the presence of a&#xD;
      fibromuscular displasia. A blood sample will be collected for the genetic analysis which will&#xD;
      be realized by the Team 3 of the INSERM UMR970, Paris Cardiovascular research Center, France.&#xD;
