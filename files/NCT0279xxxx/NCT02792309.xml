      Mathematica was awarded a contract by ACF to conduct the evaluation of selected grantees&#xD;
      offering Healthy Marriage and Relationship Education Programs.This particular evaluation will&#xD;
      focus on the University of Denver's MotherWise program, which offers relationship education&#xD;
      and other supports to low-income women expecting a baby. The program has three core&#xD;
      components: (1) 18 hours of core workshop sessions using the Within My Reach relationship&#xD;
      education curriculum supplemented with content on mother-infant relationships; (2) case&#xD;
      management services; and (3) optional relationship education workshops for couples. The&#xD;
      evaluation will test the effect of this full package of services on mothers' relationship&#xD;
      outcomes, as well as other outcomes related to child well-being, such as co-parenting and&#xD;
      father involvement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and&#xD;
      Families (ACF), is conducting an evaluation of healthy marriage and relationship education&#xD;
      (HMRE) programs. Mathematica was awarded a contract by ACF to conduct the evaluation of&#xD;
      selected programs/grantees.This segment of the larger evaluation will focus on the University&#xD;
      of Denver's MotherWise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mother Wise program will offer relationship education and other supports to low-income&#xD;
      women expecting a baby. The program will have three core components: (1) 18 hours of core&#xD;
      workshop sessions using the Within My Reach relationship education curriculum supplemented&#xD;
      with content on mother-infant relationships; (2) case management services; and (3) optional&#xD;
      relationship education workshops for couples. The evaluation will test the effect of this&#xD;
      full package of services on mothers' relationship outcomes, as well as other outcomes related&#xD;
      to child well-being, such as co-parenting and father involvement. If feasible, the evaluation&#xD;
      will also examine some measures available through hospital records, such as birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mother Wise will enroll women who are expecting a baby and those who have had a baby within&#xD;
      the past month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group members will not be eligible for Mother Wise but will be eligible for other&#xD;
      services available in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To document the outcomes of study participants, survey data will be collected at two time&#xD;
      points: (1) a baseline survey administered at study enrollment, a (2) a 12-month follow-up&#xD;
      survey, and (3) a 30-month follow-up survey. Surveys will be conducted by staff at&#xD;
      Mathematica's Survey Operations Center using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI).&#xD;
      Survey data may be supplemented with administrative records data from the Denver Health&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
