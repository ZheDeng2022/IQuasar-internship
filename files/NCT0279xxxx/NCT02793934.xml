    <textblock>
      The program is performed in the in-patient and out-patient rehabilitation departments in 13&#xD;
      regions of the Russian Federation (total 244 departments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic goals of the Programme are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop the system of organizations for medical rehabilitation providing succession&#xD;
           of rehabilitation care in Russia with covering all needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To improve the accessibility for rehabilitation care by the system of successive&#xD;
           3-stages and 3-level medical rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop the multidisciplinary approaches on medical rehabilitation in each stages and&#xD;
           in medical organizations of different levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To improve patient's daily living activity, functioning, enable participation, reduce&#xD;
           sick-leaves duration and working absenteeism, increase social role in community, prevent&#xD;
           pain recurrence and chronicity, prevent recurrent events and hospitalizations&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To develop the efficacy criteria for medical rehabilitation on each stages of&#xD;
           rehabilitation and establishing the logistic pathways for patients during rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To implement the educational programmes for personnel on PRM according to the European&#xD;
           model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Preparation for introducing the new specialty in Russia - doctor of PRM&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To establish the financial methods of calculating the costs and tariffs of&#xD;
           rehabilitation care for patients with different diseases/conditions in each stage of&#xD;
           rehabilitation and in medical organizations of different levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To improve the financial efficacy of medical rehabilitation and substantiation for new&#xD;
           tariff prices for rehabilitation care&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the &quot;new&quot; model of medical rehabilitation system&#xD;
           compared to the traditional model in the multicenter study, in patients with ACE, AMI&#xD;
           and THR.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of the &quot;new&quot; model of medical rehabilitation compared&#xD;
           to the &quot;old&quot; model in patients with ACE, AMI and THR by following indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
           in-hospital and 3-months mortality , the number of complications, length of hospital&#xD;
           stay, the degree of recovery of functions, activities and participation. To calculate&#xD;
           the economic advantage of the &quot;new&quot; model of medical rehabilitation in patients with&#xD;
           ACE, AMI and THR by the calculation of the financial cost of one case of and of the&#xD;
           complete course of rehabilitation To study characteristics of disorders of functioning&#xD;
           and participation. To develop the methodological framework for the establishment of a&#xD;
           register of patients receiving rehabilitation in Russia.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. To develop basics for establishing a quality assessment system of rehabilitative care in&#xD;
           the Russian Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences between the new and the old model of rehabilitation are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The doctor-patient relationship In the old model - Patient is passive recipient of the&#xD;
           service In the new model - The patient-oriented approach&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diagnosis In the old model -According to the International Classification of Diseases&#xD;
           (ICD-10) In the new model - ICD -10 and ICF&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Doctors tasks In the old model - To assign the necessary consultation of experts&#xD;
           conducting rehabilitation activities in accordance with the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the new model - To organize the discussion about the patients problems, to formulate&#xD;
           how to achieve the goals of rehabilitation and short-term and long-term outcomes, to&#xD;
           evaluate the criteria of rehabilitation treatment, to organize an effective use of time&#xD;
           and equipment required for rehabilitation adequately address problems of technology&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Education In the old model - Education on separated specialties on physiotherapy&#xD;
           (kinesiotherapy), acupuncture (RTI), massage therapy, speech therapy, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the new model - The unified system of education for all professionals for medical&#xD;
           rehabilitation in accordance with the European training program for the doctor of&#xD;
           Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, the modular principle, network form of educational&#xD;
           programs&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Work organization In the old model - Everyone works in accordance with the official&#xD;
           duties, each expert is free to decide what treatment should be done for patient&#xD;
           (kinesiotherapist, psychologist etc) In the new model - Multidisciplinary approach.&#xD;
           Experts in the joint discussion set the goal of rehabilitation, tasks, time solutions,&#xD;
           performers, based on the patient's needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The composition of the rehabilitation team In the old model - Instructor-methodologist&#xD;
           and exercise therapy doctor, physiotherapy doctor and nurse, massage nurse, speech&#xD;
           therapist, clinical psychologist, nurse In the new model - Clinician on relevant&#xD;
           specialty, the instructor-methodologist of physical therapy and a physician, doctor and&#xD;
           nurse on physiotherapy, ergotherapist, physiotherapy instructor, massage nurse, a speech&#xD;
           therapist, a clinical psychologist , nurse&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. length of stay In the old model -Fixed (14, 21 and 30 days, depends on the stage of&#xD;
           rehabilitation) in accordance with the National regulations of care In the new model&#xD;
           -Duration of stay in this programme depends on the goals and objectives individually for&#xD;
           each patient. When the goals, objectives and the achievement of certain clinical /&#xD;
           instrumental parameters are reached patient is transferred to the next stage or&#xD;
           discharged&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The criteria to refer of patient to the next stage of rehabilitation In the old model&#xD;
           -completion of the standard course of care In the new model -A single algorithm for&#xD;
           completion of rehabilitation at a certain stage (for all project participants) when the&#xD;
           goals and objectives are reached&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Payment case In the old model -Fixed tariff for the completed case Diagnosis related&#xD;
           group (DRG) In the new model -According to clinical and statistical group on each of the&#xD;
           three stages of rehabilitation - case mix group (CMG)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The volume of work done In the old model -According to the regulations and standards of&#xD;
           treatment In the new model -Required to achieve the objectives in each case&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. An audit of the rehabilitation measures In the old model -no In the new model -Internal&#xD;
           and external Inclusion/exclusion criteria The inclusion and exclusion criteria to the&#xD;
           programme are defined by the Russian professional association (ARUR) and more precisely&#xD;
           described in the Protocols of Pilot Project (Neurology, Cardiology and Orthopedia&#xD;
           Protocols, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Programme is focused on adult patients of any gender and age more than 18 y.o., with the&#xD;
      next conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acute cerebrovascular events (ACE, ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage -&#xD;
           specialty neurology)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI, specialty cardiology)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients after total hip replacement (THR, specialty orthopaedia)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our management of stroke, AMI and THR refers to international guidelines although scientific&#xD;
      evidence is still lacking for some physical techniques. Our programme is based on an&#xD;
      individual approach of each patient. During different phases of the diseases we put emphasis&#xD;
      on adequate drug treatment, increasing of exercise's tolerance, gradual mobilization and&#xD;
      verticalization with simultaneous improvement of daily activity, increasing of mobility and&#xD;
      self-servicing, improvement of activity and participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and patient rights are defined by National regulations, national law and internal&#xD;
      rules. Each patient signs an informed consent form. Each patient signs an informed consent.&#xD;
      The patient and his/her relatives are invited to participate in multidisciplinary team&#xD;
      meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient's medical and functional information, assessment and further monitoring data is&#xD;
      recorded manually into a standardized medical documentation. It is fulfilled at the entry and&#xD;
      on discharge from each level of the treatment. All the Programme documents are stored in the&#xD;
      clinical archive and are accessible for periodic internal or external audit and outcomes&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most features of the Pilot Project in Russia is the using of ICF for the&#xD;
      assessment of efficacy of medical rehabilitation and for the configuring of activity for&#xD;
      individualized rehabilitation processes For each model of patient included to the Pilot&#xD;
      Project the set of domains of ICF have been created . Analysis of ICF domains will be done&#xD;
      automatically by the soft &quot;ICF-reader&quot;. The program &quot;ICF-reader&quot; also can help to generate&#xD;
      documentation for the adoption of the patient or the patient's discharge or transfer. The&#xD;
      main function of the &quot;ICF-reader&quot; is the accumulation and analysis of all the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient is assigned a unique number, which allows to identify him/her at the electronic&#xD;
      database of the program &quot;ICF-reader&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each center is responsible for working with the program &quot;ICF-reader&quot;. In the second phase of&#xD;
      the Pilot Project, program &quot;ICF-reader&quot; will give an opportunity to establish a&#xD;
      rehabilitation diagnosis on the basis of the ICF, and the option for ICF assessment using&#xD;
      rating scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 1st stage of rehabilitation patients to be included to the programme after detailed&#xD;
      examination, stabilization of condition and assessment of rehabilitation potential. On the&#xD;
      basis of primary examination with the using of ICF tools individualized programme of&#xD;
      rehabilitation, goals of rehabilitation and methods and technologies are established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transfer of patient from one stage of rehabilitation to another depends on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      achievement of defined goals and functional parameters (data of laboratory, instrumental,&#xD;
      functional methods, results of clinical examination by appropriate scales), assessment of&#xD;
      activity and participation achievement of requirements of National regulations (number of&#xD;
      appropriate diagnostic methods, prespecified treatment, prevention procedures etc) The degree&#xD;
      of functional disturbances is assessed by appropriate diagnostic methods: laboratory,&#xD;
      instrumental and clinical .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referral patients: At the 1st stage of rehabilitation (in acute unit) patients should be&#xD;
      included to rehabilitation process during the first 48 hours after onset of event or surgery&#xD;
      after examination of doctor (trained on PRM) and other members of multidisciplinary team.&#xD;
      Each member of multidisciplinary team assesses a patient at the beginning and at the end of&#xD;
      each stage of rehabilitation by appropriate pre-defined clinical scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 2nd stage of rehabilitation patients should be included to rehabilitation process just&#xD;
      after admission from the 1st stage (by referral of PRM doctor of the 1st stage) At the 3rd&#xD;
      stage of rehabilitation patients should be included to rehabilitation process after admission&#xD;
      from the 1st or 2nd stages (by referral of PRM doctor of the 1st or 2nd stages, by referral&#xD;
      of general practitioner after assessment of multidisciplinary team).&#xD;
