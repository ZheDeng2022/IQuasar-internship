    <textblock>
      Objective: To develop and evaluate a technology-augmented self-monitoring model using a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to demonstrate whether patients with co-morbid type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and hypertension can improve their glycemic and blood pressure control, adherence to&#xD;
      medication regimens, and other relevant outcomes by using a tablet-based consumer health&#xD;
      information technology (CHIT) to support the self-monitoring and self-management of their&#xD;
      chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A two-group, randomized controlled trial with follow-up assessments 8, 12, 16, and 24&#xD;
      weeks after the baseline evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Patients' homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Two hundred and ninety-six adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      hypertension who receive their health care from a local community health service network or a&#xD;
      major hospital will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Participants in the technology-augmented self-monitoring model (intervention&#xD;
      group) will use a tablet-based, interactive touch screen self-monitoring system to monitor&#xD;
      and manage their chronic conditions. The system is designed to augment patients' abilities to&#xD;
      assess, record, and review their health signs while providing text-, audio-, and video-based&#xD;
      resources supporting disease self-care. The participants in the usual-care group will perform&#xD;
      conventional self-monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes will be glycemic control measured by changes in&#xD;
      HbA1c,blood pressure control assessed by changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure,&#xD;
      and medication compliance. The secondary outcomes will be adherence to diabetes and&#xD;
      hypertension self-care activities and knowledge of diabetes and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implication: This study will improve our understanding of the clinical value of CHITs in&#xD;
      chronic disease self-monitoring and self-management.&#xD;

      Subject recruitment: The person-in-charge/managers of the departments of the hospitals/the&#xD;
      health service centers will go through the in-house medical documents to identify adults with&#xD;
      a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and invite them to attend an information&#xD;
      session, in which the project's lead PI (Dr. Calvin Or) and research assistants will&#xD;
      introduce the study; determine their eligibility based on their self-reported demographic&#xD;
      data, health information, and/or medical records; and collect their contact information.&#xD;
      Later, the research assistant will telephone the eligible patients to schedule a first visit&#xD;
      to their homes for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The participants randomized to the intervention group will be given a&#xD;
      tablet-based, interactive touch-screen self-monitoring system free of charge to perform&#xD;
      disease self-monitoring in their homes. The objectives of the system are to empower patients'&#xD;
      ability to self-monitor and improve their self-care adherence and medication compliance by&#xD;
      enabling access to various e-support, information, resources, and self-monitoring tools in a&#xD;
      timely manner. It runs on a 10-inch touch-screen tablet computer that is programmed to&#xD;
      connect to a 2-in-1 blood pressure and glucose monitor. Measurement modules are available for&#xD;
      assessing and recording blood pressure, pulse, and blood glucose level. The assessment&#xD;
      records are fully automated and can be retrieved and reviewed in structured tables and&#xD;
      charts. Patients can determine whether assessment values that deviate from the critical&#xD;
      levels may need attention based on the &quot;normal value ranges&quot; indicated by the system. The&#xD;
      system also has a module that provides both text- and video-based learning resources related&#xD;
      to the causes and prevention of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, self-care, salt and sodium&#xD;
      intake, diet, action plan (e.g., appropriate actions in response to symptoms), exercise, and&#xD;
      stress management. The care information and video capability allow patients to easily learn&#xD;
      how to self-monitor and self-manage. In addition, the system has a reminder function that can&#xD;
      be programmed to emit audible reminders at predetermined times alerting patients to take&#xD;
      their prescribed medications. A secured web portal (http://selfcare.imse.hku.hk/) is&#xD;
      available for authorized, non-patient users such as caregivers and families to remotely&#xD;
      review and monitor the assessment values of key patient health signs using their own mobile&#xD;
      devices or computers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Participants will be stratified into four groups based on the HbA1c and&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure measurements: (i) HbA1c ≤ 8% and systolic BP ≤ 159 mm Hg, (ii) HbA1c&#xD;
      ≤ 8% and systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg, (iii) HbA1c &gt; 8% and systolic BP ≤ 159 mm Hg, and (iv)&#xD;
      HbA1c &gt; 8% and systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg. These cut-offs for grouping were set based on&#xD;
      previous studies (2, 3) and clinical judgement. Within each stratum, the patients will be&#xD;
      block-randomized into the study groups using randomly permuted blocks and sequentially&#xD;
      numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The randomization and allocation process will be based on&#xD;
      the practical guide for permuted blocks randomization in a stratified trial, as described in&#xD;
      Doig and Simpson (4), and handled centrally by a researcher in response to a telephone call.&#xD;
