  <brief_summary>

      The main aim of this study is to describe the morphology, size distributions and specific&#xD;
      markers of the different vesicles populations present in the human endometrial fluid. To&#xD;
      further characterize the vesicles populations, contents of these membrane compartments (i.e.:&#xD;
      DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids and other small metabolites) will be assessed by using mass&#xD;
      spectrometry and next generation sequencing techniques. The objective here is to relate a&#xD;
      specific vesicles composition to the moment of the cycle, to a normal physiological&#xD;
      endometrial function and to the transmission of functionalities from the mother to the&#xD;
      embryo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last decades, the emission of membrane enclosed compartments, more commonly regarded&#xD;
      as extracellular vesicles, has been established as a new mechanism of communication either&#xD;
      between cells of a complex organism, between unicellular organisms or between unicellular&#xD;
      organism and host. These vesicles have been described in all body fluids and are currently&#xD;
      classified into three types according to the mechanism by which they are formed: exosomes,&#xD;
      with sizes ranging from 30 to 150 nm (formed intracellularly); microvesicles, between 100 and&#xD;
      1000 nm (formed from the cell membrane) and apoptotic bodies, with sizes greater than 1 Âµm&#xD;
      (produced by cells undergoing programmed cell death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial fluid is a viscous liquid present in the uterine cavity originating from the&#xD;
      different cell types that form the uterus and serum exudates. It offers a precise view of the&#xD;
      context in which the embryo implants and can be retrieved by a minimally invasive technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this pilot study is to isolate and characterize the extracellular&#xD;
      vesicles secreted by the endometrium to the endometrial fluid, being this the first time that&#xD;
      this fact is being described. It is intended to standardize a method for the isolation of the&#xD;
      different vesicles populations present within the endometrial fluid (i.e.: apoptotic bodies,&#xD;
      microvesicles and exosomes), based on serial differential centrifugations and filtration.&#xD;
      Morphological characterization of the isolated vesicles will be done at three levels: study&#xD;
      of the external morphology by transmission electron microscopy, characterization of the&#xD;
      different vesicles populations surface markers by Western Blot and analysis of the vesicles&#xD;
      populations size distributions by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study is directed to assess the content of the extracellular vesicles&#xD;
      throughout the menstrual cycle. For this purpose, a canonical menstrual cycle of 28 to 30&#xD;
      days has been classified in 5 phases: phase I (days 0-8), phase II (days 9-14), phase III&#xD;
      (days 15-18), phase IV (days 19-24) and phase V (25 to 30). The experimental design for&#xD;
      vesicles contents description consists of two levels of comparison: (1) analysis of&#xD;
      differential contents of the different populations of vesicles in the same phase of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle and for each of the phases and (2) analysis of differential contents of the&#xD;
      same population of vesicles in each phase of the cycle and for each of the vesicular&#xD;
      populations. This characterization of the vesicular contents will be made using mass&#xD;
      spectrometry techniques to analyze the protein, lipid and other small metabolites&#xD;
      composition. Their presence aims to be related both to the moment of the cycle and to a&#xD;
      normal physiological function of the endometrium. On the other hand, analysis of DNA and RNA&#xD;
      contents of these vesicular populations by massive sequencing will be performed. The&#xD;
      objective here is to analyze the transmission of functionalities to target cells as well as&#xD;
      the potential predictive usefulness of these molecules to determine the moment of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle.&#xD;
