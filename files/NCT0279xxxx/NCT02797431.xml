      A multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of two dosing frequencies&#xD;
      of recombinant Interleukin-7 (CYT107) treatment to restore absolute lymphocyte counts in&#xD;
      sepsis patients; IRIS-7A (Immune Reconstitution of Immunosuppressed Sepsis patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parallel study will be performed in United State of America to allow a common statistical&#xD;
      analysis of the primary end points and analysis for the enrolled patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients in most intensive care units&#xD;
      in Europe and the US. Recently, evidence has accumulated that sepsis progresses from a state&#xD;
      of hyper-inflammation to a state of immunosuppression. This immunosuppressive phase is&#xD;
      characterized by increased incidence of secondary infections often with relatively avirulent&#xD;
      opportunistic type pathogens. Currently, new therapeutic approaches to sepsis are occurring&#xD;
      using immuno-adjuvants that boost host immunity. One of the most promising agents&#xD;
      Interleukin-7 is an essential, non-redundant, pluripotent cytokine produced mainly by bone&#xD;
      marrow and thymic stromal cells that is required for T-cell survival.In addition to its&#xD;
      anti-apoptotic properties, IL-7 induces potent proliferation of naïve and memory T-cells&#xD;
      potentially supporting replenishment of the peripheral T-cell pool which is severely depleted&#xD;
      during sepsis. These effects were confirmed in clinical trials at the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute and in HIV+ patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study will test the ability of IL-7 to restore the absolute lymphocyte counts&#xD;
      in septic patients who have markedly reduced levels of circulating lymphocytes. An effect&#xD;
      already confirmed in preclinical models of sepsis.&#xD;
