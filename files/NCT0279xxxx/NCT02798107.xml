  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) that binds to dabigatran with&#xD;
      very high affinity. Idarucizumab potently and specifically binds to dabigatran and its&#xD;
      metabolites and neutralises its anticoagulant effect. A clinical development program is&#xD;
      ongoing to support marketing authorisation submissions for idarucizumab indicated in patients&#xD;
      treated with dabigatran who require emergency surgery/urgent procedures or who have a&#xD;
      life-threatening or uncontrolledbleeding when rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effects of&#xD;
      dabigatran is required.&#xD;
