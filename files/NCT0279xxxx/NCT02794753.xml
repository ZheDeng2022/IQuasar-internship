    <textblock>
      Introduction and conceptualization Hair-pulling disorder (HPD) has not received much&#xD;
      attention in comparison to other psychiatric illnesses. Considering South African research,&#xD;
      only a limited number of studies have focused on HPD with minimal focus on treatment&#xD;
      interventions. Several treatments with regards to pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy have been&#xD;
      developed and investigated. Evidence suggests limited efficacy of these treatments, thus&#xD;
      there is a need for an intervention that shows better efficacy in symptom reduction with&#xD;
      longer maintenance of treatment gains, whilst also being cost-effective and easily&#xD;
      accessible. Studies have indicated that patients with HPD experience difficulty in working&#xD;
      memory (WM), impulse control (IC) and emotion regulation (ER). The involvement of the&#xD;
      frontoparietal circuitry, as well as frontal cortex, amygdalo-hippocampal formation and&#xD;
      putamen have been specified in HPD. WM and ER circuitry are both based in the frontoparietal&#xD;
      neural circuit, and thus training of WM shows potential to also address ER difficulties. An&#xD;
      intervention focusing on WM training, may promise to address difficulties in IC and ER, and&#xD;
      thus be appropriate in the treatment of patients with HPD. Cognitive training (CT) is a novel&#xD;
      intervention that focuses on enhancing executive functioning and more specifically WM. WM&#xD;
      tasks in CT also focus on the frontoparietal network which plays a role in ER, and therefore&#xD;
      when this network is activated by executive functioning tasks, ER should improve. The&#xD;
      positive impact of computerized cognitive training (CCT) on neuroplasticity in these&#xD;
      indicated pathways have recently been acknowledged. Psychotherapeutic support might not be&#xD;
      readily available or accessible to most people in developing countries, such as South Africa.&#xD;
      Indeed, locally the physical distance from mental health centres and cost of individual&#xD;
      sessions with health care professionals, are challenging - preventing patients finding the&#xD;
      help that they need. CT can thus be a more accessible and cost-effective alternative. Cogmed&#xD;
      Working Memory Training, an internet-based CT program, will be investigated for its efficacy&#xD;
      in the treatment of HPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study: The principal aim of this project is to establish the impact of CT in&#xD;
      patients with primary HPD. Study findings will also provide information on whether an&#xD;
      internet based CT intervention, done at patients' homes, is feasible as a mode of treatment&#xD;
      for HPD patients in SA. The proposed research will focus on the following objectives: To&#xD;
      determine the effect of CT (25 sessions over 5 weeks) on WM, ER, IC and hair-pulling severity&#xD;
      (HPS), in patients with HPD. To determine whether the effect of the true CT program on WM,&#xD;
      ER, IC and HPS differed from that of the active control program. To determine whether effects&#xD;
      are maintained at 3 months post-intervention. To qualitatively explore participants'&#xD;
      subjective experience of the intervention process and responses to CT (in terms of WM, ER, IC&#xD;
      and HPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that after 5 weeks of CT, the treatment HPD group will show significant&#xD;
      improvement in WM, ER, IC and significant reduction in HPS. The effect of the true CT program&#xD;
      on WM, ER, IC and HPS will be significantly different from the active control group. During a&#xD;
      3-month follow-up evaluation, the HPD intervention group will have maintained reduction in&#xD;
      symptoms after the treatment, compared to the active control HPD group. The treatment HPD&#xD;
      group will generally be positive about the effects of CT on HPD and their functioning at&#xD;
      post-intervention and 3-month follow-up and consider CT as easy to use and affordable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study design is a 5-week, 25-session intervention study with an active&#xD;
      control, and 3-month follow-up evaluation. As a registered clinical psychologist, the&#xD;
      principal investigator has the expertise to diagnose, do clinical interviews, and implement&#xD;
      the psychometric battery pre and post intervention. Inclusion criteria is a primary diagnosis&#xD;
      of HPD (DSM-5); Adults (18 years and older); Fluent in English; Access to the internet for&#xD;
      the duration of their study participation. Exclusion criteria is any significant current DSM&#xD;
      comorbidity; Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Score &gt; 20 to exclude patients&#xD;
      with comorbid depressive syndromes; Previous exposure to cognitive training (previous 'brain&#xD;
      training' games on cell phone and/or computer allowed). The criteria will be assessed during&#xD;
      the screening procedure. Participants will enter the study as recruited and randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the treatment or active control group. Participants entering the study will be randomized&#xD;
      into the intervention or active control group, using a randomization list provided by the&#xD;
      statistician. The intervention task (Cogmed QM) and the placebo (Jigsaw Puzzles) differ&#xD;
      significantly. The principal investigator will not be blind to the group that the&#xD;
      participants are in, whereas the participants will be blind to their group inclusion. It is&#xD;
      aimed to achieve a sample size of at least 40 (20 treatment, 20 active control). This is&#xD;
      comparable to group sizes in other HPD treatment studies. The research method is based in&#xD;
      embedded theory design, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative components. The benefit&#xD;
      of this hybrid approach is to be able to investigate and describe subject matter with&#xD;
      statistical power, as well as being able to comment on the participant's experience, thus&#xD;
      creating a richer and more holistic description of the research theme. The quantitative&#xD;
      research consists of the pre- and post intervention assessment battery, 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      evaluation and continuous information provided by the treatment intervention (Cogmed). The&#xD;
      qualitative data analysis will be done on semi-structured interviews, as part of the pre- and&#xD;
      post assessment battery and 3-month follow-up evaluation. Pre- and post intervention data&#xD;
      collection will be done by the principal investigator by means of the assessment battery&#xD;
      including both quantitative and qualitative measures. Statistical analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      using mixed model repeated measures ANOVA, which is most suitable for dealing with possible&#xD;
      lost to follow-up. Patients in the study will be treated as random effects (randomly selected&#xD;
      from a larger population). Treatment (intervention vs placebo) and time (pre, post, 3 months)&#xD;
      will be treated as fixed effects. The treatment*time interaction effect will be the primary&#xD;
      effect of investigation because it tests whether the change over time is the same for the two&#xD;
      groups. If the intervention has a different effect to the placebo, then this interaction&#xD;
      effect should be significant. Post hoc testing will be done using Fisher Least Significant&#xD;
      Difference (LSD) testing. Normality assumptions will be checked for all analyses and&#xD;
      appropriately dealt with if necessary, based on the nature of the data. A 5% significance&#xD;
      level will be used as guideline for significant results. The qualitative data will be&#xD;
      analysed using an interpretative phenomenological approach (TerreBlanche, Durrheim, &amp; Kelly,&#xD;
      2010), utilizing a qualitative data analysis software program, Atlas.ti.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated benefits and risks: CT has not been investigated as a treatment intervention for&#xD;
      HPD and reduction of HPS cannot be guaranteed. However, HPS may reduce during the true CT&#xD;
      program. Participants, who are part of the placebo group, will get the opportunity to access&#xD;
      the true CT program on completion of the study. Except for the fact that they might not be in&#xD;
      the treatment group for the duration of the study due to randomization, there are no known&#xD;
      risks involved in participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations: The study procedures, risks and benefits will be communicated in lay&#xD;
      terminology to all participants (verbally and in writing) in Afrikaans or English. All data&#xD;
      collected will be kept strictly confidential and study results made public and published&#xD;
      without compromising confidentiality. The demographics questionnaire will be removed from the&#xD;
      questionnaire pack to ensure that the completed questionnaires and the demographic details&#xD;
      cannot be linked. Personal identifying details such as the name and contact information will&#xD;
      not be recorded on the electronic database. All participants will be allocated a unique study&#xD;
      code on the electronic database. Identifiers linked to a study code will be kept in a&#xD;
      separate, password protected file. Only the principal investigator will have access to this&#xD;
      information. It will be clearly indicated that the participant is free to withdraw&#xD;
      participation from this trial, without consequence. Participating individuals will incur no&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
