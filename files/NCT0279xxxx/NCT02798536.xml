      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LMB-100 is a man-made protein. It is attracted to the mesothelin protein. This is found in&#xD;
      many tumors, including mesothelioma. But it is found in only a very small number of normal&#xD;
      tissues. After binding to mesothelin on tumors, LMB-100 attacks and kills cancer cells.&#xD;
      Researchers want to test LMB-100 in people with advanced mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe dose and anti-tumor activity of LMB-100 for people with advanced mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma that has not responded to platinum-based&#xD;
&#xD;
      therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of tumor tissue or tumor fluid. These can be new or from a previous procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT or MRI scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDG-PET scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get LMB-100 on days 1, 3, and 5 of each 21-day cycle. It will be given&#xD;
      through an IV catheter, a tube inserted in an arm vein. They will get standard medicines&#xD;
      before each infusion to help prevent side effects. Each infusion lasts about 30 minutes. They&#xD;
      will be monitored for up to 2 hours after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each cycle, participants will repeat the screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drug for up to 4 cycles or until their disease worsens or&#xD;
      they have intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4 6 weeks after their last infusion, participants will have a follow-up visit. They&#xD;
      will repeat the study tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up scans every 6 weeks until their disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be called about once a year to see how they are doing.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although mesothelioma patients with a limited tumor burden may benefit from surgical&#xD;
           resection, most patients have advanced disease at diagnosis and are not candidates for&#xD;
           cytoreductive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For mesothelioma patients who are not eligible for curative surgery, the median survival&#xD;
           with supportive care alone is 6 months whereas with the current standard treatment, a&#xD;
           combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed, the median survival is 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mesothelin, a tumor differentiation antigen, is expressed in over 95% of epitheloid&#xD;
           mesothelioma. Mesothelin is a suitable candidate for targeted therapy due to its very&#xD;
           limited expression in normal human tissue and its high expression in several tumors&#xD;
           including mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LMB-100 is a novel recombinant anti-mesothelin immunotoxin developed for the treatment&#xD;
           of patients with solid tumors that express mesothelin. Mesothelin is targeted by linking&#xD;
           a humanized fragment of the anti-mesothelin Fab to a de-immunized Pseudomonas exotoxin&#xD;
           (PE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical use of first generation immunotoxins such as SS1P was hampered mainly by&#xD;
           their high immunogenicity. LMB-100 is a next generation PE-fusion protein that has been&#xD;
           protein-engineered to maximally reduce its immunogenicity. LMB-100 has shown broad&#xD;
           activity against different mesothelinexpressing cancer cell lines and tumor xenograft&#xD;
           models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LMB-100 in patients with treatment&#xD;
      refractory advanced epithelioid or biphasic mesothelioma and evaluate potential efficacy of&#xD;
      the identified PP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of LMB-100 with respect to objective response rate in patients with&#xD;
      treatment refractory advanced epithelioid or biphasic mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed advanced pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must have had at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen with last dose of previous&#xD;
           therapy occurring at 3 weeks before the start of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with CNS metastases or prior pneumonectomy are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase I, open-label study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
           activity of LMB-100 in patients with treatment refractory advanced epithelioid or&#xD;
           biphasic mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LMB-100 will be administered intravenously on days 1, 3 and 5 of each 21 day cycle for&#xD;
           up to 4 cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor response will be assessed after every 2 cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional tumor biopsies may be collected at baseline and after 2 cycles of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The accrual ceiling will be set at 30&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active or uncontrolled infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV or active HBV or HCV infection. HIV positive patients will be excluded due to a&#xD;
             theoretical concern that the degree of immune suppression associated with the&#xD;
             treatment may result in progression of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior pneumonectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Live attenuated vaccinations 14 days prior to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with LMB-100, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with LMB-100. These potential risks may also&#xD;
             apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of LMB-100&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High doses of systemic corticosteroids within 7 days prior to first dosing. High dose&#xD;
             is considered as &gt; 20 mg of dexamethasone a day (or equivalent) for &gt; 7 consecutive&#xD;
             days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (Cohort B only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have received paclitaxel nor nab-paclitaxel within 4 months prior to&#xD;
