    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study of investigational agent CFI-402257 in patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see how safe and tolerable CFI-402257 is in cancer patients&#xD;
      as well as the pharmacokinetics (PK). This study is the first time that CFI-402257 is given&#xD;
      to humans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CFI-402257 is an oral drug that blocks TTK protein kinase (also known as Monopolar spindle 1&#xD;
      [Mps1]) activity. TTK is a protein that is important in regulating cell growth, and cell&#xD;
      death, and ensuring proper division. Many tumors are shown to make too much TTK. When there&#xD;
      is too much TTK produced, it is believed to contribute to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and&#xD;
      division leading to additional mutations in cancer cells. Therefore, it is believed that&#xD;
      blocking this protein from working will lead to cancer cell death, stopping tumors from&#xD;
      growing or shrinking them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation part tested different dose levels of study drug in groups of patients to&#xD;
      find the highest dose of study drug that can be given safely to patients (called maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose or MTD). This part of the study is now complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion part will further assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of the MTD found in&#xD;
      the escalation part of the study in additional group of patients.&#xD;
