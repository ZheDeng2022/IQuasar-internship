    <textblock>
      As iodinate contrast media (CM) has been widely used in current medical practice, contrast&#xD;
      induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) has been an important issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, many guidelines suggested prophylaxis protocol using 0.9% saline when CM is&#xD;
      administrated to high risk patients. However, recent studies showed that 0.9% saline might&#xD;
      induce metabolic acidosis due to its supra-physiologic chloride component, and therefore&#xD;
      renal vasoconstriction. In spite of protective effect by volume expansion with saline&#xD;
      infusion, this renal vasoconstriction might have conflicting effect on renal function, as&#xD;
      hypoxic injury is suspected to be the main cause of CI-AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to 0.9% saline, balanced salt solution has physiologic level of chloride and&#xD;
      neutral pH. Also, recent studies proved preventive effect of balanced salt solution for AKI&#xD;
      in several clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the investigators planned a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing 0.9%&#xD;
      saline and balanced salt solution to prevent CI-AKI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iodinated contrast media (CM) has been widely used for various diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions. Coronary angiography and contrast enhanced computed tomography are&#xD;
      representative medical procedure in which CM administration is necessary, and their usage are&#xD;
      recently extended. Also, U.S sales of medical imaging CM has been increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although iodinated CM has useful role in many medical procedures, CM is well known for its&#xD;
      renal side effect, contrast induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). CI-AKI is one of the&#xD;
      leading cause of iatrogenic acute kidney injury (AKI). Moreover, CI-AKI is known to be an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for short- and long term morbidity and mortality. Considering the&#xD;
      current rising incidence of CI-AKI, its prevention has been an important issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of CI-AKI is below 5% and up to 25% according to presence of risk factors such&#xD;
      as renal failure, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, old age and concomitant use of&#xD;
      nephrotoxic medications. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an established risk factor for&#xD;
      CI-AKI and therefore several guidelines recommend prophylaxis for CI-AKI when patients with&#xD;
      creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 60mL/min receives CM administration. In those guidelines,&#xD;
      it is generally recommend that high risk patients should receive isotonic crystalloid&#xD;
      solution and be considered for taking N-acetylcysteine, although there are still debates on&#xD;
      its benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical studies have compared 0.9% saline and sodium bicarbonate solution for their&#xD;
      effectiveness on CI-AKI prevention, and no superiority was shown in using sodium bicarbonate&#xD;
      solution. Hence, most organization currently use 0.9% saline for CI-AKI prophylaxis due to&#xD;
      its wide availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, several studies showed that 0.9% saline has supra-physiologic dose of chloride and&#xD;
      induces metabolic acidosis which contributes renal vasoconstriction and impairment of&#xD;
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Double blind, randomized clinical human study&#xD;
      proved that these problems are less pronounced with the use of balanced salt solution, which&#xD;
      has physiologic level of chloride and neutral pH. Also, recent prospective pilot study&#xD;
      suggested that using chloride restrictive solutions, rather than using chloride rich&#xD;
      solutions, for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients can reduce AKI. Considering the&#xD;
      above findings, few large scale cohort studies and randomized controlled trials are ongoing&#xD;
      to prove preventive effect of balanced salt solution for AKI over 0.9% saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, as stated above, use of 0.9% saline for CI-AKI prophylaxis might have limited&#xD;
      benefit only by volume expansion. Considering its components, additional physiologic&#xD;
      advantage by using balanced salt solution could be achieved. In order to assess this&#xD;
      hypothesis, the investigators planned a multicenter prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      open-label trial comparing balanced salt solution and 0.9% saline to prevent CI-AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point of this study is event of CI-AKI, which is defined by relative (≥25%)&#xD;
      or fixed (≥0.5mg/dL) increase in serum creatinine from baseline value assessed at 48 hours&#xD;
      after CM use. The secondary end-point are decrease in eGFR of more than 50% from the baseline&#xD;
      eGFR within 48 hours and initiation of dialysis and mortality, after 1 or 6 month from CM&#xD;
      exposure. For this purpose, at least 830 subjects would be required for each group when type&#xD;
      I error rate is 2.5% and type II error is 20%, given 20% drop-out rate during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
