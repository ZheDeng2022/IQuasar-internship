  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a frequent consequence of amputation, and it is notoriously&#xD;
      difficult to treat. Amputation usually follows traumatic injuries or surgery following&#xD;
      vascular diseases, diabetes, osteomyelitis or tumours in cases where the loss of the limb is&#xD;
      required for the survival of the patient. The loss of a limb or other body parts is usually&#xD;
      followed by the sensation that the lost body part is still present and can be felt. These&#xD;
      phenomena are called, respectively, phantom awareness and phantom sensation. In 50-80% of&#xD;
      amputees neuropathic pain develops in the lost limb also referred to as phantom limb pain&#xD;
      (PLP). PLP can be related to a certain position or movement of the phantom limb, and might be&#xD;
      elicited or worsened by a range of physical factors (e.g. changes in the weather or pressure&#xD;
      on the residual limb) and psychological factors (e.g. emotional stress). It is well known&#xD;
      that most treatments available for PLP today, such as pharmacological, surgical, anaesthetic,&#xD;
      psychological and other, are ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today it is believed that phantom limb pain may be related to changes in the cortex of the&#xD;
      brain. There is evidence that these changes may be modulated - or even reversed - by&#xD;
      providing sensory input to the stump or amputation zone. For example, cortical reorganization&#xD;
      and alleviation of phantom limb pain has been observed in amputees following intense use of a&#xD;
      hand prosthesis. However, there is no consistent knowledge on which type of peripheral&#xD;
      sensory feedback may be effective in affecting the cortical plasticity or on how to best&#xD;
      apply the sensory feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed research is to create natural, meaningful sensations through&#xD;
      providing invasive sensory feedback (i.e. electrical stimulation through intraneural&#xD;
      implantation of electrodes) and the effectiveness to alleviate phantom limb pain and restore&#xD;
      the cortical neuroplastic changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, which will take place at the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV, Centre&#xD;
      Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois), 1-2 hand amputated patients experiencing severe PLP will&#xD;
      be enrolled and implanted with intraneural nerve electrodes in the arm stump for up to&#xD;
      maximal 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve electrodes will be implanted in two nerves of the arm stump. During daily stimulation&#xD;
      sessions the electrodes will be connected to an external stimulator via transcutaneous leads.&#xD;
      During the sessions, selective nerve stimulation will be performed. The amputee patient will&#xD;
      experience this as sensations (movement, touch, temperature, vibration etc.) originating from&#xD;
      the phantom limb. While implanted, the investigators will investigate how well they can&#xD;
      induce these sensations and they will provide a stimulation therapy, which consist of&#xD;
      stimulation activities and therefore requires the patient to focus on the evoked sensations.&#xD;
      Prior to, during and following therapy a series of assessments (standardized across all&#xD;
      EPIONE partners to enable comparison) will be conducted to relate therapy with PLP, cortical&#xD;
      organization, the mental state etc. of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing of clinical assessments is conducting in the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline and Entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Intervention period: intensive therapy, preliminary outcome, semi-intensive therapy,&#xD;
           monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Explantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures are standardized across international EPIONE partners (which carry out different&#xD;
      interventions, but similar assessments), to enable comparison between treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: First visit. The subject is invited to a meeting with the principal investigator and&#xD;
      one of the senior researchers involved in the study to be informed about the experiment. Only&#xD;
      the PI, who is a medical doctor, will be allowed to answer health and medical related&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Pre-screening. This phase is conducted before the start of the experiment but after&#xD;
      the subject has signed the informed consent form. Via questionnaires, tests and interviews it&#xD;
      is evaluated if the subject fulfills the inclusion criteria in relation to physical health&#xD;
      (able to undergo surgery), depression, normal range of IQ and PLP. The principal investigator&#xD;
      will evaluate the results and decide whether the subject should be included or excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Baseline and Entry. This phase aims to determine the stability and intra-subject&#xD;
      variability of the pain sensations without treatment. The measure control for the daily&#xD;
      variability in pain, assessment scoring variability, site-to-site variability and inter&#xD;
      subject variability in the &quot;before intervention&quot; state. These variances will be used in the&#xD;
      analysis to estimate baseline noise in the measure. In addition to the questionnaires used&#xD;
      for quantifying the perceived phantom limb pain and sensation, the last week before&#xD;
      implantation includes the application of cortical mapping methods (EEG and fMRI). During all&#xD;
      phases of the study the subject is required to fill out a diary before going to bed about the&#xD;
      development of PLP during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Implantation. After the initial phases the patient is implanted with 4 TIME-4H&#xD;
      (Transverse Intrafascicular Multichannel Electrode Version 4 for Human) electrodes. Surgical&#xD;
      implantation of the TIME-4H electrodes is conducted under full anaesthesia. During the&#xD;
      operation, the median and the ulnar nerves are freed through an incision of 20 cm on the&#xD;
      medial aspect of the upper-arm. The fascicles of both nerves are dissected free for a couple&#xD;
      of centimetres at the level where the TIME-4H electrodes are to be implanted. Four TIME-4H&#xD;
      electrodes are pulled into the fascicles of the nerves using the attached needle and thread,&#xD;
      two TIME-4H in each nerve. The electrodes are anchored to the nerve using the dedicated&#xD;
      anchoring points of the TIME-4H. After placing the electrodes the electrical integrity of&#xD;
      each TIME-4H electrode is tested, before closing the wound. Wires are lead out through the&#xD;
      skin and the wound is closed. During surgery the subject is treated with prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics. Prophylactic antibiotics are not administered later in the study due to the risk&#xD;
      of the development of resistance. After the implantation the subject is offered to stay at&#xD;
      hospital to enable routine assessment of the surgical outcome as long as the PI judges it&#xD;
      necessary. The subject will routinely have the wound where the wires exit the arm cleaned and&#xD;
      treated to reduce the risk of infection. This will be conducted by a nurse who is member of&#xD;
      the project group. The subject will receive training in treating/cleaning the wound and also&#xD;
      in what symptoms to be aware of.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 5: Intervention. One week after the surgery, the patient will start daily sessions of&#xD;
      nerve stimulation. Therapy of PLP and sensations are assessed via questionnaires prior to and&#xD;
      following the stimulation therapy. Several assessments are conducted during this phase with&#xD;
      the purpose of characterizing the sensations which can be evoked and to provide sensory&#xD;
      stimulation therapy with the aim of alleviating the phantom limb pain. Programs of&#xD;
      stimulation will be performed every day (weekends excluded) for up to 3 hours per day&#xD;
      according to the daily experimental aims and the compliance of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experience will last between 12 and maximum 20 weeks and will be divided in four&#xD;
      different phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intensive therapy (from 1st to 4th weeks); during this period the experiments will be&#xD;
           carried out every day, from Monday to Friday;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preliminary outcome (5th week); during this week, the experiment will be carried out&#xD;
           every day, from Monday to Friday; It will consist of questionnaires and cortical mapping&#xD;
           (EEG and fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Semi-intensive therapy (from 6th to 11th weeks); during this period the experiments will&#xD;
           be carried out only two days per week, Monday and Tuesday (or two other consecutive days&#xD;
           of week that the patient would prefer);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Monitoring (from 12th week to the end of the experiment, but no later than 20th week);&#xD;
           during this period the experiments will be carried out only once a week on Monday (the&#xD;
           day could be changed according to the possibilities of the patient and the working&#xD;
           team); during this period the weekly evaluation will be performed only if, in case of&#xD;
           success of the trial in treating the PLP, the VAS score will became 2 points greater&#xD;
           than the minimum score achieved during the previous periods of the trial, or if other&#xD;
           types of necessities connected to implant use would occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A cortical mapping (EEG and fMRI) is scheduled to be carried out during the preliminary&#xD;
           outcome and at the end of the therapy (during phase 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stimulation is performed with the aim of inducing meaningful sensory input to the&#xD;
           subject and thereby inducing a normalization of the cortical organization and&#xD;
           alleviation of PLP. This is sought accomplished by performing activities (program) which&#xD;
           reintroduce the missing limb into the subject's body image.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The program 1 (Pr1) of the experiment will be performed in order to characterize each&#xD;
           channel of the TIME-4H electrodes. The Pr1 will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  during the intensive phase: • the first three days of the first week after the&#xD;
                implant; • the first day in the following weeks (in order to record possible&#xD;
                changes of the location, type and strength of the generated sensation and of the&#xD;
                lower threshold and upper limits of the charge, over the weeks);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  during the semi-intensive phase: • the first day of the weeks (in order to record&#xD;
                possible changes of the location, type and strength of the generated sensation and&#xD;
                of the lower threshold and upper limits of the charge, over the weeks);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  during the monitoring phase: • the day of the week when the experiment will be&#xD;
                carried out (in order to record possible changes of the location, type and strength&#xD;
                of the generated sensation and of the lower threshold and upper limits of the&#xD;
                charge, over the weeks). Only if there is observed change in the stabilized map,&#xD;
                and only over the active sites where the change is observed the mapping will be&#xD;
                re-executed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The program 2 (Pr2) of the experiment will be aimed at measuring the impedance of the&#xD;
           patient and electrode system with the purpose of characterizing it, to investigate&#xD;
           possible changes in consecutive days and to eventually correlate it to changes of the&#xD;
           lower threshold and upper limits of current during the same period. The Pr2 will be&#xD;
           performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  during the intensive phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • the first day of each week&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  during the semi-intensive phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • the first day of the weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  during the monitoring phase: • the day of the weeks when the experiment will be&#xD;
                carried out&#xD;
&#xD;
           The program 3 (Pr3) will be aimed to explore different strategies of simultaneous&#xD;
           asynchronous or synchronous multichannel electrical intraneural stimulation. This&#xD;
           program will be performed with the aim of trying different combinations of channels and&#xD;
           to identify the best pattern to treat the phantom limb pain of the enrolled patients.&#xD;
           The Pr3 will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  during the intensive phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • the last two days of the first week after the implant;&#xD;
&#xD;
                • the second day of the following weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  during the semi-intensive phase: • the first day of the weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  during the monitoring phase: • the day of the weeks when the experiment will be&#xD;
                carried out. During the treatment program (Tr), the investigators will test the&#xD;
                possibility to drive the stimulation produced by electrical stimulator with the&#xD;
                transformed signals from sensors in (or over) the robotic hand, which is&#xD;
                voluntarily controlled by the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
           More specifically, the investigators will ask the patient to perform several tasks&#xD;
           (depending on capacity, availability and motivation):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Execution of different force levels (up to 8 levels) with the hand prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Identification of objects physical properties&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Embodiment tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Functional improvement tests&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Tr will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - during the intensive phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  from the third to the fifth day of the second week;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  every day of the following weeks - during the semi-intensive phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  both days of the trial - during the monitoring phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the day of the week when the experiment will be carried out&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase 6: Outcome. After the therapy a series of assessments (questionnaires and cortical&#xD;
           mapping) are performed to evaluate the effect of therapy. No stimulation therapy is&#xD;
           conducted during the outcome and the following follow-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase 7: Follow-up. During the follow-up phase it will be assessed how long time it&#xD;
           takes for any effects of pain alleviating to wear off (questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase 8: Explantation. In the event of infection, blushing, swelling, pain or other&#xD;
           complications which render continuous implantation impossible, the electrodes will be&#xD;
           explanted and the subject treated with antibiotics. Explantation of the TIME-4H&#xD;
           electrodes may be conducted at the end of the therapy phase. Explantation will be&#xD;
           carried out under full anaesthesia. Access is obtained via an insertion made through the&#xD;
           skin on the medial side of the upper arm. The TIME-4H electrodes are dissected free,&#xD;
           thread cut and the implant pulled out of the nerve and removed. Following the&#xD;
           explantation normal wound treatment will be conducted and the stitches removed according&#xD;
           to standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study duration for a subject will be limited by the maximum TIME-4H implantation&#xD;
           duration, which has been set to 6 months maximum.&#xD;
