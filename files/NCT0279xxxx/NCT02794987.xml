    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is a diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      procedure, however it has an important image limitation. The fluoroscopic cholangiography&#xD;
      shows the biliary tree in a two-dimensional view. When an indeterminate biliary stricture is&#xD;
      seen, the certainly diagnosis by ERCP depends on a blind biopsy sampling with the risk of&#xD;
      missed pathology and sampling errors. SpyGlass® System (Boston Scientific, Marlborough,&#xD;
      Massachusetts, USA) is a cholangioscope that enables single-operator, direct visualization of&#xD;
      the pancreatico-biliary system and the evaluation of intraductal lesions. It has a digital&#xD;
      sensor with 4x resolution and a 1.2 mm working channel that allows the passage of the&#xD;
      SpyBite® Forceps biopsy. It has been demonstrated that the use of SpyGlass® System and&#xD;
      SpyBite® Forceps changes clinical management in 64% of patients. It has a sensitivity of&#xD;
      76.5% for indeterminate stricture diagnosis, compared to 29.4% and 5.9% sensitivity using&#xD;
      blind biopsy brushing catheter respectively. Although it has been described before&#xD;
      cholangioscopic images of malignant biliary lesions like an irregular lesion surface with&#xD;
      irregular vessels and bleeding or a smooth surface without vessels for benign lesions, there&#xD;
      is no current validated classification that allows unify the diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Study design: The study was design to be performed in 2 stages. Stage 1:&#xD;
      observational, retrospective study with case collection from September 2013 to September&#xD;
      2015. Patients included had bile duct tissular lesion detected by POCS. The images were&#xD;
      correlated to histopathology and 6 month follows up and a classification was finally&#xD;
      performed to differentiate benign forma malignant bile duct lesions. Stage 2: patients with&#xD;
      bile duct tissular lesion detected by POCS, will be the evaluated in a prospective,&#xD;
      non-randomized and double blind manner. Two groups of endoscopist will evaluate the images&#xD;
      but only one group will do it using the classification previously performed. Second stage&#xD;
      case collection has already started (December 2015) and will include patients until December&#xD;
      2016.&#xD;

      Setting: Gastroenterology division of the Ecuadorian Institute of Digestive Diseases (IECED),&#xD;
      OmniHospital Academic Tertiary Center. The study protocol and consent form has been approved&#xD;
      by the Institutional Review Board and will be conducted according to the declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki. Patients will sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: 63 patients enrolled with bile duct tissular lesion detected by POCS.&#xD;
      Cholangioscopic lesions images (315) were photographically recorded in order to correlate to,&#xD;
      histopathology after targeted or surgical biopsies, and 6 months follow up with POCS. Using&#xD;
      the histopathology results, the lesions were classified into benign or malignant. An&#xD;
      experienced endoscopist with more than 140 POCS analyzed the images based on the&#xD;
      morphological and vascular pattern and performed a POCS macroscopic classification of&#xD;
      tissular bile duct lesions as follow: Benign lesions: Type 1 &quot;Villous pattern&quot; (micronodular&#xD;
      or villous pattern without vascularity), Type 2 &quot;Polypoid pattern&quot; (adenoma or granuloma&#xD;
      pattern without vascularity) and Type 3 &quot;Inflammatory pattern&quot; (regular or irregular fibrous&#xD;
      and congestive pattern with regular vascularity). Malignant lesions: Type 1 &quot;Flat pattern&quot;&#xD;
      (flat and smooth or irregular surface with irregular or spider vascularity); Type 2 &quot;Polypoid&#xD;
      pattern&quot; (polypoid or mass shape with fibrosis and irregular or spider vascularity), Type 3&#xD;
      &quot;Ulcerated pattern&quot; (irregular ulcerated and infiltrative pattern with or without fibrosis&#xD;
      and with irregular or spider vascularity) and type 4 &quot;honey-comb pattern&quot; (fibrous honey-comb&#xD;
      pattern with or without irregular or spider vascularity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: estimated enrollment of 100 patients with bile duct tissular lesion detected by&#xD;
      POCS. Patients included will be analyzed by two groups of endoscopists. One group&#xD;
      (classification group) will use the previous classification to select the images as benign or&#xD;
      malignant with the different subtypes; and the second group (no classification group or&#xD;
      control group) will do it without using the classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: patients included were evaluated using a standard duodenoscope (Pentax ED 3670TK,&#xD;
      Hoya Co.), the Pentax Video Processor EPK-i5010 and both SpyGlass® cholangioscopes: First&#xD;
      generation, SpyGlass® Direct Visualization System and Second generation, Digital SpyGlass® DS&#xD;
      System (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA) in a mother-baby manner.&#xD;
      Procedures were performed by one experienced endoscopists with more than 300 ERCP/year&#xD;
      (C.R.M), in the supine position and under general anesthesia. All patients received&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis. Biopsies were taken in order to correlate to histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: patients will be evaluated using a standard duodenoscope (Pentax ED 3670TK, Hoya&#xD;
      Co.), the Pentax Video Processor EPK-i7010 and second generation, Digital SpyGlass® DS System&#xD;
      (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA) in a mother-baby manner. Procedures will&#xD;
      be performed by two experienced endoscopists with more than 300 ERCP/year (C.R.M and M.S.A),&#xD;
      in the supine position and under general anesthesia. Half of patients will receive antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis because an ongoing cholangioscopic antibiotic prophylaxis protocol. Biopsies will&#xD;
      be taken in order to correlate to histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter and intra-observer agreement Stage 1: A data set containing 40 random photographs of&#xD;
      the bile duct lesions were presented to 1 expert and 2 non-experts in POCS, whom analyzed the&#xD;
      images blindly. Intra and inter-observer reproducibility was measure based on comparison of&#xD;
      images between endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Intra and inter-observer agreement will be performed in the same manner as stage1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Baseline characteristics will be compared between groups using&#xD;
      Chi-square o Fisher Test for categorical variable and Mann-Whitney Test for continuing&#xD;
      variables. Accuracy, sensitive, specificity, positive and negative predicts value will be&#xD;
      calculated. To examine inter and intra observer agreement, kappa values will be calculated. A&#xD;
      P value of less than 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant. All the statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using SPSS software suite v.22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations: the protocol will be performed in only one center.&#xD;
