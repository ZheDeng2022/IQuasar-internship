  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient oriented clinical outcomes have increased in use and popularity and provide a&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of the level of symptoms and function experienced by a patient.&#xD;
      Though several measures have been developed and shown to be valid, reliable, and responsive&#xD;
      in adults, such efforts have only been rarely undertaken in pediatric populations.&#xD;
      Specifically, there has been no validation of the predominant adult hip specific outcome&#xD;
      measures, such as the WOMAC and Oxford-12, in children and adolescents. Prior to using such&#xD;
      measures in pediatric patients, it is necessary to establish the psychometric properties of&#xD;
      these measurements in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the reliability and validity of the WOMAC hip&#xD;
      scores in a pediatric population, between five and nineteen years of age, with Perthes&#xD;
      disease. The results of this study will accomplish the above goal, thereby allowing either&#xD;
      for widespread use of these measures in pediatric hip disorders or emphasizing the necessity&#xD;
      for development of a pediatric hip specific outcome measure.&#xD;

      1. Purpose Perthes disease is a hip disorder most often affecting children with an onset&#xD;
           between four and eight years of age. The treatment options range from non-operative to&#xD;
           bracing to operative intervention. As the disease most often affects the head of the&#xD;
           femur, there is the potential for long-term conditions due to the residual hip joint&#xD;
           deformity, following resolution of Perthes disease, leading to early degenerative hip&#xD;
           osteoarthritis and potential impact on hip function, quality of life, and morbidity. A&#xD;
           valid and reliable means by which to assess function and outcome is essential to&#xD;
           determine the most effective means of treatment. Previous research has used different&#xD;
           methods in different subject groups, making comparisons of results very difficult. Both&#xD;
           the long-term outcome and change over time of a patient with Perthes disease could be&#xD;
           measured with a hip joint specific patient oriented outcome measure. Several such&#xD;
           measures have been developed in adults; specifically the Western Ontario and McMaster&#xD;
           Osteoarthritis Scale (WOMAC) hip score are used very often. Though these tools have been&#xD;
           well studied and validated in adults, they have not been tested or used in pediatric&#xD;
           populations. As they were developed and shown to be valid, reliable, and responsive in&#xD;
           adults, these measures require rigourous testing in pediatric populations prior to their&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis There is no true global hypothesis for the study since it is a&#xD;
           validation/reliability study. There are hypotheses for each type of validity being&#xD;
           studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For construct validity (using convergence), the hypothesis would be a priori hypothesis&#xD;
           in this study related to convergent validity is that, assuming the WOMAC has construct&#xD;
           validity in this population, then the hip specific outcome scores should be different&#xD;
           for each Stulberg classification stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For construct validity (using extreme groups), the hypothesis would be a priori&#xD;
           hypothesis in this study is that, assuming the measures have adequate construct validity&#xD;
           in this population, the group of subjects being followed for treatment of an upper&#xD;
           extremity fracture should have significantly better function, as indicated by a low&#xD;
           score on the WOMAC and , compared to those with Perthes disease, who should have higher&#xD;
           scores indicating poorer function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For criterion validity, the hypothesis would be a priori hypothesis related to criterion&#xD;
           validity in this study predicts that, assuming adequate concurrent validity of these&#xD;
           measures in this population, there should be a negative correlation between the&#xD;
           Activities Scale for Kids - Performance (ASK-p, an activity level outcome score) and the&#xD;
           WOMAC. The reason for a negative correlation is that high scores on the generic measure&#xD;
           indicate better function, whereas low scores on the hip specific measures indicate&#xD;
           better function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research Method All subjects enrolled in the study will be given the initial set of&#xD;
           questionnaires at the time of recruitment and asked to complete them at home, following&#xD;
           the clinical follow-up visit, and return the questionnaires by mail using a&#xD;
           self-addressed, stamped envelope which will be provided. All subjects will complete the&#xD;
           WOMAC. Those with healed Perthes disease will also complete the ASK-p at the first visit&#xD;
           to the clinic following consent into the study. Those in the comparison group with an&#xD;
           upper extremity fracture will not complete the generic measure. This will comprise the&#xD;
           initial time point of the study. Those subjects who do not complete all required&#xD;
           questionnaires, at this time point, will be excluded from the study. Radiographs of the&#xD;
           affected hip and pelvis will be obtained for each patient with healed Perthes disease at&#xD;
           the time of the clinic visit, which would be obtained regardless of inclusion in the&#xD;
           study in the course of standard clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Those subjects with Perthes disease will also complete the WOMAC and measure two weeks&#xD;
           following the initial time point. The questionnaires will be mailed to the subjects and&#xD;
           they will be asked to complete the questionnaires and return them in a self-addressed,&#xD;
           stamped envelope which will be provided. This will comprise the follow-up time point of&#xD;
           the study. A reminder notification will be mailed at four weeks and a telephone call&#xD;
           reminder at six weeks following the initial time point if the second series of&#xD;
           questionnaires has not been returned. Those who do not complete the second series of&#xD;
           questionnaires will be excluded from the reliability component of the study but&#xD;
           maintained in the validity phase, provided the initial questionnaires were completed.&#xD;
           Those with an upper-extremity fracture will not complete any additional questionnaires&#xD;
           following the initial time point. The Stulberg classification will be determined, as&#xD;
           outlined, following the initial time point but prior to analysis of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical Analysis All statistical analysis will be performed by a blinded,&#xD;
           independent analyst. All analyses, with the exception of the weighted kappa statistic&#xD;
           which will be calculated manually, will be performed with the use of S-PLUS software&#xD;
           (version 6.2, Lucent Technologies, Inc.). The distribution of all questionnaire data&#xD;
           will be determined with the use of frequency histograms to allow for the use of&#xD;
           appropriate statistical tests. All statistical tests will be performed with α=0.05. The&#xD;
           reported values will be the mean and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Where&#xD;
           two groups are compared, the mean difference between the groups and the 95% confidence&#xD;
           interval of the difference will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been no previous studies or data of the WOMAC in a pediatric population. Using&#xD;
      values obtained in studies of adults may not provide a good estimate for a power analysis in&#xD;
      this population since other outcome measures, which have been validated in adults, have been&#xD;
      shown to lack validity in children and adolescents. However, in order to estimate the sample&#xD;
      size required for the correlation between the ASK-p and the hip outcome measures the&#xD;
      previously reported adult derived values were required. On the basis of a minimum correlation&#xD;
      of 0.6, which would be considered adequate, with α=0.05 and 80 per cent power, a total of 40&#xD;
      children are required for the study. Since there is no available evidence with which to&#xD;
      estimate the correlation between these outcome measures, a liberal sample size will be&#xD;
      recruited. In a similar study, except that generic as opposed to joint specific, outcome&#xD;
      measures were used, a sample size of 196 subjects was recruited. Young et al recruited 200&#xD;
      subjects for their study in which several psychometric properties of the ASK-p were&#xD;
      determined. A total of 200 subjects will be recruited across all centers participating in&#xD;
      this study. There will be 100 subjects with an upper extremity fracture and 100 with healed&#xD;
      Perthes disease. This sample size was chosen, in part, on the basis of the maximum number of&#xD;
      subjects with healed Perthes which would be feasible to recruit over the time horizon of the&#xD;
      study, which will be six months. It is anticipated that a minimum of four centers will&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;

        All children and adolescents, between the ages of five and nineteen years, being followed&#xD;
        at the Orthopaedic clinic of a participating center with a diagnosis of an upper extremity&#xD;
        fracture or healed Perthes disease will be eligible for inclusion in the study.&#xD;

    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants will be between 5-19 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healed Perthes disease. Healed Perthes disease will be defined radiographically, in&#xD;
             the accepted fashion, by the appearance of normal bone density of the femoral head.&#xD;
             The restriction of those with Perthes disease to only those with resolution of the&#xD;
             disease will prevent heterogeneity of the clinical presentation and anticipated&#xD;
             functional abilities which would occur by including those in the acute phases of the&#xD;
             disease, thereby reducing potential bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants will have to be able to complete the questionnaires in English and,&#xD;
             for those with Perthes disease, be able to complete the questionnaires again two weeks&#xD;
             following the initial completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amongst those being followed at the orthopaedic clinic of a participating center with&#xD;
             an upper extremity fracture, those with a history of a hip disorder will be excluded.&#xD;
             The reason for this is that these subjects will compose a comparison group with normal&#xD;
             hip function, consequently a history of hip disorder would bias this comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with Perthes disease who demonstrate acute phases of the disease will be&#xD;
             excluded. Acute phases of the disease will be defined in the accepted fashion, by the&#xD;
             radiographic presence of fragmentation or reossification of the femoral head.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who do not provide consent for participation in the study will be excluded, as&#xD;
             will those who either cannot complete the questionnaire in English or are unable to&#xD;
             complete a second set of questionnaires at two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with cognitive impairment, precluding completion of the questionnaires, will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All those with concomitant medical problems will be excluded due to possible&#xD;
             confounding of the clinical outcome measures.&#xD;
