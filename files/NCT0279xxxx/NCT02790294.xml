  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating suitability of a delayed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      in management of spine tumors. Currently the standard of care is obtaining an MRI scan in the&#xD;
      early postoperative period (within 72 hours after surgery). The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      see if delayed MRI (2 to 3 weeks after surgery) is similar in quality to the earlier MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study patients will undergo 2 MRIs after the surgery instead of one MRI. Patients&#xD;
      will have one MRI about 3 days after the surgery and one MRI about 2-3 weeks after surgery.&#xD;

      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess if Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at 2 to 3 weeks after surgery leads to the same&#xD;
      clinical decisions and has the same probability of being chosen by a physician for guiding&#xD;
      the subsequent management of the patient, compared with immediately postoperative MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate the differences between early and late MRI by comparing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Size of tumor in three dimensions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extent of edema;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence and extent of fluid collection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spine Oncology Study Group score;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Involvement of adjacent levels;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression of tumor;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's preference/performance scale right after each image had taken: level of&#xD;
           discomfort at around the time each MRI was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective diagnostic study for which no standard of care currently exists.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic or primary malignant tumor involving spinal column, with or without&#xD;
             extension into the epidural space&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Operated for debulking, decompression or separation surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed within 72 hours after surgery is&#xD;
             needed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Image quality acceptable for comparison with later MRI as read by a neuroradiologist;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky score of 60 or higher;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to consent for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient who previously underwent spinal surgery at these levels will be excluded&#xD;
             to eliminate late postoperative changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intradural extension of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients, whose MRI at post operative 48-72 hours are not readable due to artifacts or&#xD;
             disease process shall not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient not able to tolerate MRI scan due to claustrophobia or severe pain or allergic&#xD;
             reaction to contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt; or = to 30 will be&#xD;
             excluded to avoid issues related to contrast administration in such patients. This&#xD;
             Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) threshold cutoff level is chosen per institutional&#xD;
             policy, because below that level other measures would be required (hydration or no&#xD;
             contrast administration). In order to keep the imaging information as uniform as&#xD;
             possible in such a small study group, patients with a low GFR will not be enrolled in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
