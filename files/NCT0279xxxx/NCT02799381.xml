  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 3b, open-label, randomized, multicenter, 12-week study. The study consisted&#xD;
      of 3 sequential periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-Up. The OMT group had the same&#xD;
      schedule of visits/procedures throughout the study as the LCIG treatment group, except for&#xD;
      visits related to nasojejunal (NJ)/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedures,&#xD;
      titration of LCIG, and follow-up period.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) is a tool used to assess dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contains both self-evaluation questions and items that are assessed directly by the physician to objectively rate the abnormal movements associated with PD. Part 1 contains 11 questions about the ON time dyskinesia and the impact of ON-dyskinesia on experiences of daily living. Part 2 contains 4 questions about OFF-dystonia rating. Part 3 contains 7 questions about objective evaluation of dyskinesia impairment and Part 4 contains 4 questions regarding dyskinesia disability. Each question is scored with respect to severity, which is rated on a scale where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3= moderate and 4 = severe. The UDysRS total score is obtained by summing the item scores, ranging from 0 to 104. Higher scores are associated with more disability. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in ON Time Without Troublesome Dyskinesia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's Disease (PD) Symptom Diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected study visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e., 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. ON time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug, and OFF time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. Positive change from baseline for ON time without troublesome dyskinesia indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8) Summary Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8) is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure aspects of health that are relevant to participants with PD, and which may not be included in general health status questionnaires. The PDQ-8 is a self-administered questionnaire. Each item is scored on the following 5-point scale: 0 = Never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always (or cannot do at all, if applicable). Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremors and stiffness. The results are presented as a summary index. The PDQ-8 summary index ranges from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) score is a clinician's rating scale for assessing Global Improvement of Change. The CGI-C rates improvement by 7 categories: very much improved (1), much improved (2), minimally improved (3), no change (4), minimally worse (5), much worse (6), very much worse (7). The CGI-C score ranges from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating improvement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II Score (Activities of Daily Living)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. The Part II score is the sum of the answers to the 13 questions related to Activities of Daily Living, and ranges from 0-52. Higher scores are associated with more disability. Negative values indicate improvement from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in OFF Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's Disease (PD) Symptom Diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected study visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e., 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. ON time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug, and OFF time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. Negative change from baseline for OFF time indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III Score (Motor Examination)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. The Part III score is the sum of the 27 answers related to Motor Examination, and ranges from 0-108. Higher scores are associated with more disability. Negative values indicate improvement from baseline.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to OMT continued their current anti Parkinson's disease (anti-PD) medication regimen for the duration of the study. All anti-PD medications and medications to treat dyskinesia must have remained stable for the duration of the study unless adjustments were medically indicated. The Investigator provided the prescription for continued OMT.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The total daily dose of infusion LCIG was composed of three components: (i) the morning dose, (ii) continuous maintenance infusion dose and (iii) extra doses. A temporary nasojejunal (NJ) tube may have been used initially with the infusion pump to determine a participant's response to this method of treatment and to optimize the dose of LCIG before treatment with a permanent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension (PEG-J) tube was started. Following optional NJ and/or PEG-J placement and, at the investigator's discretion, the participant may have begun initiation and titration of LCIG infusion on Day 1 once tube placement was confirmed. The dose of LCIG was adjusted to obtain the optimal clinical response. The rate of LCIG infusion is typically within the range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances and runs over a period of 16 consecutive hours each day.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Safety Data Set: all participants randomized to OMT and all participants randomized to LCIG treatment who had a study tube (NJ or PEG-J) placement procedure. Two participants randomized to the LCIG arm did not have device placement for LCIG infusion and were not included in the safety data set.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Optimized Medical Treatment (OMT)</title>
          <description>Participants randomized to OMT continued their current anti Parkinson's disease (anti-PD) medication regimen for the duration of the study. All anti-PD medications and medications to treat dyskinesia must have remained stable for the duration of the study unless adjustments were medically indicated. The Investigator provided the prescription for continued OMT.</description>

          <title>Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG)</title>
          <description>The total daily dose of infusion LCIG was composed of three components: (i) the morning dose, (ii) continuous maintenance infusion dose and (iii) extra doses. A temporary nasojejunal (NJ) tube may have been used initially with the infusion pump to determine a participant's response to this method of treatment and to optimize the dose of LCIG before treatment with a permanent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension (PEG-J) tube was started. Following optional NJ and/or PEG-J placement and, at the investigator's discretion, the participant may have begun initiation and titration of LCIG infusion on Day 1 once tube placement was confirmed. The dose of LCIG was adjusted to obtain the optimal clinical response. The rate of LCIG infusion is typically within the range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances and runs over a period of 16 consecutive hours each day.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) is a tool used to assess dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contains both self-evaluation questions and items that are assessed directly by the physician to objectively rate the abnormal movements associated with PD. Part 1 contains 11 questions about the ON time dyskinesia and the impact of ON-dyskinesia on experiences of daily living. Part 2 contains 4 questions about OFF-dystonia rating. Part 3 contains 7 questions about objective evaluation of dyskinesia impairment and Part 4 contains 4 questions regarding dyskinesia disability. Each question is scored with respect to severity, which is rated on a scale where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3= moderate and 4 = severe. The UDysRS total score is obtained by summing the item scores, ranging from 0 to 104. Higher scores are associated with more disability. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement.</description>

            <description>The total daily dose of infusion LCIG was composed of three components: (i) the morning dose, (ii) continuous maintenance infusion dose and (iii) extra doses. A temporary nasojejunal (NJ) tube may have been used initially with the infusion pump to determine a participant's response to this method of treatment and to optimize the dose of LCIG before treatment with a permanent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension (PEG-J) tube was started. Following optional NJ and/or PEG-J placement and, at the investigator's discretion, the participant may have begun initiation and titration of LCIG infusion on Day 1 once tube placement was confirmed. The dose of LCIG was adjusted to obtain the optimal clinical response. The rate of LCIG infusion is typically within the range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances and runs over a period of 16 consecutive hours each day.</description>

        <description>The Parkinson's Disease (PD) Symptom Diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected study visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e., 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. ON time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug, and OFF time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. Positive change from baseline for ON time without troublesome dyskinesia indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8) is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure aspects of health that are relevant to participants with PD, and which may not be included in general health status questionnaires. The PDQ-8 is a self-administered questionnaire. Each item is scored on the following 5-point scale: 0 = Never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always (or cannot do at all, if applicable). Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremors and stiffness. The results are presented as a summary index. The PDQ-8 summary index ranges from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement.</description>

The dose of LCIG was adjusted to obtain the optimal clinical response. The rate of LCIG infusion is typically within the range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances and runs over a period of 16 consecutive hours each day.</description>

          <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) score is a clinician's rating scale for assessing Global Improvement of Change. The CGI-C rates improvement by 7 categories: very much improved (1), much improved (2), minimally improved (3), no change (4), minimally worse (5), much worse (6), very much worse (7). The CGI-C score ranges from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating improvement.</description>

      <time_frame>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (TESAEs) collection: OMT (starting after the day of randomization until 30 days after the last visit, up to 18 weeks); LCIG group with study tube removal after the last study drug infusion (from the time of tube placement up to 30 days following tube removal, up to 16 weeks); other LCIG participants (starting with tube placement and up to 30 days following the last study visit, up to 16 weeks)</time_frame>
      <desc>TEAEs and SAEs are defined as any adverse event (AE) with an onset date starting after the day of randomization (OMT group) or from the time of tube placement (LCIG group) until 30 days after the last visit (OMT group), or up to 30 days following tube removal (LCIG group) or the last study visit (LCIG group) and were collected whether elicited or spontaneously reported by the participant.</desc>

          <description>The total daily dose of infusion LCIG was composed of three components: (i) the morning dose, (ii) continuous maintenance infusion dose and (iii) extra doses. A temporary nasojejunal (NJ) tube may have been used initially with the infusion pump to determine a participant's response to this method of treatment and to optimize the dose of LCIG before treatment with a permanent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension (PEG-J) tube was started. Following optional NJ and/or PEG-J placement and, at the investigator's discretion, the participant may have begun initiation and titration of LCIG infusion on Day 1 once tube placement was confirmed. The dose of LCIG was adjusted to obtain the optimal clinical response. The rate of LCIG infusion is typically within the range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances and runs over a period of 16 consecutive hours each day.</description>

          <description>Participants randomized to OMT continued their current anti Parkinson's disease (anti-PD) medication regimen for the duration of the study. All anti-PD medications and medications to treat dyskinesia must have remained stable for the duration of the study unless adjustments were medically indicated. The Investigator provided the prescription for continued OMT.</description>
