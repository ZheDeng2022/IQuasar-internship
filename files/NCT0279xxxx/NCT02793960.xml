  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center study to investigate the effects of a topical cream on patients 12&#xD;
      years of age and older that have been diagnosed with epidermolysis bullosa.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be conducted in patients with any form of Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) with at&#xD;
      least 1 active EB wound between 2.5 and 50 cm2 in size or up to 10% of the Body Surface Area.&#xD;
      The investigators will identify an &quot;index lesion&quot; and other lesions for treatment An area of&#xD;
      un-involved skin will also be treated with the study cream. This are will be used for testing&#xD;
      by producing tiny blisters th so that the underlying tissue can be examined using a special&#xD;
      microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will apply the study cream&#xD;

          3. Have no other dermatological disease that may adversely impact wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willing to refrain from using topical creams or lotions other than the study drug to&#xD;
             the designated areas during the treatment period and from washing the designated areas&#xD;
