  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase Ib/II study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, patient reported outcomes (PROs), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      atezolizumab administered by intravenous (IV) infusion alone and in combination with&#xD;
      intravesical BCG in high-risk NMIBC participants. The study will be conducted in following&#xD;
      cohorts: Cohort 1A, Cohort 1B, Cohort 2, and Cohort 3. Atezolizumab will be administered at a&#xD;
      fixed dose of 1200 milligrams (mg) every 3 weeks (q3w) for a maximum of 96 weeks. BCG will be&#xD;
      administered to evaluate dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or&#xD;
      maximum administered dose (MAD). De-escalation will be allowed for up to three dose levels of&#xD;
      BCG (full dose [50 mg], 66 percent [%] of a full dose, and 33% of a full dose [Cohort 1B&#xD;
      only]). After the MTD or MAD is determined for Cohort 1B, this dose will be used for all&#xD;
      subsequent participants enrolled into Cohorts 1B, 2, and 3, unless the MTD is determined to&#xD;
      be 33% of a full BCG dose. If MTD is determined to be 33% of a full BCG dose, then, no&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled into Cohorts 2 and 3 until an assessment of the safety and&#xD;
      activity of the combination of atezolizumab plus 33% of a full BCG dose is completed.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated early as the study had met its goals of providing preliminary safety&#xD;
    and efficacy information for atezolizumab monotherapy alone and in combination with BCG in&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled only in Cohort 1 of this study. The Sponsor decided not to enroll participants in Cohorts 2 and 3 after the enrollment of 24 patients in Cohort 1 (BCG-unresponsive cohort), as the study had met its goals of providing preliminary safety and efficacy information for atezolizumab monotherapy alone and in combination with BCG in NMIBC.</recruitment_details>
