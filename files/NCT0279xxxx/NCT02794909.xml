  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective cohort study in which a select group of emergency&#xD;
      physicians at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Ghana will be trained in&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary ultrasound (CPUS). Following the training, patients who present to the ED&#xD;
      with undifferentiated shock and/or dyspnea will either receive usual and customary care&#xD;
      supplemented with cardiopulmonary ultrasonography-guided diagnosis and treatment during their&#xD;
      initial resuscitation, or usual and customary care alone depending on whether the treating&#xD;
      physician has received CPUS training. The main outcomes is the impact of CPUS on correct&#xD;
      diagnosis. Information regarding initial treatment strategies, diagnoses and 24-hour&#xD;
      mortality will be collected via manual review of paper charts and medical records.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training protocol and pilot study have been developed through a collaborative effort&#xD;
      involving emergency medicine physicians at University of Michigan (UM) and KATH. Select&#xD;
      resident physicians (approximately 1/3 of the emergency medicine resident physicians) at KATH&#xD;
      will participate in a one-week, hands-on ultrasound course concentrating on solidifying their&#xD;
      preexisting skills in ultrasound, with a focus on the RUSH and BLUE protocols for assessment&#xD;
      of critically ill patients. Resident physicians will be trained, as attending physicians are&#xD;
      not routinely present during the majority of patient evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RUSH (Rapid Ultrasound in SHock) protocol was first described in publication in 2010 and&#xD;
      has since become widely used throughout the country to aid in identifying the cause of shock&#xD;
      for a patient. It is a three-step ultrasound scanning protocol, first evaluating &quot;the pump&quot;&#xD;
      or heart, second &quot;the tank&quot; or intravascular volume status, and third &quot;the pipes&quot; or large&#xD;
      arteries and veins. Ultrasound findings from the exam are then compared with those typically&#xD;
      seen in hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, obstructive shock and distributive shock (1).&#xD;
      The BLUE (Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency) protocol was initially published in 2008 as a&#xD;
      quick tool to determine diagnosis in acute respiratory failure. Based on ultrasound findings,&#xD;
      this scanning protocol provides specific profiles for six main causes of acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease, asthma, and pneumothorax (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As most of the emergency physicians at KATH have previously expressed interest in receiving&#xD;
      this training, we will offer training to all physicians in three different cohorts, 1/3&#xD;
      initially, 1/3 part way through the study, and 1/3 at the end. The physicians in the initial&#xD;
      training group will be chosen based off their availability and work schedule. The&#xD;
      participants will take a test prior to beginning the training and also at the end. They will&#xD;
      also be required to pass an OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Exam) at the end of the week.&#xD;
      One week will be allocated for ultrasound training, to allow the physicians to participate&#xD;
      and practice their new skills. These select residents will make up the cohort of CPUS-trained&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study will be conducted over a four-month period in the emergency department at&#xD;
      KATH. All patients presenting to the ED will be screened for study inclusion criteria as&#xD;
      defined below by a triage nurse, and informed consent will be obtained by research assistants&#xD;
      in all patients deemed competent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will immediately receive usual and customary care, to include physical&#xD;
      examination, IV access, continuous cardiac monitoring, and supplemental oxygen. Following the&#xD;
      initial assessment, the treating physician will be asked to choose the most likely diagnosis&#xD;
      from a provided checklist. All checklists were designed specifically for research purposes in&#xD;
      this study and the information documented on the checklists will be used in clinical&#xD;
      decision-making. The information contained in the checklists is based on the well-validated&#xD;
      RUSH and BLUE protocols and will be used strictly in the context of these protocols only. The&#xD;
      physicians filling out the checklists will be part of the study team at KATH. When a patient&#xD;
      meets inclusion criteria and their treating physician has received CPUS-training, the patient&#xD;
      will receive a CPUS exam in addition to standard care. In addition to the CPUS exam, any&#xD;
      other ultrasound exams deemed necessary for clinical care will occur as they normally do as&#xD;
      part of regular standard of care. Ultrasound will not be withheld for any patient as part of&#xD;
      their clinical care. There will be no aspects of the study conducted prior to enrollment that&#xD;
      will impact care or study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the CPUS group will receive imaging in concordance with the standardized RUSH and&#xD;
      BLUE protocols and findings will be documented on a second checklist. Emergency physicians&#xD;
      trained in CPUS will perform the ultrasound exams, after which they will again choose the&#xD;
      most likely diagnosis from the same initial checklist. The pre-ultrasound and post-ultrasound&#xD;
      diagnoses will be recorded for comparison. Diagnostic accuracy will be assessed based on&#xD;
      post-hoc review of hospital records. Ultrasound competency will be assessed intermittently by&#xD;
      means of direct supervision during site visits to ensure that there is no skill degradation&#xD;
      and to ensure safety of study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis was performed for the primary outcome of diagnostic accuracy. Assuming a&#xD;
      baseline of 60% correct diagnosis we calculated that 158 subjects are required to detect an&#xD;
      absolute 30% increase in correct diagnosis. A minimum of 180 patients will be enrolled to&#xD;
      account for loss to follow-up. Additionally, the information gathered during the pilot study&#xD;
      will be used to help guide planning for a long-term follow-up study in the future. During the&#xD;
      initial ultrasound training, competency will be assessed using pre and post-tests, in&#xD;
      addition to OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Exam). General Linear Model (GLM) framework,&#xD;
      with pretest scores as the covariate, will be used to analyze the pre and post-test data. All&#xD;
      data from the pilot study will be collected on I-pads or paper copies and transferred into a&#xD;
      CSV-formatted file by a research assistant. Data will be examined using SPSS statistical&#xD;
      analysis software using linear and (multiple) logistic regression analysis. A p-value of&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 will be interpreted as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval will be sought from the Committee for Human Research, Publication and Ethics&#xD;
      (CHRPE) of the School of Medical Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of science and Technology&#xD;
      (S.M.S.-K.N.U.S.T.) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Michigan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients considering taking part in this study will be provided with a consent form&#xD;
      describing the interventions and given sufficient time to decide whether or not to&#xD;
      participate. When informed consent cannot be obtained from the patient due to incapacitation&#xD;
      or impaired decision-making, consent will be obtained from the next of kin or from legally&#xD;
      authorized representative. Legal guardians or the head of household can serve as a proxy or&#xD;
      legally authorized representative. According to local customs, in the case where there are no&#xD;
      parents then the &quot;head of the family&quot; is given proxy. This person may not have court&#xD;
      documentation but is presented by the family and accepted as the one to make decisions. Only&#xD;
      adults, those over the age of 18, will be included in this study. The subject population&#xD;
      consists of the community surrounding KATH which sees a range of patients, from children to&#xD;
      adults. Only adults meeting the inclusion criteria will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality will be maintained by de-identifying patient information as early as possible&#xD;
      during the study and storing personal information and data on secure servers in the United&#xD;
      States which will likely be very effective in protecting patient information. In reports,&#xD;
      data and discussion are confidential.&#xD;
