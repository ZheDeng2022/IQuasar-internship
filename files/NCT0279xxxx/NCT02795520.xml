      The purpose of Phase I of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      investigational drug, OTS167, and that of Phase II of this study is to confirm the potential&#xD;
      response benefit of OTS167.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTS167 is a maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) inhibitor which demonstrated&#xD;
      antitumor properties in laboratory tests. It is being developed as an anti-cancer drug. In&#xD;
      this study OTS167 will be administrated to patients with AML, ALL, advanced MDSs, advanced&#xD;
      MPNs, or advanced CML.&#xD;

                  chemotherapy or for whom no standard or curative therapy exists),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALL,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute biphenotypic leukemia (assigned to the appropriate group by the treating&#xD;
                  physician by documented analysis of relevant laboratory values and&#xD;
                  pathology/cytogenetics),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Advanced MDS defined as ≥5% bone marrow blasts or ≥2% blasts in the peripheral&#xD;
                  blood (including patients who have progressed following treatment with&#xD;
                  hypomethylating agents),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Advanced MPN (excluding patients with ET, PV, or low risk MF), and MDS/MPN&#xD;
                  overlap syndrome with ≥5% bone marrow blasts or ≥2% blasts in the peripheral&#xD;
                  blood, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Advanced CML after failure/progression of at least 3 prior TKIs&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No prior antineoplastic drug therapy for at least 14 days, with the exception of&#xD;
             hydroxyurea, prior to starting OTS167. Patients with rapidly proliferative disease may&#xD;
             continue to receive hydroxyurea&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients refractory to all approved therapies or for which no approved or conventional&#xD;
             therapies are available&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a diagnosis of advanced CML must have been treated with 3 prior TKIs,&#xD;
             and the last therapy must have been discontinued at least 14 days prior to starting&#xD;
             OTS167&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adequate organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Liver function (total bilirubin &lt;2 mg/dL and aspartate aminotransferase and/or&#xD;

                  to leukemic involvement)&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients (pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from&#xD;
