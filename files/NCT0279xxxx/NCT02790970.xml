  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a very common, serious and in some cases life-threatening condition, affecting&#xD;
      around 350 million people globally. Approximately 11% of citizens in the European Union&#xD;
      suffer from depression at some point in their lives. Depression is associated with&#xD;
      significant socio-economic costs and has been predicted to become the greatest cause of&#xD;
      disability worldwide by 2030 . In 2010 it was estimated that there were approximately 30&#xD;
      million patients with depression in Europe, with aggregated economic costs of approximately&#xD;
      €92 billion . Improvements in managing the treatment of depression are urgently needed to&#xD;
      improve patient outcomes, contain rising healthcare costs, improve workplace productivity and&#xD;
      help to address global economic and societal challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a range of effective antidepressant medications are available to treat depression, it&#xD;
      takes 4-6 weeks after starting antidepressant treatment before a physician can detect whether&#xD;
      the treatment is working. However, surprisingly, more than 50% of patients fail to respond to&#xD;
      the first antidepressant treatment they are prescribed. Therefore, it often takes several&#xD;
      months to identify an effective antidepressant treatment for the majority of patients with&#xD;
      depression. During this time a patient's ability to work and function socially is severely&#xD;
      impaired. Individuals may be absent from work for many weeks or months and this places a&#xD;
      substantial burden on the economy and on healthcare resources.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, two-arm, multi-centre, open label, clinical investigation of a&#xD;
      medical device, the Predicting Response to Depression Treatment Test (PReDicT Test) . It will&#xD;
      be conducted in depressed patients in primary care settings in five European countries (UK,&#xD;
      France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into an 8 to 10 week clinical phase and a 40 week follow-up phase. Each&#xD;
      participant will be in the study for a total of up to 48-50 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the clinical phase, participants will attend between 2 and 4 study visits, depending&#xD;
      on their study arm and their response to treatment. Some of these visits may be conducted by&#xD;
      telephone. Participants will also complete weekly online questionnaires from home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up phase participants will complete online questionnaires from home every 4&#xD;
      weeks over a 40 week period. Study visits will not be required during the follow-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) system, accessed via a study website, will be&#xD;
      used to collect questionnaire data and PReDicT Test responses. The ePRO system will be used&#xD;
      to randomise participants and will issue email reminders to participants and study&#xD;
      researchers when study-related activities are due.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening and PReDicT #1 The visit will take place at the study site 0 to 7 days&#xD;
      after the SSRI was prescribed. Visit 1 may take place on the same day as the Selective&#xD;
      Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) was prescribed only if local approvals permit this to&#xD;
      happen. Informed Consent must be obtained before any study procedures are performed. Visit&#xD;
      duration will be approximately 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will take place at Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unique participant screening number assigned&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics (including age, gender, ethnicity, number of years in higher education,&#xD;
           family history of depression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression history (as applicable), including age at first episode, number of past&#xD;
           episodes of depression and time since last episode&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication history (current medication, medication taken over the past month, any&#xD;
           available information on previous antidepressant medications)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Entry criteria check Participants that do not meet the entry criteria ('screen&#xD;
           failures') will leave the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that meet the entry criteria will complete the following activities in the order&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration of participant on the Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes(ePRO) system (by&#xD;
           study researcher)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant creates ePRO system account&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PReDicT Test (which includes the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self&#xD;
           Report (QIDS-SR-16) questionnaire from which baseline QIDS-SR-16 scores are obtained)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomisation (by the ePRO system)&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse Device Effects (ADEs) and device deficiencies will be&#xD;
           recorded from the signing of the ICF and continue until week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the visit, enrolled participants will be asked to start their prescribed SSRI.&#xD;
      Dose and frequency will be as prescribed by their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 is only required for participants in the PReDicT arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This visit will take place after PReDicT #2 has been completed. It will preferably take&#xD;
           place within 1 day (same day is permissible). The visit may be conducted by telephone&#xD;
           (if permitted locally) or at the study site. Visit duration will be approximately 5-10&#xD;
           minutes. The following will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study researcher will review the PReDicT Test results online.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the PReDicT Test results indicate a positive response to the prescribed&#xD;
           antidepressant:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Antidepressant treatment is not changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The next study visit is Visit 4 (there is no Visit 3 for this participant).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the PReDicT Test results indicate an insufficient response to the prescribed&#xD;
           antidepressant:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Antidepressant treatment is altered (by a physician) in accordance with locally&#xD;
                appropriate guidelines and judgement of the physician (i.e. normally the dose of&#xD;
                the current medication is increased).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 is only required for participants in the PReDicT arm who have completed PReDicT #3.&#xD;
      This visit will be the same as Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 (All Participants) The visit will take place 8-10 weeks after starting antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment. Visit duration will be approximately 60 minutes. All participants will then&#xD;
      continue into the online follow-up phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following Visit 4 activities must be completed at the study site and will take&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  OxCAP-MH (UK and Germany only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SAS-SR (screener version) For all online questionnaires, an email reminder will be sent&#xD;
           to each participant on the day that completion of the questionnaires is due. The email&#xD;
           will include a link to the questionnaires on the ePRO system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alert will be emailed to the study researchers after 2 days if the questionnaire(s) have&#xD;
      not been completed. A researcher will contact the participant as soon as possible and ask&#xD;
      them to complete the missing questionnaire(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve study participation and reduce drop-outs, participants in the PReDicT arm of the&#xD;
      study will be able to view their QIDS-SR-16 scores on the ePRO system from Visit 4 up to and&#xD;
      including the final online follow-up (Follow-Up #10, occurring 40 weeks after Visit 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescribing physicians and (if relevant) support staff at each study site will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a Healthcare Provider Acceptability Questionnaire at around the time that the final&#xD;
      participant at their study site completes Visit 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Healthcare Provider Acceptability Questionnaire is a 40-item questionnaire covering their&#xD;
      experience of taking part in the study, their experience of using the PReDicT Test in the&#xD;
      study and their future intentions regarding the use of the PReDicT Test. Additional space is&#xD;
      provided for free-text comments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In England and Germany, digitally recorded semi-structured interviews will be performed with&#xD;
      maximum variance samples of participants (patients), prescribing physicians and (if relevant)&#xD;
      support staff. Interviews will be conducted by fluent speakers of English and/or German (as&#xD;
      appropriate) and may be carried out face-to-face or by telephone/Skype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviewees will be selected in such a way that there is appropriate representation of&#xD;
      factors including age, gender, questionnaire responses, full- and part-time staff, urban and&#xD;
      rural location and high/low/non-recruiting study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 15 to 20 participants, 20-25 prescribing physicians and a small number of&#xD;
      support staff (if relevant) will be interviewed. Interviews will be conducted by trained&#xD;
      researchers and will take place during and after completion of the clinical phase of the&#xD;
      study, depending on whether participants or study staff are being interviewed. Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited for interview within 1 to 2 months after they have completed Visit 4.&#xD;
      Prescribing physicians and support staff will be interviewed after the end of the clinical&#xD;
      phase at their study site (when all participants have been recruited).&#xD;
