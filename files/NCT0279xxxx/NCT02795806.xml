  <brief_summary>

      Background: Electronic health records contain a vast amount of data about diseases and&#xD;
      treatments. Researchers could use this data to test their ideas, but they would need to use&#xD;
      records from more than just their own group of patients. But access to those records is&#xD;
      restricted to ensure patient privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) has created a computer tool called NLM Scrubber. This&#xD;
      program recognizes and deletes personal information from health records. The researchers who&#xD;
      developed this program now need access to the original records. This will allow them to see&#xD;
      how well the program removes personal information from patient records and how they can make&#xD;
      it more accurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find ways to improve clinical text de-identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No new participants. Researchers will review data that have already been collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will collect a random sample of reports. These will be from different doctors in&#xD;
      different fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will manually remove personal information from the records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will also automatically remove personal information from original records using&#xD;
      NLM-Scrubber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare the results of the computer program versus the manual changes. They&#xD;
      will note when the program has not been removing personal information correctly. They will&#xD;
      also note when the program has been deleting nonpersonal health information incorrectly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will use the results to revise the program. They will keep testing it until the&#xD;
      de-identification process is complete.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is about the quality assessment, improvement, and monitoring of an automatic&#xD;
      clinical text de-identification software application called NLM Scrubber, which has been&#xD;
      developed at the National Library of Medicine (NLM). The application has been developed so&#xD;
      that clinical reports can be used in secondary scientific studies (i.e., for secondary use)&#xD;
      without breaching patient privacy. Research on methods for protecting patient privacy and on&#xD;
      the development of NLM Scrubber have been conducted by following the guidelines of and in&#xD;
      compliance with HIPAA and the Privacy Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to further develop and improve NLM Scrubber and assess its de-identification&#xD;
      performance effectively, the investigators require the original / unredacted samples from all&#xD;
      potential clinical report types and sources. To this end, NLM investigators have been&#xD;
&#xD;
      collaborating with entities within NIH, namely, NIH Clinical Center, BTRIS, and NCI as well&#xD;
      as outside entities, Kentucky State Registry administered by University of Kentucky and&#xD;
      researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, who stated their interest in integrating NLM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scrubber to their application called Text Information Extraction System. These entities&#xD;
      collect samples of various types of clinical reports for assessing and improving NLM Scrubber&#xD;
      performance. However we also need access to the original data in order to assess&#xD;
&#xD;
      potential problems and improve the accuracy of NLM Scrubber.&#xD;

    <time_frame>01/01/2017-01/31/2027</time_frame>
    <description>HIPAA Privacy Rule defines 18 types of personally identifying information, that need to be de-identified, which include personal names, addresses, significant dates, numeric identifiers (such as socialsecurity number). Our annotators label those words and numbers creating a gold standard and NLM-Scrubber tries to recognize andeliminate all of them. The rate of de-identification of PII refers to success of this outcome measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The rate of erroneously redacted clinical information</measure>
    <time_frame>01/01/2017-01/31/2027</time_frame>
    <description>While NLM-Scrubber tries to eliminate only PII elements while preserving nonidentifying study data, it inadvertently deletes some ofthe non-identifying study data elements (non-protected health information) as well. The rate of erroneously redacted clinical information refers to the failure of NLMScrubber in preserving nonidentifying health information.</description>
