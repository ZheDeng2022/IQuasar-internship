      CFD simulations in this study provide detailed hemodynamics information, which cannot be&#xD;
      obtained from cardiac images alone. The investigators hypothesize that our proposed&#xD;
      simulations will provide strong correlation between hemodynamic parameters, such as WSSG and&#xD;
      SPA, and clinically identified graft stenosis. These correlations will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to identify the future patients at high risk of graft stenosis and lead to&#xD;
      future researches on optimizing and refining surgical plans, such as finding optimal proximal&#xD;
      and distal anastomoses locations, optimal graft length and diameter, which could lead to&#xD;
      improved longevity of the graft. Once CFD coupled shape optimizer is validated, it could be&#xD;
      part of the surgical simulator to help in training the next generation physicians. It could&#xD;
      provide new viewpoints for assessing whether some modified surgical techniques are better or&#xD;
      not. It could also aid in designing and evaluating the vascular medical devices, including&#xD;
      stent, artificial graft, and etc., which would lead to better surgical outcome.&#xD;

      Since the introduction of saphenous vein grafting in the late 1960s, CABG, with or without&#xD;
      arterial conduits, remains the gold standard for management of intractable angina due to&#xD;
      coronary artery occlusive disease. According to the statistics of American Heart Association,&#xD;
      571,000 of bypass procedures were performed on 355,000 patients in 1999. In Singapore, 831&#xD;
      CABG surgeries were carried out in 2011. With the aging of society, the number of bypass&#xD;
      operations is suspected to keep increasing over the years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the CABG was not without complications. The saphenous vein, which is the most&#xD;
      commonly used vessel for grafting, provides only palliation of the ongoing process.&#xD;
      Approximately 15% to 20% saphenous vein grafts occlude in the first year. An additional 2% to&#xD;
      5% grafts occlude each year between 2 to 10 years postoperatively. At 10 to 14 years, 50% of&#xD;
      the grafts are occluded. Similar data is reported in 2011 ACCF/AHA CABG guideline. Although&#xD;
      thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis are found by pathological examinations,&#xD;
      the exact mechanism of stenosis is still not fully understood. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that localized hemodynamic parameters is related to the sites of graft occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic parameters are propounded to be involved in localization of arterial stenosis in&#xD;
      literatures. High wall shear stress was found to lead abnormal endothelia cells by Fry on the&#xD;
      study of thoracic aorta in dogs. Intimal thicken and atherosclerosis was found to be&#xD;
      developed in the low WSS region when studying stenosis on postmortem human carotid&#xD;
      bifurcations, synthetic grafts on dog's carotid arteries and human coronary arteries. Both&#xD;
      high and low WSS segments was found to interplay with plaque development on human coronary&#xD;
      arteries. Bovine aortic endothelial cells density was found to increase in the high wall&#xD;
      shear stress gradient regions by Depaola and colleagues. Significantly increased WSSG was&#xD;
      found at the throat of the cervical carotid stenosis by Schirmer and colleagues for 8&#xD;
      patients. Stress phase angle was proposed to be a useful indicator in predicting sites prone&#xD;
      to atherosclerosis by Torii et al. when investigating a patient's right coronary artery with&#xD;
      stenosis. Low-density lipoprotein transportation was proposed to be a useful indicator in&#xD;
      predicting sites prone to atherosclerosis on human left coronary artery by Olgac and&#xD;
      colleagues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these hemodynamic parameters are related to the forces acting on the endocellar cells,&#xD;
      especially the wall shear stress. Signaling pathways have been proposed, which mediate the&#xD;
      mechano- chemical transduction in endothelial cells in response to disturbed WSS. Among the&#xD;
      WSS-related parameters, WSSG and SPA may be the most important, as WSSG measures the impact&#xD;
      of changes in surface forces, while SPA refers to the phase angle between WSS and WCS.&#xD;
      Therefore direct study on the human with CABG is necessary to provide strong correlation&#xD;
      between graft stenosis and hemodynamic parameters, which would be helpful in identifying the&#xD;
      patients at high risk of re-stenosis and optimizing the surgery from a mechanical standpoint.&#xD;
      The current project aims to fill in this gap.&#xD;
