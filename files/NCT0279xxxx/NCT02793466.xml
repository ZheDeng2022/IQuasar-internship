      This clinical trial is the first clinical trial to study Durvalumab, a checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
      which stimulates the patient's own immune system to act against cancer cells in children and&#xD;
      adolescents. This trial will assess the safety and tolerability of Durvalumab in children and&#xD;
      adolescents and also study how Durvalumab is processed in their bodies.&#xD;
