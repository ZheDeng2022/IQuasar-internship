      Aim: To evaluate the clinical survival of fluoride sealants applied in first permanent molars&#xD;
      affected by Molar-Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: For this case control study, it was selected 41 first permanent molars&#xD;
      of the 21 children aged 6-8 years. MIH was classified by one calibrated examiner (kappa 0.80)&#xD;
      according severity of the MIH lesion (EAPD, 2003). Inclusion criteria were FPM with MIH or&#xD;
      sound (without MIH), fully erupted, and with sealant treatment indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FPMs were assigned into two groups: G1 - Control group and G2 - MIH group. Both group&#xD;
      teeth were treated with sealant application (Fluroshield, NY, USA). Clinical follow-up was&#xD;
      performed at baseline, 1, 6, 12 and 18 months for anatomic form, marginal adaptation,&#xD;
      retention and presence of caries, according to the United States Public Health Service&#xD;
      USPHS-Modified by a blinded examiner (kappa 0.80). The Acturial Method was used to evaluate&#xD;
      the survival of sealants. Statistical analysis compared the ratings of each criterion between&#xD;
      materials using the Fisher's exact test at a level of significance of 5% (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;

      This study was conducted according to the Helsink Declaration. The approval was obtained from&#xD;
      the Ethics and Research Committee at Araraquara Dental School, São Paulo, Brazil (protocol&#xD;
      #11/09). All parents/guardians of the children signed the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This case control study included four clinical exams performed in 6 to 8 years-old children&#xD;
      that received preventive treated with sealants, divided into 2 groups: G1 - teeth not affect&#xD;
      by MIH and G2 - teeth affect by MIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 21 children included in the study had been previously diagnosed with MIH, according to&#xD;
      the EAPD criteria. A total of 41 first permanent molars teeth (FPM) were included, being 16&#xD;
      without MIH and 25 with MIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calibration of the examiner for the evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examiner was calibrated according to MIH based on criteria proposed by the European&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and for USPHS-Modified. The examiner assessed 32 clinical&#xD;
      photographs of patients from the Clinic of Pediatric Dentistry of the Araraquara Dental&#xD;
      School in São Paulo, Brazil, followed by a discussion with the MIH research team of all the&#xD;
      indices and codes. After an agreement, 30 patients with enamel alterations (17 of them with&#xD;
      MIH) were evaluated. After 2 weeks, the patients were reevaluated and the Kappa coefficient&#xD;
      was used to verify the agreement between the evaluations. The intra-examiner values for MIH&#xD;
      and USPHS-modified were 0.80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 41 FMP were clinically examined and classified according the presence of MIH according&#xD;
      the European Association of Paediatric Dentistry and were distributed into groups. The&#xD;
      preventive procedures were performed at the Pedodontics Clinics of São Paulo State&#xD;
      University, for another operator. All teeth receive pre-treat with care 4 weekly applications&#xD;
      of fluoride varnish (Duraphat, NY, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both group teeth were treated with sealants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four clinical exams (1, 6, 12 and 18 months) were performed in a clinical environment&#xD;
      according exams preconized by the World Health Organization under artificial lights and after&#xD;
      prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sealants were clinically evaluated by a calibrated examiner (Kappa 0.80). The groups were&#xD;
      evaluated according to the criteria for quality of the restoration proposed by the United&#xD;
      States Public Health Service USPHS-Modified and classified as satisfactory or unsatisfactory.&#xD;
      When the tooth was considered unsatisfactory, it was considered failure and the treatment was&#xD;
      replaced but it had not considered for the research evaluations.&#xD;
