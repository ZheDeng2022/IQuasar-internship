  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity have become an increasing problem in patients on hemodialysis.&#xD;
      However, in virtually all observational studies in chronic kidney disease(CKD) and dialysis&#xD;
      patients , using body mass index(BMI) as metric fat mass is associated inversely with death&#xD;
      rate. Nevertheless, it is questionable that obesity can be considered an unequivocal&#xD;
      protective factor in chronic diseases as increase body fat mass appears to be a potential&#xD;
      cause of the chronic inflammation frequently present in these patients. The consequences of&#xD;
      this inflammation are impaired nutritional status, accelerated atherosclerosis, and increased&#xD;
      mortality. In the present study, by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and&#xD;
      bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) to evaluated the contributions of fat mass to outcomes in an&#xD;
      observational cohort of hemodialysis patients. Besides, we aim to assess the relationship&#xD;
      between body fat composition, clinical metabolic risk profiles, measures of adiposity, such&#xD;
      as waist circumference (WC), visceral adiposity index, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and&#xD;
      waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), markers of inflammation and adipocytokines in these maintenance&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

      Patient Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically stable stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients (400 patients) attending the Tungs&#xD;
      Taichung Metroharbour will be enrolled in this study. These patients will be given written&#xD;
      information and are invited to participate in the study. Written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from each patient enrolled. Our hospital dialysis center undergoes multi-frequency&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis( BIA) scanning on a bimonthly basis as part of their ongoing&#xD;
      clinical care. Multi-frequency BIA is performed on patients attending the center as part of&#xD;
      their routine dry weight assessment. Among these patients, eighty ambulatory adults attending&#xD;
      for thrice-weekly outpatient hemodialysis treatments concomitantly had similar dual-energy&#xD;
      X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and postdialysis multi-frequency BIA assessments for review.&#xD;
      Patients with implantable defibrillators, those with cardiac pacemakers, and amputees are&#xD;
      excluded from the study. This study will be conducted prospectively for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Body Composition Assessment Measurements with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEXA was performed with patients in the supine position. The radiation exposure is estimated&#xD;
      to be one tenth of that for standard chest radiography. DEXA is scheduled postdialysis.&#xD;
      Whole-body composition, including total and segmental lean, total body fat mass, and bone&#xD;
      mineral content, will be calculated using the compatible software. For patients with multiple&#xD;
      multifrequency BIA estimations, the study performed will be arranged temporally to the DEXA&#xD;
      scan for more relevant comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Bioimpedance In all patients BIS will be carried out bimonthly using the Body&#xD;
      Composition Monitor (Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland Gesellschaft mit beschrankter Haftung&#xD;
      (GmbH), Germany), which takes measurements at 50 frequencies in a range of 5 to 1000&#xD;
      kilohertz(KHz). The measurement was performed approximately 30 minutes after the midweek&#xD;
      hemodialysis session, with four conventional electrodes being placed in the patient, who was&#xD;
      lying in the supine position: two in the hand and two in the foot contralateral to the&#xD;
      vascular access. Regarding the quality of measurements, all exceeded 95%. The manufacturer of&#xD;
      the Body Composition Monitor (Fresenius Medical Care) indicated that 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      hemodialysis session, the balance between intra-and extracellular fluid was restored and no&#xD;
      significant differences in relation to pre-dialysis values were observed. Parameters obtain&#xD;
      directly through BIS that are used in this study are free fat mass, lean body mass,&#xD;
      intracellular water (ICW) and extracellular water( ECW). Protein-energy wasting (PEW),&#xD;
      represented by the intracellular water/dry body weight (ICW/BW) ratio, and overhydration,&#xD;
      represented by the extracellular water/dry body weight(ECW/BW) ratio will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameters The following data will collected bimonthly : height (m)), dry&#xD;
      weight (kg) measured with a calibrated scale and body mass index(BMI,kg/m2). Abdominal&#xD;
      obesity is defined as a waist circumference of &gt;80 cm in women and &gt;90 cm in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical assays and other measurements Fasting blood samples (4 ml each time) were taken&#xD;
      just before starting a dialysis session.The vacutainers were kept cold and placed immediately&#xD;
      on ice, then they were centrifuged at 4 degree centigrade and the serum was stored at -80&#xD;
      degree centigrade until the analysis. The measurements of serum creatinine, cholesterol,&#xD;
      total proteins, albumin, prealbumin and carbon dioxide(CO2) were analysed using standard&#xD;
      methods. Urea reduction ratio and single-pool dialysis efficiency calculator(Kt/V) were used&#xD;
      to represent the administered dialysis treatment dose. To decrease intraindividual variation,&#xD;
      3-month averaged values for laboratory measures and urea reduction ratio during the study&#xD;
      calendar quarter were calculated and used in this study. High sensitivity C- reactive&#xD;
      proteins(CRP) was obtained by the immuno-turbidimetric method. Serum 25(OH)D3 was measured by&#xD;
      enzymeimmunoassay and the levels of intact parathyroid hormone( i-PTH) were assessed using&#xD;
      immunoradiometric assay. Plasma insulin levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay method.&#xD;
      Interleukin-6(IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) concentrations were measured in&#xD;
      duplicate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). Insulin resistance was assessed using&#xD;
      the following validated formula: homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance&#xD;
      (HOMA-IR)=(fasting glucose [mmol/1] × fasting insulin [μU/ml])/22.5. Because of confounding&#xD;
      introduced by exogenous insulin administration to HOMA-IR results, HOMA-IR was only measured&#xD;
      in patients who were not treated with insulin . All the above measurements will be done at&#xD;
      baseline, and the end of each years (4 times for the whole study)&#xD;
