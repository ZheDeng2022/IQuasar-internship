    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a peri-incisional&#xD;
      multimodal injection for post-operative pain control following operative management of femur&#xD;
      fractures. Enrolled subjects will be prospectively randomized into either the peri-incisional&#xD;
      injection or control cohorts. Patients will be treated with standard of care surgical&#xD;
      techniques by the treating orthopaedic surgeon for the patient's specific fracture pattern.&#xD;
      The patients randomized into the injection cohort will receive an intra-operative injection&#xD;
      with 400 mg ropivacaine, 0.6 mg epinephrine, 5 mg and morphine into the local superficial and&#xD;
      deep peri-incisional tissues while under general anesthesia. Visual analog pain scores will&#xD;
      be collected every 4 hours after surgery for the first two post-operative days. Total&#xD;
      narcotic consumption will also be recorded over eight hour intervals for the first two&#xD;
      post-operative days. Medication related side effects will be monitored. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the peri-incisional injection cohort will demonstrate an improved pain&#xD;
      profile and utilize less parenteral narcotic analgesia in the early post-operative period.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a peri-incisional&#xD;
      multimodal injection for post-operative pain control following operative management of femur&#xD;
      fractures. Patients will be identified by way of direct presentation to the orthopaedic&#xD;
      trauma service with an acute femur fracture. If the patient meets the parameters for study&#xD;
      enrollment (inclusion/exclusion criteria) the patient will be approached for introduction of&#xD;
      the study by a member of the surgical team. If the patient is agreeable to study enrollment,&#xD;
      he/she will have to complete the written informed consent process. This study protocol has&#xD;
      received formal approval from the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective, randomized, double-blind comparative trial. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to the two treatment groups: peri-incisional multimodal injection and&#xD;
      control (no injection). In order to create balanced cohorts with respect to intervention,&#xD;
      randomization will be completed in a block format across six discrete surgical techniques:&#xD;
      proximal femur open reduction and internal fixation (dynamic hip screw, trochanteric&#xD;
      stabilizing plate), distal femur open reduction and internal fixation (lateral peri-articular&#xD;
      locking plate), cephalomedullary fixation, other intramedullary fixation (antegrade or&#xD;
      retrograde intramedullary device without fixed angle construct into the femoral head),&#xD;
      percutaneous fixation, and arthroplasty (hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty).&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed with use of Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington)&#xD;
      to generate random numbers. The patients enrolled in the investigation as well as the nursing&#xD;
      staff performing the post-operative assessments are blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be treated with standard of care techniques chosen by the treating surgeon&#xD;
      regardless of whether or not the patient decides to enroll in the study. Written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained for the surgical procedure in addition to and independent from the&#xD;
      study consent. All surgical procedures will be completed under general anesthesia. No spinal,&#xD;
      regional, or preemptive anesthesia/analgesic regimen will be employed per study protocol.&#xD;
      Surgical drain placement and pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis will not be&#xD;
      standardized. Post-operative pain management will continue per the institutional standard of&#xD;
      care with a combination of intravenous and oral narcotic analgesia. The post-operative pain&#xD;
      regimen will not be specified nor altered by the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the peri-incisional injection cohort will receive a single&#xD;
      intra-operative injection while the subject is under general anesthesia following completion&#xD;
      of fracture fixation/instrumentation. The local anesthetic cocktail includes 400 mg of 0.75%&#xD;
      ropivacaine (53.33 mL), 0.6 mg of 1 mg/mL epinephrine (0.6 mL), 5 mg of 0.5 mg/mL morphine&#xD;
      sulfate (10 mL), and 36.07 mL 0.9% sodium chloride solution. All pharmacologic agents in the&#xD;
      anesthetic cocktail are FDA approved. For intra-articular proximal femur procedures the&#xD;
      cocktail will be evenly distributed between the deep (synovium, capsule, periosteum, gluteus&#xD;
      musculature) and superficial (fascia lata, vastus lateralis, subcutaneous plane) tissues&#xD;
      prior to wound closure. The same pattern will be followed for extra-articular proximal femur&#xD;
      procedures without direct injection of the synovium and capsule. The injection will be&#xD;
      similarly distributed between the deep (synovium, capsule, periosteum) and superficial&#xD;
      (quadriceps musculature, subcutaneous plane) tissues prior to wound closure for distal femur&#xD;
      procedures. Injections for intramedullary nails will be placed around the nail entry site&#xD;
      into bone and into the superficial tissues at both the entry site and cross lock locations.&#xD;
      All infiltrations will be completed with a blunt trochar to minimize the risk of&#xD;
      intravascular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is visual analog pain scores over the first two post-operative days.&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to use a 10-cm visual analog scale to describe their current&#xD;
      level of comfort with end points of zero corresponding to &quot;no pain&quot; and ten corresponding to&#xD;
      &quot;the most extreme possible pain.&quot; Pain assessments will be completed while patients are at&#xD;
      rest at standardized intervals immediately prior to surgery, in the post-anesthesia care unit&#xD;
      (captured as the mean of all individual data points), and every 4 hours following surgery for&#xD;
      the first two post-operative days. Visual analog pain scores are collected and charted by&#xD;
      nursing staff on the inpatient ward. All nursing staff will remain blinded to the treatment&#xD;
      allocation. Physician staff that have knowledge of the intra-operative treatment and&#xD;
      randomization are not involved in recording any outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures are total narcotic consumption, wound complications, and&#xD;
      drug-related side effects. Narcotic consumption will be recorded every eight hours for the&#xD;
      first two post-operative days and transformed into narcotic equivalents. Every fifteen&#xD;
      minutes in the post-anesthesia care unit and every four hours for the first two&#xD;
      post-operative days nursing personnel will monitor the patients via direct observation and&#xD;
      query for medication side effects related to ropivacaine toxicity including blurred vision,&#xD;
      hearing problems, transient peripheral paralysis, dizziness, convulsion, uncontrolled muscle&#xD;
      contraction, hypotension, bradycardia, and new onset arrhythmia. Anesthesiology staff will&#xD;
      also perform two standardized post-operative assessments in the recovery room and on the&#xD;
      first post-operative day to screen for adverse effects related to the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An a priori power analysis was completed for sample size determination for the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure. A preliminary retrospective analysis revealed a standard deviation of 2.5 on&#xD;
      the visual analog pain scale twelve hours following surgery (unpublished data). Prior&#xD;
      literature has suggested that a change of 1.0-1.3 points on the visual analog scale is&#xD;
      clinically significant. Therefore, the investigators determined a total of 44 patients were&#xD;
      required per study group in order to detect a 1.5 point difference on the visual analog scale&#xD;
      with a power of 80% and a P-value of 0.05. The Student t test and the chi-squared test of&#xD;
      association will be used to compare continuous and categorical variables between the two&#xD;
      groups, respectively. Statistical significance is defined as p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient confidentiality will be maintained at all times. Only approved research team&#xD;
      personnel will review the medical records. Only the minimal data necessary to answer the&#xD;
      research questions will be obtained. Collected electronic data will be stored on password&#xD;
      protected servers. Written informed consent documents will be stored in a locked filing&#xD;
      cabinet in the Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation at the University of Iowa&#xD;
      Hospitals and Clinics. Upon publication and completion of data analysis all information with&#xD;
      patient identifiers will be destroyed.&#xD;

            <description>A 100 cc multimodal analgesic cocktail will be injected into the superficial and deep peri-incisional tissues after the completion of femur fracture fixation/instrumentation while the patient remains under general anesthesia and prior to wound closure. This cocktail includes 400 mg of 0.75% ropivacaine (53.33 mL), 0.6 mg of 1 mg/mL epinephrine (0.6 mL), 5 mg of 0.5 mg/mL morphine sulfate (10 mL), and 36.07 mL 0.9% sodium chloride solution.
