      To better understand the PK and associated pharmacodynamic (PD) responses produced by the&#xD;
      Research ENDS S-TA-U001 product, this study will compare the Research ENDS S-TA-U001 to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject's own brand combustion (non-menthol) cigarette and a U.S. FDA approved&#xD;
           smoking cessation product, the NICORETTE Inhalator, in current non-menthol cigarette&#xD;
           smokers who have some limited e-cigarette experience (Group 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Commercially available products in current primarily e-cigarette users (experienced ENDS&#xD;
           users) (Group 2) The PK/PD session for each product will be conducted in a controlled&#xD;
           clinical setting with frequent PK sampling after 14 hours of supervised abstinence from&#xD;
           all forms of nicotine. Subjects will familiarize themselves with the Research ENDS&#xD;
           S-TA-U001 and NICORETTE Inhalator by using each product in the real world for one day&#xD;
           before the PK/PD session for that product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 objectives are to characterize the nicotine PK profile (eg, maximum plasma&#xD;
      concentration [Cmax], time to maximum plasma concentration [Tmax], area under the&#xD;
      concentration-time curve [AUC], and terminal half-life [t1/2]) for 10 inhalation and ad lib&#xD;
      sessions of Research ENDS S-TA-U001 and explore how the Cmax compares to a 15 ng/mL level&#xD;
      during the 4.5-minute 10 inhalation and the 6 hour ad lib use sessions, to compare the PK&#xD;
      profiles between Research ENDS S-TA-U001 to the profiles of combustion cigarettes measured at&#xD;
      the baseline session, and to demonstrate superiority of PK profile of Research ENDS S-TA-U001&#xD;
      to that of the marketed NICORETTE Inhalator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 objectives are to characterize the nicotine PK profile of Research ENDS S-TA-U001 and&#xD;
      explore how the Cmax compares to a 15 ng/mL level during the 4.5-minute 10 inhalation and 6&#xD;
      hour ad lib use sessions, and to compare the PK profile between Research ENDS S-TA-U001 to&#xD;
      the profile of a commercial ENDS product measured at the baseline session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include comparison of the nicotine PK of the Research ENDS S-TA-U001 to&#xD;
      the subjects' normal nicotine source (combustion cigarettes for Group 1 or commercial ENDS&#xD;
      for Group 2), to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Research ENDS S-TA-U001, to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects on craving and user satisfaction of the Research ENDS S-TA-U001 vs a combustion&#xD;
      cigarette or the NICORETTE Inhalator (Group 1) or a commercial ENDS product (Group 2), and to&#xD;
      evaluate various biomarkers following use of each test product.&#xD;

      Subjects in Group 1 will participate in a Phase 1 2×2 cross-over study of the Research ENDS&#xD;
      S-TA-U001 (Test Product A) and NICORETTE Inhalator (Test Product B). Subjects in Group 2 will&#xD;
      participate in a study to examine the effect of the Research ENDS S-TA-U001 (Test Product A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 20 healthy volunteers, ages 21 to 65 inclusive, who are current combustion&#xD;
      cigarette smokers will be enrolled into Group 1 for the 2×2 cross-over study. Approximately&#xD;
      14 healthy volunteers, ages 21 to 65 inclusive, who are current primarily e cigarette users&#xD;
      will be enrolled into Group 2. Initial screening for the study will occur from 7 to 21 days&#xD;
      before the first PK assessment/in-clinic device Training Visit on Day 1. Subjects in Group 1&#xD;
      will be randomized to Sequence AB (10 subjects) or Sequence BA (10 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, subjects will arrive at the research site to begin at least 14 hours of overnight&#xD;
      supervision to insure abstinence from all forms of nicotine prior to the first administration&#xD;
      of the Baseline Product. Each subject will complete a 10 inhalation session of his or her&#xD;
      normal nicotine source (either the subject's own brand of a combustion cigarette [Group 1] or&#xD;
      the subject's own brand of commercial ENDS product [Group 2]) in 4.5 minutes, abstain for 1&#xD;
      hour 55 minutes, complete a second session of 10 inhalations in 4.5 minutes, complete a 6&#xD;
      hour ad lib use session, and complete a series of behavioral assessments over the PK&#xD;
      sampling/observation period lasting 8 hours and 5 minutes. The first series of 4.5-minute 10&#xD;
      inhalation sessions will be videotaped to assess inhalation duration and technique. Subjects&#xD;
      will abstain from food for one hour before each 10 puff session and caffeine within one hour&#xD;
      of the first 10 puffs through the duration of the entire ad lib session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the sampling/observation period on Day 1, subjects in Group 1 Sequence AB and&#xD;
      subjects in Group 2 will be trained on how to properly use the Research ENDS S-TA-U001, and&#xD;
      Group 1 Sequence BA subjects will be trained on how to properly use the NICORETTE Inhalator.&#xD;
      Prior to discharge, subjects will be provided with two cartridges of the Research ENDS&#xD;
      S-TA-U001 or a set of NICORETTE Inhalator for at-home use for 1 day (starting immediately&#xD;
      after clinic discharge) depending on the group and sequence to which they are assigned.&#xD;
      Subjects will be encouraged (though not required) to use the Research ENDS S-TA-U001 or&#xD;
      NICORETTE Inhalator as their exclusive nicotine source. Subjects will record the number of&#xD;
      combustible cigarettes smoked (if any) and the number of cartridges of the Research ENDS&#xD;
      S-TA-U001 or NICORETTE Inhalator used, depending on sequence (Group 1), or the number of&#xD;
      cartridges of the Research ENDS S-TA-U001 used and the amount of e liquid used (if any) from&#xD;
      their commercial ENDS products (Group 2). All subjects will be required to return all of the&#xD;
      study devices used as well as used and unused cartridges at the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 3, subjects will arrive at the research site to begin at least 14 hours of overnight&#xD;
      supervision to insure abstinence from all forms of nicotine prior to the first administration&#xD;
      of the Test Product. Subjects in Group 1 Sequence AB and Group 2 will complete a 10&#xD;
      inhalation session of Research ENDS S-TA-U001 in 4.5 minutes, abstain for 1 hour 55 minutes,&#xD;
      complete a second session of 10 inhalations in 4.5 minutes, followed by a 6 hour ad lib use&#xD;
      session. Subjects in Group 1 Sequence BA will complete a 10 inhalation session of NICORETTE&#xD;
      Inhalator, abstain for 1 hour 55 minutes, complete a second session of 10 inhalations in 4.5&#xD;
      minutes, followed by a 6 hour ad lib use session. A series of behavioral assessments will be&#xD;
      performed during the PK sampling/observation period lasting 8 hours and 5 minutes. The first&#xD;
      series of 4.5 minute 10 inhalation sessions for both products will be videotaped to assess&#xD;
      inhalation duration and technique. Subjects will abstain from food for one hour before each&#xD;
      10 puff session and caffeine within one hour of the first 10 puffs through the duration of&#xD;
      the entire ad lib session. Subjects in Group 2 will be discharged from the clinic following&#xD;
      the final PK blood draw and completion of all final clinical assessments on Study Day 3.&#xD;
      Following the sampling/observation period, subjects in Group 1 Sequence AB will be trained on&#xD;
      how to properly use the NICORETTE Inhalator and subjects in Group 1 Sequence BA will be&#xD;
      trained on how to properly use the Research ENDS S-TA-U001. Prior to discharge, subjects,&#xD;
      depending on the group and sequence to which they are assigned, will be provided with two&#xD;
      cartridges of the Research ENDS S TA U001 or a set of NICORETTE Inhalator for at-home use for&#xD;
      1 day (starting immediately after clinic discharge). Subjects will be encouraged (though not&#xD;
      required) to use the Research ENDS S-TA-U001 or NICORETTE Inhalator as their exclusive&#xD;
      nicotine source. All subjects will be required to return all of the study devices used as&#xD;
      well as used and unused cartridges at the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 5, subjects in Group 1 will arrive at the research site to begin at least 14 hours of&#xD;
      overnight supervision to insure abstinence from all forms of nicotine prior to the first&#xD;
      administration of the Test Product. Subjects in Group 1 Sequence AB will complete a 10&#xD;
      inhalation session of NICORETTE Inhalator in 4.5 minutes, abstain for 1 hour 55 minutes,&#xD;
      complete a second session of 10 inhalations in 4.5 minutes, followed by a 6 hour ad lib use&#xD;
      session. Subjects in Group 1 Sequence BA will complete a 10 inhalation session of Research&#xD;
      ENDS S-TA-U001 in 4.5 minutes, abstain for 1 hour 55 minutes, complete a second session of 10&#xD;
      inhalations in 4.5 minutes, followed by a 6-hour ad lib use session. A series of behavioral&#xD;
      assessments will be performed during the PK sampling/observation period lasting 8 hours and 5&#xD;
      minutes. The first series of 4.5 minute 10 inhalation sessions for both products will be&#xD;
      videotaped to assess inhalation duration and technique. Subjects will abstain from food for&#xD;
      one hour before each 10 puff session and caffeine within one hour of the first 10 puffs&#xD;
      through the duration of the entire ad lib session. Subjects in Group 1 will be discharged&#xD;
      from the clinic following the final PK blood draw and completion of all final clinical&#xD;
      assessments on Study Day 5.&#xD;
