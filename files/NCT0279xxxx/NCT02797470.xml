      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of gene therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related lymphoma that did not respond to&#xD;
      therapy or came back after an original response receiving stem cell transplant. In gene&#xD;
      therapy, small stretches of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) called &quot;anti-HIV genes&quot; are&#xD;
      introduced into the stem cells in the laboratory to make the gene therapy product used in&#xD;
      this study. The type of anti-HIV genes and therapy in this study may make the patient's&#xD;
      immune cells more resistant to HIV-1 and prevent new immune cells from getting infected with&#xD;
      HIV-1.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Safety, defined as timely engraftment (the collective establishment of a persistent&#xD;
      absolute neutrophil count of at least 500 cells/mm^3 and platelet count of 20,000 cells/mm^3&#xD;
      without transfusion for 3 consecutive days) at one month post transplant, in the absence of&#xD;
      any study candidate specific grade 3 and 4 non-hematopoietic organ toxicity or any clonal&#xD;
      expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Efficacy of the candidate product, defined as establishment of &gt; 5% mononuclear blood&#xD;
      cells expressing anti-HIV genes in the peripheral blood at 3 months post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the presence, quantity, and duration of gene modified HIV-1 resistant&#xD;
      peripheral blood cells and gut mucosal immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study the integration sites of vector sequences in circulating cells. III. To study&#xD;
      progression-free survival. IV. To study overall survival. V. To study complete response rate&#xD;
      and duration. VI. To study partial response rate and duration. VII. To study time to&#xD;
      neutrophil engraftment (first of 3 consecutive days of absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &gt; 500&#xD;
      cells/mm^3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To study time to platelet engraftment (first of 3 consecutive days of platelets &gt;&#xD;
      20,000 cells/mm^3 without platelet transfusions 7 days prior).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To study hematologic function at day 100 (ANC &gt; 1500, hemoglobin [Hb] &gt; 10 g/dl without&#xD;
      transfusion and platelets &gt; 100,000) X. To study cluster of differentiation (CD)4 recovery at&#xD;
      the conclusion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. To study safety in terms of toxicities, infections, transfusions, and infusion-related&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. To study HIV-1 viral load over time. XIII. To study persistence of vector-transduced&#xD;
      cells over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the presence and the magnitude of expansion of HIV-1 resistant immune cells in&#xD;
      the peripheral blood and gut mucosa of transplanted participants, subsequent to withholding&#xD;
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive BEAM regimen administered as standard of care comprising carmustine on day&#xD;
      -6, cytarabine twice daily (BID) on days -5 to -2, etoposide BID on days -5 to -2, and&#xD;
      melphalan on day -1. Patients undergo infusion of lentivirus vector CCR5 shRNA/TRIM5alpha/TAR&#xD;
      decoy-transduced autologous CD34-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 60,&#xD;
      90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, 480, 520, 600, 660, and 720, and then yearly for at least&#xD;
      15 years.&#xD;
