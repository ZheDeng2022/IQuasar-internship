  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research suggests that women with substance use disorders may be at a higher risk of&#xD;
      unintended pregnancy. There is a paucity of interventions specifically focused on this&#xD;
      population. Through using mixed methods, this study proposes to develop a brief peer-led&#xD;
      intervention (based on the Health Belief Model) to prevent unintended pregnancies among women&#xD;
      entering opioid medication-assisted treatment; to assess acceptability, feasibility and the&#xD;
      initial efficacy of the behavioral intervention; and to conduct exploratory analyses to&#xD;
      identify the Health Belief Model constructs that are most influential on use of long-acting&#xD;
      reversible contraception methods. Future research would include testing the intervention in a&#xD;
      larger scale trial and with other populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a reproductive health intervention to prevent unintended pregnancy&#xD;
      for women of child-bearing age in opioid medication-assisted treatment (OMAT). It will be&#xD;
      conducted in two phases. The first formative phase will employ individual interviews and&#xD;
      focus groups with women between the ages of 18 and 44 and in opioid medication-assisted&#xD;
      treatment to better understand: pregnancy desires/motivation and perceived susceptibility and&#xD;
      severity, contraceptive knowledge, perceived benefits/barriers, self-efficacy, social norms,&#xD;
      behaviors, and access to contraception and family planning services, especially related to&#xD;
      long-acting reversible contraception. This information, coupled with prior evidence and&#xD;
      theory, will be used to develop a brief peer-led behavioral intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility and the initial efficacy of the developed intervention. Women will&#xD;
      be recruited from two opioid medication-assisted treatment facilities and once they have&#xD;
      consented and the baseline survey is completed they will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      behavioral intervention or usual care. Participants will complete a baseline, three and&#xD;
      six-month post-baseline follow up survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those randomized to the intervention arm, the first session will occur immediately&#xD;
      post-consent and baseline, and the second will occur 2-4 weeks post-baseline. A trained&#xD;
      peer-educator will deliver the behavioral intervention that will provide accurate, unbiased&#xD;
      information about Long Acting Reversible Contraception (intrauterine devices and subdermal&#xD;
      implants) and all other contraceptive methods (including effectiveness, advantages, and&#xD;
      disadvantages), help women assess their needs (pregnancy desires compared to behavior), and&#xD;
      utilize motivational interviewing to empower them to make an informed decision regarding&#xD;
      their sexual health. For those that are interested, the peer-educator will connect women to a&#xD;
      Denver Health Community Health Clinic or a clinic of their choosing to further explore&#xD;
      appropriate birth control methods. The medical clinic will assess the woman and determine and&#xD;
      dispense the most appropriate method.&#xD;
