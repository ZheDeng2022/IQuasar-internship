      The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of early microvascular disease assessed by&#xD;
      coronary physiologic indices such as fractional flow reserve (FFR), coronary flow reserve&#xD;
      (CFR), index of microvascular resistance (IMR) on future occurrence of cardiac allograft&#xD;
      vasculopathy (CAV) in heart transplant recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) or acute cellular rejection (ACR) are a leading cause of&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity in heart transplant recipients. Most of the cases occur within 5&#xD;
      years after transplant and later incidence was known to be infrequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms of CAV or ACR are thought to be multi-factorial involving both immunologic and&#xD;
      non-immunologic factors that leads to injury of coronary endothelium and intimal hyperplasia.&#xD;
      This unique mechanism results in long, diffuse and concentric stenosis of coronary arteries,&#xD;
      different from those with conventional coronary atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to lack of typical ischemic symptoms by denervated heart, diagnosis of CAV depends on&#xD;
      routine screening tests rather than symptom based investigation. International Society for&#xD;
      Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guideline recommends annual or biannual coronary&#xD;
      angiography screening until 5 years after transplant, but sensitivity of coronary angiography&#xD;
      is limited because of diffuse involvement of all segments of coronary arteries.&#xD;
      Alternatively, Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a current standard for diagnosis and&#xD;
      prognostication of CAV. It is well studied that progressive intimal thickening during the&#xD;
      first year after transplant predicts future incidence of CAV and poor prognosis. However, the&#xD;
      use of IVUS in the diagnosis of CAV is not generalized due to technical issues, high cost,&#xD;
      procedure complications and ISHLT guideline states it is an option to exclude donor coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, to detect rapidly progressive CAV, and provide prognostic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent development of single guidewire thermodilution technique enabled simple way to measure&#xD;
      microvascular indices such as FFR, CFR, IMR. Our previous study shows, in patients with&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease, presence of microvascular disease defined by low CFR and high IMR,&#xD;
      predicts poor prognosis even without apparent epicardial disease. Considering its mechanism&#xD;
      to involve diffuse coronary vasculature, CAV is believed to affect microvascular circulation&#xD;
      in the early phase and spread to epicardial disease in its course. For this reason, by&#xD;
      evaluating coronary physiology early after transplant, it may be possible to predict future&#xD;
      progression of CAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were previous studies which evaluated microvascular dysfunction in heart transplant&#xD;
      patients. These studies indicated microvascular dysfunction at time of transplantation is&#xD;
      related to progression of epicardial disease during first year after transplant, but lack of&#xD;
      follow up prohibited from drawing any conclusion on occurrence of CAV later on. Another study&#xD;
      by the same group evaluated microvascular dysfunction at 1 year after transplant and revealed&#xD;
      it was associated with allograft vasculopathy at 5 years after transplant. However, this&#xD;
      study did not evaluate impact of earlier assessments of microvascular dysfunction at time of&#xD;
      transplantation on occurrence of CAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the current study will perform early physiologic assessments including fractional&#xD;
      flow reserve, coronary flow reserve, and index of microcirculatory resistance in patients who&#xD;
      received heart transplant and evaluate the impact of initial microvascular dysfunction on&#xD;
      future occurrence of CAV or ACR during 6 years of follow up. The investigators hope to&#xD;
      develop strong predictors of CAV or ACR that can be evaluated early after heart transplant&#xD;
      and to improve outcome by preemptive therapy before overt development of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a pilot study and target sample size will be 200 consecutive patients to&#xD;
      receive heart transplant.&#xD;
