  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common intraocular tumor of childhood. Recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory disease following therapy most often occurs due to persistence of vitreous disease&#xD;
      and/or retinal reactivation of the main tumor mass. With this treatment protocol,&#xD;
      investigators seek to identify a less invasive method of local drug delivery that does not&#xD;
      disrupt the eye's integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and toxicity profile associated with intravitreal carboplatin&#xD;
           for the treatment of recurrent or progressive intraocular retinoblastoma with vitreous&#xD;
           seeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the ocular salvage rate after treatment with intravitreal carboplatin in&#xD;
           patients with recurrent or progressive intraocular retinoblastoma with vitreous seeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of intravitreal carboplatin therapy on the histopathology of&#xD;
           eyes enucleated for progressive or recalcitrant disease while on therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eye(s) will be sterilized prior to injection. Aqueous fluid (0.1-0.15ml) will be&#xD;
      withdrawn and sent for pathology review. Carboplatin diluted in normal saline will be&#xD;
      administered via intravitreal injection under anesthesia once to each eligible eye&#xD;
      approximately every 14 days. Following the injection, triple freeze/thaw cryotherapy is&#xD;
      applied to the injection site and the eye is washed with water. The eye is gently &quot;shaken&quot; in&#xD;
      all directions to evenly distribute the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will use a traditional phase I design for dose de-escalation with two dose levels.&#xD;
      The first 6 patients will be enrolled at dose level 1 and will be observed for dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) throughout the treatment period up to approximately 5 months after start of&#xD;
      therapy. If 0-2 (of the first 6) participants experience DLT, a second cohort of 6 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled at the same dose level 1. Study accrual would be completed at 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, if 3 or more of the first 6 patients experience DLT at dose level 1, the dose level&#xD;
      would be de-escalated to level -1 and 6 patients enrolled at this level (dose -1). If 0-2&#xD;
      patients experience DLT at dose level -1, a second cohort of 6 patients will be enrolled at&#xD;
      dose level -1, and the study accrual would be complete. If 3 or more patients experience DLT&#xD;
      at dose level -1, accrual would also be complete.&#xD;

    <description>DLTs are defined as any of the following: uveitis, sterile or infectious endophthalmitis, retinopathy or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, massive vitreous hemorrhage that obscures direct visualization of the retina/tumor, and/or cataract that threatens the visual axis or view by treating physician.&#xD;
Grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions should lead to discontinuation of intravitreal carboplatin injections. Patients who have grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions will not be evaluable for this objective and will be replaced.</description>

    <intervention_name>Carboplatin</intervention_name>
    <description>Carboplatin will be given intravitreally. Participants are eligible to receive up to 8 injections per eye (once approximately every 14 days) based on lack of toxicity and evidence of tumor response. An injection of consolidation will be given once a complete response is observed. If further regression of &quot;stable&quot; seeds is noted, additional injections (up to 8 maximum per eye) will be provided at the discretion of the treating team. Injections could be repeated if vitreous recurrence occurs from another source (and patient has not reached 8 max limit per eye).</description>
