    <textblock>
      Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a promising new ablation technique to fight pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. The primary aim of the CROSSFIRE trial is to compare the efficacy (in terms of&#xD;
      overall survival) of FOLFIRINOX and IRE (experimental arm) to the efficacy of FOLFIRINOX and&#xD;
      stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) (control arm) in patients with locally advanced,&#xD;
      non-resectable, non-metastasized, pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      progression free survival, safety/toxicity, immunomodulation, tumor marker Cancer Antigen&#xD;
      (CA) 19.9, quality of life (QoL), and total direct and indirect costs for each treatment arm&#xD;
      (cost-effectiveness analysis).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers; 94% of pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis, 74% within the first year of&#xD;
      diagnosis; only 6% will survive for more than five years. Surgical resection is the only&#xD;
      curative option. However, about 40% present with non-metastatic locally advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      carcinoma (LAPC; AJCC stage III). These patients are not eligible for surgical resection&#xD;
      because the tumor involves major blood vessels such as the superior mesenteric artery, celiac&#xD;
      axis, common hepatic artery and/or portal vein. These patients are currently treated with&#xD;
      palliative chemotherapy as first line therapy. Focal therapy using external beam radiation&#xD;
      therapy (EBRT) may further improve survival, but outcome remains poor. Stereotactic ablative&#xD;
      radiotherapy (SABR) is a form of EBRT that has important advantages over conventional&#xD;
      radiotherapy such as a more precise and greater biological dose delivery and hence less&#xD;
      toxicity and presumably better outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients diagnosed with LAPC, a combination of chemotherapy plus local tumor destruction&#xD;
      using irreversible electroporation (IRE), a novel tumor ablation technique, has recently&#xD;
      shown great promise. IRE is based on permeabilization of the cell membrane through electrical&#xD;
      pulses leading to apoptosis. Theoretically, IRE only affects viable tumor tissue, leaving&#xD;
      surrounding vital structures relatively intact. It is therefore considered to cause less&#xD;
      morbidity than thermal ablative strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CROSSFIRE-trial is a prospective, randomized controlled phase-II/III trial.The primary&#xD;
      aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of chemotherapy and IRE (experimental arm) to&#xD;
      the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation (control arm) in patients with locally advanced,&#xD;
      non-resectable, non-metastasized, pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 138 patients with histologically proven locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (AJCC stage III), aged ≥ 18 years will be included. Patients with a specific cardiac history&#xD;
      (arrhythmias, pacemaker), pre-existent ECG-abnormalities and/or non-retrievable metallic&#xD;
      self-expanding biliary stents are excluded from participation. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to receive either chemotherapy and radiation (control arm) or chemotherapy and IRE&#xD;
      (experimental arm).&#xD;
