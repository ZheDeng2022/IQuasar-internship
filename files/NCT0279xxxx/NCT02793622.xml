  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blinded randomized controlled phase III trial of 782 HIV uninfected&#xD;
      pregnant women and the children born to them. HIV uninfected women at 12-20 weeks gestation&#xD;
      will be randomized in equal proportions to one of two intermittent preventive treatment in&#xD;
      pregnancy (IPTp) treatment arms: 1) monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), or 2) monthly&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP). Both interventions arms will have either SP or DP&#xD;
      placebo to ensure adequate blinding is achieved in the study. Follow-up for the pregnant&#xD;
      women will end approximately 6 weeks after giving birth. All children born to mothers&#xD;
      enrolled in the study will be followed from birth until they reach 12 months of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women will be scheduled to be seen in the clinic every 4 weeks during their&#xD;
      pregnancy and then 1 and 6 weeks following delivery. In addition, pregnant women will be&#xD;
      instructed to come to the study clinic for all their medical care and avoid the use of any&#xD;
      outside medications. Children will be scheduled to be seen in the clinic at 1, 4, 6, and 8&#xD;
      weeks of age and then every 4 weeks until they reach 52 weeks of age. Parents/guardians will&#xD;
      be instructed to bring their children to the study clinic for all medical care and avoid the&#xD;
      use of any outside medications. The study clinic will remain open 7 days a week from 8 a.m.&#xD;
      to 5 p.m. Study participants not seen in the clinic for their every 4 week routine visits&#xD;
      will be visited at home and requested to come to the study clinic as soon as possible.&#xD;
      Pregnant women and children will receive standard of care as designated in the Uganda&#xD;
      Ministry of Health guidelines. Routine antenatal care will include screening and treatment&#xD;
      for sexually transmitted infections, blood pressure assessment, urine dipstick for&#xD;
      proteinuria, prescription of iron, folate, multivitamins and mebendazole. Routine care in&#xD;
      children will include immunizations, vitamin A supplementation, and management of anemia&#xD;
      using Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines. During routine&#xD;
      assessments subjects will be asked about visits to outside health facilities and the use of&#xD;
      any medications outside the study protocol. Standardized assessment of adherence will be done&#xD;
      for study drugs administered at home and insecticide treated net use. A routine history and&#xD;
      physical exam will be performed using a standardized clinical assessment form. Blood will be&#xD;
      collected by finger prick for thick smear (in very young children, heel sticks may be&#xD;
      substituted for finger pricks), capillary plasma (for routine visits where phlebotomy is not&#xD;
      done in pregnant women only) and filter paper samples. If a pregnant woman or parent/guardian&#xD;
      of a child reports a fever in the last 24 hours or the patient has a documented temperature &gt;&#xD;
      38.0ËšC tympanic, the patient's thick blood smear will be read immediately and if positive the&#xD;
      patient will be diagnosed and treated for malaria. If the thick blood smear is negative, the&#xD;
      patient will be managed by study physicians for a non-malarial febrile illness. If the&#xD;
      patient is afebrile and does not report a recent fever, a thick blood smear will not be&#xD;
      obtained, except when following routine testing schedules. In pregnant mothers, thick blood&#xD;
      smears other than those done when a mother has fever will not be used for clinical care of&#xD;
      study participants. Phlebotomy for routine laboratory tests (CBC and ALT) to monitor for&#xD;
      potential adverse events from study medications, storage of plasma and for immunology studies&#xD;
      will be performed every 8 weeks in pregnant women. Phlebotomy for routine laboratory tests&#xD;
      (CBC) and immunology studies will be performed at 12, 28, and 52 weeks of age in children.&#xD;
      For pregnant women, study drugs will be administered at the time of each routine visit. ECGs&#xD;
      will be performed to measure the QTc interval in all pregnant women just prior to the 1st&#xD;
      dose of study drugs and 2-3 hours after their 3rd dose of study drugs at 20, 28 and 36 weeks&#xD;
      of gestation. In addition a finger prick capillary plasma sample will be collected just prior&#xD;
      to performing the ECGs after the 3rd dose of study drugs at 20, 28, and 36 weeks of gestation&#xD;
      in pregnant women.&#xD;

In addition, placebos will be used to mimic the identical dosing strategy such that every 4 weeks women will receive two drugs on day 1 (SP and placebo or DP and placebo) followed by one drug on days 2 and 3 (DP or placebo). Two placebos will be used, one that mimics the appearance of SP and one that mimics the appearance of DP.&#xD;
