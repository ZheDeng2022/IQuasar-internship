      ABSORB BTK Study: A prospective, multicenter, controlled clinical evaluation of the use of a&#xD;
      bioresorbable drug eluting stent in the arterial vasculature below the knee&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of a bioresorbable vascular scaffold&#xD;
      (BVS) coated with the drug Everolimus. This will be used to treat short length blockages of&#xD;
      up to 55mm (5.5cm) in arteries below the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be performed to treat patients who have severe leg pain or have developed skin&#xD;
      ulcers or gangrene which are not healing due to insufficent blood supply. The ABSORB&#xD;
      Everolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold works on similar principles of drug&#xD;
      eluting stents which have been used for a considerable time in treating blocked arteries.&#xD;
      However this product consists of a scaffold coated with a drug so rather than leaving a&#xD;
      metallic stent in the blood vessel, this product primarily delivers the drug, gives&#xD;
      mechanical support to the blood vessel and once it is no longer needed the scaffold absorbs&#xD;
      into the body leaving no permanent metallic implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This same device has been used safely and effectively in the arteries which supply the heart&#xD;
      both in clinical trials and current practice and has also been evaluated in the leg arteries&#xD;
      in a single-centre pilot study. This study aims to evaluate it's use in a larger number of&#xD;
      patients in multiple centres and compare that to a historical control group of metal drug&#xD;
      eluting stents. The study will evaluate both ultrasound and angiographic derived patency in&#xD;
      those arteries out to a 36 month follow-up time point. This data will be collected in&#xD;
      patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria and who are then treated and followed over time.&#xD;
