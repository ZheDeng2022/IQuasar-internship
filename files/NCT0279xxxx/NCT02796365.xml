    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify patients at risk for future heart failure using&#xD;
      novel markers of early cardiac damage and determine if exercise training can improve these&#xD;
      emerging markers as well as overall fitness and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With more than 14 million cancer survivors in the United States, more patients than ever are&#xD;
      living well beyond their initial cancer diagnosis. However despite the tremendous progress,&#xD;
      cancer treatments often come with adverse side-effects, perhaps none are more serious or&#xD;
      devastating than chemotherapy induced heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many patients, the clinical manifestation of heart failure may not appear until a year, or&#xD;
      several years, after completion of chemotherapy. While an echocardiogram is part of&#xD;
      standardized surveillance for patients on these drugs, current echocardiogram parameters may&#xD;
      not be sensitive enough to quickly detect early heart damage which, in some cases, is&#xD;
      irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, even if detected early, there is no uniformity in terms of how to best treat&#xD;
      patients with subclinical cardiac dysfunction who are at risk for heart failure. The use of&#xD;
      certain blood pressure drugs show promise, especially in patients with hypertension. However,&#xD;
      in addition to drug side-effects (e.g. dizziness/lightheadedness), they do not target the&#xD;
      underlying mechanism of chemotherapy induced cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise, in various forms, has shown promise in animal studies as a potential&#xD;
      cardio-protective therapy to counteract drug toxicity. In general, exercise has many&#xD;
      pleiotropic effects for patients receiving chemotherapy (e.g. reduces fatigue, improves&#xD;
      endurance, reduces frailty, and enhances quality of life). Relative to DOX toxicity, research&#xD;
      involving animals has also shown that exercise protects against deleterious heart dysfunction&#xD;
      while showing an enhancement of potential mechanisms involved in chemotherapy induced heart&#xD;
      failure (i.e. anti-oxidant and anti-apoptosis pathways).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cancer who receive either doxorubicin (DOX) or trastuzumab will be screened by&#xD;
      one of two methods: 1) a strain echo or 2) a high sensitivity troponin. If either test is&#xD;
      positive, patients will meet with a board-certified cardiologist who will determine if the&#xD;
      patient may participate in the exercise trial. Under the supervision of a trained clinical&#xD;
      exercise physiologist patients will undergo baseline testing, which includes: a quality of&#xD;
      life assessment via questionaires, a body composition test, cardiopulmonary stress test and a&#xD;
      muscle strength test. These assessment will be performed at baseline and at 12 weeks. Also&#xD;
      performed at 12 weeks will be a repeat strain echo and high sensitivity troponin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following baseline testing patients will be randomized into exercise training versus standard&#xD;
      care. The exercise training will include 12 weeks of cardiac rehabilitation which can be&#xD;
      offered in Detroit, Livonia, or West Bloomfield. Exercise will consist of 3 days per week of&#xD;
      an interval training aerobic exercise on a treadmill and/or bike for 30-60 minutes and 1-2&#xD;
      days per week of an individualized resistance training program.&#xD;
