  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) the commonest cause of death is respiratory failure.&#xD;
      Respiratory failure can have many causes. However, in patients with CF a major contributor is&#xD;
      the impairment of the muscles required for breathing (respiratory muscles). Respiratory&#xD;
      muscle impairment can result from poor nutrition. Lung function declines particularly during&#xD;
      adolescence whilst body composition also changes at the same time. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to study the relationship of nutrition and body composition to respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength and lung function in children and young people with CF aged between 12-18 years. The&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) is currently used in the clinical setting to measure nutritional status&#xD;
      in CF. At King's College Hospital (KCH) there are portable devices to assess both respiratory&#xD;
      muscle function and lung function. The research team will use a Bioelectrical Impedance&#xD;
      Analysis (BIA) device to assess body composition, including BMI and lean body mass (LBM). The&#xD;
      aim of the study is primarily to assess whether measurements of LBM impairment may better&#xD;
      relate to poor lung function compared to BMI and secondly to examine whether lung and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle function correlates with exercise tolerance.&#xD;

      In patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) the commonest cause of death is respiratory failure.&#xD;
      Respiratory failure can have many causes. However, in patients with CF a major contributor is&#xD;
      the impairment of the muscles required for breathing (respiratory muscles). Respiratory&#xD;
      muscle impairment can result from severe narrowing of the airways, poor nutrition, chronic&#xD;
      infection and inflammation, lack of aerobic exercise and use of steroids (Dassios, 2015). The&#xD;
      most rapid decline in lung function is seen during adolescence and coincides with a change in&#xD;
      body composition (Loomba-Albrecht, 2009). The body mass index (BMI) is currently used in the&#xD;
      clinical setting to quantify nutritional status in CF. However, measurements of the&#xD;
      proportion of lean muscle, such as lean body mass (LBM), may better describe nutritional&#xD;
      impairment in CF (Pedreira, 2005, Ionescu, 1998). LBM and BMI have been measured using dual&#xD;
      x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in children and young adults with CF showing a stronger&#xD;
      association of LBM rather than BMI with pulmonary function especially in the undernourished&#xD;
      adolescent (Sheikh, 2014). Assessment of respiratory muscle function and body composition has&#xD;
      previously required specialised equipment, such as DXA, which is not readily available in&#xD;
      many CF clinics. In addition, DXA involves radiation which may have unwanted side effects if&#xD;
      used routinely for body composition monitoring. At King's College Hospital there are now,&#xD;
      however, portable devices to assess both respiratory muscle function and body composition.&#xD;
      The investigators will use a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) device to calculate body&#xD;
      composition, including BMI and LBM. The aim of the study is primarily to assess whether LBM&#xD;
      rather than BMI better predicts both pulmonary and respiratory muscle function using portable&#xD;
      equipment that avoids use of avoidable radiation. Secondly, the research team aims to examine&#xD;
      whether pulmonary and respiratory muscle function correlates to exercise capacity. These may&#xD;
      yield useful information about targeting nutritional support and exercise to improve&#xD;
      respiratory muscle and pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional study will be undertaken. Age, height, and weight will be recorded.&#xD;
      Spirometry, impulse oscillometry and body plethysmography will be measured with a&#xD;
      pneumotachograph based system (Jaeger Masterscreen PFT, Carefusion Ltd, Basingstoke UK)&#xD;
      according to the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society guidelines.&#xD;
      The highest value of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second&#xD;
      (FEV1), ratio of FEV1 to VC (FEV1/VC), forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of VC (FEF&#xD;
      25-75%), functional residual capacity (FRC), residual volume (RV), total lung capacity (TLC),&#xD;
      respiratory system resistance at 5Hz and 20Hz (Rrs5, Rrs20) will be recorded following at&#xD;
      least three technically acceptable measurements. Respiratory muscle function data will be&#xD;
      obtained from the Micro RPM Respiratory Muscle Analyser (CareFusion, San Diego, California,&#xD;
      USA): maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), sniff nasal&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure (SNIP), maximum relaxation rate (MRR), time constant of relaxation (Ï„,&#xD;
      tau), and maximum rate of pressure development (MRPD). A respiratory health questionnaire&#xD;
      will be completed. Body composition information will be obtained with the Inbody S10 Body&#xD;
      Composition Analyzer (Inbody Ltd, Cerritos, California, USA): Body mass index (BMI), BMI-z&#xD;
      scores, fat free mass (FFM), segmental lean mass (LM) [LM-right arm (LMRA), LM-left arm&#xD;
      (LMLA), LM-trunk (LMTR), LM-right leg (LMRL), LM-left leg (LMLL)], visceral fat area (VFA),&#xD;
      body cell mass (BCM). A field test to assess exercise tolerance test will be performed and&#xD;
      the level of habitual activity will be assessed using a questionnaire. Information will be&#xD;
      collected on genetic mutations, chronic infection status, use of systemic corticosteroids,&#xD;
      and co-morbidities.&#xD;
