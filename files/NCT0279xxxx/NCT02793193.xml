  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut-brain axis is described as being important in both, gut functions and central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) functions. The microbiota in the gut plays an important role in this axis&#xD;
      through neural, immune and endocrine systems. Previous studies have found altered gut&#xD;
      microbiota (GM) composition could change the CNS functions in animals and humans. Probiotics&#xD;
      were shown having positive effect on improving stress response in animals and stress related&#xD;
      psychiatry in humans. The current study will investigate if probiotics can improve response&#xD;
      to social stress in healthy participants and patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),&#xD;
      which is a stress-related disease, and whether this probiotic action can be counteracted by&#xD;
      the locally acting antibiotic, Rifaximin. The investigators will use the Cyberball paradigram&#xD;
      to induce social stress and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record neural responses related&#xD;
      to the social stress. The administration of the probiotics will be a new strategy for both&#xD;
      the mental health management and treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the experience of social stress may help to&#xD;
      prevent the development of IBS and to help people to maintain their mental health. Social&#xD;
      distress has been examined with the Cyberball paradigm in developing peers and children with&#xD;
      autism spectrum disorders, people with social anxiety disorder and with borderline&#xD;
      personality disorder. These studies provided researchers the clinical evidence and validity&#xD;
      of the paradigm in patients . Here the investigators will examine the neural response of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers to acute stress induced by the Cyberball game and if acute intervention&#xD;
      with probiotics for 4 weeks can alleviate the stress response. The study will be firstly&#xD;
      conducted on healthy volunteers whose GM will be disturbed by an antibiotic Rifaximin as to&#xD;
      simulate IBS patients, to see their neural response to the social exclusion (Study 1). The&#xD;
      second study will be conducted as a clinical trial in healthy volunteers to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum 1714 (Study 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1 &amp; 2 will be a randomized, double blind, double dummy design, during which the&#xD;
      participants will visit the laboratory for 2 times (M1, M2,): measurement at baseline and&#xD;
      after intervention. Intervention period lasts for 1 week in study 1 and 4 weeks in study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study 1, Group 1 will take Rifaximin for 1 week Group 2 will take Placebo for 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study 2, Group 1 will take B.longum 1714 for 4 weeks Group 2 will take Placebo for for 4&#xD;
      weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be not allowed to eat certain kinds of food. As mentioned in the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, participants will not eat probiotic/prebiotic containing food supplements, or&#xD;
      potentially immune-enhancing dietary supplements either. The food to be avoided will be&#xD;
      summarized on a list of probiotic/prebiotic containing food. Also, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to record the food they take on each day during the intervention, by taking photos.&#xD;
      Nutritional information about the food taken by the participants will be analyzed by using an&#xD;
      online tool http://nutritiondata.self.com/.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the intervention period, each participant will need to complete questionnaires&#xD;
      including a demographic questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and the&#xD;
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The PHQ is for excluding those healthy&#xD;
      participants who suffer from psychiatry disorder(s) and for further analysis. The HADS, which&#xD;
      will also be completed after each intervention period, aims to study the effect of the&#xD;
      probiotic on anxiety and depression level in healthy participants and especially in IBS&#xD;
      patients. Also, participants will receive a daily online questionnaire via email, including&#xD;
      the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scales, and questions about their level of stress,&#xD;
      consumption of the study capsules, hours of sleep, IBS symptom and quality of life (QoL) (the&#xD;
      last two are only for patients), etc. Through questionnaires, the investigators will record&#xD;
      menstruation information of female participants for controlling confounders. Also, gender and&#xD;
      age between healthy and patient groups will be matched as much as possible, since these&#xD;
      factors could have an effect on the GM composition and the CNS functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will be collected on the day participants come to a lab visit for measurements.&#xD;
      The stool sample should be as fresh as possible, ideally collected in the morning of the&#xD;
      visiting day. Fresh samples will be stored in RNA synthesis stabilization buffer at the time&#xD;
      of collection. A centrifuged fecal pellet will be stored at -80째.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Magnetoencephalography measuring, before the Cyberball game, there will be a&#xD;
      resting state session for 5 minutes. In this session participants will be studied in supine&#xD;
      position. Participants will be instructed to move as little as possible and remain awake,&#xD;
      while keeping their eyes closed. After the resting state recording the Cyberball game will&#xD;
      start. The task of the game will be projected on a screen and participants will be asked to&#xD;
      fixate the screen and hold a response box to get ready for the task. Magnetic fields will be&#xD;
      measured with a 275-channel whole head magnetometer at a sampling rate of 1200 Hz. In order&#xD;
      to overlay the brain activity derived from MEG on anatomical scans, a high-resolution (1 mm,&#xD;
      isotropic) T1-weighted structural MR image will be acquired with an MPRAGE sequence with a&#xD;
      3-T MR scanner (University Hospital T체bingen, T체bingen, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 participants will be needed in each experimental group in study 1, resulting in at least 14&#xD;
      in study 1. 20 participants will be needed in each experimental group in study 2, resulting&#xD;
      in at least 40 in study 2. The recruitment of participants will be organized by the MEG&#xD;
      center under the responsibility of Prof. Dr. Christoph Braun. The study will be announced on&#xD;
      black boards in the T체bingen University Clinic and the campus of the University. Further&#xD;
      announcements will be done via the University mailing list and the local newspaper. Each&#xD;
      participant will be provided with detailed information about the aims of the investigation,&#xD;
      the tasks and measurements. Participants will be informed about the possibility to cancel the&#xD;
      examination at any time without cause or prejudice for her person. Investigation will be&#xD;
      carried out only when written consent from the participants is obtained.&#xD;
