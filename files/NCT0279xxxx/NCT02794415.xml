      The primary aim of this research is to evaluate a community-based exercise (CBE) intervention&#xD;
      for adults living with HIV within the community with the goal of reducing disability and&#xD;
      enhancing health (cardiopulmonary, strength, weight and body composition, and neurocognitive&#xD;
      outcomes) and contextual factor outcomes (social support, stigma, mastery, coping) for adults&#xD;
      living with HIV.&#xD;

      Investigators will use the RE-AIM Framework to evaluate the community-based exercise (CBE)&#xD;
      intervention. The RE-AIM Framework includes criteria to evaluate the impact and translation&#xD;
      of an intervention at both individual and organizational-levels in order to promote uptake,&#xD;
      transferability and ultimately enhance the public health impact of health promotion&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific study objectives are: 1) To determine the extent (proportion of sessions attended,&#xD;
      frequency, intensity, time, type) to which adults with HIV participate in a CBE intervention;&#xD;
      2) To assess the effect of a CBE intervention on disability and health outcomes and intrinsic&#xD;
      and extrinsic factor outcomes for people living with HIV; 3) To assess engagement in CBE for&#xD;
      adults with HIV over time (adherence, level of physical activity); and 4) To evaluate the&#xD;
      process (strengths and challenges; feasibility; accessibility, long term sustainability) of&#xD;
      implementing a CBE intervention within the community from the perspective of recreation&#xD;
      providers (fitness instructors; managers) and people living with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct a prospective longitudinal study using mixed methods to evaluate a&#xD;
      CBE intervention in the community with people living with HIV. They will use an interrupted&#xD;
      time series (ITS) design in combination with qualitative interviews to assess outcomes at&#xD;
      baseline (pre-testing phase), during (intervention phase) and after the CBE intervention&#xD;
      (post-testing phase) to evaluate the short- and long-term effect of CBE.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention Phase (6 months): The HIV Community-Based Exercise (CBE) intervention is a 6-month exercise program at the Central Toronto YMCA. Participants will meet the fitness instructor to establish an individualized exercise program that will include a combination of aerobic, resistive, neuromotor and flexibility training. Participants will attend exercise sessions for ~1.5 hour, 3 times per week for 24 weeks. Sessions will be supervised weekly by a fitness instructor.&#xD;
Post-Intervention Phase (8 months): At the end of the 24 week intervention, participants will be encouraged to continue to engage in unsupervised exercise 3 times per week. As per usual practice at the YMCA, a fitness instructor will be available to monitor participants monthly.</description>
