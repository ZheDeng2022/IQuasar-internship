      Potential (SSVEP) based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) device to facilitate communication of&#xD;
      common patient needs in alert mechanically ventilated patients in the Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
      (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine patient, family and bedside nurse satisfaction with&#xD;
      communication using the BCI device and elicit open-ended feedback to guide future device&#xD;

      a picture board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of the primary self-identified primary patient need on the BCI device will be&#xD;
      compared to the icon selected on the picture board (reference standard). A patient&#xD;
      satisfaction survey will then be provided to the patient or a family member following use for&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      An inability to consistently and effectively communicate their most fundamental physical&#xD;
      needs is a major problem for mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Patients rate about 40% of&#xD;
      communication sessions as difficult and more than a third of communications about pain as&#xD;
      unsuccessful. Nurses initiate about 86% of all communication exchanges as it is typically&#xD;
      very difficult for a voiceless ICU patient to initiate communication. Patients in the ICU&#xD;
      therefore commonly suffer unrecognized pain and discomfort, feelings of loss of control and&#xD;
      insecurity, depersonalization, anxiety, sleep disturbances, fear and frustration. Caregivers&#xD;
      also frequently report feeling anxious and frustrated in not being able to adequately assess&#xD;
      the needs of their patients. This inability to communicate effectively can lead to the&#xD;
      inappropriate use of sedatives and prolongation of time spent on the ventilator, which may&#xD;
      then lead to increased ICU length of stay and costs. Furthermore, the inability to&#xD;
      communicate with caregivers hampers the ability of critically ill patients to be active&#xD;
      participants in their treatment and in decision-making, including decisions to withdraw or&#xD;
      withhold life-sustaining treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of picture boards with icons representing common patient needs and complaints (pain,&#xD;
      fear, hot/ cold, thirst, bedpan etc) has been shown to improve nurse-patient communication&#xD;
      for patients in the postoperative period on the ventilator. These picture boards are widely&#xD;
      available in most ICUs and are the closest thing to a current standard for communication with&#xD;
      voiceless mechanically ventilated patient, for the purposes of addressing fundamental&#xD;
      physical and emotional needs. Recent pilot studies have described the use of&#xD;
      computer-assisted communication using touch sensitive screens, eye blink detectors and gaze&#xD;
      trackers to enable communication in the ICU patient. The majority of patients and hospital&#xD;
      staff surveyed in these studies indicated that the use of a computer-assisted communication&#xD;
      device improved the ability to respond to patient needs and address patient comfort. Gaze and&#xD;
      eye blink tracker systems are expensive, however, while touch sensitive screens may not be&#xD;
      suitable for the many ICU patients with weakness and restriction in motor ability. Patients&#xD;
      in the ICU, particularly those with neurological illness, frequently suffer from significant&#xD;
      weakness and loss of co-ordination, however, limiting their ability to use their arms and&#xD;
      hands to indicate the appropriate item on the board. While patients in the neuroICU are&#xD;
      frequently weak because of focal brain injury, about a quarter of patients requiring&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in other ICUs may have significant weakness from critical illness&#xD;
      neuropathy and myopathy, limiting their ability to use their hands to select the appropriate&#xD;
      icon on a picture board. There are several patient populations, however, for whom the use of&#xD;
      a picture board or touch screen is impossible, including patients with high spinal cord&#xD;
      injury, advanced ALS and brainstem stroke, who are voiceless, but also typically have no&#xD;
      useful motor function of their limbs. These patients are &quot;locked-in&quot;, to varying degrees,&#xD;
      awake and alert but with no control of bodily function or ability to articulate and&#xD;
      communicate using standard forms of communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) devices to facilitate communication in &quot;voiceless&quot;&#xD;
      patients has recently generated interest. A BCI translates deliberate, voluntary modulation&#xD;
      of cerebral electrical activity, typically recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) into&#xD;
      computer commands. A variety of BCI devices have been used to permit patients with advanced&#xD;
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), high spinal cord injury and brainstem stroke with the&#xD;
      locked-in-syndrome, who have no voluntary use of their limbs, to communicate to varying&#xD;
      degrees. These devices have typically been evaluated in the rehabilitation setting, following&#xD;
      the period of acute medical illness, or at home. No study has evaluated the use of a BCI&#xD;
      device to assist with communication of the typical physical and emotional needs/ complaints&#xD;
      of the critically ill. This is significant, not only for patients with spinal cord injury and&#xD;
      stroke, most of who are initially admitted to an ICU, but to the potentially large number of&#xD;
      ICU patients who cannot use a picture board or other finger contact system because of&#xD;
      critical illness neuropathy/ myopathy or acute brain injury causing weakness. Our focus is on&#xD;
      creating a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) based, wireless BCI system to&#xD;
      facilitate communication with intubated ICU patients., The wearable BCI device of interest in&#xD;
      this study functions through visual attention to illustrative icons displayed on an&#xD;
      electronic screen. The icon, which may depict a common ICU patient need, such the need for&#xD;
      repositioning or common patient complaint, such as pain, can be displayed as a symbol. The&#xD;
      patient can, thereby, communicate by looking at a specific item depicting their need or&#xD;
      complaint. This wearable device is entirely noninvasive and without significant risk to&#xD;
      patients, functioning only to record and translate EEG signals. The device will communicate&#xD;
      wirelessly with the user interface (UI) that can be either a tablet or the flat screen TV&#xD;
      monitor that is present in every ICU patient room. The proposed prototype provides a user&#xD;
      interface that includes basic functions that are typically used in communication between&#xD;
      nurses and patients in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a translational pilot study of a Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based&#xD;
      BCI system to facilitate communication in intubated patients. After obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent from the patient or their legally authorized representative, 30 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from the medical, surgical, cardiac, cardiothoracic and neurological intensive care&#xD;
      units at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor over a period of 12 months. Approval has been&#xD;
      obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan (HUM00095052).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for delirium and ability to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be identified by members of the primary ICU team, who will then&#xD;
      contact a study investigator. Subjects will need to be off all sedating medicines with return&#xD;
      to full wakefulness prior to further evaluation. Patients meeting the above eligibility&#xD;
      criteria who consent to participate in the study will then undergo further testing by an&#xD;
      investigator to confirm that the patient is sufficiently alert and attentive to communicate&#xD;
      AND is capable of consistently selecting items through volitional finger contact. The patient&#xD;
      will then undergo a screening evaluation with the BCI device to confirm that their individual&#xD;
      EEG signal can be detected and interpreted by the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient complaints/ needs: The investigators will evaluate the ability of subjects to&#xD;
      accurately select a specific need or complaint from 10 common needs/ complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;I am in pain&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;I have difficulty breathing&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &quot;I need to be suctioned&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. &quot;I need to have a bowel movement&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. &quot;I need to pee/ pass urine&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. &quot;I am thirsty&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. &quot;I am hungry&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. &quot;I need to have my position in bed changed&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. &quot;Raise the head of my bed&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. &quot;I need my family at my bedside&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Picture board: Feasibility of communication using the BCI device will be evaluated using a&#xD;
      picture board with illustrative icons representing the 10 needs/ complaints above as the&#xD;
      standard for comparison and to determine the accuracy of selection of the appropriate icon.&#xD;
      The icons and phrases on the picture board will be identical to the icons and phrases on the&#xD;
      BCI device&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the feasibility of using a Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based&#xD;
      Brain Computer Interface (BCI) device to facilitate communication of common patient needs in&#xD;
      alert mechanically ventilated patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: At least 80% of alert mechanically ventilated patients will be able to&#xD;
      accurately select the illustrative icon on the brain computer interface representing the&#xD;
      physical or emotional need self-identified by the patient as being the most common trigger&#xD;
      for communication with the bedside nurse during their admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orientation to BCI and picture board: The patient will initially be familiarized with both&#xD;
      the picture board and the BCI device. Instruction on use of the BCI device will include&#xD;
      demonstration of the UI, explanation of the icons on the UI and the mechanism of selection of&#xD;
      an icon, through focused visual attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of need/ complaint: Immediately following orientation, testing for accuracy of the&#xD;
      BCI device will be performed. Testing for accuracy will be performed a single time for each&#xD;
      patient, using the most important need/ complaint for that patient. The patient will be asked&#xD;
      to identify on the BCI UI the specific need or complaint as being the most common reason to&#xD;
      request the assistance of the bedside nurse during their admission, among the 10 patient&#xD;
      need/ complaint options provided. Selection of &quot;None of the above/ Other&quot; will be permitted,&#xD;
      however, the patient will be specifically instructed in advance to select the need/ complaint&#xD;
      most applicable to their situation among the 10 choices provided. The patient will then be&#xD;
      asked to select the SAME need/ complaint on the picture board using finger contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine patient, family and bedside nurse satisfaction with&#xD;
      communication using the BCI device and elicit open-ended feedback to guide future device&#xD;
      improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: At least 70% of patients will &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;strongly agree&quot; with the statement&#xD;
      &quot;The Brain computer interface device allowed me to communicate my needs to the bedside nurse&#xD;
      adequately&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following evaluation of accuracy described under Specific Aim 1, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate patient, family and bedside nurse satisfaction following bedside&#xD;
      use of the device as the primary communication tool for 2 hours a day for 3 consecutive days.&#xD;
      A delirium screen using CAM-ICU and a brief neurological examination to confirm the patient's&#xD;
      ability to effectively use the BCI device and picture board will be performed prior to use of&#xD;
      the device or picture board on subsequent days (days 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 3 days, the patient, any family members present and each nurse who&#xD;
      participated in testing will be provided the short questionnaires. The patient questionnaire&#xD;
      with options will be read out to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients who pass Step 2 of screening who then also pass Step 3 will be&#xD;
      calculated with exact binomial 95% confidence intervals. A proportion of at least 70% passing&#xD;
      Step 3 of screening will be the initial threshold for feasibility, based on clinical&#xD;
      estimates of value. The median time, with interquartile range, required for orientation to&#xD;
      the BCI device and to the picture board will be calculated, and comparison performed using&#xD;
      the Mann Whitney U-test. The proportion of patients who select the same icon on the BCI UI&#xD;
      and the picture board will be calculated, with exact binomial 95% confidence intervals. In&#xD;
      determining the accuracy of using the BCI device, a binomial analysis including multiple&#xD;
      studies of BCI estimated the chance level at 63% (α = 0.05, 60 trials). Based also on a&#xD;
      clinical estimate of what would be a minimum useful level of accuracy for a communication&#xD;
      device, the threshold for accuracy in our study will be at least 80% of patients&#xD;
      demonstrating concordance between selection of their most important need/ complaint on the&#xD;
      BCI device and the picture board. Descriptive statistics will be used to for proportions of&#xD;
      patients selecting responses to each of the satisfaction questions.&#xD;
