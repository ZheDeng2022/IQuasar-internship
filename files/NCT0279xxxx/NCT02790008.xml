      Aortic valve disease causes impaired let ventricular function (LVF) due to hypertrophy,&#xD;
      dilatation and diffuse myocardial fibrosis yet the prognostic effect of fibrosis, waiting&#xD;
      time for operation and postoperative exercise training is presently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to (1) determine the changes in LVF for patients on the waiting list;&#xD;
      (2) establish non-invasive diagnostics for diffuse myocardial fibrosis; (3) relate LVF to&#xD;
      fibrosis and physical capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unique design (echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test, cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance tomography and myocardial biopsy on the same patients) makes it possible to&#xD;
      establish relationship between results of histology and imaging; quantifying and qualifying&#xD;
      fibrosis in vivo, evaluate LVF vs. general cardiopulmonary function and optimize health care&#xD;
      prior to and after operation.&#xD;

      AORTIC VALVE DISEASE &amp; VENTRICULAR FUNCTION Aortic valve disease is the most common valvular&#xD;
      heart disease in Europe (46.4%). The valve can be stenotic (aortic stenosis, AS) or can leak&#xD;
      (aortic regurgitation, AR). While mostly elderly patients suffer from AS (a steadily growing&#xD;
      group due to the increasing population above 60 years), AR occurs in younger individuals&#xD;
      (20-60 years in general) who are still working and have a long life expectancy. The current&#xD;
      treatment is aortic valve replacement (AVR) and in Sweden approx. 1800 AVR are performed&#xD;
      every year with an increasing tendency. AVR is a procedure with low mortality (1.7%)&#xD;
      nevertheless there is limited information available about postoperative morbidity, physical&#xD;
      performance and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present guidelines suggest surgery when patients are presented with symptoms and/or show&#xD;
      impairment of LVF (increasing LV diameters, declining ejection fraction - EF). These are&#xD;
      though fairly crude measures as both symptoms and LV dilatation occur late in the natural&#xD;
      history of the disease. Furthermore, we found previously that symptoms and LVF did not&#xD;
      correlate which warrants the quest for searching more precise indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AS causes pressure and AR causes volume overload which the LV compensates by concentric or&#xD;
      eccentric hypertrophy initially. As the disease progresses even histological changes present&#xD;
      e.g. diffuse fibrosis. Regional fibrosis after myocardial infarction is known to cause&#xD;
      impaired LVF. However, there is no information available in the medical literature on how&#xD;
      diffuse myocardial fibrosis affects LVF and whether it would be reversible following&#xD;
      prosthetic valve implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac surgery always carries risks for complications (e.g. mortality, stroke, postoperative&#xD;
      arrhythmias, infections etc.) and life with a prosthetic heart valve is not necessarily&#xD;
      uncomplicated. Our previous studies showed that preoperative impairment of the LVF can be&#xD;
      irreversible and, as Gjertson showed, can progress to heart failure despite operation.&#xD;
      Postoperative heart failure has a profound impact on long-term prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIBROSIS &amp; CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (cMRI) Well defined ischemic scars visualized&#xD;
      reliably on cMRI by late gadolinium enhancement making it a useful diagnostic modality for&#xD;
      myocardial viability in the clinical practice. Currently, in-vivo information on diffuse&#xD;
      myocardial fibrosis is limited and optimal imaging method for clinical use is not established&#xD;
      yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOMARKERS Biomarkers of myocardial fibrosis and their use as diagnostic tool for heart&#xD;
      failure have been emerging lately. However, their diagnostic or predictive value for diffuse&#xD;
      myocardial fibrosis in AS patients is not studied yet. The present study examines diffuse&#xD;
      myocardial fibrosis pre- and postoperatively in AS patients, thus providing possibility to&#xD;
      evaluate if fibrosis biomarkers can contribute as diagnostic/predictive markers for diffuse&#xD;
      myocardial fibrosis and/or myocardial remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the hypothesis that amount and location of the fibrotic tissue can be connected to&#xD;
      impairment of LVF in severe aortic valve disease. We aim to validate special sequences&#xD;
      (developed in Link√∂ping) of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) as a diagnostic tool&#xD;
      and to get information about the reversibility of myocardial fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we plan to survey the physical capacity by cardiopulmonary exercise testing&#xD;
      (CPET) pre- and postoperatively and study the relationship between physical performance&#xD;
      capacity, fibrosis and LVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS During cMRI T1 and T2 mapping of three ventricular slices equally spaced in the short&#xD;
      axis direction will be performed. Gadolinium contrast is given for renewed T1 mapping&#xD;
      allowing the calculation of the distribution volume, which will be taken as a sign of&#xD;
      fibrosis. Functional data are calculated from the cine images. Flow images are generated by&#xD;
      2D phase contrast recording of through-plane flow times the flow area produces an estimate of&#xD;
      stroke volume and cardiac output. In a 4D phase contrast recording, LV inflow can be&#xD;
      characterized in terms of four flow compartments as well as the presence or absence of&#xD;
      vortices in the intraventricular flow pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D-QALAS (3D-quantification using an interleaved Look-Locker acquisition sequence with T2&#xD;
      preparation pulse) is based on a 3D spoiled Turbo Field Echo sequence using inversion&#xD;
      recovery with interleaved T2 preparation. It allows rapid acquisition and provides&#xD;
      quantitative information of both T1 and T2 relaxation times in the same scan with full&#xD;
      coverage of the LV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NT-proBNP, HsTnT, and markers for myocardial fibrosis are to be taken to assess relations&#xD;
      between these parameters and fibrosis in the heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperatively 5 biopsies (1.2 mm) are to be taken of the LV in a standardized fashion.&#xD;
      Samples are to be dyed and analysed by an image quantification program for verification and&#xD;
      quantification of fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPET records data about the cardiovascular and respiratory systems under stress&#xD;
      simultaneously.&#xD;
