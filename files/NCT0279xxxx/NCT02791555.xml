      The investigators are evaluating the effect of Pradaxa in comparison to warfarin on bone&#xD;
      turnover and bone density in men and women with atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

      1.0 Hypothesis: The direct thrombin inhibitor Pradaxa positively affects bone turnover&#xD;
      markers and increases bone mineral density in women and men at risk for osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Goal: The goal of this study is to establish if the direct thrombin inhibitor Pradaxa&#xD;
      positively affects bone turnover markers and increases bone mineral density in women and men&#xD;
      at risk for osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Specific Aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 To determine the effect of Pradaxa on bone mineral density in patients after 6 and 12&#xD;
      months of daily use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 To determine the effect of the direct thrombin inhibitor Pradaxa on bone turnover markers&#xD;
      for osteoclastic resorption (measured as serum levels of C-terminal peptide, and&#xD;
      N-telopeptide) and osteoblastic formation (measured as serum levels of bone-specific alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, osteocalcin and P1NP) in subjects after 6 and 12 months of daily use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 To evaluate any correlation among the hemoclot, thrombin inhibitor test, changes in&#xD;
      markers of bone turnover and changes in bone mineral density in patients on Pradaxa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 To determine the effect of Pradaxa on change in serum levels of receptor activator of NF&#xD;
      B-ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), RANKL/OPG ratio, inflammatory markers (IL-1b, IL-6,&#xD;
      TNF-alpha and FGF-23) and inhibitors of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway including&#xD;
      sclerostin and DKK1 at baseline, 6 and 12 months, to understand the mechanisms for the effect&#xD;
      of Pradaxa on bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Study design and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, Phase IV age-matched cohort study in men and women who are being&#xD;
      started on long-term treatment with Pradaxa for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. This is a&#xD;
      proof of concept study evaluating the effect of Pradaxa, a direct thrombin inhibitor on bone&#xD;
      density and bone turnover markers in comparison to warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Subject Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be recruiting patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are&#xD;
      being prescribed Pradaxa by their cardiologists or primary care providers for long-term&#xD;
      anticoagulant treatment for participation in the study. The patients taking Pradaxa will be&#xD;
      the study group, and will be compared to an age-matched cohort of men and women with&#xD;
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are being started on long-term warfarin by their&#xD;
      cardiologists or primary care providers (control group). The investigators will be evaluating&#xD;
      20 men and 20 women in the Pradaxa cohort and another age-matched 20 men and 20 women in the&#xD;
      warfarin cohort (Pradaxa cohort: N = 40, 20 men, 20 women; Warfarin cohort: N = 40, 20 men,&#xD;
      20 women). The two groups will be determined based on treatment assigned to them by their&#xD;
      cardiologists or primary care providers. As age can influence the risk for osteoporosis, the&#xD;
      warfarin group will be age-matched to the Pradaxa group for optimal comparison. This will be&#xD;
      achieved by offering participation to patients taking warfarin who are similar in age to the&#xD;
      patients being recruited for the Pradaxa group. As women are more likely to develop&#xD;
      osteoporosis and the effects of Pradaxa may be gender-based as a result of differences in the&#xD;
      levels of sex hormones, the investigators are evaluating a cohort of men and women in this&#xD;
      pilot study for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to see an older cohort of subjects with atrial fibrillation, who are&#xD;
      also likely to have an increased risk of osteoporosis.&#xD;
