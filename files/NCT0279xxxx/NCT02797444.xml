    <textblock>
      Advance Care Planning (ACP) is a process of 'reflection and communication, in which a person&#xD;
      with decision-making capacity makes decisions regarding their future health and/or personal&#xD;
      care in the event that they become incapable of consenting to or refusing treatment' Most&#xD;
      Canadians have not planned for end-of-life Care and are at risk of aggressive medical care&#xD;
      that may not be compatible with their wishes. This study aims to systematically evaluate&#xD;
      local barriers to making personal choices with regards to life support interventions that can&#xD;
      be provided in the contemporary Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS: The overarching hypothesis is that the average layperson lacks sufficient&#xD;
      knowledge about the aggressive life support measures used routinely in contemporary Critical&#xD;
      Care to make informed decisions for themselves and their loved ones. Considering that most&#xD;
      Canadians have not even heard of the term Advance Care Planning, it is likely that there is a&#xD;
      gap in their knowledge and expectations of Critical Care. Such a gap can be bridged through&#xD;
      education - the only caveat being that the individual should be in full possession of their&#xD;
      faculties and can make informed decisions. This point is critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus this study uses a mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) research design to&#xD;
      address the following questions: 1) What is the state of knowledge about Critical Care&#xD;
      interventions among healthy elderly laypersons in London, Ontario? 2) What are the barriers&#xD;
      to formulating ACPs? 3) What opportunities exist for increasing ACP in the healthy elderly&#xD;
      population? The primary objective of this proposal is to assess public knowledge of Critical&#xD;
      Care interventions (and their outcomes) from the perspective of making Advance Care Plans.&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives are 1) To evaluate local barriers to Advance Care Planning 2) To&#xD;
      determine effective modes of education for Advance Care Planning that could be used for the&#xD;
      community and in our hospital setting.&#xD;

    <description>This is a qualitative study. The primary objective of this proposal is to assess public knowledge of Critical Care interventions (and their outcomes) from the perspective of making Advance Care Plans. Examples of such interventions include but are not limited to Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, dialysis and artificial feeding. Outcomes involve lay person knowledge, beliefs and perceptions of Critical care from the perspective of making Advance Care Plans.</description>
