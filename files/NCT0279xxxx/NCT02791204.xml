  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use SPECT/CT imaging to assess the effect of percutaneous revascularization&#xD;
      treatments in patients with Peripheral arterial disease and diabetes mellitus, in whom the&#xD;
      disease can progress more quickly than in patients without diabetes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a progressive atherosclerotic disease of the lower limbs&#xD;
      that affects 8 to 10 million Americans, and is more prevalent and progresses more quickly in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). There is a critical need for a standard non-invasive&#xD;
      approach to assess response to treatment by three-dimensional (3D) perfusion to vascular&#xD;
      territories of the feet in PAD patients. Assessing the response to treatment is particularly&#xD;
      important in DM patients, who suffer from poor distal runoff and often require more distal&#xD;
      revascularization to achieve limb salvage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical study, the investigators will evaluate lower extremity skeletal muscle&#xD;
      perfusion in the feet of healthy controls and PAD patients who are undergoing&#xD;
      revascularization using conventional sodium iodide SPECT/CT imaging, as well as dynamic&#xD;
      SPECT/CT imaging with a unique cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy control subjects (n=15) will be recruited from Yale University and the greater New&#xD;
      Haven area. In addition to healthy control subjects, 35 PAD patients with previously&#xD;
      diagnosed diabetes will be recruited from Vascular Surgery and Interventional Cardiology at&#xD;
      Yale-New Haven Hospital. Patients who are undergoing revascularization procedures will be&#xD;
      identified and asked to participate in the imaging study prior to their revascularization&#xD;
      procedure and will be imaged once again 1-3 days following revascularization, prior to&#xD;
      hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo resting perfusion imaging of the feet using two separate SPECT/CT&#xD;
      systems. They will be injected with a low dose radiotracer. In healthy control subjects,&#xD;
      arterial blood will be continuously sampled from the radial artery for calculation of a blood&#xD;
      input function and K1 values for foot angiosomes. Additionally, we will sample heated venous&#xD;
      &quot;arterialized&quot; blood from a hand vein retrograde to evaluate the potential for heated venous&#xD;
      blood in the calculation of a blood input function, thus eliminating the need for arterial&#xD;
      access in future PAD patient studies.&#xD;
