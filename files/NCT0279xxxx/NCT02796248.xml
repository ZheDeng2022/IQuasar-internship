    <textblock>
      Stigma related to chronic disease is rejection or judgement or exclusion by others that is&#xD;
      related to the chronic disease itself and is unwarranted. We are trying to figure out what&#xD;
      proportion of young people with type 1 diabetes experience stigma in Canada. By young people,&#xD;
      we mean teenagers and young adults; specifically, people who are between 14 and 25 years of&#xD;
      age. This is a challenging period in life when identities are developed and peer opinions are&#xD;
      felt to be particularly important. Experiencing stigma in this life period may be especially&#xD;
      hurtful and may have bad effects on taking care of type 1 diabetes. This may lead to&#xD;
      important medical problems like dangerously low or high blood sugar values. By understanding&#xD;
      how common stigma is, we can figure out the need for programs and strategies to deal with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask young people with type 1 diabetes to help us study this problem by completing an&#xD;
      online survey. We will 'advertise' our study through type 1 diabetes clinics, websites, and&#xD;
      social media. People who are eligible and interested will click on an internet link and be&#xD;
      directed to the survey. Staff at clinics in Montreal, Calgary, and Vancouver will also draw&#xD;
      their attention to the posters and/or provide small flyers with the internet link for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked about their general sense of well-being, their habits and&#xD;
      behaviours, and their blood sugar control, including frequency of both lows and highs. They&#xD;
      will also be asked if they are willing to mail in a small blood sample. If yes, they will&#xD;
      receive a kit with a small lancing device and instructions on how to clean their finger tip,&#xD;
      prick it, and express a few drops of blood into a small container. They will then mail this&#xD;
      back to us in a postage-paid envelope. We will use this to measure their hemoglobin A1c, an&#xD;
      overall measure of blood sugar control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use this information to (1) calculate the proportion of young people with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes who experience stigma; (2) figure out what factors and behaviours might predict or&#xD;
      signal the experience of stigma; (3) see if there is a link between stigma and A1c control&#xD;
      and/or frequent lows by report; (4) explore challenges and solutions voiced through the&#xD;
      open-ended questions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stigma in diabetes has been understudied. Some recent investigations have examined stigma in&#xD;
      adults with type 1 diabetes through in-depth interviews. Such qualitative evaluations provide&#xD;
      important insights into the roots and experiences of stigma, but cannot capture the&#xD;
      prevalence of the problem. This is a key gap that we will address through a national sample.&#xD;
      We will also assess the relationship of stigma to both glycemic control and patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes (PROs) such as mood, self-efficacy, and sense of well-being. PROs are increasingly&#xD;
      recognized as critical outcome measures. Finally, we will explore potential solutions with&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Selection of questions to capture stigma: As a starting point, we will consider the&#xD;
           questions included by Mulvaney and colleagues in their validated Barriers to diabetes&#xD;
           adherence in adolescents questionnaire. This 21-item tool includes 6 questions on stigma&#xD;
           and 4 other components (stress and burnout, time pressure and planning, social support,&#xD;
           parental autonomy support) and showed good overall internal consistency (Cronbach's&#xD;
           alpha 0.88). We will also consider additional questions proposed by our team, related to&#xD;
           lived experiences with type 1 diabetes and to managing young people with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
           (e.g., stigma within social media networks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Creation of on-line questionnaire Based on (1), we will create an online questionnaire&#xD;
           through FluidSurveys™ (www.fluidsurveys.com). Participants will be able to fill the&#xD;
           survey directly online or offline on tablets, laptops or cell phones. The survey&#xD;
           platform also allows participants to upload documents (pictures, videos, text). The&#xD;
           questionnaires will be available in both French and English and will include close-ended&#xD;
           and open-ended questions. Participants will be allowed to interrupt survey completion as&#xD;
           needed and continue at a later time, as convenient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition to stigma, we will query peer support, quality of life and well-being,&#xD;
           diabetes history and current treatment, and socio-demographic information.Overall&#xD;
           well-being will be assessed with the WHO-5 well being index, a validated 5-item&#xD;
           questionnaire. It is the most widely used questionnaires assessing subjective&#xD;
           psychological well-being and has been used in people with type 1 diabetes. Demographic&#xD;
           factors including age, sex, and ethnocultural background will be queried to ascertain if&#xD;
           the prevalence of diabetes-related stigma is more common in some demographic subgroups&#xD;
           (e.g., teens vs. young adults, females vs. males, ethnocultural groups). Similarly, we&#xD;
           will query sexual orientation/gender identification in order to ascertain, for example,&#xD;
           if being LGBT (i.e., Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender), or subgroups thereof, is&#xD;
           associated with higher prevalence of diabetes-related stigma. Owing to their potentially&#xD;
           sensitive nature, however, the questions on sexual orientation/gender orientation will&#xD;
           be explicitly optional&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following completion of close-ended questions, participants will respond to open-ended&#xD;
           questions that seek to capture experiences and perceptions of stigma as well ideas as to&#xD;
           how stigma may be effectively addressed. They will be permitted to upload explanatory&#xD;
           materials (e.g., videos, testimonials, pictures, drawings).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Following survey completion, participants will receive a kit for A1c testing&#xD;
           (DTILaboratories, Inc.) with a pre-paid envelope for mailing the sample back to&#xD;
           Montreal. The kit includes a sample vial that contains EDTA preservative, a vial holder,&#xD;
           a single use lancet, a capillary tube device to draw up a small amount of blood after&#xD;
           lancing, and a Ziploc bag. Participants will receive instructions to place the vial on&#xD;
           the vial holder, wash their hands, lance a finger tip (they are familiar with this, as&#xD;
           type 1 diabetes patients), draw up the blood with the capillary tube, and then release&#xD;
           the blood into the vial. The instructions include pictures. They will then place the&#xD;
           vial into the Ziploc bag, then into the prelabelled and postage paid box, and then mail&#xD;
           the package through a Canada Post mail box. The samples are stable for 2.5 months&#xD;
           without refrigeration. The AccuBase A1c Test Kit is a non-fasting, finger stick, whole&#xD;
           blood mail-in test requiring a very small blood volume (0.001ml). Samples are stable for&#xD;
           45 days un-refrigerated once collected. They are analysed using a two step process. The&#xD;
           screening step detects hemoglobin variants and/or disturbed erythrocyte kinetics by&#xD;
           ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The second step includes the&#xD;
           use of an interference-free procedure HPLC-boronate affinity, that provides a hemoglobin&#xD;
           A1c value free of possible interferences including chemically modified derivatives. It&#xD;
           is considered one of the most accurate and comprehensive A1c tests available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Adolescents and emerging adults with type 1 diabetes aged ≥ 14 and &lt; 25 years&#xD;
      will be recruited. The study will be publicized through Facebook©, Twitter© , and other forms&#xD;
      of social media as well as websites of organizations such as Canadian Diabetes Association,&#xD;
      Juvenil Diabetes Research Foundation, Diabète Québec and the Quebec Diabetic Children's&#xD;
      Foundation. These organizations may be asked to mail out flyers or send email messages&#xD;
      through any patient contacts. Specifically, the study will be publicized through posters at&#xD;
      diabetes clinics, Facebook© pages and websites of diabetes organizations and messages on&#xD;
      Twitter©. As in previous studies, we will include a description of the STIGMA study with a&#xD;
      link on the websites of diabetes organizations. We will also ask the organizations to contact&#xD;
      their members directly to inform them about the study, with a link embedded in the email&#xD;
      message.&#xD;
