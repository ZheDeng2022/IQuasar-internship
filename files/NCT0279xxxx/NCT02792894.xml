  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 6% of children in Pakistan suffer from a developmental disorder (intellectual disability&#xD;
      or Autistic spectrum disorder) and most receive no intervention.In an earlier proof of&#xD;
      concept study, the investigators integrated social, technological and business innovations to&#xD;
      develop and successfully pilot a sustainable service for such children in one rural&#xD;
      population of 30,000. Affected families were identified through a mobile phone-based&#xD;
      interactive voice response system, and organised into family networks. 'Champion' family&#xD;
      volunteers were trained in evidence-based interventions. A Tablet-based android application&#xD;
      was developed for training, monitoring and supervision of the champions, based on the World&#xD;
      Health Organization's guidelines. The champions delivered the intervention to other families&#xD;
      in the network. The project was sustainable and demonstrated significant improvements in the&#xD;
      lives of children and their families in the first 6 months of its operation. The&#xD;
      investigators are scaling-up this intervention to a population of 1 million. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the scaled-up&#xD;
      programme using cluster randomized control trial nested within the scale-up study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Developmental Disorders- Children Disability Assessment Schedule (DD-CDAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in DD-CDAS score at 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The DD-CDAS is a 36-item questionnaire measuring functioning and disability. The 36 items are rated on a five-point Likert scale (1=none to 5=extreme/cannot do). The items represent cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along with others, life activities, and participation in the society. The raw scores are sum across all the items of each domain and all 36 items for a tool. Domain and total raw scores are transformed into a range from 0 to 100. The tool has been validated for children with developmental disorders in Pakistan (DD-CDAS) by our group (Hamdani et al, 2020).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver-Child Interaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre treatment) and follow-up (6 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Fifteen minutes video will be recorded to capture caregiver-child interaction. Caregivers will be asked to try home routines involving the child (e.g. feeding the child, performing domestic chores) or play based routines (e.g. playing with toys or reading a book) with their child. Caregiver's facilitators and interrupters (including child's engagement and distress during social communication) and joint engagement will be rated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre treatment) and follow up (6 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Parent rated, 25 items scale. Items are distributed over 5 domains: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behavior. Each item is rated on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = not true, 1 = somewhat true, 2 = certainly true). Total difficulty score is calculated by adding all the domain scores except prosocial problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family Empowerment Scale (FES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre treatment) and follow up (6 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Parent rated, 34 items scale, consisting of 3 subscales: The family subscale (12 items) refers to the parents' management of everyday situations. The service system subscale (12 items) refers to parents' acting to obtain services to meet the child's needs. The community subscale (10 items) refers to parents' advocacy for improving services for children in general. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not true at all to 5 = very true). Scores are summed across all items for each subscale with higher scores indicating relatively more empowerment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inventory of Stigmatizing Experiences (Family version)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre treatment) and follow up (6 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Interview-based measure of the extent of stigma faced by family. Seven items, each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = never to 5 = always). The responses are recoded into a binary variable with 1 reflecting presence of stigma and 0 reflecting absence of stigma. Scores are summed across all items with a maximum score of 7, with lower scores indicating relatively less stigma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) family impact module</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre treatment) and follow up (6 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The 36-item PedsQLâ„¢ Family Impact Module Scales encompass 6 sub-scales measuring parent self-reported functioning: 1) Physical Functioning (6 items), 2) Emotional Functioning (5 items), 3) Social Functioning (4 items), 4) Cognitive Functioning (5 items), 5) Communication (3 items), 6) Worry (5 items), and 2 scales measuring parent-reported family functioning; 7) Daily Activities (3 items) and 8) Family Relationships (5 items). Items are rated on a 5 point Likert scale (0 never to 4 almost always). For ease of interpretability, items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better HRQOL (Health-Related Quality of Life).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Client Services Receipt Inventory (CSRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre treatment) and follow up (6 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Client Services Receipt Inventory has been adapted for use in children and families with developmental disorders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre treatment) and follow up (6 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical global impression (CGI) measures severity of challenges in social communication (rated from 1-7) (b) improvement in social communication at 6 months follow up (rated from 1-7). The CGI will be rated from the CCX videotapes by observers blinded to intervention allocation.</description>
