      Background. Statins are cholesterol lowering drugs that are prescribed to lower the risk of&#xD;
      cardio-vascular diseases. The use of statins has increased markedly and it is now one of the&#xD;
      most prescribed drugs in the world. More than 600,000 people in Denmark are taking statins on&#xD;
      a daily basis, approximately 40 % of these are taking the medication without having any other&#xD;
      risk factors for cardio-vascular diseases than elevated blood-cholesterol i.e. they are in&#xD;
      primary prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins are not without side effects and studies have shown that there is an elevated risk of&#xD;
      developing diabetes when taking statins. This has led to an increased debate about the use of&#xD;
      statins in primary prevention. Furthermore a large meta-analysis has shown that to prevent&#xD;
      one event of cardio-vascular disease, it is necessary to treat 200 people for 3-5 years.&#xD;
      These data suggest that more conservative use of statins to prevent CVD in otherwise healthy&#xD;
      individuals at low risk for future CVD may be warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other side effects of statins are muscle myalgia, muscle cramps and fatigue which potentially&#xD;
      can prevent a physically active lifestyle. The biomedical background of these side effects is&#xD;
      not fully elucidated but it has been shown that there is a link to decreasing levels of an&#xD;
      important enzyme, Q10, which plays a role in muscle energy metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching research question is: why does statin treatment cause muscle pain? Does&#xD;
      statin treatment impair (or even prohibit) physical exercise training? Furthermore the&#xD;
      following questions will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Does statin treatment cause:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Decreased muscle strength?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Skeletal muscle inflammation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Decreased mitochondrial respiratory function? B. Abnormal glucose homeostasis?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re question A &amp; B: If so, can physical training counteract this effect of statin treatment?&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypercholesterolemia and statin use in Denmark&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simvastatin is the most commonly prescribed statin, a class of drugs that inhibit&#xD;
      hydroxyl-methyl-glutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase, and thereby blocking biosynthesis of&#xD;
      cholesterol in the liver. Simvastatin is prescribed for individuals with elevated low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or total cholesterol, because these clinical parameters&#xD;
      are viewed as a risk factor for cardiovascular-disease (CVD), even in the absence of other&#xD;
      health problems or risk factors, such as previous myocardial infarction, diabetes or&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 40% of the prescriptions for statins are issued for primary prevention of&#xD;
      elevated cholesterol by general practitioners to patients without bodily symptoms or signs.&#xD;
      Only the &quot;cholesterol number&quot; makes the risk of heart attack and stroke visible. The lack of&#xD;
      symptoms is likely to be of importance for patients' adherence to treatment as is adverse&#xD;
      effects. A number of factors, such as information in mass media and changes in daily life,&#xD;
      may affect the decision to take the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment guidelines for hypercholesterolemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guidelines indicate preventive treatment with statins is appropriate in individuals with&#xD;
      &gt;10% predicted risk of a major vascular event within 5 years, while, some, but not all&#xD;
      opinion-leaders advocate a 5% threshold. Nevertheless, statin therapy failed to reduce&#xD;
      all-cause mortality in a meta-study of 65,229 patients without CVD, some of whom had&#xD;
      diabetes. Similarly, a Cochrane review analysis, which included some studies in which more&#xD;
      than 10% of the patients had history of CVD, showed only 0.5% reduction in all-cause&#xD;
      mortality, indicating that for every 200 patients taking statins daily for 5 years, 1 death&#xD;
      would be prevented. These data suggest that more conservative use of statins to prevent CVD&#xD;
      in otherwise healthy individuals at low risk for future CVD may be warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The downside:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhabdomyolysis (skeletal muscle cell death) is an infrequent but serious side-effect of&#xD;
      statin use, that can on rare occasion lead to acute renal failure and death (i.e., 1.5 deaths&#xD;
      per 106 prescriptions). Statin use is much more frequently associated with muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction, including myalgia (muscle pain), cramps, and weakness. The reported incidence of&#xD;
      myalgia varies from 1% (pharmaceutical company reports) to as high as 75% in statin-treated&#xD;
      athletes. Mild to severe myalgia is a strong disincentive to regular exercise, and because&#xD;
      regular exercise is one of the critical life-style approaches to preventing CVD and reducing&#xD;
      blood cholesterol, this is a significant down-side of statin use. Regular exercise is also&#xD;
      effective in preventing and treating obesity and type 2 diabetes, which themselves are risk&#xD;
      factors for CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism behind the myalgia is not known. However, the investigators behind this study&#xD;
      has recently demonstrated that muscle mitochondrial function is impaired with statin&#xD;
      treatment and the Q10 protein may play a key role in this. In addition, the statins also&#xD;
      negatively affect the glucose tolerance, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching research question is: why does statin treatment cause muscle pain? Does&#xD;
      statin treatment impair (or even prohibit) physical exercise training? Furthermore the&#xD;
      following questions will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Does statin treatment cause:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Decreased muscle strength?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Skeletal muscle inflammation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Decreased mitochondrial respiratory function? B. Abnormal glucose homeostasis?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re question A &amp; B: If so, can physical training counteract this effect of statin treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that fulfil defined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited from General&#xD;
      Practice clinics in Copenhagen and news paper advertisements. The vast majority of these&#xD;
      patients are being assessed on basis of the HeartScore risk estimation system that offers&#xD;
      direct estimation of the ten-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease in a format suited to&#xD;
      the constraints of clinical practice. A staggered recruitment will be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 men (age: 40-70 years; BMI: 25-35 kg/m2) before initiation of a statin treatment as&#xD;
      primary prevention are recruited. No other risk factors for CVD except elevated total&#xD;
      cholesterol (&gt;6 mmol/l) and/or elevated LDL cholesterol (&gt;3,5 mmol/l) and mild hypertension&#xD;
      (&lt;160/100 mm Hg) must be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be allocated (randomization by drawing a lot) to one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exercise training and Simvastatin 40 mg/day and Q10 placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exercise training and Simvastatin 40 mg/day and Q10 400 mg/day supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exercise training, Simvastatin placebo and Q10 placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention period is 8 weeks with a series of experimental days before and after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental days (identical before and after the interventions):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information day: health examination, ECG and Maximal oxygen uptake take (VO2 max).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 (overnight fasting, approximately 5 hours):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (body composition and body fat).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test + score questionnaire for muscle pain/discomfort (incl.&#xD;
           Visual Analog Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isokinetic strength and Rate of Force Development (PowerRig and KinCom dynamometer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeated VO2-max-test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 (overnight fasting approximately 7 hours):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle biopsy, vastus lateralis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 step Euglycemic, hyperinsulinaemic clamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training programme All training is supervised and takes place at the department. The training&#xD;
      is aerobic, bicycle ergometer training (45 min/session at 60-70% of VO2max) three times a&#xD;
      week for 8 weeks.&#xD;
