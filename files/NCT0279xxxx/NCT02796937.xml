    <textblock>
      This is a 2-year open-label, multicenter extension of the double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      GTi1201 study. The purpose of this study is to obtain an additional 2 years of safety data&#xD;
      for intravenously administered Alpha1-MP 60 mg/kg/week in subjects with alpha1-antitrypsin&#xD;
      deficiency (AATD).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a 2-year open-label extension of the double-blind, placebo-controlled GTi1201 study.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to obtain an additional 2 years of safety data for intravenously&#xD;
      administered Alpha-1 MP 60 mg/kg/week in subjects with AATD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a Screening Visit (the same visit as the End-of-Study Visit in the&#xD;
      GTi1201 study for subjects who complete the GTi1201 study or is the same visit as the Early&#xD;
      Discontinuation Visit for subjects meeting the early withdrawal criterion for forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] decline), a treatment period of 104 weeks (beginning&#xD;
      immediately after screening [on the same day as the Screening Visit] but no sooner than 1&#xD;
      week after the last infusion of investigational product in the GTi1201 study), and an&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects meeting the entrance criteria of the extension study will begin receiving weekly&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusions of Alpha-1 MP 60 mg/kg on the day of screening and will continue&#xD;
      to receive weekly infusions for a total of 104 infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include adverse events, concomitant medications, complete physical&#xD;
      examination (excluding breast and genitourinary examination), hematology, chemistry, urine&#xD;
      cotinine, and pregnancy test. Efficacy assessments will include whole lung computed&#xD;
      tomography density, quality-of-life assessment, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests. The occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary exacerbations, will&#xD;
      also be evaluated as a safety and as an efficacy measurement.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has current evidence of smoking, which includes electronic/vapor cigarettes, or has a&#xD;
