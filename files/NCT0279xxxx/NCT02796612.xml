      The project investigates prospectively whether anxiety in the context of breast biopsy can be&#xD;
      reduced by the planed intervention (take-home brochure and structured and standardized&#xD;
      information given by a psychologically trained physician who performs the biopsy).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fact having to have a breast biopsy taken due to suspected breast cancer is an&#xD;
      emotionally exceptional situation not only because of the threat to be diagnosed of cancer&#xD;
      but also because the breast is perceived as a symbol of womanhood, sexuality and motherhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time, however, is scarce in a busy outpatient setting. Nevertheless doctors and nurses at the&#xD;
      outpatient breast clinic University Hospital Basel are empathetic and try to address anxiety&#xD;
      and give emotional support before, during, and after a necessary breast biopsy. Study&#xD;
      findings, however suggest, that the level of anxiety, pain and discomfort associated with&#xD;
      breast biopsies is considerable, which might not be sufficiently controlled by empathy alone&#xD;
      but might be reduced by giving structured and standardized information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the planned intervention reduces the level of anxiety in&#xD;
      patients going for breast biopsy and thus is superior to the current standard of diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project focuses on improving the patients' knowledge about the procedure of breast biopsy&#xD;
      and on meeting their emotional needs to reduce anxiety related to the biopsy by giving&#xD;
      structured and standardized information. Additionally the project investigates whether&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with breast cancer have a higher level of anxiety than patients with&#xD;
      benign breast disease. Furthermore the study assesses how precisely the physicians, who&#xD;
      perform the biopsy, appraise the patients' perception of anxiety, pain and satisfaction&#xD;
      related to the breast biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that the intervention reduces the patients' anxiety&#xD;
      compared to the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of (1) handing out a take-home brochure to the patient as well as&#xD;
      (2) providing structured standardized information about the biopsy by the physician who&#xD;
      performs the biopsy and who underwent psychological training for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the intervention reduce anxiety during and after biopsy? Is there a correlation of the&#xD;
      level of anxiety and the histological diagnosis of breast cancer? Does the waiting time&#xD;
      between the procedure and the histological diagnosis have any influence on the level of&#xD;
      anxiety? How is the patient's perception of pain during and after the biopsy? Is there a&#xD;
      correlation between the patient's perception of pain and anxiety and the physicians'&#xD;
      impression of the patient's perception? Is the patient satisfied with the additional&#xD;
      take-home brochure and / or the structured and standardized information giving? This is a&#xD;
      prospective study to evaluate anxiety before and after the implementation of a structured&#xD;
      intervention to reduce anxiety related to breast biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible are women who speak and understand German and will need a skin biopsy, core biopsy&#xD;
      or a vacuum assisted biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women receiving a fine needle aspiration, examination of a pathologic nipple secretion, and&#xD;
      abscess evacuation will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who do not understand or do not speak the German language will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and relevant baseline variables will be summarized for both groups of patients.&#xD;
      Categorical data will be presented as frequencies and percentages. For continuous variables,&#xD;
      the lower and upper quartile as well as the median will be presented. Baseline&#xD;
      characteristics of the two groups will be compared using the proportion test for categorical&#xD;
      variables and the Welch two-sample t-test for continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety of patients will be measured at four points in time with State-Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory (STAI): before and after biopsy as well as before and after the communication of&#xD;
      the diagnosis. The difference in STAI score between patients receiving standard of care and&#xD;
      patients with intervention will be compared using Wilcoxon's rank sum test (Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      test) at a significance level of α = 0.05. The results of the questionnaires will be reported&#xD;
      as estimates together with the 95% confidence interval. Secondary objectives will be assessed&#xD;
      using non-parametric tests if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was estimated to be able to detect a significant difference in anxiety measured&#xD;
      by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score (Spielberger, Consulting Psychologists&#xD;
      Press (CPP) 1983) between the group receiving standard of care and the intervention group. In&#xD;
      a recent study, Flory et al. (Flory and Lang) reported a mean STAI score of 48 points for&#xD;
      breast biopsy patients which were used here to simulate data for the control group. By&#xD;
      assuming an effect size of 5 score points, a mean score of 43 points was used for the&#xD;
      patients with intervention. The scores of both groups were assumed to be normally distributed&#xD;
      with a standard deviation of 11.9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated with a semi-parametric resampling method. Each sample size ni, was&#xD;
      evaluated by simulating R=999 times ni individual patients from the above distributions. The&#xD;
      scores of the two groups were compared using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test at a significance&#xD;
      level of α = 0.05. Sample size was set to ensure at least a power, 1 - β, of 0.9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, totally 334 patients should be recruited to ensure 250 evaluable patients&#xD;
      considering a drop-out rate of 25 %.&#xD;
