  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Detecting exacerbations to prevent a severe and / or to early treat an exacerbation is&#xD;
      crucial in patients with COPD in order to prevent hospitalization. Patients with invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation outside the hospital have a high re-hospitalization rate which is&#xD;
      associated with severe economic burden since those patients need to be treated mainly on an&#xD;
      ICU or a respiratory ward being able to take care of invasive mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been shown that daily variations of parameters recorded by non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV) software are predictors of exacerbations in a cohort of COPD patients being&#xD;
      treated outside the hospital with NIV [1]. These parameters were respiratory rate and&#xD;
      percentage of respiratory cycles triggered by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to detect parameters recorded by the ventilator which are&#xD;
      able to predict exacerbation and / or hospitalization in patients with COPD under invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation outside the hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is increasing&#xD;
      due to a rise in the frequency of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as&#xD;
      demographical changes. As a result, there is a corresponding increase in the time required&#xD;
      for the complex process of weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV). Weaning from MV&#xD;
      contributes to up to 50% of the duration of respiratory support. Especially those patients&#xD;
      with prolonged weaning (≥3 spontaneous breathing trials over ≥7 days) refer to a very complex&#xD;
      patient group with either chronic co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      [COPD]) or extended treatment in the ICU as a result of acute conditions (e.g. septic or&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory failure) or other significant diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not all of these patients can be weaned from the ventilator. An increasing number of patients&#xD;
      are in need for invasive mechanical ventilation following unsuccessful weaning. They often&#xD;
      need special care regarding ventilatory support, management of tracheal secretion and&#xD;
      muscular re-conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients, especially those with COPD, are at high risk for further exacerbations and&#xD;
      have thus a high rate of re-hospitalization. An early detection of exacerbations to rapidly&#xD;
      implement therapeutic interventions is a major goal in the management of patients with severe&#xD;
      COPD but may need close contact to medical experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a physician-based structure for treating this specific patient group does not exist,&#xD;
      so that these patients often have hospital treatment. This might be preventable if clinical&#xD;
      determinants and ventilator parameters would be detected timely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home ventilators for invasive ventilation are provided with built-in software recording data&#xD;
      such as respiratory rate (RR), percentage of respiratory cycles triggered by the patient&#xD;
      (%Trigg), tidal volume and daily usage of the ventilator. A systematic assessment of&#xD;
      variations in specific ventilator-based parameters may help to predict the risk of&#xD;
      exacerbation in patients with COPD treated by home care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sum, the objective of this study is to assess whether day-to-day variation in these&#xD;
      ventilatory parameters recorded by the ventilators can predict an imminent exacerbation or&#xD;
      need for hospitalization in patients with COPD treated at home with invasive ventilation.&#xD;
      This is supposed to be of major importance, both for the progression of the disease and for&#xD;
      economic reasons regarding the health care system. The possibility of detecting exacerbations&#xD;
      due to ventilator analysis might be a further step towards telemonitoring of&#xD;
      ventilator-dependent patients&#xD;
