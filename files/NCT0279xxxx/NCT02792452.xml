      The management of symptomatic patients with moderate Aortic Stenosis (AS) remains challenging&#xD;
      and tests that would give more definitive answers are needed. The value of increase in Aortic&#xD;
      Valve mean Gradient (AVMG), lack of change in Aortic Valve area (AVA) and calculation of&#xD;
      valve compliance/resistance during stress echo (SE) in the symptomatic moderate AS population&#xD;
      prognostication has to the investigators knowledge not been examined before. Similarly the&#xD;
      additive value of myocardial blood flow reserve (MBFR), Computed Tomography (CT) calcium&#xD;
      score, speckle tracking echocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, and N-Terminal pro B- type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide B (NT-proBNP) in the prognostication of this population group especially&#xD;
      in combination with SE remains unclear.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of aortic valve stenosis (AS) has increased over the last few decades due to&#xD;
      improvement in life expectancy and a growing elderly population. A wealth of data is&#xD;
      available on patients with severe AS, whereas the risk stratification and management of&#xD;
      patients with symptomatic moderate AS remains contentious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress echocardiography (SE) is a recognised tool for the risk stratification of patients&#xD;
      with asymptomatic severe AS. Exercise is the preferred mode of stress in this group, as it&#xD;
      provides important prognostic information- such as presence of symptoms, overall exercise&#xD;
      capacity and precipitation of hypotension. Significant increase in mean gradient (MG) (MG&#xD;
      &gt;20mmHg) is an independent predictor of valve intervention or cardiovascular death, similar&#xD;
      to older age, diabetes and high resting gradient and this is recognised in international&#xD;
      guidelines as a parameter to risk stratify asymptomatic severe AS. The increase in MG in the&#xD;
      context of increasing transvalvular flow during exercise is usually accompanied by little or&#xD;
      no change in aortic valve area (AVA). Thus, mechanistically, the increase in MG is associated&#xD;
      with worse outcome because it reflects the intrinsic non-compliance of the aortic valve and&#xD;
      hence resistance. A compliant valve will open to accommodate the increased flow during&#xD;
      stress, whereas a fixed valve orifice will not, resulting in increased gradients. It is&#xD;
      therefore advised that these patients with asymptomatic severe AS and significant increase in&#xD;
      MG during exercise may be reasonably considered for aortic valve intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In moderate AS current guidelines recommend Aortic Valve replacement (AVR) only when other&#xD;
      cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting) is planned (class IIa). This is because&#xD;
      patients with moderate AS are a heterogeneous group with regard to the risk of adverse&#xD;
      events: some have indeed rapid progression to severe AS, and/or Left Ventricular (LV)&#xD;
      dysfunction and cardiovascular death, whereas others remain stable for many years. Overall&#xD;
      moderate AS carries a substantial risk of death or valve intervention, with the estimated&#xD;
      likelihood of event free survival at 4 years being 55-60%. Furthermore the presence of&#xD;
      symptoms increases the overall likelihood of risk in moderate AS, as there is a significant&#xD;
      difference in outcome between minimally symptomatic and symptomatic moderate AS. It maybe&#xD;
      hypothesised that patients with moderate AS and symptoms in the absence of myocardial&#xD;
      ischaemia due to flow-limiting coronary artery disease likely has the same valve hemodynamics&#xD;
      as one with severe AS, particularly decreased valve compliance/increased resistance. These&#xD;
      characteristics are likely to manifest during exercise when transvalvular flow is increased&#xD;
      resulting in significant increase in gradient with little change in AVA. Accordingly, resting&#xD;
      AVA and MG may not be the best parameters for determining suitability for valve intervention,&#xD;
      particularly as the overall mortality of symptomatic moderate aortic stenosis approaches that&#xD;
      of symptomatic severe AS. However, clear criteria that risk-stratify patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic moderate AS and guide timing for intervention do not currently exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly the role of SE could be expanded beyond assessment of risk in asymptomatic severe&#xD;
      AS to improve risk stratification in patients with symptomatic moderate AS. This is on the&#xD;
      assumption that moderate AS associated with symptoms of breathlessness, chest pain or syncope&#xD;
      is likely to have the same characteristics as severe AS. This means that during SE in&#xD;
      moderate symptomatic AS one would expect the AVA to remain unchanged, the valve resistance to&#xD;
      be elevated and the MG to increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore during SE apart from valve related indices that determine severity (AVA, MG),&#xD;
      myocardial blood flow reserve (MBFR) has been shown to correlate with severity of AS; reduced&#xD;
      MBFR is seen in severe AS whereas MBFR&lt;1.8 has an accuracy of 85% for distinguishing severe&#xD;
      from non-severe AS. It could therefore be that MBFR can also contribute in the risk&#xD;
      stratification of symptomatic moderate AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that several other tests could contribute to the risk stratification of&#xD;
      AS i.e. CT calcium score, speckle tracking echocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, and&#xD;
      N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Specifically it has been shown that&#xD;
      aortic valve calcium score correlates with AS severity and that there is moderate agreement&#xD;
      between AVA as defined by American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines and the degree of&#xD;
      AS determined from AV calcium score. Basal and global longitudinal strain (GLS) have been&#xD;
      found to be independently associated both with the severity of AS and the presence of&#xD;
      symptoms. Furthermore GLS can predict all-cause mortality in patients with AS and could&#xD;
      therefore improve the identification of the optimal timing for AV replacement. The severity&#xD;
      of AS in general has also been shown to correspond to an increase of carotid plaque and&#xD;
      intima media thickness (IMT). Finally NT-proBNP values correlate with the severity of AS and&#xD;
      in moderate AS, NT-proBNP can differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic status.&#xD;
