  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-oxygenation with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen has been evaluated in a limited number of&#xD;
      studies and seems to be better than traditional preoxygenation with a tight fitting mask.&#xD;
      Oxygenation with high-flow nasal cannula in apnea demonstrates that this could be done safely&#xD;
      for up to 25 mins with preserved saturation. Based on this, the investigators want to&#xD;
      evaluate whether this novel concept of preoxygenation can prolong the time to desaturation in&#xD;
      emergency anesthesia while securing a possibly difficult airway. This may reduce the number&#xD;
      of hypoxic events during intubation. This novel concept has already been tested in clinical&#xD;
      practice in certain cases but not during rapid sequence induction for acute surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Purpose The general purpose of this project is to compare a new preoxygenation&#xD;
      technique based on humidified oxygen in a high-flow nasal cannula with traditional&#xD;
      preoxygenation with a tight fitting mask during rapid sequence induction intubation with&#xD;
      focus on gas exchange.&#xD;

      Pre-oxygenation with high-flow nasal cannula with 100% oxygen has been evaluated in a limited&#xD;
      number of studies and seems to be equal or better than traditional preoxygenation with tight&#xD;
      fitting mask. Apneic oxygenation with high-flow nasal cannula in apnea demonstrates that this&#xD;
      could safely be don up to 25 minutes. Based on this, we can to evaluate whether this novel&#xD;
      concept of preoxygenation can prolong the time before desaturation in emergency anesthesia&#xD;
      and a difficult airway situation. This could ultimately reduce the number of damage to the&#xD;
      airway and hypoxic injuries. This novel concept is already tested in clinical practice in&#xD;
      certain cases and we strongly believe that a scientific evaluation of this approach is needed&#xD;
      before a broad implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will undergo regular pre-anesthetic evaluation and will be then be asked to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Oral and written information will be given. A consent form will be&#xD;
      signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to either traditional preoxygenation or preoxygenation with&#xD;
      high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival in the operating room standard patient monitoring will be applied (ECG, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure) and preparation for anesthesia induction will be done&#xD;
      with the patients placed with a slightly elevated head, approximately 25º. Peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2) will be noted when breathing room air. If an arterial line is planned this&#xD;
      will be put in place before pre-oxygenation and a blood sample will be drawn when breathing&#xD;
      room air Preoxygenation will hereafter take place either the traditional way or with a HFNC.&#xD;
      The traditional preoxygenation consists of breathing 100% oxygen via a tight-fitting&#xD;
      non-rebreathing facial mask with a fresh gas flow of ≥10 L/min of for ≥ 3 minutes. HFNC&#xD;
      pre-oxygenation consists of application of nasal cannulae (Optiflow TM, Fisher &amp; Paykel&#xD;
      Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand) in the nostrils and the patients will receive 40L/min of&#xD;
      heated and humidified 100% oxygen for ≥ 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of anesthesia with RSI the airways will be kept open by manual adjustment by&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist until intubation regardless of pre-oxygenation technique. During the&#xD;
      laryngoscopy and intubation 70L/min of humidified 100% oxygen will be administered&#xD;
      continuously by the nasal cannula left in place if HFNC oxygen is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endtidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) will be noted before the start of pre-oxygenation and on the&#xD;
      first breath after intubation. If an arterial line is in place blood gas samples will be&#xD;
      taken before the start of pre-oxygenation (breathing room air) and when the endotracheal tube&#xD;
      is in place.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  SpO2 breathing room air, at end of pre-oxygenation and one minute after intubation&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statistics This is a randomized controlled study evaluating a novel concept and comparing it&#xD;
      to a traditional technique. Continuous data will be presented as mean ± SD or 95% CI and&#xD;
      categorical data as median and range. We will analyze the data using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad) or&#xD;
      SPSS 24 (IBM). We do not know the primary outcome parameters (lowest saturation within 1 min&#xD;
      after intubation), but with an estimation based partly on a previous study (Wimasalena et al.&#xD;
      Ann Emerg Med 2015) we assume that the lowest saturation in the control group will be 93% and&#xD;
      95% in the treatment group with a SD of 3%. Using a type I error of 5% and type II error of&#xD;
      20% (power 80%) a sample size of 70 patients in each group was calculated. To allow for&#xD;
      missed data and drop-outs we plan to include 100+100 patients (total of 200 patients). After&#xD;
      inclusion of 80 patients an interim analysis will be performed for the primary outcome. A&#xD;
      non-paired t-test will be performed to analyse the primary outcome.&#xD;
