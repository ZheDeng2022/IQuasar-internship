    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of LuCaS Choices, a web-based decision&#xD;
      aid designed to facilitate informed decision making about participation in lung cancer&#xD;
      screening among individuals at high risk of lung cancer due to heavy cigarette smoking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will develop an innovative web-based decision aid (DA) to improve&#xD;
      decision making for lung cancer screening (LCS) among individuals at high risk for lung&#xD;
      cancer due to cigarette smoking. Recent National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) data&#xD;
      demonstrated a 20% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality for low dose computed&#xD;
      tomography screening as compared to chest X-ray among individuals at high lung cancer risk.&#xD;
      Given that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States with an&#xD;
      estimated 160,340 deaths predicted for 2012, the new data have reinvigorated interest in LCS.&#xD;
      However, LCS carries substantial risks including a high false positive rate, over-diagnosis,&#xD;
      adverse psychosocial consequences, and increased radiation exposure. Further, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether LCS would reduce lung cancer mortality among individuals who smoke but do not meet&#xD;
      NLST eligibility criteria. Therefore, there is currently no clear best choice for whether a&#xD;
      given individual should be screened or not. Decisions about participating in LCS should be&#xD;
      well informed and consistent with individual preferences. However, previous data indicate&#xD;
      that individuals who do undergo LCS rarely have a thorough understanding of the risks or&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this rapidly emerging public health challenge, this research has developed a&#xD;
      web-based decision aid (DA) to facilitate informed decision making regarding LCS in&#xD;
      individuals at high risk for lung cancer (i.e., cigarette smokers), and will assess&#xD;
      feasibility of DA administration and proposed methods for conducting a future randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial (RCT) of DA effectiveness. The content of the DA will be based on the&#xD;
      investigators previous studies exploring LCS decision making and other recent research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of the currently proposed research are to conduct a feasibility trial of the&#xD;
      DA among individuals at high risk of lung cancer due to heavy cigarette smoking.&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit participants to assess feasibility of: 1) delivering the DA&#xD;
      intervention in a community setting, and 2) conducting research procedures and assessment&#xD;
      tools as planned for a future RCT.&#xD;
