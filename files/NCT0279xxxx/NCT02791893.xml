  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers propose studying Gulf veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI), characterized by&#xD;
      a problem with widespread pain. Besides their pain, the researchers will also assess the&#xD;
      effect of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in alleviating migraine headache, another complaint&#xD;
      of Gulf veterans, which is common in the presence of widespread pain. Importantly, the&#xD;
      researchers are partnering with a company that has made a hand-held device that allows for&#xD;
      stimulation of the vagus nerve without the need for surgery; it works by the patient putting&#xD;
      it on the skin overlying the vagus nerve in their neck and then turning it on for 120 second&#xD;
      periods three times a day. The device is programmed to deliver only 6 bouts of stimulation&#xD;
      per day - one to each side of the neck three times a day; it is then inactive until the next&#xD;
      day. The fact that this device can be used without surgery and is non-invasive makes it&#xD;
      extremely practical for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting pre-treatment measurement of pain severity and headache severity, veterans&#xD;
      will receive either the actual active VNS device or an inactive device, which does not&#xD;
      stimulate the nerve. Veterans will use their device for ten weeks - providing similar&#xD;
      information periodically over this period by responding to questions about the severity of&#xD;
      their pain and headaches, They will then return to the Center for the final phase of the&#xD;
      study where all veterans will receive active devices. Ten weeks later, they will return to&#xD;
      the Center to provide information to allow the investigators to gain further knowledge as to&#xD;
      the effectiveness of actual VNS in relieving pain - both throughout the body and in the head.&#xD;

    <time_frame>10 and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to indicate the number of days in the last 3 months during which they experienced a headache. If a headache lasted more than 1 day, they are instructed to count each day. Scores are expected between 0-90 with higher numbers corresponding to a greater number of headache days.</description>

          <title>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to Assess Change of Widespread Pain</title>
          <description>Patients used the Pain Visual Analog Scale (0-10; 0=No pain, 10=Worst pain possible) to rate their average level of pain over the last 24 hours. The median value for each individual's ratings over 5 consecutive days immediately prior to the end of the intervention period was recorded and then the average was calculated for each group.</description>
          <population>The 10-week measure includes only those individuals who completed the blinded phase of the study. The 20-week measure includes only those individuals who completed the open label phase of the study.</population>

      <time_frame>Patients were asked to provide reports on adverse events after the first week of the blinded phase (Week 1), at the end of the blinded phase (Week 11), and in the final week of the open label phase (Week 20). Adverse event monitoring for the sample took place over the course of 3 years (March, 2017 - March 2020).</time_frame>
      <desc>Adverse events were logged by description, date of occurrence, severity, and whether or not they were serious. Subjects were counted as having experienced a specific adverse event if they reported it at any of the three time points.</desc>
