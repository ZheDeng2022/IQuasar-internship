      Use of the software could allow learning of reading code in subjects with ASD through the&#xD;
      design of serious games for educational and therapeutic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This SEMATIC software could improve communication and could be integrated into medical&#xD;
      management (speech therapy and neuropsychological).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit of an action research will enable training professionals to autism, cognitive&#xD;
      characteristics of autism and the use of IT support for this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SEMATIC is an innovative collaborative project which aims to develop an edutainment software&#xD;
      for learning words and phrases from logic games. This software is designed for children with&#xD;
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who do not have the normal prerequisites for learning to read&#xD;
      (that is to say: the understanding of words, verbal expression and phonological awareness).&#xD;
      In addition, this project is based on hyper competence in the visual field of children with&#xD;
      ASD by providing a playful computer support and access to specific visual interests of these&#xD;
      children. IT support is a useful tool because it is stable and predictable for focusing the&#xD;
      child's attention with ASD. To date, none of learning reading software does exist for&#xD;
      children with ASD. This project is based on innovative theoretical and methodological&#xD;
      assumptions. These assumptions are derived directly from observation, clinical knowledge of&#xD;
      the autistic disorder, testimonies of families and individuals with Asperger Syndrome or&#xD;
      Autism High Level and the contributions of the scientific literature in the field of autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This software was designed to improve the secondary verbal children with ASD as well as&#xD;
      medical care (speech therapist and neuropsychological). The SEMATIC software could be&#xD;
      integrated into traditional care for children with ASD. This project is part of an approach&#xD;
      of 'action research'. Indeed, this research aims to boost health care teams by training&#xD;
      cognitive characteristics of children with ASD and the use of computer support (SEMATIC).&#xD;
      Fifteen children with ASD will be recruited in various institutions in the PACA region&#xD;
      (departments 06 and 83) to participate in this study. All participants will use the software&#xD;
      in the institution where they are usually supported but also at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the interest of SEMATIC project is to develop learning words and phrases on computer&#xD;
      using logic games to go towards learning the reading code for children with ASD do not have&#xD;
      the usual prerequisites. This is a pilot study. There is currently no equivalent method for&#xD;
      measuring these changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of learning will be carried out at different times of the protocol. Tests&#xD;
      created specifically for the needs of the study will be used. Some tests commonly used in&#xD;
      speech therapy and neuropsychological assessments (Standard tools validated on the&#xD;
      recommendation of the HAS, 2005) will also be used to include topics and define the&#xD;
      characteristics of the population of this study.&#xD;
