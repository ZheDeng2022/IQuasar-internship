      Trial Design - Objectives and Purpose The aim of this study is to perform a proof of concept&#xD;
      for the successful retention and outcome measures of zirconia RBBs for the replacement of&#xD;
      missing canine or posterior teeth (6-8mm span) and that they will exhibit similar survival&#xD;
      rates (95%) as metal ceramic RBBs over 3 years and short term (Botelho 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of monolithic extra-coronal zirconia RBBs in the posterior region does not appear to&#xD;
      have been reported in the literature (A search pf Pub Med and Google Scholar has not shown&#xD;
      any similar studies that have been published - pubmed.gov; Keywords: &quot;zirconia&quot;, &quot;resin&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;clinical&quot; assessed on 17/10/2015 AND google scholar; Keywords: &quot;zirconia&quot;, &quot;resin bonded&#xD;
      fixed partial denture&quot;, &quot;resin bonded fixed dental prosthesis&quot;, &quot;Maryland&quot;, &quot;resin bonded&#xD;
      bridge&quot; &quot;posterior&quot;, &quot;clinical&quot;) In addition, currently there appear to be no clinical trials&#xD;
      planned or finished in this area (clinicaltrial.gov; Keywords: &quot;zirconia&quot;, &quot;resin&quot; assessed&#xD;
      on 17/10/2015) using zirconia RBBs in the posterior region. This reveals that there is a gap&#xD;
      in the literature on the use of zirconia for replacing posterior teeth with such prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures would be: success ie. prosthesis retention ie. does not fall out&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures would be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complications of the prosthesis such as tipping, drifting or fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient centered outcomes (satisfaction and oral health related quality of life) on the&#xD;
           RBBs The hypothesis is that 2-unit cantilevered zirconia RBBs will be as successful as&#xD;
           current data on 2-unit cantilevered metal-ceramic RBBs from this centre and that there&#xD;
           will be no difference in the patient centered outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary review appointments will be at 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. However, longer term&#xD;
      follow up will be performed and this centre has experience of such long term studies (9.5&#xD;
      years - Botelho 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing to metal-ceramic RBBs will NOT be performed as&#xD;
      the 5-year success rate of both metal-ceramic (Botelho 2006) and anterior zirconia (Sasse&#xD;
      2014) prosthesis were higher than 95% and this small differences would mean an unattainable&#xD;
      large sample size in an equivalence test (Burns 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and implications Zirconia has significant strength and greater stiffness than&#xD;
      base metal alloys and displays clinical outcomes comparable to metal-ceramic conventional&#xD;
      crowns and bridges (Heintze 2010, Sailer 2007). Well polished zirconia has been observed to&#xD;
      have lower wear rates than porcelain (Stober 2014) Zirconia RBBs for posterior tooth&#xD;
      replacement will offer an esthetic and biocompatible treatment option to patients over the&#xD;
      traditional ceramic-metal RBBs. It is anticipated that patient demand for this would be high&#xD;
      as these prostheses should be as successful (retentive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results would re-write established dental prosthodontics textbooks and this would be&#xD;
      the first centre to report on the routine use of a 2-unit extracoronal all-zirconia RBB for&#xD;
      the replacement of missing posterior teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan and methodology The sample pool would be obtained from patients presenting at&#xD;
      the Prince Philip Dental Hospital, University of Hong Kong and who request and need&#xD;
      replacement of one or more missing teeth.. They will be clinically assessed for eligibility&#xD;
      and invited to participate with written consent in the study. After treatment they will be&#xD;
      reviewed up to a 3rd year endpoint of the study. Further review beyond this will be&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;
