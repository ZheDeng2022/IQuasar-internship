      The International study on NoSocomial Pneumonia in Intensive CaRE (PneumoINSPIRE) is a&#xD;
      prospective, international, multicentre, observational, cohort study. The study aims to&#xD;
      provide up-to-date and generalisable information on current worldwide epidemiology and&#xD;
      clinical practice associated with diagnosis and management of nosocomial pneumonia in&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PneumoINSPIRE study is endorsed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Specifically, the study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the global epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in ICU patients, analysing&#xD;
           responsible pathogens and resistance pattern by type of pneumonia and geographical&#xD;
           region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe on a global scale current clinical practice regarding diagnosis and determine&#xD;
           the degree of concordance between the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in routine&#xD;
           clinical practice and the official definitions including: a) ATS/IDSA 2005 guidelines;&#xD;
           b) CDC/NHSN Surveillance Definitions (version January 2015, modified April 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify on a global scale variable treatment decisions with emphasis on therapeutic&#xD;
           schemas, appropriateness, de-escalation decisions and their relation to outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate nosocomial pneumonia in specific subgroups of critically ill patients (such as,&#xD;
           chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], the elderly, postoperative, trauma&#xD;
           patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the differences between nosocomial pneumonia in non-intubated ICU patients and&#xD;
           VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the characteristics and outcomes between patients with nosocomial pneumonia in&#xD;
           ward patients later transferred to the ICU and non-intubated ICU patients with&#xD;
           nosocomial pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This international study will explore clinical details for nosocomial pneumonia in the ICU&#xD;
      setting: practice variations among countries and continents, diagnostic and treatment&#xD;
      modalities, implicated pathogens and their resistance patterns, resolution patterns and risk&#xD;
      factors for unfavourable outcomes. In view of these, this global multicentre study shall&#xD;
      provide useful information for the elaboration of future recommendations on diagnostic and&#xD;
      treatment approaches for nosocomial pneumonia in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU patients with a diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission to the ICU with diagnosis of HAP that developed in the ward in non-intubated&#xD;
           patients (Ward HAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first episode of ICU-acquired pneumonia that developed in non-intubated patients&#xD;
           (ICU-HAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first episode of ICU-acquired pneumonia that developed in patients receiving&#xD;
           invasive ventilation(i.e. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &lt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with nosocomial pneumonia receiving palliative treatment at the time of&#xD;
           assessment for eligibility (i.e. the time of clinical diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous inclusion in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 150 ICUs from 25 or more countries worldwide that will agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 10 consecutive ICU patients with nosocomial pneumonia as described above will be&#xD;
      recruited per site. A sample size of at least 1000 ICU patients with nosocomial pneumonia is&#xD;
      anticipated to comprise the dataset. This sample size has been chosen to provide&#xD;
      generalisable data for each geographic region and to satisfy power considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analytic, techniques and parametric and non-parametric tests will be used to&#xD;
      explore diagnostic, microbiological or subgroup differences as well as clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      nosocomial pneumonia. Cox regression will be used to predict dichotomous outcomes of&#xD;
      interest, including mortality and pneumonia resolution. Independent predictors and associated&#xD;
      hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be reported. A two-sided p-value less than&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Start and End Date:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first site is anticipated to commence recruitment in March 2016 with staggered site&#xD;
      recruitment; however, sites are anticipated to start recruitment during the first half of&#xD;
      2016; each site will commence recruitment as soon as relevant Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      approvals have been obtained. Recruitment will continue until the minimum target of 10&#xD;
      patients has been reached. Sites will have the opportunity for further recruitment while the&#xD;
      study is active. Completion of recruitment is anticipated to occur by end December 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of Findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary data will be presented in a timely manner at national and international conferences&#xD;
      and in peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;
