  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the UK and currently costs the&#xD;
      country £7bn per year. There is an overwhelming need to accurately and rapidly triage&#xD;
      patients to allow best use of finite NHS specialist resources for the treatment of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple blood test of substances (the purines) that result from cellular metabolism and are&#xD;
      produced in excess when brain cells are starved of oxygen and glucose (as occurs during a&#xD;
      stroke) is proposed. The sensors designed by the investigators are used to measure blood&#xD;
      purines during a procedure in which blood flow to the brain is reduced to allow surgical&#xD;
      interventions on the major arteries that supply the brain. Previous studies by the&#xD;
      investigators have shown that as soon as blood flow to the brain is reduced, purines are&#xD;
      produced within minutes and are detectable in systemic arterial blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project will now compare the levels of purines in the blood of stroke patients&#xD;
      and controls. The purines will be measured on admission to hospital and 24 hours later. The&#xD;
      occurrence and magnitude of a stroke will be determined by an MRI scan given between 24 and&#xD;
      72hrs after admission. This study will establish whether purines are elevated in the blood of&#xD;
      stroke patients on admission to hospital compared to healthy controls, and whether this&#xD;
      correlates with the size of the stroke and damage to the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients will be prospectively recruited to the trial on admission to A&amp;E. The patient&#xD;
      will undergo normal clinical assessment and treatment for stroke. As soon after admission as&#xD;
      possible, a finger-prick blood sample will be taken from the patient and the SMARTChip device&#xD;
      will be used to measure the levels of purines in the sample. A medical history of factors&#xD;
      relevant to the purine test will also be established. This will include factors such as any&#xD;
      medications that might alter purine levels, a prior history of strokes, diabetes, a history&#xD;
      (individual or family) of gout, and when they last had food. The patient will also be given a&#xD;
      CT head scan as part of their normal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sub-set of patients repeated blood samples (once per hour for 6 hours) will be taken to&#xD;
      gain information on how purine levels may change in blood following a stroke. In all&#xD;
      patients, the blood purines will be re-tested at 24h (±3h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be offered the option of an MRI brain scan at 24-72h post-admission and&#xD;
      recruitment will continue until 100 patients with MRI measurements have been enrolled. The&#xD;
      flexibility in the timing of the scan is to allow scheduling of the scan to fit in with other&#xD;
      demands on the MRI. The purpose of the scan is to identify the nature of the cerebrovascular&#xD;
      event and quantify any infarction or area of brain bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control participants will give blood on 2 occasions 24h apart for a purine test. The purpose&#xD;
      of this control is two-fold: 1) to establish the variability of blood purines in healthy&#xD;
      controls and 2) to test whether stroke patients have elevated blood purine levels compared to&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteer feeding controls will give a baseline blood sample, eat a simple purine&#xD;
      rich meal (a meat sandwich) and then give 4 more blood samples at 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes&#xD;
      following the meal. The purpose of this control is to test whether ingestion of a recent meal&#xD;
      might alter baseline blood purine measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study patients recruited at University Hospitals North Midlands NHS Trust will also be&#xD;
      given the option of participating in the Spasticity and Pharmacokinetic sub-studies.&#xD;
      Participants taking part in the Spasticity sub-study will provide an additional blood sample&#xD;
      to measure biomarkers and will undergo a spasticity assessment at admission, 24h, 72h, 7d and&#xD;
      one or two clinic visits between 30-90d post-admission. Participants taking part in the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic sub-group will provide an additional blood sample for measurement of&#xD;
      glutamate and other biomarkers at admission, 24h, 72h, 7d and 30-90d post-admission.&#xD;
