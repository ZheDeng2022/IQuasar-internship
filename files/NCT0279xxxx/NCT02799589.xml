  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to show the efficacy of remifentanil-dexmedetomidine infusions in&#xD;
      combination with a caudal block for patients ages 1 year to 3 years old receiving elective&#xD;
      surgery to investigate alternatives to the currently used volatile anesthetics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In light of the concern for potential anesthetic neurotoxicity in infants and toddlers, it is&#xD;
      prudent to start investigating alternative methods to decrease the amount of volatile&#xD;
      anesthetic being utilized in this patient population. The US Food and Drug Administration has&#xD;
      been asked to evaluate the data showing the neurotoxic effects of multiple anesthetic agents&#xD;
      in animal models and humans. These studies have shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)&#xD;
      receptor blockers such as ketamine,and gamma-Aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA) modulators&#xD;
      like benzodiazepines, nitrous, propofol, barbiturates and isoflurane have been shown to cause&#xD;
      brain cell apoptosis in animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia provides both intraoperative and postoperative analgesia may play a major&#xD;
      role in effectively reducing the amount of general anesthetic used. Caudal anesthesia has&#xD;
      been proven be both safe, effective and is applied widely in the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha2-adrenergic agonist that acts in the brainstem by&#xD;
      inhibiting norepinephrine release. Dexmedetomidine is commonly used off-label, including use&#xD;
      for duration greater than 24 hours and any use in pediatrics. Dexmedetomidine has relatively&#xD;
      few adverse events when compared to other sedative agents, with hypotension and bradycardia&#xD;
      being most common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanil has a rapid onset, rapid offset, small volume of distribution, rapid clearance,&#xD;
      and a short elimination half-life, It may be a useful anesthetic for pediatric outpatient&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the current standard of care involves a volatile general anesthetic with a caudal&#xD;
      block, anesthesiologists have alternative methods that can be utilized to allow an elective&#xD;
      surgery to be performed. In summary, this study intends to show the efficacy and safety of a&#xD;
      remifentanil-dexmedetomidine infusion and caudal block for patients ages 1 year-3 years old&#xD;
      receiving elective circumcision, hydrocele repair, orchidopexy, mild hypospadias or inguinal&#xD;
      hernia repair. This alternative anesthetic is already being studied in children under 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
