      This study will evaluate the efficiency of dietary intervention on intradialytic weight gain.&#xD;
      Uniric hemodialysis patients without serious dietary complications, who accumulate above 2.5&#xD;
      kg (or above 4%) of their dry weight, will undergo a series of dietary consultations for&#xD;
      sodium restriction. One month after the intervention, their intradialytic weight accumulation&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;

      Inter Dialytic Weight Gain (IDWG) ascribed to fluid retention is one of the major clinical&#xD;
      problem that patients in hemodialysis need to cope with between 2 subsequent hemodialysis&#xD;
      especially in patients with no residual renal function. Fluid retention is associated with&#xD;
      morbid conditions such as lower-extremity edema, ascites, pulmonary vascular congestion or&#xD;
      edema, hypertension, and worsening heart failure. Gain weight above 2 kg between 2 subsequent&#xD;
      hemodialysis found to be in higher risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death&#xD;
      .Lowering daily sodium intake found to mitigate fluid retention ,however there are only a few&#xD;
      researches that check it. 2IDWG also associated with poorer quality of life. Dietary sodium&#xD;
      restriction recommendation since the beginning of hemodialysis are based on association of&#xD;
      this restriction with balance of hypertension and fluid retention. Sodium intake recommended&#xD;
      for patients in hemodialysis is limited to 2 grams a day. Nevertheless, there are only a few&#xD;
      studies that examine the efficiency of this restriction because of the complexity of&#xD;
      measurement of sodium intake. One recently published study which used a 24-h recall to&#xD;
      measure sodium intake, found a direct correlation between IDGW and mortality form any reason.&#xD;
      In spite of this complexity, IDWG has been found to be in a direct relation with patients'&#xD;
      nutrition status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of sodium-related issues is malnutrition. Malnutrition in dialysis is a risk factor for&#xD;
      patients' morbidity and mortality. Higher sodium intake is associated with higher calorie and&#xD;
      protein intake, while adherence to restriction of sodium intake is poor in hemodialysis. This&#xD;
      is a reason for high importance to study effects of sodium restriction in people with more&#xD;
      than 2.5 kg (or 4% of dry body weight) IDWG while following up their nutritional status&#xD;
