      STUDY 1: INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to&#xD;
      help people stop smoking by using very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes. This&#xD;
      developmental pilot study (n=20) will determine the feasibility of the treatment approach and&#xD;
      methodology using a targeted intervention, and lead to refinements for a subsequent&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY 2: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL The purpose of this study is to see if a targeted&#xD;
      intervention will help people to stop or reduce smoking better than a standard intervention&#xD;
      using very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes, and to determine the optimal nicotine&#xD;
      tapering schedule (gradual vs. immediate) during a 5-week pre-quit period. About 208&#xD;
      participants will take part in this phase of the study at Moffitt Cancer Center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current project will (1) develop a theory-based, user-friendly, and efficient set of&#xD;
      targeted cessation materials to facilitate extinction during pre-quit VLNC smoking, (2)&#xD;
      establish the feasibility of recruitment and measurement strategies to be used in the RCT,&#xD;
      (3) determine whether immediate vs. gradual pre-quit nicotine tapering in combination with&#xD;
      the targeted behavioral intervention has beneficial effects (on cessation-related and&#xD;
      intermediate outcomes) for eventual comparison with validated cessation methods (e.g., NRT),&#xD;
      and (4) examine several potential moderators and mediators of treatment efficacy.&#xD;
