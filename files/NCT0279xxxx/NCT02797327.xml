      The primary goal of the study is to identify biomarkers from the molecular signature&#xD;
      predictive of pre-term birth. This will be achieved through high frequency sampling and&#xD;
      profiling throughout pregnancy.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Preterm birth occurs before 37 weeks and is a major cause of neonatal mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity, and affecting 8% of newborns on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Identifying&#xD;
      biochemical markers that are associated with preterm birth can guide in designing the most&#xD;
      effective targeted intervention strategies for women at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to identify biomarkers signatures predictive of preterm birth the investigators will&#xD;
      employ high throughput profiling technologies (aka &quot;a systems approach&quot;) that maximize the&#xD;
      amount of information that can be obtained and knowledge generated from each participant&#xD;
      sample. Preliminary data will also be obtained for infectious complications in order to&#xD;
      assess potential for a systems approach such approach in detecting infectious events before&#xD;
      onset of clinical symptoms or in absence of clinical symptoms. The rationale behind such&#xD;
      approach and its importance for establishing personalized medicine approaches was detailed in&#xD;
      a recent opinion article published by Dr Chaussabel et al (2015) A vision and a prescription&#xD;
      for big data-enabled medicine. Nat Immunol 16: 435-439. In addition parallel studies will be&#xD;
      carried out in other countries such as Qatar and the US in order to assess environmental&#xD;
      influences on blood and transcriptome signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN This is a prospective pregnancy cohort from the first trimester until&#xD;
      post-partum. The investigators are unable to predict which women will have preterm birth or&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION 400 Pregnant women with confirmed viable pregnancy of more than 8+0 weeks&#xD;
      and less than 14 weeks of pregnancy, who are healthy, intend to deliver at SMRU and can&#xD;
      attend for two weekly ANC visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD AND TECHNIQUE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant women attending SMRU ANC clinics will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study samples will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A small blood volume (100 micro litres) will be collected by finger prick sampling&#xD;
                via a capillary straw. The sample will be transferred into a microtube containing&#xD;
                an RNA stabilizing solution and stored at -80°C. This will be repeated every two&#xD;
                weeks, delivery and post-partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. A stool sample will be collected and stored at -80°C. This will be collected each&#xD;
                trimester, delivery and post-partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. A vaginal swab will be collected from the posterior fornix under direct&#xD;
                visualization by the midwife; and stored at -80°C. This will be collected each&#xD;
                trimester, delivery and post-partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-partum visits, will be at 4-6 weeks and at 3months. The investigators estimate 15-18&#xD;
      blood samples, and 6 stool and vaginal swabs will be collected per women if they attend as&#xD;
      expected. Fetal growth will be measured by 5-6 weekly ultrasound scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample set will be repeated if the woman has fever during pregnancy or post-partum&#xD;
      (estimated at 5% of the women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL VALUE Identifying biochemical markers that are associated with preterm can guide in&#xD;
      designing the most effective targeted intervention strategies aimed at women at risk for&#xD;
      preterm birth.&#xD;
