  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 35 adult patients with metastatic melanoma will be enrolled in this study with a target&#xD;
      enrollment of 30 evaluable subjects who complete the baseline and an approximately 3 week FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT scans, they may also complete an FDG PET/CT after 10 weeks of pembrolizumab therapy.&#xD;
      Subjects may also be a part of the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program and then will be&#xD;
      asked to have one additional tumor biopsy and one additional blood draw for the purposes of&#xD;
      this imaging study. Subjects who are eligible for this imaging protocol will undergo a&#xD;
      baseline FDG PET/CT scan as part of their clinical restaging prior to starting new therapy. A&#xD;
      research FDG PET/CT will take place approximately 3 weeks post-therapy and a 3rd FDG PET/CT&#xD;
      scan will be done at more than 10 weeks after starting pembrolizumab, this scan may be done&#xD;
      as a clinical scan for evaluation of response or restaging after therapy, however, if it is&#xD;
      not ordered as a clinical scan it will be done as a research scan. Changes in FDG uptake will&#xD;
      be correlated with blood and tissue results from the patient's medical records and from the&#xD;
      data collected as part of the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program and with long term&#xD;
      outcomes including progression free and overall survival.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide&#xD;
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior&#xD;
             to study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be â‰¥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have biopsy proven or clinically documented advanced stage metastatic&#xD;
             melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have measurable disease (per RECIST 1.1) that is seen on CT, MRI, or&#xD;
             FDG PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be recommended to start pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding at the time of screening will not be&#xD;
             eligible for this study. Female participants of child-bearing potential will have a&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test at the time of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is not able to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             or treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent&#xD;
             as assessed by medical record review and/or self-reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies)&#xD;
             as determined by medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV&#xD;
             RNA [qualitative] is detected) as determined by medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Subjects with previously treated brain metastases will be eligible to participate&#xD;
        provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four&#xD;
        weeks prior to receiving pembrolizumab and any neurologic symptoms have returned to&#xD;
        baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
        steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.&#xD;
