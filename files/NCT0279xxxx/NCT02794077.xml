  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no standard third-line systemic treatment for inoperable locoregionally advanced&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We investigated the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of metronomic oral cyclophosphamide as third-line treatment or beyond.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NPC is endemic in Southern China including Hong Kong. Despite aggressive definitive&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy for locoregionally advanced disease, still about 30% develop relapse&#xD;
      locoregionally or distally. Salvage or second-course radical radiotherapy with or without&#xD;
      chemotherapy may achieve durable disease control for locoregionally advanced recurrent&#xD;
      disease. However for those who had received 2 courses of radical radiotherapy or those with&#xD;
      distant metastases, systemic chemotherapy would be the only drug of choice. Platinum-based&#xD;
      doublet chemotherapy including cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, gemcitabine or&#xD;
      taxane is considered the standard first-line treatment. For second-line treatment, whether&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy was given previously is a consideration. Re-challenge with&#xD;
      cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil can be considered in patients who enjoyed a good initial&#xD;
      response to the same regimen with an intervening disease-free period of more than 1&#xD;
      year.However so far there has been no recognized standard third-line systemic treatment.&#xD;
      Metronomic oral chemotherapy may provide an ideal choice patients treated in this setting by&#xD;
      shifting the targets from tumor cells to tumor vasculature so as to reduce the chance of drug&#xD;
      resistance as well as offering a relatively low toxicity profile to them who have been&#xD;
      significantly jeopardized by the long-term complications brought prior courses of radiation&#xD;
      therapy, surgery and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the above, we investigated metronomic open-label oral cyclophosphamide as&#xD;
      third-line treatment or beyond in patients with inoperable locoregionally advanced recurrent&#xD;
      or metastatic NPC who had failed at least 2 lines of prior systemic chemotherapy.&#xD;
