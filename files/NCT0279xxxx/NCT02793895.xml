  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the SEARCH-AF trial is to evaluate a novel diagnostic tool for detecting&#xD;
      post-operative atrial fibrillation or flutter (POAF/AFL) in cardiac surgical subjects during&#xD;
      the early, sub-acute post-operative period. The population includes cardiac surgical subjects&#xD;
      who have either developed or are at risk for developing new onset POAF/AFL and who are at&#xD;
      risk for stroke, as determined by their CHA2DS2-VASC (congestive heart failure, hypertension,&#xD;
      age ≥75 years (2 points), diabetes mellitus, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA)&#xD;
      (2 points), vascular disease, age 65-74 years, sex class (female)) score. These subjects must&#xD;
      not have had a history of AF/AFL before cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will undergo up to 30 days of continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring&#xD;
      with an adhesive, patch-based monitor (Medtronic SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system or the&#xD;
      CardioSTAT (Icentia Inc.) cardiac rhythm monitoring device). The control group will receive&#xD;
      usual care, which does not involve planned cardiac rhythm testing within the first 30 days&#xD;
      after study randomization. The primary outcome is documentation of sustained atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation or flutter within the first 30 days after randomization. In addition, subjects&#xD;
      in both groups will undergo 14 days of continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring with the&#xD;
      Medtronic SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system or the CardioSTAT (Icentia Inc.) cardiac&#xD;
      rhythm monitoring device at 6±1 months after their index cardiac surgery.&#xD;

      The aim of the SEARCH-AF trial is to evaluate a novel diagnostic tool for detecting&#xD;
      post-operative atrial fibrillation or flutter (POAF/AFL) in cardiac surgical subjects during&#xD;
      the early, sub-acute post-operative period. Its primary objective is to test whether enhanced&#xD;
      cardiac rhythm monitoring with an adhesive, continuous monitor results in higher rates of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL) detection at 30 days after randomization for&#xD;
      post-cardiac surgical subjects who are at risk for developing post-operative atrial&#xD;
      arrhythmias, when compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is an open-label, two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a&#xD;
      strategy of enhanced cardiac rhythm monitoring vs. usual care in 396 post-cardiac surgical&#xD;
      subjects who are at risk for developing POAF/AFL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a cumulative AF/AFL burden of ≥6&#xD;
      minutes or documentation of AF/AFL by a 12-lead ECG within 30 days after randomization.&#xD;
      Clinical endpoints will be adjudicated by an independent committee of physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population involves post-cardiac surgical subjects at high risk of stroke, defined&#xD;
      as having a CHA2DS2-VASC score of ≥4 or CHA2DS2-VASC of ≥2 with additional risk factors for&#xD;
      developing POAF/AFL. These subjects must not have a history of AF/AFL pre-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the&#xD;
      following 2 arms: (i) Enhanced cardiac rhythm monitoring (intervention group) or (ii) Usual&#xD;
      care (control group). Subjects in the intervention group will receive up to 30 days of&#xD;
      continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring with the Medtronic SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system&#xD;
      or the CardioSTAT (Icentia Inc.) cardiac rhythm monitoring device. Monitoring will begin on&#xD;
      the day of randomization. Subjects in the usual care group will not undergo protocol-mandated&#xD;
      cardiac rhythm monitoring during the first 30 days after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have a follow-up visit at 31-90 days after hospital discharge and at 6±1&#xD;
      months after surgery. At 6±1 months, all subjects will undergo 14 days of continuous cardiac&#xD;
      rhythm monitoring with the SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system or the CardioSTAT (Icentia&#xD;
      Inc.) cardiac rhythm monitoring device. A telephone follow-up will be performed for all&#xD;
      subjects at 9±1 months after surgery.&#xD;
