  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a major health care burden. It can occur with either normal or reduced LV&#xD;
      ejection fraction, depending on different degrees of ventricular remodelling. The&#xD;
      investigators recently published a new method, curvedness-based imaging. The investigators&#xD;
      have also reported the diagnostic utility of curvedness-based imaging in various cardiac&#xD;
      diseases. The investigators now propose to prospectively assess curvedness-based imaging for&#xD;
      diagnosis of heart failure with normal ejection fraction and with reduced ejection fraction,&#xD;
      and examine left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and predicts the prognosis in a&#xD;
      cohort of HF patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure imposes major global health care burden on society and suffering for the&#xD;
      individual.In the US, HF affects 5.7 million patients, and is the leading cause of&#xD;
      hospitalization for people over 65 years, with 25% to 50% rate or hospital readmission within&#xD;
      6 months.In Singapore, between 1991 and 1998, it accounted for 4.5% of all hospital&#xD;
      admissions and 2.5% of mortality in the geriatric age group.It confers an annual mortality of&#xD;
      10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early diagnosis and identification of the underlying etiology of HF is of paramount&#xD;
      importance; some causes require specific treatment and may be correctable. From updated&#xD;
      American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, some questions must be&#xD;
      addressed for suspected HF patients: Is the left ventricular ejection fraction preserved or&#xD;
      reduced? Is the structure of the LV normal or abnormal? Are there other structural&#xD;
      abnormalities such as right ventricular (RV) abnormalities that could account for the&#xD;
      clinical presentation? Is there LV global and regional dysfunction and to what extent? Is the&#xD;
      etiology ischemic or non-ischemic?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac imaging is important both for HF diagnosis and monitoring of progress. Impaired pump&#xD;
      function, expressed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction is often used as a marker of&#xD;
      HF. About 50% of HF have preserved EF.In this situation, more intricate and comprehensive&#xD;
      imaging involving measurement of multiple diastolic and systolic parameters, usually using&#xD;
      echocardiography, may become necessary to address the questions mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our solution is expected to result in a significant cost saving for HF patients. HF diagnosis&#xD;
      is still very challenging, consisting of assessment of medical and family histories, a&#xD;
      physical exam and diagnostic imaging tests. The investigators compare the cost difference in&#xD;
      traditional way against our proposed solution. The traditional diagnostic tests include chest&#xD;
      x-ray, BNP blood test, echocardiography, nuclear heart scan and cardiac catheterization. In&#xD;
      this project, the investigators estimate the cost of echocardiography, nuclear heart scan and&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization for HF diagnosis. Based on clinical experience, among 1000 patients&#xD;
      undergoing echocardiography, 50% will be referred to nuclear heart scan and 30% will be&#xD;
      referred to invasive cardiac catheterization. The cost of the whole workup is estimated to be&#xD;
      $1.95 million. If 1000 patients undergo our proposed CBI solution directly, the cost&#xD;
      estimated at $1.4 million. The cost saving is estimated at S$400 per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the investigators will be exploring the following for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: Assess LV systolic and diastolic function from curvedness-based imaging in 120&#xD;
      HF patients with reduced ejection fraction and normal ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim: Evaluate the utility of curvedness-based imaging for the diagnosis of etiology&#xD;
      of HF, against gold standard gadolinium enhanced CMR in subgroup of HF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory aim: Evaluate the utility of curvedness-based imaging for the prediction of&#xD;
      prognosis during 6 month follow up, where clinical outcome include death, CV death and HF&#xD;
      re-admission.&#xD;
