    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the cause for the discrepancy in predicted and&#xD;
      observed weight loss with Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) by measuring appetite regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major secondary objectives are to determine the effects of Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) on&#xD;
      energy expenditure and change in total body weight and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is change in appetite hormone concentrations (specifically total PYY)&#xD;
      between baseline and 24 weeks: - this will be measured by sequential blood sampling during&#xD;
      visits 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes, which are exploratory, are effect on appetite hormones (ghrelin and&#xD;
      GLP-1), appetite perceptions, total body weight and fat and fat free mass, energy&#xD;
      expenditure, appetite perception, physical activity and blood and urine biochemical&#xD;
      parameters after Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) treatment for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for the study is 76 participants and the planned trial duration is 21 months,&#xD;
      with participants receiving approximately 24 weeks of exposure to Empagliflozin (Jardiance™).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Out of a family of six sodium glucose co-transporters, two have been extensively studied for&#xD;
      therapeutic indications involving glucose reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate. Sodium&#xD;
      glucose co-transporter-1 (SGLT-1), which is mainly found in both the renal tubule and&#xD;
      enterocytes lining intestinal villi, transfers glucose across a concentration gradient&#xD;
      resulting in glucose absorption from the gut and accounting for 10% of the glucose&#xD;
      reabsorption from the renal tubules. Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2), which is&#xD;
      mostly found in the kidneys, is responsible for reabsorbing 90% of the glucose that is&#xD;
      filtered by the renal tubules. Compared with healthy individuals, SGLT-2 is over-expressed&#xD;
      and over-activated in those with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGLT-2 inhibitors are a new class of glucose-lowering drugs for the management of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes which reduce plasma glucose levels by increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE) by&#xD;
      up to 60-80g (240-320 kilo Calories) per day. SGLT-1 inhibitors and combined SGLT-1 and -2&#xD;
      inhibitors are currently in development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several SGLT-2 inhibitors are commercially available and licensed for use in the UK including&#xD;
      dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and Empagliflozin (Jardiance™). They all lower glycated&#xD;
      haemoglobin (HbA1c) effectively compared with placebo (mean difference vs. placebo -0.66%&#xD;
      (95% Confidence Interval, -0.73% to -0.58%). They also result in weight loss of approximately&#xD;
      1.8kg compared with placebo and in combination with other oral hypoglycaemic medications.&#xD;
      Some of this weight loss can be attributed to fluid loss due to osmotic diuresis from UGE.&#xD;
      Weight is lost from both subcutaneous and visceral stores of adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II studies have shown that the highly selective and potent SGLT-2 inhibitor&#xD;
      Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) results in significant reductions in HbA1c level after 12 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy compared with placebo (HbA1c 0.4-0.6% reduction with 5-25mg daily dose, p&lt;0.0001) and&#xD;
      reduction was similar to that seen with metformin. Weight loss of between 1.81-2.33kg was&#xD;
      also achieved depending on Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) dose along with reduction in fasting&#xD;
      plasma glucose (FPG). Similar improvements in HbA1c, weight and FPG have been seen in phase&#xD;
      III trials with Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) both as monotherapy and in combination with&#xD;
      metformin, sulphonylureas or insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) is licensed in the UK for use in type 2 diabetes management. In&#xD;
      this study, we will be using Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) according to its licensed indications&#xD;
      and dosage. The commonest known side-effects include urinary tract and genital mycotic&#xD;
      infections which are more frequent in women than men and generally mild in severity.&#xD;
      Dehydration and postural hypotension may occur due to volume depletion and modest lowering of&#xD;
      blood pressure. Increased urinary frequency may also occur. Increased risk of hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      is observed when Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) is combined with sulphonylureas or insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight loss from increased UGE and net energy loss with SGLT-2 inhibitors is less than&#xD;
      expected as shown by studies in patients with type 2 diabetes. Endogenous glucose production&#xD;
      is markedly increased with shifting of substrate utilisation from carbohydrate to lipid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 90g of glucose are excreted per day with Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) which equates to&#xD;
      360 kilo Calories per day lost by glycosuria. A 90 week study of patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes treated with Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) 25mg daily showed that average weight loss&#xD;
      was 3.2±4.2kg representing a calorie deficit of 51 kilo Calories /day (interquartile range&#xD;
      112). This was 29%±41% of the expected loss of 11.3±3.1kg predicted by glycosuria of 206 kilo&#xD;
      Calories per day using a validated mathematical model (http://bwsimulator.niddk.nih.gov). An&#xD;
      increase in daily calorie intake of 269 kilo Calories /day [Inter Quartile Range 258] and&#xD;
      daily energy expenditure appear to be the adaptive responses due to Empagliflozin&#xD;
      (Jardiance™) therapy and the combination of SGLT-2 inhibitors and calorie restriction has&#xD;
      been recommended by the authors of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appetite stimulation resulting in increased energy intake may be the underlying mechanism for&#xD;
      this weight loss deficit. Furthermore, glucagon response is increased by SGLT-2 inhibition&#xD;
      using Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) and dapagliflozin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appetite hormones such as peptide Y-Y (PYY) and ghrelin are important in the control of&#xD;
      appetite and weight regulation. They are secreted from intestinal L cells which are found in&#xD;
      the distal small intestine. Ghrelin, which stimulates hunger, has been shown to increase with&#xD;
      weight loss and energy restriction diets. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is another hormone&#xD;
      which is involved in the regulation of appetite and satiety along with other glucose&#xD;
      homeostatic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no studies that have investigated the impact of SGLT-2 inhibitors on appetite&#xD;
      hormones and effect on body composition. It is essential to understand these mechanisms in&#xD;
      order to maximize the weight loss achievable with these agents. They may need to be combined&#xD;
      with appropriate dietary measures such as energy restriction diets and weight-lowering or&#xD;
      weight-neutral hypoglycaemic therapies for optimal clinical benefit. The aim of our study is&#xD;
      to explore the relationship between appetite hormones and Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) in order&#xD;
      to understand the underlying mechanisms for observed weight loss which does not equate with&#xD;
      that predicted for these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the cause for the discrepancy in predicted and&#xD;
      observed weight loss with Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) by measuring appetite regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) on resting energy expenditure and&#xD;
      change in total body weight and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study End Points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is effect on appetite hormones (specifically total PYY) with&#xD;
      Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) after treatment for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints, which are exploratory, are effect on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Appetite hormones ghrelin and GLP-1 and appetite perception (ii) Total body weight and&#xD;
      change in body composition (fat and fat free mass) (iii) Resting energy expenditure (iv)&#xD;
      Physical activity (v) Change in blood and urine biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted over 24 weeks in&#xD;
      male and postmenopausal female participants with type 2 diabetes on lifestyle control or&#xD;
      stable metformin dose only to compare the effects of Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) on appetite&#xD;
      and weight regulation compared with placebo and energy restriction diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised to one of four arms at baseline:- (i) Empagliflozin&#xD;
      (Jardiance™) 25mg once daily (ii) Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) 25mg once daily and energy&#xD;
      restriction diet (iii) Placebo (iv) Placebo and energy restriction diet Participants will be&#xD;
      stratified for age and BMI. STUDY CONDUCT Participant Withdrawal:- Each participant has the&#xD;
      right to withdraw from the study at any time without needing to give a reason. The&#xD;
      investigator may discontinue a participant from the study at any time if considered&#xD;
      necessary. The reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the CRF and medical records. If the&#xD;
      participant is withdrawn due to an adverse event, the investigator will arrange for follow-up&#xD;
      visits or telephone calls until the adverse event has resolved or stabilised. The duration of&#xD;
      safety follow-ups will be at least five half-lives of the study medication. The half-life of&#xD;
      Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) is 12.4 hours, thus the duration of safety follow-ups will be&#xD;
      rounded up to be at least 72 hours (or 3 days). The participant will be withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study if they lose capacity and data collected up to that point will be used for analysis. As&#xD;
      analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis, there will be analysis of all data of&#xD;
      participants receiving study medication (e.g. most safety analyses) and data will be admitted&#xD;
      to the database even after the participant has withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source Data:- Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which&#xD;
      participants' CRF data will be obtained. These include, but are not limited to, hospital&#xD;
      records (from which medical history and previous and concurrent medication will be summarised&#xD;
      into the CRF), clinical and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries,&#xD;
      microfiches, radiographs, and correspondence. On all study-specific documents, other than the&#xD;
      signed consent, the participant will be referred to by the study participant number/code&#xD;
      only, and not by name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Management:- The licensed product Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) will be handled according&#xD;
      to the University Hospitals of Leicester pharmacy in-house protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance with Study Treatment:- The participants will be instructed to return all unused or&#xD;
      part-used medication and packaging from used medication at each visit. The Investigator may&#xD;
      withdraw the participants if they consider dose compliance is unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medication:- Throughout the study, Investigators will be able to prescribe any&#xD;
      concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care&#xD;
      except for those listed in the exclusion criteria. If these are required, the participant&#xD;
      will be withdrawn. Any medication, other than the study medication taken during the study&#xD;
      will be recorded in the CRF. Contraindicated medications during the study will include any&#xD;
      other glucose-lowering therapies apart from metformin. Loop diuretic therapy will also be&#xD;
      contraindicated. As study drug Empagliflozin (Jardiance™), placebo and metformin do not cause&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia, participants will not be expected to perform home blood glucose monitoring&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY REPORTING Expected Serious Adverse Events/Reactions (SAE):- The most common adverse&#xD;
      events seen with Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) are urinary tract and mycotic fungal infections&#xD;
      (e.g. balanitis) and volume depletion leading to dehydration, postural hypotension and&#xD;
      dizziness. If these events lead to hospitalisation of the participant, they will require&#xD;
      immediate reporting to the study team. Otherwise, they will be treated as an AE and need&#xD;
      reporting to the study team within 2 working days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormalities of renal and liver function will also be closely monitored as part of the usual&#xD;
      study visits and any significant clinical deterioration in renal and/or liver function will&#xD;
      be reported as an SAE. A serious deterioration in renal function to be classified as an SAE&#xD;
      will be a reduction in eGFR to less than 30ml/min/1.73m2. A serious deterioration in liver&#xD;
      function will be classified as an SAE if ALT (Alanine aminotransferase) or AST (Aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase) is 3 x greater than the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketoacidosis and Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) have recently been reported as a possible&#xD;
      serious SAE occurring with SGLT-2 inhibitor use by the US Food and Drugs Administration.&#xD;
      Participants will be closely monitored for the development of this SAE and will be advised to&#xD;
      seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, unusual fatigue or sleepiness, anorexia,&#xD;
      excessive thirst, dehydration, low food intake, weight loss, infection, poor control of&#xD;
      diabetes, and/or only moderately increased glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors will be&#xD;
      discontinued immediately. Restarting SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA&#xD;
      while on SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment is not recommended unless another clear precipitating&#xD;
      factor is identified and resolved. Treatment will also be interrupted in patients who are&#xD;
      hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute medical illnesses. In both cases,&#xD;
      treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors may be restarted once the patient's condition has stabilised&#xD;
      and only once the necessary safety assessments have been performed. The decision to stop or&#xD;
      interrupt and subsequently re-start the study treatment Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) will be&#xD;
      documented in the participant's medical notes. Any decisions regarding the withdrawal of&#xD;
      participants from the study will be made by the study clinician and Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) A serious adverse reaction, the nature&#xD;
      or severity of which is not consistent with the Summary of Product Characteristics for&#xD;
      Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) will be reported as a SUSAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events of Special Interests (AESI) Adverse Events of Special Interests (AESI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased renal function: creatinine value shows a ≥ 2 fold increase from baseline and&#xD;
           is above ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatic injury defined by the following alterations of liver parameters after&#xD;
           randomization at visit 1:-&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Elevation of AST and/or ALT≥3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total&#xD;
                bilirubin≥2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Isolated elevation of AST and/or ALT≥5 fold ULN irrespective of any bilirubin&#xD;
                elevation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) o DKA is defined by the diagnostic criteria in the table&#xD;
           below, and as defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators should note that not all criteria in Table 2 (below) need to apply for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of DKA, and clinical judgment should also be taken into consideration. Due to its&#xD;
      mechanism of action, Empagliflozin (Jardiance™) may potentially modify the clinical&#xD;
      presentation of DKA which may occur at lower plasma glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any AESIs occur they will be reported to the Sponsor and Boehringer Ingelheim using the&#xD;
      same procedure as reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events:- All SAEs will be reported internally to the&#xD;
      Sponsor within one working day (24 hours) of discovery or notification of the event. The SAE&#xD;
      will be reported using appropriate forms and the immediate report will be made in writing and&#xD;
      shall be followed by a detailed written report of the event. Additional information can be&#xD;
      provided if requested to the Sponsor and main Research Ethics Committee (REC) (e.g. in the&#xD;
      event of a death). The Principal Investigator or another delegated physician is responsible&#xD;
      for the review and sign off of the SAE, or in their absence, another member of the team (in&#xD;
      order to avoid a delay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor will perform an initial check of the information and ensure that it is reviewed&#xD;
      at the next R&amp;D management meeting. All SAE information must be recorded on an SAE form and&#xD;
      sent to the Sponsor. Additional information received for a case (follow-up or corrections to&#xD;
      the original case) needs to be detailed on a new SAE form and sent to the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor will report all SUSARs to the MHRA and the REC concerned. Fatal or&#xD;
      life-threatening SUSARs must be reported within 7 days and all other SUSARs within 15 days.&#xD;
      The Chief Investigator will inform all investigators concerned of relevant information about&#xD;
      SUSARs that could adversely affect the safety of participants. The Sponsor will use the&#xD;
      Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) as the Reference Safety Information (RSI) when&#xD;
      determining the expectedness of any untoward medical occurrences and thus SAE/SUSAR&#xD;
      reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the expedited reporting above, the Chief Investigator will submit once a year&#xD;
      throughout the clinical study or on request a Developmental Safety Update Report (DSUR) to&#xD;
      the MHRA and REC. The PI will inform all investigators concerned of relevant information&#xD;
      about SUSARs that could adversely affect the safety of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS Description of Statistical Methods:- Participants recruited to the study will be&#xD;
      compared within and by treatment group. For the latter, each active treatment arm, whether&#xD;
      medication, medication and energy restriction diet or placebo and energy restriction diet,&#xD;
      will be compared against the placebo only arm. Baseline variables will be presented by arm&#xD;
      using N (%) for categorical variables and mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile&#xD;
      range) as appropriate, for continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is change in appetite hormones from baseline to week 24 within and&#xD;
      between treatment groups. AUC values for appetite hormone measurements at baseline and 24&#xD;
      weeks will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Paired t-tests or equivalent&#xD;
      non-parametric tests will be used to analyse the change in appetite hormones within&#xD;
      individual treatment groups. One way analysis of variance will be used to calculate mean&#xD;
      changes in AUC from baseline to 24 weeks by treatment group. Adjusted treatment effects will&#xD;
      be calculated via linear regression analysis or similarly appropriate methods, to compare&#xD;
      each treatment against placebo. Models will include a categorical treatment variable and will&#xD;
      be adjusted for stratification factors; age and BMI as well as baseline AUC value. Changes in&#xD;
      appetite hormones from baseline to weeks 2, 6 and 12 will also be analysed using the same&#xD;
      methods; however will represent hypothesis generating analyses only. Similarly, overall&#xD;
      changes in appetite hormones over time will be analysed using multilevel models, adjusted for&#xD;
      stratification factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis for the primary outcome will be repeated for secondary endpoints; changes in&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure, weight and body composition, physical activity and biochemical&#xD;
      parameters from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses of outcome data will be carried out on a complete case basis, so only those&#xD;
      patients with complete data will be included in the analysis. Intention to treat and per&#xD;
      protocol analyses will be carried out as sensitivity analyses, using multiple imputation and&#xD;
      including only those who remain on their treatment regimen for the duration of the study,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Number of Participants:- The power calculation is based on the primary outcome of change&#xD;
      in appetite hormones and a standard deviation of area under the curve of 96.2pg/ml of total&#xD;
      PYY based on a study looking at the influence of resistance and aerobic exercise on hunger&#xD;
      and circulating levels of total PYY in healthy males. To detect a minimum clinically&#xD;
      significant difference of 120pg/ml in area under the curve of total PYY between groups, we&#xD;
      will require 15 participants in each of the four arms with 80% power and 2-sided alpha of&#xD;
      1.7%. This will allow three comparisons between arms. To account for up to 20% dropout, 19&#xD;
      participants will be required in each arm; therefore 76 participants will be recruited in&#xD;
      total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Level of Statistical Significance:- Statistical significance will be taken at the level&#xD;
      of p&lt;0.05. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURES The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the current approved protocol, International Conference on Harmonisation Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice, relevant regulations and standard operating procedures (SOPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular monitoring will be performed according to International Conference on Harmonisation&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice. Data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol and accuracy&#xD;
      in relation to source documents. Following written standard operating procedures, the&#xD;
      monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated, documented&#xD;
      and reported in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice and the applicable&#xD;
      regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY GOVERNANCE The study will be conducted in accordance with the Research Governance&#xD;
      Framework for Health and Social Care, ICH GCP and the Data Protection Act. The Sponsor&#xD;
      responsible for checking research governance arrangements will be the University of&#xD;
      Leicester. A Trial Steering Committee (TSC), Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and&#xD;
      Project Management Committee (PMC) will be set up to support the running of the study.&#xD;
