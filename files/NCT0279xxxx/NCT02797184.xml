  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to do the work that is necessary and sufficient for setting up&#xD;
      an appropriate multi-center, randomized clinical trial (RCT) of a new therapy for heart&#xD;
      failure: inorganic nitrate. The investigators will first determine the effects and&#xD;
      palatability of ~12.8mmol KNO3 (an oral pill) as compared to the roughly equivalent amount of&#xD;
      nitrate in 2 beetroot juice (BRJ) Sports Shots (by James White Drinks). Next, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine the effects of inorganic nitrate (KNO3 in an oral pill format)&#xD;
      on blood pressure, blood nitrate levels, breath nitric oxide (NO) levels, and exercise&#xD;
      performance in a dose-response study. Third, the investigators will perform a small phase II&#xD;
      chronic treatment study that will allow them to determine the best primary endpoint and the&#xD;
      numbers of patients the investigators will need to study in the large, multi-center RCT to&#xD;
      follow this project. In the small study and in the RCT to follow, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine whether inorganic nitrate can improve aerobic exercise capacity, muscle power, and&#xD;
      speed of muscle contraction, and lessen the effort of breathing during exercise.&#xD;

      1. Subjects will be patients with Heart Failure (HF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All subjects will be consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All subjects will give permission for the investigators to review their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After consenting to participate, subjects will be instructed to refrain from spitting or&#xD;
           the use of an antibacterial mouthwash, antacids, proton pump inhibitors, or chewing gum&#xD;
           during the morning of each clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjects will have a physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Subjects will undergo transthoracic echocardiographic imaging at rest (unless they had&#xD;
           this performed within the past 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Subjects will be asked to undergo a mouth swab for bacterial DNA analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Subjects will be asked to answer questionnaires regarding their medical health (basic&#xD;
           health questionnaire, Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire, a combined&#xD;
           fatigue questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Dose visit 1: Subjects will receive 2 capsules containing either 10 or 20 mmol of&#xD;
           potassium nitrate (KNO3).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Before and at 3 hourly time points after receiving the KNO3, subjects will undergo&#xD;
           phlebotomy for plasma nitrate and nitrite levels, will have their blood pressure&#xD;
           measured, and will blow into a small machine to assess the amount of nitric oxide in&#xD;
           their breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Exercise Test 1: Subjects will complete measurements of leg muscle power by doing knee&#xD;
           extension exercises on a dynamometer (a device that measures voluntary muscle force&#xD;
           production while controlling the speed of movement).&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Exercise Test 2: Subjects complete a measurement of peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak)&#xD;
           while walking on a treadmill and breathing into a mouthpiece. Blood pressure, heart rate&#xD;
           and heart rhythm will be monitored during this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Subjects will undergo a 7 d washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Dose visit 2: Subjects will receive 2 capsules containing either 10 or 20 mmol of KNO3&#xD;
           (whichever dose they did not receive at dose visit 1). They will repeat the same&#xD;
           assessments listed above in 10, 11, and 12.&#xD;
