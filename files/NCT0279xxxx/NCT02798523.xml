      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system defends the body against bacteria and other harmful invaders. But it can&#xD;
      overact and attack healthy cells by mistake. The group of drugs called glucocorticoids (GCs)&#xD;
      can calm down an overactive immune system. But they often cause negative side effects.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn how human genes respond to GCs. Genes live inside each cell of the&#xD;
      body. They tell our cells how to function. Researchers hope the results of this study will&#xD;
      show them how to develop better drugs that will have the benefits of GCs without the side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how human genes respond to glucocorticoid drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult volunteers ages 18 64.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have a&#xD;
      heart test and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study visit will last about 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have medical history, physical exam, and 3 blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a skin biopsy. An injection will numb the skin on one arm. Then a tool&#xD;
      will remove a piece of skin about as big as a pencil eraser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A GC cream will be applied to the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the GC study drug for 30 minutes. It will be a liquid that will drip&#xD;
      through a needle placed in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a skin biopsy of the arm that had the cream applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up calls 1 and 4 days later. They will be asked about reactions&#xD;
      or other health problems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoids are among the most frequently prescribed immunosuppressive and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications worldwide. Long-term use, however, is complicated by serious&#xD;
      non-immunologic side effects. Ongoing in vitro experiments with human primary cells in our&#xD;
      laboratory suggest that there are indeed fundamental differences in the genomic response of&#xD;
      immune and non-immune cells to glucocorticoids. These and other aspects of drug action at the&#xD;
      genomic level have not been completely characterized. This study will attempt to generate a&#xD;
      list of human genes and non-coding RNAs that are differentially expressed and regulated in&#xD;
      response to glucocorticoids between immune and non-immune cells. These data will be used to&#xD;
      identify transcripts, their corresponding proteins, and the molecular pathways that are best&#xD;
      candidates for targeted intervention. Potential targets could be validated with small&#xD;
      interfering RNA (siRNA) libraries, with the long-term goal of developing small-molecule or&#xD;
      nanoparticlefacilitated RNA interference (RNAi) interventions that reproduce the therapeutic&#xD;
      action of glucocorticoids in immune cells while avoiding their harmful side effects on other&#xD;
      tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will undergo baseline blood collection prior to receiving a single&#xD;
      intravenous dose of 250 milligrams of methylprednisolone sodium succinate. Blood will be&#xD;
      collected in one of two regimens: 1 and 2 hours or 2 and 4 hours after the start of the&#xD;
      infusion. A skin punch biopsy may be obtained before healthy volunteers receive IV&#xD;
      methylprednisolone. If so, topical methylprednisolone will be applied to a limited area of&#xD;
      skin, contralateral to the site of the baseline skin biopsy, and an affitional skin biopsy&#xD;
      will be obtained 4 hours after drug administration, from the area where topical&#xD;
      methylprednisolone was applied. Follow-up phone calls 1 day and 1 week after discharge will&#xD;
      document any adverse effects related to the drug or skin biopsy. Total length of individual&#xD;
      study participation is 1-5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be processed for isolation of hematopoietic cell sub-population&#xD;
      (neutrophils, B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, and natural killer [NK] cells).&#xD;
      Laboratory studies will be performed in the purified cells, with the goal of understanding&#xD;
      the human response to glucocorticoids in vivo at the level of RNA (e.g., RNA sequencing,&#xD;
      small -RNA-sequencing, real-time PCR), DNA (e.g., ChIP-seq, methylation analysis, DNA&#xD;
      sequencing, genotyping, and protein (e.g., flow cytometry, mass spectrometry). At each time&#xD;
      point, serum methylprednisolone levels will be measured and flow cytometry for standard&#xD;
      lineage markers will be performed. Skin biopsies will be subjected to RNA isolation for RNA&#xD;
      sequencing and small-RNA sequencing. A fragment of each skin biopsy will undergo fibroblast&#xD;
      isolation and culture for in vitro exposure to glucocorticoids and for the generation of&#xD;
      induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.&#xD;
