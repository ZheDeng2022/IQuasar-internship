    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; medically important events. AEs included both serious and all non-serious adverse events.</description>

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to Duavive tablet in a participant who received Duavive tablet. A treatment-related serious adverse event was a treatment-related adverse event resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Relatedness to Duavive tablet was assessed by the investigator.</description>
