  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing number of trials have demonstrated treatment effectiveness for people with mental&#xD;
      illness (PWMI) by non-specialist providers, such as primary care and community health&#xD;
      workers, in low-resource settings. A barrier to scaling up these evidence-based practices is&#xD;
      the limited uptake from trainings into service provision and lack of fidelity to&#xD;
      evidence-based practices among non-specialists. This arises, in part, from stigma among&#xD;
      non-specialists against PWMI. Therefore, interventions are needed to address attitudes among&#xD;
      non-specialists. To address this gap, REducing Stigma among HeAlthcare Providers to improvE&#xD;
      Mental Health services (RESHAPE-mh), is an intervention for non-specialists in which social&#xD;
      contact with PWMI is added to training and supervision programs. A pilot cluster randomized&#xD;
      control trial will address primary objectives including trainees' perspectives on perceived&#xD;
      acceptability of PWMI's participation in training and supervision, intervention fidelity and&#xD;
      contagion, assessment of randomization, and feasibility and psychometric properties of&#xD;
      outcome measures in a cluster design. Secondary objectives are change in provider and patient&#xD;
      outcomes. The control condition is existing mental health training and supervision for&#xD;
      non-specialists delivered through the Programme for Improving Mental Healthcare (PRIME),&#xD;
      which includes the mental health Global Action Programme (mhGAP) and psychosocial treatments.&#xD;
      The intervention condition will incorporate social contact with PWMI into existing PRIME&#xD;
      training and supervision. Participants in the pilot will be the direct beneficiaries of&#xD;
      training and supervision (i.e., primary care workers) and indirect beneficiaries (i.e., their&#xD;
      patients). Primary care workers' outcomes include knowledge (mhGAP knowledge scale), explicit&#xD;
      attitudes (mhGAP attitudes and social distance scales), implicit attitudes (Implicit&#xD;
      Association Test), and clinical competence (Enhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic&#xD;
      factors, ENACT) to be assessed pre-training, post-training, and at 4-month follow-up. Patient&#xD;
      outcomes include functioning, stigma experiences in accessing care, and depression/alcohol&#xD;
      use symptoms to be assessed at initiation of mental health care and 6 months later. The pilot&#xD;
      study will assist in modifying the intervention to inform a larger effectiveness trial of&#xD;
      RESHAPE to ultimately improve provider attitudes and clinical competence as a mechanism to&#xD;
      improve patient outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Setting The study will take place in primary care health facilities in Chitwan, Nepal. The&#xD;
      Department for International Development (DFID)-sponsored Programme for Improving Mental&#xD;
      Health Care (PRIME) is being implemented in Chitwan, Nepal. PRIME aims to improve the&#xD;
      coverage of treatment for priority mental disorders by implementing and evaluating a&#xD;
      comprehensive mental health care package, integrated into primary health care in five low and&#xD;
      middle income countries (LMIC) (Nepal, India, South Africa, Ethiopia and Uganda). The care&#xD;
      package includes the provision of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions by&#xD;
      non-specialized primary health workers (following the World Health Organization mental health&#xD;
      Gap Action Programme (mhGAP)-Intervention Guide) and community counselors. Currently, no&#xD;
      mental health services are systematically available in primary health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The facilities include health posts, primary health centers, and urban clinics. These are all&#xD;
      part of the government health center and represent the first portal for care. In these&#xD;
      facilities, primary care providers refer to health auxiliaries staff: health assistants,&#xD;
      community medical assistants, and auxiliary nurse midwives. PRIME and the RESHAPE component&#xD;
      are conducted by Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) Nepal, a Nepali&#xD;
      non-governmental mental health research and training organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The investigator will use a pilot cluster randomized trial design. Because attitudes&#xD;
      and clinical behaviors are influenced by peers (reference), the investigator anticipates a&#xD;
      high degree of contagion among providers within a facility. Moreover, clinical care is not&#xD;
      restricted to exclusive relationships with a single provider in the government health system.&#xD;
      Therefore, patient care will be characterized by seeing a range of providers within a single&#xD;
      facility over the course of their treatments. Therefore, a cluster design with the health&#xD;
      facility as the unit of clustering is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions The control arm will include the standard PRIME training and supervision&#xD;
      protocol for Nepal. There are two versions of the PRIME training: one for prescribers and one&#xD;
      for non-prescribers. Prescribers refer to health workers who can prescribe medication (health&#xD;
      assistants and auxiliary health workers). Non-prescribers cannot prescribe medication and&#xD;
      provide community outreach, assist in vaccination within maternal and child health programs,&#xD;
      and promote adherence. Non-prescribers are predominantly auxiliary nurse midwives. Training&#xD;
      for prescribers is based on mhGAP and includes target disorders of depression, psychosis,&#xD;
      epilepsy, and harmful drinking. Psychosocial modules focusing on communication skills,&#xD;
      supportive techniques, and health education are included based on prior curriculums and&#xD;
      adapted for Nepal. Training is delivered by a psychiatrist and an experienced psychosocial&#xD;
      counselor. Following training, the prescriber group participates in monthly supervision&#xD;
      sessions with a psychiatrist. Non-prescribers receive training which includes psychosocial&#xD;
      basics, a modified behavioral activation module, and a modified motivational interviewing&#xD;
      module. These later psychological treatments, known as Healthy Activity Program (HAP) and&#xD;
      Counseling for Alcohol Programs (CAP) respectively, have been developed for use in South Asia&#xD;
      by non-specialists. Non-prescribers receive monthly supervision from experienced psychosocial&#xD;
      counselors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESHAPE-mh uses the basic model of PRIME training and supervision. For both the prescriber&#xD;
      and non-prescriber training, people with mental illness (PWMI) participate as&#xD;
      co-facilitators. PWMI are trained to serve as co-facilitators using &quot;PhotoVoice&quot;-a&#xD;
      participatory research approach in which photography is used to develop testimonials and&#xD;
      other messaging. PWMI contribute to personal testimonials, ongoing social contact, myth&#xD;
      busting, and provide a recovery emphasis. In addition, a health worker who has previously&#xD;
      participated in the PRIME program receives training to participate as a co-facilitator and&#xD;
      serves as an enthusiastic and aspirational role model. The second component of RESHAPE is&#xD;
      ongoing engagement with PWMI through monthly consumer consultation meetings. [Note: In Duke&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) Pro00055042 and in National Institute of Mental Health&#xD;
      (NIMH) grant application K01MH104310, RESHAPE is referred to as &quot;Consumer Engagement&#xD;
      Anti-Stigma (CEAS) Training.&quot; CEAS has now been renamed as RESHAPE-mh.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Primary care workers are the intended direct beneficiaries of RESHAPE. Their&#xD;
      patients are the intended indirect beneficiaries. Primary care workers include prescribers&#xD;
      (health assistants and auxiliary health workers) and non-prescribers (auxiliary nurse&#xD;
      midwives) both of whom represent the first contact for most care needs. Medical doctors&#xD;
      (MBBS) are limited to primary health centers and hospitals are usually seen after a person&#xD;
      has encountered one of the lower level cadre of workers. In the pilot, additional&#xD;
      participants will include PWMI who will be trained as facilitators for RESHAPE, mental health&#xD;
      experts (psychiatrists and psychosocial counselors) who serve as facilitators and&#xD;
      supervisors, and research staff (research assistants, field coordinators, and external&#xD;
      competency and fidelity raters). For the pilot, the investigator plans to recruit all primary&#xD;
      care workers (prescribers and non-prescribers) who are participating in the PRIME scale-up&#xD;
      phase and a subset of their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization RESHAPE is a pilot cluster randomize trial. As mentioned, the reason for&#xD;
      cluster randomization is because of the expected contagion at the level of the health&#xD;
      facility. Health attitudes and behaviors are influenced by co-workers, and therefore the&#xD;
      investigators expect that an intervention done with one health worker in a facility will&#xD;
      influence peers. In addition, contagion may occur during other trainings among community&#xD;
      health workers. Therefore, the health care provider randomization plan is to randomize all&#xD;
      prescribers and non-prescribers associated with a specific facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analyses: Focus group discussions (FGD), cognitive interviews, and process&#xD;
      evaluation notes will be coded in NVIVO (software name) and analyzed using content analysis&#xD;
      for themes of cultural acceptability, experience of consumers as trainers, relevance to&#xD;
      clinical care, training duration, structure of training, content of training, and follow-up&#xD;
      engagement. Coding will be conducted among independent raters, and inter-rater reliability&#xD;
      will calculated using Kappas. Data analysis will be conducted throughout each step to&#xD;
      facilitate iterative revision then finalization of the manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: The quantitative outcomes of interest will be summarized descriptively&#xD;
      and visually over time for the providers (4 time points: pre- and post-training, then 4&#xD;
      months later, followed by another 12 months after that assessment point) and patients (2 time&#xD;
      points: study entry and 6 months later) for both study arms. Total and validated&#xD;
      domain-specific scores will be obtained for each instrument. Patient (PT)-specific trends&#xD;
      over time for each score will be plotted to examine between-PT differences and to determine&#xD;
      the plausible pattern (e.g. linearity) of those trends. This information will be used to&#xD;
      inform the choice of effect estimate (e.g. difference in slopes or in means at a specific&#xD;
      follow-up time point) in a subsequent cluster-randomized trial (C-RCT). The profiles will be&#xD;
      grouped by cluster and by study arm to examine between-cluster and between-arm variation in&#xD;
      PT outcomes. Using the first PT measurement (i.e. in the absence of intervention),&#xD;
      preliminary estimates of within- and between-cluster variances, within- and between-primary&#xD;
      care workers (PCW) variances and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of PT outcomes&#xD;
      will be estimated. Such estimates are essential for sample size calculations for the planned&#xD;
      R01 C-RCT design. Such variances are often guessed or obtained from other studies, whereas&#xD;
      the investigator will obtain context and design-specific estimates using this pilot data.&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigator will be able to estimate variance components for other measures of&#xD;
      interest, such as PT-specific slopes, as appropriate. PCW-specific trends for each PCW-score&#xD;
      will be examined using the same strategy as for PTs. Preliminary indicative estimates of&#xD;
      differences in perceptions by arm will be obtained. Because the proposed K01 study is a&#xD;
      pilot, no hypothesis-based inference testing will be performed. Instead, all quantitative&#xD;
      analyses will focus on description. Analyses will be used for publication on the C-RCT pilot&#xD;
      and for modification for full-scale C-RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and research governance Consent: Providers will be told in the consent form that there&#xD;
      are two different training approaches being evaluated. They will not be told about the focus&#xD;
      regarding stigma as this may bias the outcomes. Nor will they be told that the main&#xD;
      difference between trainings is the presence of PWMI as co-facilitators as this may&#xD;
      contribute to attentional biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms: The main risk factor is psychological distress among consumers depending on the type&#xD;
      of interaction with health care trainees in the training. If consumers do not feel that the&#xD;
      engagement training is comfortable training environment, the investigator has outlined&#xD;
      contingency plans regarding use of videotaped testimonials. Given a prior training with&#xD;
      healthcare consumers in Nepal, the investigator anticipates that consumers will find the&#xD;
      training experience a non-distressing experience. Minimal risk of harm from the treatment is&#xD;
      anticipated. If patients require medication, hospitalization, or treatment, they will&#xD;
      continue to be followed. Thus, there is not a disincentive for patients or providers to&#xD;
      transition to other care if needed. In addition to these risks with greatest likelihood,&#xD;
      other issues to consider are 1) negative consequences if confidentiality of information&#xD;
      obtained in the study (including subject identity as a research participant or information&#xD;
      collected during assessments or abstracted from a medical record review) were compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for patients in the study is at the discretion of PCWs. PCW training includes both&#xD;
      psychotherapy and medication management. At any time, PCWs may decide to initiate medication.&#xD;
      All patients are expected to be receiving optimal clinical care at the clinical judgment of&#xD;
      PCWs. PCWs are supervised by psychiatrists in Chitwan who can provide information on&#xD;
      management and receive referrals for patients with worsening symptoms or other clinical&#xD;
      concerns. All changes in treatment resulting from Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events&#xD;
      will be reported to institutional review boards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research ethics approval: This protocol has been approved by Duke University (Protocol&#xD;
      Number: Pro00055042) and the Nepal Health Research Council (Regulatory Number: 110/2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendments: Amendments will be jointly reviewed by Duke University and Nepal Health Research&#xD;
      Council, as well submitted to the funder: the National Institute of Mental Health, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timescale Trainings for PRIME and PRIME plus RESHAPE will take place in February-June 2016.&#xD;
      Providers will be followed for two years to evaluate retention, changes in knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, and clinical competence. Patient will be enrolled at facilities approximately 18&#xD;
      months after training. They will be followed-up six months after initial enrollment&#xD;
      evaluation. Primary outcome data collection will be completed by the end of June 2018.&#xD;
