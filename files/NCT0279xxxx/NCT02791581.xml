      This study is being done to see if patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer affects&#xD;
      the heart, the ability to exercise and fatigue when compared to patients who do not have&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      840 women aged ≥18 years old scheduled to receive chemotherapy for Stage I-III breast cancer&#xD;
      and a comparison population of 160 women without cancer (1,000 total). Equal numbers of women&#xD;
      will be recruited aged &lt; 52 vs. &gt; 52. At baseline, innovative MRI measures of CV function (LV&#xD;
      and aorta); measurements of submaximal (6-minute walk) and, on 45% of the cohort, maximal&#xD;
      (peak VO2) exercise capacity; questionnaire data to assess fatigue and behavioral and&#xD;
      psychosocial risk factors; and biomarkers will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be repeated at 3±1, 12±2 and 24±2 months. This study will assess the&#xD;
      relevance of pre-existing factors such as age, black/white race, hypertension, smoking&#xD;
      (yes/no), diabetes, coronary artery disease, menopause status, CV medications, and physical&#xD;
      activity on the study outcomes. Also, this study will assess dynamic change in modifiable CV&#xD;
      risk factors (including BMI, blood pressure, serum lipids, serum glucose, physical activity,&#xD;
      psychosocial factors, lifestyle behaviors), and the cancer treatment including chemotherapy,&#xD;
      radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and surgery.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Wake Forest NCORP Research Base is committed to following the NIH Statement on Sharing Research Data (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html). As of July 2018, the WF NCORP RB signed an agreement with NCI to contribute de-identified data and data dictionaries from clinical trials conducted through our RB to the NCI NCTN/NCORP data archive within 6 months of primary and non-primary publications of phase II/III and phase III trials to https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/. This will become the primary means for sharing raw data, and we will adhere to the guidelines spelled out in the NCTN/NCORP Data Archive Usage Guide. De-identified data from studies not covered by the agreement (e.g., phase II and observational studies) will be made available upon request. All data files will be de-identified. De-identification procedures will meet the HIPAA criteria as detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 45, Section 164.514.</ipd_description>
