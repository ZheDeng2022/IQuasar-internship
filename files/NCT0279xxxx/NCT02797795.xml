  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation trial&#xD;
      to be conducted in 2 sequential parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A (Dose Escalation) in subjects with advanced malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B (Dose Confirmation) in subjects with tumor type(s) to be determined by results of&#xD;
           Part A&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part A, subjects will be treated with a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of NEV801 on&#xD;
      Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of continuous 28-day cycles. The starting dose of NEV801 will be 20&#xD;
      mg/m2/dose, and the NEV801 dose will be escalated in successive cohorts of 3 subjects per&#xD;
      dose level. In Part B, up to 3 expansion cohorts of up to 12 subjects each, defined by tumor&#xD;
      type, will be enrolled at or below the MTD (i.e., the RP2D) of NEV801. In both parts,&#xD;
      subjects who tolerate the drug and who do not experience progressive disease may continue to&#xD;
      receive NEV801 at the discretion of the Investigator for up to 12 cycles. Subjects who&#xD;
      tolerate the drug and experience clinical benefit will be eligible for further treatment in&#xD;
      an extension protocol or through another means to be determined by the Sponsor.&#xD;

    <description>Part A - Dose escalation and de-escalation for the determination of the Maximum tolerated dose. All subjects will receive NEV801 intravenously on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 during each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
Part B - Subjects will receive NEV801 at or below the highest tolerable dose from Part A.</description>
