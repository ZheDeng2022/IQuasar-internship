      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775&#xD;
      when given together with fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (FLAG) combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy in treating children, adolescents and young adults with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia. Wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775 may help combination chemotherapy work&#xD;
      better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      fludarabine and cytarabine, may prevent tumor cells from multiplying by damaging their&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which in turn stops the tumor from growing. Giving wee1 kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor AZD1775 and FLAG chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of wee1&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor AZD1775 (AZD1775) administered orally daily for 5 days in combination with&#xD;
      FLAG (fludarabine, cytarabine, filgrastim) chemotherapy in children and adolescents with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of AZD1775 in combination with FLAG chemotherapy&#xD;
      administered on this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics AZD1775 in combination with FLAG chemotherapy in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of AZD1775 plus FLAG within the confines of&#xD;
      a phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarkers of wee1 inhibition with administration of AZD1775&#xD;
      including cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDC2) phosphorylation at tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) and&#xD;
      induction of gamma H2AX in pre- and post-treatment leukemic blasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore mechanisms of apoptosis induction and cell death in leukemic blasts treated&#xD;
      with AZD1775 plus chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To identify genomic alterations in leukemic blasts that may correlate with response to&#xD;
      therapy with AZD1775 plus FLAG chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OULTINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive filgrastim intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) daily, fludarabine&#xD;
      intravenously IV over 30 minutes, cytarabine IV over 1-3 hours and wee1 kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      AZD1775 orally (PO) on days 1-5. Patients who meet criteria for complete remission (CR),&#xD;
      complete remission with partial recovery of platelet count (CRp) or partial response (PR) may&#xD;
      receive a second course of therapy. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
