  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The cumulative incidences of NCI-CTCAE grade 2 or higher peripheral sensory neuropathy</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 12（each cycle is 2 weeks）</time_frame>
    <description>NCI-CTCAE was used for investigator-reported outcomes of peripheral sensory neuropathy; it was assessed every day from day 1 to day 3 of each cycle and on days 15 and 43 of cycle 12. Once grade 2 or higher neuropathy was observed in a certain participant, that participant was categorized as grade 2 or higher even if the grade returned to 1 or lower in subsequent cycles. Participants who discontinued the study or whose evaluation data were missing without reaching grade 2 or higher neuropathy were analyzed as no grade 2 or higher neuropathy. No primary endpoint was specified due to the exploratory nature of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Least-squares (LS) means of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecological Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity-12 (FACT/GOG-Ntx-12) version 4.0 score at cycle 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 12（each cycle is 2 weeks）</time_frame>
    <description>Participant-reported outcomes were evaluated using the FACT/GOG-Ntx-12 version 4.0, which measured the severity and impact of symptoms of neuropathy over the past 7 days. Scores range from 0 to 48, with lower scores indicating more severe neurotoxicity. Participants completed paper questionnaires on days 1 and 8 of each cycle and on days 15 and 43 of cycle 12, with follow-up assessment on the last day (day 43). LS means were calculated from the mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM). No primary endpoint was specified due to the exploratory nature of the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The discontinuation rate of oxaliplatin due to OIPN</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 12（each cycle is 2 weeks）</time_frame>
    <description>The number of people who discontinued oxaliplatin because of OIPN was counted and the percentage of the total was calculated. No primary endpoint was specified due to the exploratory nature of the study.</description>
