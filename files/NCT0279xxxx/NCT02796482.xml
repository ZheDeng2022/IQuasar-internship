      This open-label, prospective, controlled intervention study involves evaluating tolerance and&#xD;
      acceptability of an Oral Nutrition Supplement (ONS; EnergieShake® 1.5 kcal Complete drink) in&#xD;
      18 adult patients who are already taking an ONS. Following a 2-day baseline data collection&#xD;
      on their current ONS, patients switch to the test ONS, which is taken for a further 8&#xD;
      consecutive days. Patients revert to their current ONS at the end of the study. Patients act&#xD;
      as their own controls and thus all patients are allocated the same intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily records of GI tolerance and compliance with the prescribed amount of ONS will be kept&#xD;
      for participants throughout the study period. Participants' height and weight will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline (weight at end will also be collected), all medications will be&#xD;
      documented, and relevant medical and dietary histories will be recorded. A questionnaire at&#xD;
      the end of the intervention period will be administered collecting participants' views on the&#xD;
      acceptability (taste and palatability) of the test ONS. Taste and palatability will be&#xD;
      assessed via a questionnaire that uses a Hedonic scale to quantify preference.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Information: This open-label study involves evaluating tolerance and acceptability&#xD;
      of the test ONS in 18 adult participants who are already taking an ONS. Following a 2-day&#xD;
      baseline data collection on their current ONS, patients switch to the test ONS, which is&#xD;
      taken for a further 8 consecutive days. Patients revert to their current ONS at the end of&#xD;
      the study. Patients act as their own controls and thus all patients are allocated the same&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Patient tolerance and acceptability is fundamental to the successful use of an&#xD;
      ONS. Acceptability and tolerance studies for ONS are required by the Advisory Committee on&#xD;
      Borderline Substances (ACBS) as part of a submission for a new product to be made available&#xD;
      at NHS expense in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks and Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks: There are no anticipated risks to participants. Participants will already be&#xD;
      taking other ONS as this is one of the inclusion criteria. Minimal inconvenience to&#xD;
      participants is anticipated as they will be asked to complete a questionnaire on the&#xD;
      product's acceptability. Daily records on the GI tolerance of the product will be recorded by&#xD;
      participants or nursing staff. Most of the study documentation will be completed by the study&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits: Participants may gain weight or maintain their weight during the&#xD;
      intervention. In the future, if this product becomes available on prescription, a wider&#xD;
      variety of ONS available to patients may lessen taste fatigue associated with taking the same&#xD;
      supplements over an extended period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objective: The primary objective of the study is to assess gastrointestinal&#xD;
      (GI) tolerance (bowel frequency and consistency using the Bristol Stool Chart, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, abdominal discomfort, wind, burping, flatulence) to a Test Oral Nutrition&#xD;
      Supplement (EnergieShake® 1.5 kcal Complete, a nutritional supplement, classified as a Food&#xD;
      for Special Medical Purposes for the dietary management of disease-related malnutrition) in&#xD;
      patients requiring ONS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study objective: The secondary objective is to assess acceptability of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label, prospective, controlled intervention in which participants act&#xD;
      as their own controls. Guidance from ACBS requires that acceptability and tolerance studies&#xD;
      must normally be carried out on at least 18 patients in the intended target group for a&#xD;
      period of 1 week. The design of this study has been based on the guidance provided by ACBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies for Recruitment and Retention: Potentially suitable participants will be&#xD;
      identified by staff at the site. Participants who may be suitable are those who are currently&#xD;
      taking ONS and whose requirement for ONS is expected to continue for at least a further 2&#xD;
      weeks. They will be approached by staff at the site and provided with a Participant&#xD;
      Information Sheet and letter of invitation from the sponsor (Anaiah Healthcare Ltd). To&#xD;
      ensure this process is free from undue influence, residents will not be coerced or offered&#xD;
      inducements to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for Withdrawal: Participants will have the choice of whether or not to withdraw from&#xD;
      the study at any stage for any reason. Should the participant experience any adverse event or&#xD;
      discomfort due to consuming the product, the participant will be advised to stop using the&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of Subject Withdrawals or Subject Discontinuation of Study Intervention If the&#xD;
      participant discontinues the study before the intervention is complete, their permission will&#xD;
      be sought to use the data collected on the use of the product. A replacement of a participant&#xD;
      who withdraws will be recruited to meet the requirement target that at least 18 patients&#xD;
      provide data on the test ONS.&#xD;
