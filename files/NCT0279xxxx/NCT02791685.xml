  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if a remote cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      program delivered via a smartphone application and regular telephone calls will lead to&#xD;
      improved delivery of cardiac rehabilitation compared to usual care. This includes increased&#xD;
      adherence for eligible veterans, increased program completion, improved patient outcomes as&#xD;
      measured by functional capacity, improved patient compliance in monitoring symptoms, improved&#xD;
      self-efficacy and knowledge in managing disease and, a decreased rate of hospitalization and&#xD;
      re-admissions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to determine if a smartphone-delivered cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program&#xD;
      could show similar clinical outcomes to in-person programs at a low cost in a large&#xD;
      population of patients. Investigators will also assess the feasibility of tailoring a virtual&#xD;
      CR program to a small sample of COPD participants who also stand to benefit in the absence of&#xD;
      an established pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized clinical trial of participants at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs&#xD;
      Medical Center with an applicable diagnosis for cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation versus&#xD;
      usual care during the study period. We will evaluate the outcomes related to&#xD;
      smartphone-enabled home base cardiopulmonary rehabilitation in those who choose the&#xD;
      intervention and those who opt into home-based CR, traditional CR, or those who decline. Data&#xD;
      from the past 5 years will also be evaluated to obtain a baseline event rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators seek to address the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether a home-based cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program delivered&#xD;
           through smartphones is feasible and improves functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if education and lifestyle counseling lead to increased adherence with&#xD;
           prescribed follow-up, pharmacotherapy, quality of life, self-efficacy and lifestyle&#xD;
           changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if a home-based cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program reduces health&#xD;
           system utilization, including ED visits and readmission rates.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test (6MWT) measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The individual is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure is measured using a blood pressure cuff to the upper extremity. The top number, which is also the higher of the two numbers, measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats (systolic).The bottom number, which is also the lower of the two numbers, measures the pressure in the arteries between heartbeats (diastolic). Readings are measured as follows:&#xD;
Normal = systolic less than 120 and diastolic less than 80 Prehypertension = systolic 120 - 139 or diastolic 80 - 89 High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) Stage 1 = systolic 140 - 159 or diastolic 90 - 99 High Blood Pressure(Hypertension) Stage 2 = systolic 160 or higher or diastolic 100 or higher Hypertensive Crisis (Emergency care needed) systolic = higher than 180 or diastolic higher than 110</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in A1c Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The A1C test is a blood test that provides information about a person's average levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar, over the past 3 months.&#xD;
Levels are measured as follows:&#xD;
Normal = below 5.7 percent Diabetes = 6.5 percent or above Prediabetes = 5.7 to 6.4 percent</description>

    <description>LDL cholesterol is considered &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol because it contributes to plaque, a thick, hard deposit that can clog arteries and make them less flexible.&#xD;
Levels are measured as follows:&#xD;
&lt; 100 mg/ dL = Optimal 100-129 mg/dL = Near optimal/above optimal 130-159 mg/dL = Borderline high 160-189 mg/dL = High &gt;190 mg/dL = Very high</description>

    <measure>Change in Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) is a 12-item questionnaire that utilizes self-reported physical work capacity to estimate peak metabolic equivalents. The DASI is scored by adding all activities performed together. A higher score indicates the ability to perform more physical activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

Score ranges from 5-9 indicate minimal depressive symptoms. Scores 10-14 may indicate minor depression, dysthymia, and mild major depression. Scores 15-19 indicate moderately severe, major depression. Scores greater than or equal to 20 indicate severe major depression.</description>
