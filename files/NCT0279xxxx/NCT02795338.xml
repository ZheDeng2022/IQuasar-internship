  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is unknown whether imaging technologies have broad applications in brain mapping due to&#xD;
      limited knowledge of the value of the results. Accurate identification of areas of eloquent&#xD;
      brain function is vital to surgical decision making and to preservation of independence as&#xD;
      patients with brain tumors who are higher functioning have better survival outcomes. Imaging&#xD;
      technology has evolved to provide multiple non-invasive modalities for pre-operative testing&#xD;
      of eloquent brain function and include functional MRI (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography&#xD;
      (MEG). Eloquent brain is defined as a region controlling language, motor, or sensory function&#xD;
      such that without its proper input, a person would be left with significant neurologic&#xD;
      deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies conducted by our group and others have shown that these non-invasive mapping&#xD;
      modalities provide useful information, however, the information provided inconsistently&#xD;
      predicts distribution of eloquent function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct electrical stimulation (DES) at the time of surgery allows assessment of eloquent&#xD;
      function directly from the brain surface (invasive) and is considered the gold standard in&#xD;
      brain mapping. Therefore, in order to determine the true clinical applicability of the&#xD;
      non-invasive mapping technologies, we propose to: (1) assess the predictive value of fMRI and&#xD;
      MEG for sensorimotor and language functions by comparing their results to DES and (2)&#xD;
      determine whether fMRI or MEG provides the most consistent and accurate information. We will&#xD;
      accomplish these Aims by co-registering all mapping data (invasive and non-invasive) in a&#xD;
      modifiable 3D rendering. In this way, we can evaluate the DES to fMRI and MEG as well as&#xD;
      compare fMRI to MEG. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the&#xD;
      reliability of our current technology will allow us to perform safer surgeries and to&#xD;
      preserve neurologic function. The expected outcomes for the work proposed in Aims 1 and 2 are&#xD;
      identification of a predictive value for fMRI and MEG and determination if one modality&#xD;
      should be utilized over the other pre-operatively for the most accurate information. The&#xD;
      results of this study are expected to have an important positive impact because&#xD;
      identification of accurate pre-operative non-invasive mapping modalities will allow tailored&#xD;
      testing and possibly lead to negation of the need for intra-operative mapping in certain&#xD;
      cases. It will also enhance patient outcomes by improving patient safety. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      will serve as the basis for a multi-institutional mapping data bank.&#xD;
