  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open randomized controlled trial, we seek to study whether prostate cancer screening&#xD;
      using multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) improves the detection rate&#xD;
      of clinically-significant prostate cancer (defined as Gleason score ≥7 on prostate biopsy)&#xD;
      compared with prostate cancer screening using prostate-specific antigen (PSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current paradigm of prostate cancer screening relies upon an initial PSA blood test, with&#xD;
      subsequent investigations driven by the serum PSA level. This model has proven highly&#xD;
      controversial due to the inability of PSA level to discern between indolent and aggressive&#xD;
      forms of prostate cancer. As a result, numerous government-sponsored bodies have recommended&#xD;
      against PSA screening. Evidence suggests that prostate cancer screening has led to an&#xD;
      increased proportion of men being diagnosed with potentially curable prostate cancer.&#xD;
      However, due to the inability of the PSA level to accurately distinguish patients with&#xD;
      indolent and lethal forms of prostate cancer, it has led to a significant rate of&#xD;
      over-diagnosis of indolent disease. Magnetic resonance imaging has been gaining an&#xD;
      increasingly large role in the management of patients with clinically-localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer including diagnosis in patients with abnormal PSA levels, monitoring of patients on&#xD;
      active surveillance and staging prior to definitive interventions. MRI-based prostate cancer&#xD;
      risk assessment has been shown to better distinguish between clinically-significant and&#xD;
      insignificant tumors than PSA test. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial of MRI-based&#xD;
      prostate cancer screening and PSA-based prostate cancer screening is warranted.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy and the third leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death among men in Canada1. In 1987, prostate specific antigen was introduced for&#xD;
      prostate cancer screening2. Widespread adoption of PSA screening resulted in a significantly&#xD;
      increased number of incident cases and a significantly reduced number of cases of metastatic&#xD;
      disease at presentation3. Coinciding with the introduction of PSA testing, prostate cancer&#xD;
      mortality has decreased approximately 40% from an epidemiologic perspective4. Approximately&#xD;
      45-70% of the decline in mortality is attributable to PSA-based prostate cancer screening5.&#xD;
      Several studies have examined whether screening for prostate cancer using the PSA test&#xD;
      improves overall and prostate cancer mortality. In particular, two large randomized studies&#xD;
      in the U.S. and Europe have been conducted to evaluate this. Recently, the U.S. Preventative&#xD;
      Services Task Force (USPSTF) reviewed these and all studies to evaluate whether PSA should be&#xD;
      used as a screening test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Recommendations for PSA Screening from the USPSTF&#xD;
&#xD;
      The USPSTF makes recommendations regarding the effectiveness of screening tests for&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients after assessing the evidence regarding benefits and harms of an&#xD;
      intervention. The most recent USPSTF guidelines regarding prostate cancer were published in&#xD;
      20126.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first component of the USPSTF assessment is an evaluation of the benefits of early&#xD;
      detection and treatment of prostate cancer. The review panel drew on two large randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials which have been conducted to assess the effect of PSA-based prostate cancer&#xD;
      screening on prostate cancer mortality: the European Randomized Study of Screening for&#xD;
      Prostate Cancer (ERSPC)7 and the U.S.-based Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO)&#xD;
      Cancer Screening Trial8. In their recommendation the guideline panel do not consider&#xD;
      significant differences between the trials, in large part due to the fact that PSA had been&#xD;
      widely adopted in the US during the study interval while it did not have such uptake in&#xD;
      Europe. As a result, there are concerns that the trial did not compare screening to no&#xD;
      screening and that the trial would be unlikely to find a benefit even if a significant one&#xD;
      existed9. Regardless, the panel concluded that prostate cancer screening resulted in the&#xD;
      avoidance of 0 to 1 prostate cancer deaths per 1000 men screened6, a minimal benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second component of the guideline panel's assessment focused on potential harms of early&#xD;
      detection and treatment. They found evidence of significant harm due to false-positive PSA&#xD;
      results which confer a risk of psychological harm in addition to medical evaluation including&#xD;
      biopsy6. Further, they considered there to be, at minimum, a small harm associated with&#xD;
      prostate biopsy due to pain, bleeding and infectious risk. The panel also concluded that&#xD;
      there was significant evidence of at least moderate overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment&#xD;
      among patients undergoing PSA-based screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to a perceived lack of benefit and presence of significant harms, the USPSTF concluded,&#xD;
      with moderate certainty, that the benefit of PSA-based screening did not outweigh the harms&#xD;
      and thus recommended against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major limitation of this task force was that they received no input from experts in&#xD;
      prostate cancer in order to minimize bias. While this may improve the objectivity of the&#xD;
      review, many aspects of understanding prostate cancer were lost. In response to these&#xD;
      recommendations, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) - the largest oncology&#xD;
      association in North America, developed a consensus statement to address the USPSTF&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASCO Provisional Clinical Opinion in Prostate Cancer Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASCO provisional clinical opinion on prostate cancer screening using PSA-testing was&#xD;
      based on an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality systematic review10. Despite drawing&#xD;
      on the same data as the USPSTF, this panel concluded that men with a longer life expectancy&#xD;
      (greater than 10 years) may benefit from prostate cancer screening using PSA-testing11. In&#xD;
      men with a shorter life expectancy, PSA testing was discouraged. Unlike the USPSTF, the ASCO&#xD;
      panel placed greater weight on the results of the ERSPC, demonstrating a significant&#xD;
      reduction in the risk of prostate cancer death for men undergoing prostate cancer screening.&#xD;
      They noted similar harms as the USPSTF, namely false-positive results and prostate biopsy&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the publication of this opinion, further data has become available which indicates that&#xD;
      the relative reduction in prostate cancer death from PSA-based screening may be larger than&#xD;
      previously estimated. The most mature data from the ERSPC has 13 years of follow up12. Based&#xD;
      on these data, the absolute risk reduction in prostate cancer mortality from PSA screening&#xD;
      was 0.11 per 1000 person years or 1.28 per 1000 men randomized. This risk reduction has&#xD;
      increased with increasing duration of follow up. Additional analysis has shown an absolute&#xD;
      risk reduction of metastatic disease was 3.1 per 1000 men randomized13. In a subgroup of the&#xD;
      ERSPC with longer follow-up, the absolute risk reduction in prostate cancer mortality was 4.0&#xD;
      per 1000 men randomized14. This corresponds to a number needed to screen of 293 and number&#xD;
      needed to diagnose of 12 in order to prevent one prostate cancer death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Underdiagnosis of Prostate Cancer with PSA&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to harms of biopsy and intervention, the primary concern regarding PSA-based&#xD;
      prostate cancer screening is the inability to distinguish between patients with indolent and&#xD;
      aggressive forms of the disease. Prostate cancer screening programs have traditionally used a&#xD;
      serum PSA cut-off of 4.0 ng/mL to indicate abnormality. However, many men with PSA values in&#xD;
      excess of 4.0 ng/mL do not have prostate cancer, and even fewer have clinically significant&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Further, up to 25% of men with PSA levels less than 4.0 ng/mL will be found&#xD;
      to have high-grade prostate cancer, if subject to biopsy15. Thus PSA-based prostate cancer&#xD;
      screening lacks both sensitivity and specificity to identify men with aggressive prostate&#xD;
      cancer. As a result, in addition to significant overdiagnosis and overtreatment which has&#xD;
      been well recognized, there is a risk for underdiagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the USPSTF recommendations against PSA-based prostate cancer screening, there has been&#xD;
      a significant decrease in PSA testing being performed by primary care physicians16. It is&#xD;
      predicted that complete discontinuation of PSA-based screening would result in the prevention&#xD;
      of overdiagnosis for 710,000 to 1,120,000 men in the United States over a 12 year period17.&#xD;
      However, it would result in 36,000 to 57,000 preventable deaths due to prostate cancer over&#xD;
      the same time period. Thus, improved methods for prostate cancer screening may allow for a&#xD;
      diminishment in overdiagnosis while avoiding preventable deaths from prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of The Prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has an increasingly large role in&#xD;
      the management of patients with clinically-localized prostate cancer. MpMRI was initially&#xD;
      used as a staging test in patients with prostate cancer18. Despite the use of what would now&#xD;
      be considered obsolete technologies, Bezzi et al. demonstrated in 1988 that MRI could&#xD;
      identify nodal metastases with an accuracy of 88% and could distinguish disease localized to&#xD;
      the prostate from that invading beyond the capsule with an accuracy of 78% among patients&#xD;
      undergoing prostatectomy18. Since that time, there has been a migration in the use of MRI&#xD;
      earlier in the disease process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the realm of prostate cancer treatment, MRI is used for the monitoring of patients on&#xD;
      active surveillance following a prostate cancer diagnosis as a means of reducing prostate&#xD;
      biopsies, with their incumbent risks19,20. When performed in the evaluation of patients with&#xD;
      elevated PSA levels with previous negative prostate biopsy, mpMRI has been shown to identify&#xD;
      clinically significant prostate cancers which would have been otherwise missed by routine&#xD;
      systematic biopsy21. The use of MRI and ultrasound fusion imaging in the targeting of&#xD;
      prostate biopsy has increased detection of clinically significant prostate cancer while&#xD;
      limiting the diagnosis of clinically insignificant prostate cancer22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among men with an abnormal PSA who have never undergone a prostate biopsy, mpMRI demonstrated&#xD;
      promise in both the detection and exclusion of prostate cancer, using an extensive prostate&#xD;
      mapping biopsy (median 41 cores) as the referent23: the AUC was 0.27 (95% CI 0.65-0.79). In a&#xD;
      multivariable analysis of an independent cohort including age, family history, prior 5-alpha&#xD;
      reductase inhibitor use, digital rectal examination findings, PSA level, PSA density, and MRI&#xD;
      score, only MRI score was predictive of clinically significant (Gleason score ≥7) prostate&#xD;
      cancer among men without a history of previous prostate biopsy (adjusted OR 40.2, p=0.01)24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While historically prostate MRI has required the use of an endorectal coil25, recent advances&#xD;
      in MRI technology have obviated the need for the coil26, thus reducing the cost and burden of&#xD;
      the imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Study to Examining the Feasibility of MRI Prostate Cancer Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently conducted a pilot study assessing the feasibility of mpMRI as an initial prostate&#xD;
      cancer screening test27. Following a newspaper based call for volunteers, we had 319 men&#xD;
      present for possible inclusion in this study. Of these, 120 were eligible, 50 were enrolled&#xD;
      due to limitations in funding, and 47 completed the study protocol. Serum PSA testing, mpMRI,&#xD;
      digital rectal examination, and systematic (+/- targeted) prostate biopsies were performed on&#xD;
      all men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer was identified in 18 of 47 men (38.3%). MpMRI (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.94)&#xD;
      significantly outperformed PSA (AUC 0.67, 95% CI 0.52-0.84) in the prediction of prostate&#xD;
      cancer. In multivariable analyses including age, digital rectal examination findings, PSA and&#xD;
      MRI score, mpMRI was the only significant predictor for the presence of prostate cancer&#xD;
      (adjusted OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.4). These findings persisted when we sought to predict only&#xD;
      clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason ≥7; adjusted OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.5-8.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better evaluate the use of mpMRI in prostate, a large, randomized study comparing the&#xD;
      efficacy of mpMRI in diagnosing clinically significant, aggressive prostate cancer, compared&#xD;
      to conventional PSA screening will be required.&#xD;
