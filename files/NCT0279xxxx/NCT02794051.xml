  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study fills a notable gap in the transdiagnostic literature by evaluating whether an&#xD;
      evidence-based transdiagnostic treatment for emotional disorders such as the Unified Protocol&#xD;
      for Children (UP-C) is effective for treating childhood behavior problems.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By participating in the study, child participants will learn emotion regulation skills and&#xD;
      have opportunities to interact and practice skills with other children who have similar&#xD;
      problems. In addition, parent participants will learn effective parenting skills, including&#xD;
      appropriate limit-setting, use of praise and consequences, and empathy, that may help them&#xD;
      effectively navigate the challenges of caring for a child with behavior concerns (1). Parents&#xD;
      will also have the opportunity to interact with other parents who face similar challenges,&#xD;
      providing validation and support. Upon completion of the study, investigators plan to share&#xD;
      these findings at professional conferences and submit manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;
      Collectively, this study will add to the literature in the pediatric mental health field and&#xD;
      may also serve as a model for other outpatient clinics regarding implementation and provision&#xD;
      of a transdiagnostic approach to treat children with behavior problems. Thus, the main goals&#xD;
      of the current study are to examine the effectiveness of the UP-C group treatment in reducing&#xD;
      childhood behavior problems, evaluate parents' satisfaction with this treatment, and&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of implementing this treatment in a pediatric outpatient setting.&#xD;
