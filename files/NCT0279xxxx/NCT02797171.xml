    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of&#xD;
      VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) and VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS) in the serum and mucosa of&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate two experimental human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs):&#xD;
      VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) and VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS). VRC01LS is designed to have a&#xD;
      longer half-life than VRC01. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of VRC01 and VRC01LS in the serum and mucosa of&#xD;
      healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adults into five groups. At various time&#xD;
      points during the study, participants in Groups 1, 2, and 4 will receive intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusions of VRC01, and participants in Groups 3 and 5 will receive IV infusions of VRC01LS.&#xD;
      Participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3 will attend 13 to 14 study visits over about 1 to 1 ½&#xD;
      years; participants in Groups 4 and 5 will attend 7 to 9 study visits over about 6 months to&#xD;
      1 year. At certain time points, study visits will include physical examinations, blood&#xD;
      collection, urine collection, and interviews and questionnaires. At other time points,&#xD;
      depending on group assignment and gender, visits will also include collection of&#xD;
      cervicovaginal secretions, rectal secretions, and semen; and cervical, vaginal, and rectal&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;

        <description>Outcome measure will not be ready before the anticipated reporting date. VRC01/LS levels were measured by Singulex assay. VRC01/LS levels of study samples are calibrated via the respective standard curve on each assay plate. A five-parameter logistic (5PL) model is used to fit the standard curve data using the nCal package in R. Outcome measure is the estimated concentration of VRC01/VRC01LS.</description>
