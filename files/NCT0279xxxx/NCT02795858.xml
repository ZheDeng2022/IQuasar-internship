      This research study is evaluating the drug Ramucirumab as a possible treatment for Advanced,&#xD;
      Progressive Carcinoid Tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to test the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of ramucirumab in advanced, progressive carcinoid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer cells can make growth factors that cause the abnormal growth of new blood vessels.&#xD;
      Ramucirumab is an investigational drug which works by blocking a receptor for a vascular&#xD;
      growth factor, thereby preventing new blood vessels from forming. This may stop the cancer&#xD;
      from growing or spreading and the tumor cells may die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ramucirumab for treatment of&#xD;
      Carcinoid Tumors.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed low- to&#xD;
             intermediate-grade neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Carcinoid tumors of any site are eligible. Patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine&#xD;
             tumors are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See&#xD;
             Section 10 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have evidence of radiographic disease progression within the past 12&#xD;
             months. Progressive disease by RECIST criteria is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/ mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000/ mm3&#xD;

               -  creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  urinary protein ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (if urine dipstick or&#xD;
                  routine urinalysis is 2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate&#xD;
                  &lt;1000 mg of protein in 24 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  coagulation function Adequate coagulation function as defined by International&#xD;
                  Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.5 x&#xD;
                  institutional upper limit of normal. Patients on full-dose anticoagulation must&#xD;
                  be on a stable dose (minimum duration 14 days) of oral anticoagulant or low&#xD;
                  molecular weight heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The effects of ramucirumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
                  reason and because anti-antiangiogenic agents are known to be teratogenic, women&#xD;
                  of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry&#xD;
                  and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
                  suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;
                  she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on&#xD;
                  this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study,&#xD;
                  for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of&#xD;
                  Ramucirumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone major surgery within 28 days or subcutaneous venous access&#xD;
             device placement within 7 days prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with elective or planned major surgery to be performed during the course of&#xD;
             the clinical trial.&#xD;

             significant thromboembolism (venous port or catheter thrombosis or superficial venous&#xD;
             thrombosis are not considered &quot;significant&quot;) during the 3 months prior to&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have experienced any arterial thromboembolic events, including but not&#xD;
             limited to myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled or poorly-controlled hypertension (&gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), sustained&#xD;
             ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, clinically significant bradycardia,&#xD;
             advanced heart block within the six months preceding enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have cirrhosis at a level of Child-Pugh B (or worse) or cirrhosis (any&#xD;
             degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically meaningful ascites&#xD;

             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, naproxen, and others),&#xD;
             dipyridamole or clopidogrel, or similar agents. Once-daily aspirin use (maximum dose&#xD;
             325 mg/day) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who&#xD;
             continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior or concurrent malignancy except for the following: adequately&#xD;
             treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or other adequately treated in situ&#xD;
             cancer, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other&#xD;
             conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severely impaired lung function&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled infection/ disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Nonmalignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be&#xD;
                  jeopardized by the treatment with the study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
                  requirement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ramucirumab .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because ramucirumab is&#xD;
             associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with ramucirumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with ramucirumab. These potential risks may also apply to other&#xD;
             agents used in this study.&#xD;
