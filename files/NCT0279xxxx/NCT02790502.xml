  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, about one-third of edible food is lost or wasted 1. Wasted food depletes resources&#xD;
      used to produce the food (as a matter of definition, &quot;produce&quot; includes all activities to&#xD;
      distribute, package and prepare food for human consumption at any venue, but does not include&#xD;
      growing, transporting and processing), deprives hungry people from needed nutrition and&#xD;
      represents the most common (&gt;20%) and most environmentally deleterious component (in terms of&#xD;
      greenhouse gas) of US landfills3-6. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and&#xD;
      Development (OECD) identified reducing FW as a key to increasing global food security (OECD&#xD;
      2011) 7. The Obama Administration recently announced a first ever FW reduction goal for the&#xD;
      United States of 50% by 2030. USDA and EPA will pursue this goal via partnerships with the&#xD;
      private sector, charitable and faith-based organizations, as well as state, local and tribal&#xD;
      governments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developed economies, consumers are the largest source of FW via home preparation and&#xD;
      dining out2, 8. In order to achieve FW goals, we must anticipate how consumer FW generation&#xD;
      and handling decisions will respond to proposed policies and interventions. However, there&#xD;
      exist substantial barriers to measuring consumer FW: existing methods have high respondent&#xD;
      burden and yield biased measurements of FW generation9-11. In this project we will test a&#xD;
      smartphone application (app) for measuring household FW.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to pilot test the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) and&#xD;
      SmartIntake smartphone app as an approach for measuring food waste in controlled and&#xD;
      free-living environments. The RFPM and SmartIntakeTM app constitutes a distinct improvement&#xD;
      over self-report FI methods, such as pen-and-paper surveys and dietary recall methods that&#xD;
      rely on subjects' ability to accurately recall the types and portion sizes of foods consumed.&#xD;
      After training, people use the SmartIntakeTM app to capture images of their foods both before&#xD;
      and after each eating occasion. Photos are automatically uploaded from the user's smartphone&#xD;
      to a secure server at Pennington Biomedical. The images are analyzed to quantify food&#xD;
      selection, food waste, and food intake using validated methods and a computer program (the&#xD;
      Food Photography Application©) built by Pennington Biomedical. The method has been found to&#xD;
      accurately quantify food selection, food waste, and food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, the RFPM and SmartIntakeTM app eliminate one of the largest sources of error&#xD;
      associated with self-report methods - subjects' inability to accurately estimate portion&#xD;
      size, which accounts for ~50% of the error in self-report methods11, 13-15. FI estimation&#xD;
      studies have observed that overweight subjects react to monitoring by underestimating the&#xD;
      self-reported amounts of FI or eat less when monitored16, 17. Similarly, FW behavioral&#xD;
      studies have observed that subjects start self-reporting smaller amounts of FW, however it is&#xD;
      not clear if this is the result of increased awareness and less generation, or if it due to&#xD;
      not appearing as wasteful individuals18. However, people respond less to the RFPM/SmartIntake&#xD;
      app and experiment results show that the underestimation from RFPM does not vary with energy&#xD;
      intake level12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many shortcomings that plague FI measurement likely hamper FW measurement. Biases in the&#xD;
      opposite direction (e.g., cleaning your plate to show less FW) likely emerge when measuring&#xD;
      FW and may be similarly mitigated with the proposed app. We believe using RFPM and&#xD;
      SmartIntakeTM app as the base for a FW estimation app holds great promise to transform FW&#xD;
      measurement. First, we note that FW associated with dining situations (i.e., plate waste) is&#xD;
      directly estimated by the RFPM, hence only a simple transform of current outputs is required.&#xD;
      To fully adapt RFPM for FW measurement, the procedures will be modified to estimate FW&#xD;
      created during food preparation and during stored food purges (e.g., cleaning the fridge).&#xD;
      The RFPM method already works in dine-out settings, which are currently omitted by some&#xD;
      existing FW measurement methods. Additional functionality, such as estimating edible vs&#xD;
      inedible FW (and hence calories wasted), estimating waste rate among food categories, and&#xD;
      estimating rates of diversion from landfills, will also be explored so that multiple policy&#xD;
      relevant metrics can be instantly calculated and stored.&#xD;
