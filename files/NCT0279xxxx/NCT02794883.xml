      The main purpose of this trial is to investigate the effects of a new class of drugs that&#xD;
      help the patient's immune system attack their tumor (glioblastoma multiforme - GBM). These&#xD;
      drugs have already shown benefit in some other cancer types and are now being explored in&#xD;
      GBM. Both tremelimumab and durvalumab (MEDI4736) are &quot;investigational&quot; drugs, which means&#xD;
      that the drugs are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Both drugs are&#xD;
      antibodies (proteins used by the immune system to fight infections and cancers). Durvalumab&#xD;
      attaches to a protein in tumors called PD-L1. It may prevent cancer growth by helping certain&#xD;
      blood cells of the immune system get rid of the tumor. Tremelimumab stimulates (wakes up) the&#xD;
      immune system to attack the tumor by inhibiting a protein molecule called CTLA-4 on immune&#xD;
      cells. Combining the actions of these drugs may result in better treatment options for&#xD;
      patients with glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the T-cell changes that occur in glioblastoma (GBM) treated with tremelimumab&#xD;
      and durvalumab (MEDI4736) as single agents and in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of either tremelimumab or MEDI4736 alone and in combination in&#xD;
      patients with GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the time to progression for patients treated with either tremelimumab or&#xD;
      MEDI4736 alone and in combination of both, post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the overall survival for patients treated with tremelimumab or MEDI4736&#xD;
      alone and in combination of both post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in patients treated with either&#xD;
      tremelimumab or MEDI4736 alone and in combination of both post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate T-cell changes and programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) expression with patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 2&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 3: Patients receive tremelimumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 then, after a gap of 1 hour for&#xD;
      the first cycle, durvalumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks&#xD;
      with tremelimumab for up to 7 courses and every 2 weeks with durvalumab for up to 14 courses.&#xD;
      Patients then receive both tremelimumab and durvalumab IV over 1 hour every 12 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergo surgical tumor resection on day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8-16 weeks for 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a grade III or IV glioma that has progressed after standard&#xD;
             radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) (Note: Pathology will need to be reviewed&#xD;
             locally but registration can occur based on pathology report)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had radiographic evidence of tumor progression by brain MRI or&#xD;
             computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be &gt; 12 weeks from completion of radiation therapy unless there is&#xD;
             tissue confirmation of tumor recurrence or there is progression outside the radiation&#xD;
             treatment field&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with gamma knife or other focal high-dose radiotherapy is allowed, but&#xD;
             the patient must have subsequent histologic documentation of recurrence, unless the&#xD;

          -  Patients must have had no more than 3 prior lines of chemotherapy; this includes the&#xD;
             initial treatment and two relapses; concurrent and adjuvant TMZ-based chemotherapy,&#xD;
             including the combination of TMZ with another agent, is considered one line of&#xD;
             chemotherapy; for clarification, please contact the principle investigator (PI), Dr.&#xD;
