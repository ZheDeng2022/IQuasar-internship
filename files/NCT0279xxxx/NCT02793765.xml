    <textblock>
      This clinical study will evaluate the role of combination therapy of docetaxel followed by&#xD;
      Provenge for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC, (prostate&#xD;
      cancer that is resistant to medical or surgical treatments that lower testosterone). The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to look at the combination therapy of docetaxel followed by Provenge&#xD;
      to correlate the immunological biomarkers with clinical results for therapy. Biomarkers are&#xD;
      genes, proteins and other molecules that affect how cancer cells grow, multiply, die and&#xD;
      respond to other compounds in the body. The study drugs are approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Patients will receive 6 cycles of&#xD;
      docetaxel followed by Provenge. Docetaxel is an antineoplastic (chemotherapy that affects&#xD;
      cancer cell growth) agent. Docetaxel dose of 75 mg/m2 will be given intravenously as a 1-hour&#xD;
      infusion every 21 days on Day 1 for 6 cycles. Provenge is an immunotherapy (vaccine made from&#xD;
      patient's own blood cells) that reprograms immune cells to attack cancer. A course of therapy&#xD;
      consists of three doses of Provenge administered at 2-week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategy aims to determine whether cytokine production and T cell infiltration of tumor&#xD;
      cells could favor regression using a combination of chemotherapy plus vaccine. Tissue&#xD;
      endpoints will include biopsies prior to first chemotherapy and first vaccine therapy and at&#xD;
      the end of each therapy. Prostate cancer tissue infiltrates will be studied for expression of&#xD;
      CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25/FOX3P, CD56, CTLA-4, PD-1, and Ki67. Additional immunological endpoints&#xD;
      will be secondary antigen spread and various cytokine biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) develops serial treatment resistance and is&#xD;
      considered incurable. It is a largely indolent disease, which would give the body time to&#xD;
      mount an effective immune response. CRPC is therefore potentially well suited for vaccine&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent belonging to the taxoid family. The FDA-approved course&#xD;
      of therapy for prostate cancer consists of 75 mg/m2 docetaxel given intravenously as a 1-hour&#xD;
      infusion every 21 days on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sipuleucel-T (Provenge), is an FDA-approved cancer vaccine therapy manufactured by culturing&#xD;
      an individual's own freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including&#xD;
      antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells, with a fusion protein (PA-2024) composed of&#xD;
      prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) linked to granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor&#xD;
      (GM-CSF). A course of therapy consists of three doses of Provenge administered at 2-week&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label phase II study in taxane-naïve patients with metastatic CRPC of&#xD;
      docetaxel followed by Provenge. Adult (age &gt;18 years) men with metastatic CRPC.&#xD;
      pathologically-confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with clinical or radiologic evidence&#xD;
      of metastatic disease that has progressed despite treatment with anti-androgens, inhibitors&#xD;
      of adrenal-produced androgens (abiraterone), or androgen receptor inhibitors (enzalutamide),&#xD;
      and who, prior to study entry are candidates to receive Standard of Care chemotherapy (e.g.,&#xD;
      docetaxel/prednisone) or immunotherapy (Provenge), will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit a total of 32 patients with metastatic CRPC. Patients will receive 6&#xD;
      cycles of docetaxel followed by Provenge. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis. Patients must meet one of the following prognostic criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSA doubling time ≤6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt;10 bone lesions (only if they meet PSA doubling time criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visceral metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone and lymph node lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the immunological biomarkers during&#xD;
      therapy and correlate the immunological biomarkers with clinical outcome. The strategy aims&#xD;
      to determine whether cytokine production and T cell infiltration of tumor cells could favor&#xD;
      regression using a combination of chemotherapy plus vaccine. Tissue endpoints will include&#xD;
      biopsies prior to chemotherapy, on day 14 during the rest period between therapies and after&#xD;
      vaccine therapy. Prostate cancer tissue infiltrates will be studied for expression of CD3,&#xD;
      CD4, CD8, CD25/FOX3P, CD56, CTLA-4, PD-1, and Ki67. Additional immunological endpoints will&#xD;
      be secondary antigen spread and various cytokine biomarkers.&#xD;
