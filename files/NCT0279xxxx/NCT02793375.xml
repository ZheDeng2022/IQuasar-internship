      Objective: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative&#xD;
      Montelukast as an analgesic for adenotonsillectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized controlled double blinded clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Division of Pediatric&#xD;
      Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Children between the age of 3-8 undergoing adenotonsillectomy with planned 23 hour&#xD;
      observation for adenotonsillar hypertrophy and sleep disordered breathing will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive either montelukast or placebo in Same Day surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Differences in demographics (age, gender, race, weight) between the intervention&#xD;
      and control groups will be assessed using chi-square (for categorical measures) and t tests&#xD;
      (for continuous measures). Differences in postoperative opioid usage, postoperative pain&#xD;
      scores using the FLACC scale, and the number of postoperative contacts (Emergency department&#xD;
      visits or phone calls) with patients or their family regarding pain or tonsillar hemorrhage&#xD;
      will be evaluated using chi-square (categorical measures) and t tests (continuous measures).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A) is the one of the most common pediatric procedures performed in the&#xD;
      United States, with over 530,000 procedures performed annually1. Pain control after T&amp;A is&#xD;
      essential for improving recovery and enhancing quality of life. At CCHMC, our current&#xD;
      protocol in patients over the age of three is to treat pain with scheduled Tylenol, ibuprofen&#xD;
      and steroids, as well as opioids (oxycodone) as a &quot;rescue&quot; medication for uncontrolled pain.&#xD;
      Despite this regimented approach, pain control is often suboptimal, and numerous doses of&#xD;
      opioids are often required. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist that&#xD;
      may have a role in decreasing post T&amp;A pain2. The primary objective of the present study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of montelukast on post-T&amp;A pain by measuring the amount of opioid pain&#xD;
      medication required postoperatively in patients receiving montelukast preoperatively compared&#xD;
      to those receiving placebo. The secondary objective will evaluate post-surgical outcomes and&#xD;
      include group comparisons of post T&amp;A pain scores and number of Emergency department visits&#xD;
      and/or phone calls for perioperative pain related complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1 Preoperative montelukast will decrease the amount of opioid pain mediation&#xD;
      required in the first 24 hours postoperatively compared to those in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2 Preoperative montelukast will decrease pain scores in the first 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery in patients undergoing T&amp;A compared to those in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis#3 Preoperative montelukast will decrease the number of postoperative contacts&#xD;
      (Emergency department visits and phone calls) by parents for pain related concerns in the&#xD;
      first 3-4 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
