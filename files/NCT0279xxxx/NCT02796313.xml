  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a randomized trial to test our DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)&#xD;
      based intervention in 370 adult American Indians with inadequately controlled systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (≥130 mmHg). Over the 5 years of the project, we will recruit and randomize 200&#xD;
      participants from each of 4 urban sites: two in Washington, one in Oklahoma, and one in South&#xD;
      Dakota.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants complete 3 data collection visits following an over-the-phone eligibility&#xD;
      screening call (baseline, week 8, and week 12). Participants will be randomized into either&#xD;
      the control group or the intervention group at the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive 8 weekly credits for groceries and will be given equipment for&#xD;
      monitoring their BP at home. Study staff will help participants place their grocery orders&#xD;
      each week, and will collect readings from the home BP monitoring equipment at the same time.&#xD;
      This data will be used to understand whether the intervention is effective for controlling&#xD;
      BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be encouraged to maintain their regular levels of physical activity and&#xD;
      receive treatment as usual from their healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group participants will receive an American Heart Association printed brochure&#xD;
      about the health benefits of a low-salt diet. All foods will be available to purchase,&#xD;
      including those that do not meet the DASH diet guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group participants will receive 1 hour of nutritional counseling over the&#xD;
      phone and a personalized prescription for the low-salt DASH diet based on estimated calorie&#xD;
      needs at baseline, followed by weekly 20-minute phone calls in weeks 1-8 to provide extra&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group's food choices will be limited to fresh produce and a pre-determined&#xD;
      list of other foods included in the DASH diet. During weekly phone calls, the dietitian will&#xD;
      use a structured phone curriculum to discuss in more detail a different component of the DASH&#xD;
      diet, followed by goal setting related to that component. Through small goal setting each&#xD;
      week, participants will receive ongoing support to improve full adherence to the DASH diet by&#xD;
      the end of week 8.&#xD;
