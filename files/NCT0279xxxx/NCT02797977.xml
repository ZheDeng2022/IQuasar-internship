    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to establish the safety profile, determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommend a Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of SRA737 in&#xD;
      combination with low dose gemcitabine; and to evaluate the efficacy of SRA737 in combination&#xD;
      with low dose gemcitabine in prospectively-selected subjects with genetically-defined tumors&#xD;
      that have predicted sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition based on factors including: genetic&#xD;
      profiling of tumor tissue or ctDNA, HPV status, and germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene status.&#xD;
      Specific cancer indications that frequently feature these factors will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical and clinical data support the hypothesis that active doses of SRA737 may be&#xD;
      strongly potentiated by sub-therapeutic doses of gemcitabine, which should lead to clinical&#xD;
      efficacy. To test this hypothesis, SRA737 in combination with low dose gemcitabine is being&#xD;
      explored in this study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SRA737 is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a&#xD;
      key regulator of cell cycle progression and the DNA Damage Response (DDR) replication stress&#xD;
      response. In cancer cells, intrinsic replication stress (RS) is induced by factors such as&#xD;
      oncogenes (e.g., CCNE1 or MYC), genetic mutations in DNA repair machinery (e.g., BRCA1 or&#xD;
      FA), genetic mutations leading to a dysregulated cell cycle (e.g., TP53 or RAD50) or other&#xD;
      genomic alterations. This replication stress results in persistent DNA damage and genomic&#xD;
      instability leading to an increased dependency on Chk1 for survival. Targeted inhibition of&#xD;
      Chk1 by SRA737 may therefore be synthetically lethal to cancer cells with elevated intrinsic&#xD;
      RS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The critical role of Chk1 in mediating cellular responses to RS affords the opportunity to&#xD;
      combine SRA737 with sub-therapeutic concentrations of the RS-inducing agent gemcitabine. Low&#xD;
      concentrations of gemcitabine cause a prolonged cell cycle S-phase and induce hallmarks of RS&#xD;
      without inducing overt cytotoxicity. Gemcitabine profoundly depletes DNA replication building&#xD;
      blocks and targets proliferating cells by inducing RS through induction of stalled&#xD;
      replication forks. In response, Chk1 has an important role in stabilizing and preserving&#xD;
      replication fork complexes in the context of RS, preventing catastrophic replication fork&#xD;
      collapse and double strand breaks. Extensive preclinical data, as well as clinical data,&#xD;
      support the synergistic interaction between Chk1 inhibition and gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical study is to: establish the safety profile, determine the MTD,&#xD;
      and propose a RP2D and schedule for SRA737 in combination with low dose gemcitabine. In&#xD;
      addition, the study aims to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of SRA737 in combination with&#xD;
      low dose gemcitabine in prospectively-selected subjects with tumors that have predicted&#xD;
      sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study consists of three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A Standard-Dose Triplet Combo Dose Escalation Phase 1. This phase, which has concluded,&#xD;
           evaluated a triplet combination of SRA737 with standard-dose gemcitabine and cisplatin&#xD;
           in subjects with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Low-Dose Gemcitabine Combo Dose Escalation Phase 1. Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects are&#xD;
           being given escalating doses of SRA737 on an intermittent schedule in addition to low&#xD;
           dose gemcitabine until the combination MTD is reached. The dose or frequency of&#xD;
           gemcitabine may also be reduced during this process and alternative dosing schedules for&#xD;
           SRA737 may be considered. When the MTD or a minimum efficacious dose range has been&#xD;
           achieved for SRA737, or when evidence of anti-tumor activity is observed, the&#xD;
           gemcitabine dose may be escalated with corresponding decreases in the SRA737 dose as&#xD;
           necessary for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A Low-Dose Gemcitabine Combo Cohort Expansion Phase 2. After the MTD and/or RP2D has&#xD;
           been identified, the trial will explore the preliminary efficacy of SRA737 plus low dose&#xD;
           gemcitabine in prospectively-selected subjects with tumors that harbor genomic&#xD;
           alterations linked to increased replication stress and that are hypothesized to be more&#xD;
           sensitive to Chk1 inhibition via synthetic lethality. Enrollment for expansion cohorts&#xD;
           may alternatively begin prior to the completion of dose escalation and determination of&#xD;
           MTD or RP2D, if there is evidence of anti-tumor activity or if the minimal plasma&#xD;
           concentration of SRA737 is maintained above a threshold at which sustained Chk1&#xD;
           inhibition is anticipated at 24 hours after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase is targeting enrollment of genetically-selected patients into four expansion&#xD;
      cohorts from specific indications that are predicted to have a high prevalence of such&#xD;
      alterations, including locally advanced or metastatic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  small cell lung cancer (SCLC);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  soft tissue sarcoma (STS); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cervical/anogenital cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To qualify for enrolment into these cohorts, the subject's tumor must have evidence of&#xD;
      predicted sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition based on factors including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For subjects with HGSOC, documented somatic or germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 wild-type status&#xD;
           will confer eligibility without requirement for prospective genetic profiling. If&#xD;
           documented BRCA status is not available, genetic profiling may be performed&#xD;
           prospectively to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with SCLC are eligible without requirement for prospective genetic profiling on&#xD;
           the basis of very high prevalence of cancer related alterations in the tumor suppressor&#xD;
           genes (eg, TP53 and RB1) in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For subjects with STS, and any others for whom genetic profiling is performed&#xD;
           prospectively, eligibility will be determined by the sponsor's review of genetic&#xD;
           abnormalities detected in genes in the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Key tumor suppressor genes regulating G1 cell cycle progression/arrest such as RB1,&#xD;
                TP53, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The DNA damage response pathway including ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, mismatch repair&#xD;
                genetic alterations and/or high microsatellite instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Genetic indicators of replicative stress such as gain of function/amplification of&#xD;
                Chk1 or ATR or other related gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oncogenic drivers such as MYC, CCNE1, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For subjects with anogenital cancer, known HPV positive status will confer eligibility&#xD;
           without requirement for prospective genetic profiling. If HPV status is not known or not&#xD;
           positive, genetic profiling (or HPV testing where appropriate) may be performed&#xD;
           prospectively to determine eligibility. Subjects with cervical cancer or squamous cell&#xD;
           carcinoma of the anus are eligible without requirement for prospective genetic profiling&#xD;
           based on the very high prevalence of HPV positivity in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor genetics will be determine using Next-Generation Sequencing.&#xD;
