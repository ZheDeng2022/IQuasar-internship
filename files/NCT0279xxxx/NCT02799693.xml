    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm non-randomized prospective observational cohort study to assess the&#xD;
      outcomes of patients undergoing intramural needle catheter ablation of recurrent ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia that has failed antiarrhythmic drug therapy and standard radiofrequency (RF)&#xD;
      catheter ablation. Following ablation, patients will be monitored for 6 months. The duration&#xD;
      of the study is up to 4 years.&#xD;

      This is an observational prospective cohort study of patients undergoing needle catheter&#xD;
      ablation. Patients with recurrent sustained or incessant ventricular tachycardia who have&#xD;
      recurrent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia that has failed antiarrhythmic drug therapy and&#xD;
      prior catheter ablation who are undergoing intramural needle ablation for VT will be offered&#xD;
      participation. Data will be collected during the procedure and during follow-up. Patients&#xD;
      will be monitored in hospital for complications and during 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Data: Baseline demographic information and a narrative medical history will be&#xD;
      collected on all patients, including documentation of prior cardiac history, and arrhythmia&#xD;
      history, as well as prior medications and cardiac procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural data: Details of the procedure including both procedural methods and arrhythmias&#xD;
      induced, ablation parameters, needle deployments, recordings and response to procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Followup data: Adverse events will be collected for events which are documented during&#xD;
      enrollment and follow-up. During follow-up, hospitalizations will be collected, need for&#xD;
      further procedures, implantable defibrillator therapies and procedures will be collected, as&#xD;
      well as follow-up echocardiography findings.&#xD;
