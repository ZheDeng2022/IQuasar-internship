  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to explore the effect of combined training involving functional&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (FES) of the ankle dorsal flexor with simultaneous maximal-effort&#xD;
      voluntary contraction of the same muscle to correct or improve foot drop in chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients. Participants will be assessed for functional motor ability and neurological&#xD;
      function during their first visit and then again after five and then ten weeks of training.&#xD;
      Functional motor ability is broken down into dorsiflexion strength and general gait analysis.&#xD;
      Dorsiflexion strength is measured by use of a dynamometer. Gait is assessed via recordings of&#xD;
      electromyography, pedobarography, kinematic, and various functional variables during 10&#xD;
      walking trials. The neurological assessment will include electroencephalographic (EEG)&#xD;
      analysis of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), somatosensory evoked potentials&#xD;
      (SSEP), and M-wave response to stimulation. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      three groups: 1) FES + volitional movement (VOL), 2) FES alone, and 3) VOL alone, which will&#xD;
      determine their training regimen. The training sessions involve roughly 20 minutes of&#xD;
      repeated muscle contractions (with appropriate breaks to avoid fatigue). The participants&#xD;
      assigned to the FES+VOL group will receive electrical stimulation to the peroneal nerve in&#xD;
      concert with volitional dorsiflexion, whereas the other groups will either dorsiflex&#xD;
      voluntarily with no stimulation or receive stimulation while being asked to do nothing.&#xD;
