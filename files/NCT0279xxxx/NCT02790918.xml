      In this study, study team aim to i) evaluate the accuracy of 3D IVS curvedness for prediction&#xD;
      of RV systolic pressure (RVSP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance (PVR) with RHC; ii) evaluate the usefulness of 3D IVS curvedness for predicting&#xD;
      the response to vasodilator challenge with RHC, in patients clinically suspected or known to&#xD;
      have primary PH.&#xD;

      1) Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is manifested as an increase in mean&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure (i.e., mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg) at rest on right heart catheterization (RHC)&#xD;
      (Badesch 2009). It is a complex and multidisciplinary disorder causing restricted flow&#xD;
      through the pulmonary arterial circulation due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance&#xD;
      (PVR). It can be classified into five groups (Simonneau et al 2004): Group I - Idiopathic&#xD;
      PAH, Familial PAH, and PAH associated with collagen vascular disease et al; Group II - PH&#xD;
      with left heart disease; Group III - PH associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxemia; Group&#xD;
      IV - PH due to chronic thrombotic and/or embolic disease; and Group V - miscellaneous causes&#xD;
      of PH. The prognosis of PH is poor. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Registry followed&#xD;
      194 patients with IPAH enrolled at 32 clinical centers from 1981 to 1985 (D'Alonzo et al&#xD;
      1991). The reported median survival rates of 68%, 48% and 34%. Similar results have been&#xD;
      reported in Japan, India and Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right heart catheterization (RHC) is the current reference standard for diagnosing PH (Galie&#xD;
      et al 2009; McLaughlin et al 2009), according to ACCF/AHA expert consensus (McLaughlin et al&#xD;
      2009) and ESC/ERS guidelines (Galie et al 2009). Three hemodynamic measurements are essential&#xD;
      from RHC: right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP)&#xD;
      and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Further, patients with PH undergo RHC to assess&#xD;
      clinical response to vasodilator challenge in order to guide therapy. It helps identify&#xD;
      patients with better prognosis and patients who could potentially benefit from treatment with&#xD;
      calcium channel blockers. A positive acute response is defined as a reduction of pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressure ≥10mmHg and ≤40mmHg. Although RHC plays a pivotal role in PH diagnosis, it is&#xD;
      invasive and not without its own inherent risks (Hoeper et al 2006). For these reasons,&#xD;
      development of a noninvasive alternative to RHC for diagnosis of PH is paramount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive diagnosis of PH and prediction of response to vasodilator challenge is clinically&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several noninvasive methods for diagnosis of PH have been propounded, the most common being&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiography. While routinely used to estimate pulmonary arterial pressure,&#xD;
      Doppler measurement of tricuspid regurgitation jet peak velocity has inherent limitations:&#xD;
      (i) the reliance on the visualization of the tricuspid regurgitant jet which is not always&#xD;
      detectable, (ii) the fact that peak velocity of the jet may be difficult to measure in the&#xD;
      presence of severe tricuspid regurgitation, and (iii) the need for adequate acoustic windows&#xD;
      (Hinderliter et al 2003; Hachulla et al 2005). Furthermore, as recently emphasized in the&#xD;
      ERS/ESC guideline (Galie et al 2009), estimation of mPAP or PVR must be an integral part of a&#xD;
      complete cardiac echocardiographic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has long been recognized that systolic flattening and abnormal motion of the&#xD;
      inter-ventricular septum (IVS), from either echocardiography (King et al 1983; Reisner et al&#xD;
      1994; Ricciardi et al 1999) or cine CMR images (Roeleveld et al 2005; Dellegrottaglie et al&#xD;
      2007; Alunni et al 2010), are signs of increased pulmonary arterial pressures. However, these&#xD;
      studies are either qualitative or limited to 2D assessment, relying for analysis on&#xD;
      subjective selection of the imaging plane and cardiac cycle phase. In the last 10 years,&#xD;
      despite advances in biomedical engineering and computational approaches, no rigorous studies&#xD;
      have been undertaken to study the relationship between quantitative 3D IVS shape and PH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well documented that RV dysfunction and the 6-min walk test (6MWT) are associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of mortality in PH (van Wolfersen 2007). Study team has recently developed a&#xD;
      new method for assessment of RV function in terms of area strain, integrating radial,&#xD;
      circumferential and longitudinal deformation (Zhong et al 2012). Therefore, we will also&#xD;
      investigate the relationship between RV area strain and exercise capacity in PH.&#xD;
