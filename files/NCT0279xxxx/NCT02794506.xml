      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propolis is a natural resin made by bees from various plant sources. Propolis exerts&#xD;
      antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and antidiabetic properties.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to assess the adjunctive benefit of propolis supplementation in&#xD;
      individuals with both chronic periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving&#xD;
      scaling and root planing (SRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 6-month randomized blinded clinical trial comparing SRP with placebo (placebo+SRP group,&#xD;
      n=26) or combined with a 6- month regimen of 400 mg oral propolis once daily (propolis+SRP&#xD;
      group, n=26) was performed in patients with long-standing T2DM and chronic periodontitis.&#xD;
      Treatment outcomes included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum&#xD;
      N€-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) and changes in periodontal parameters.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by frequent periods of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, which induce certain molecular pathways that seem to be crucial to the&#xD;
      initiation of angiopathic complications of DM. Several mechanisms have been suggested to&#xD;
      explain the pathogenicity of complications of hyperglycemia such as protein kinase C&#xD;
      isoforms, enhanced polyol pathway flux, and increased accumulation of advanced glycosylated&#xD;
      end-products. A dysregulated immune response stemming from an inappropriate cytokine&#xD;
      production is a possible mechanism underpinning the cross-susceptibility between periodontal&#xD;
      disease and DM. DM has been unambiguously determined as one of the major risk factors of&#xD;
      periodontitis. It was reported that the risk of periodontitis increases to almost threefold&#xD;
      in diabetic patients when compared to healthy individuals. The glycemic control level is&#xD;
      believed to be of paramount importance as a determinant of the increased risk for developing&#xD;
      complications. Diabetic patients with an HbA1c level more than 9% were found to have an&#xD;
      increased prevalence of advanced chronic periodontitis in comparison to healthy people&#xD;
      according to the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two decades ago, periodontitis was added to represent the sixth complication of DM.&#xD;
      Individuals suffering from periodontal diseases often have increased serum levels of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α. Diabetic patients with periodontitis&#xD;
      possess hyperinflammatory immune cells that lead to enhanced release of proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, which eventually lead to insulin resistance resulting in a greater risk of poor&#xD;
      glycemic control when compared to diabetic patients without periodontitis. The accumulation&#xD;
      of irreversible advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), predominantly N€-(carboxymethyl)&#xD;
      lysine (CML) has shown to alter cell function and tissue structure. Due to difficulty in&#xD;
      managing diabetes; there is a critical need for new therapeutic modalities for prevention of&#xD;
      diabetes-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propolis is a natural resin synthesized by honey bees from substances extracted from parts of&#xD;
      some plants, buds and sap. Due to its physical characteristics, propolis is utilized by the&#xD;
      honey bees to protect the hives against foreign invaders. Propolis has been used for&#xD;
      centuries as a homeopathic medicine known for its anti-inflammatory properties, especially in&#xD;
      Europe and ancient Egypt. It has traditionally been used for the management of numerous&#xD;
      diseases, such as gastrointestinal disorders and mucocutaneous infections of fungal,&#xD;
      bacterial and viral etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several types of propolis that differ in composition depending on the plant source&#xD;
      which varies according to the geographic zone such as Brazil, Peru, China and Europe.&#xD;
      Propolis contains more than more than 230 constituents, including flavonoids, cinnamic acids&#xD;
      and their esters, caffeic acid and caffeic acid phenethyl ester. It has been found to have a&#xD;
      wide array of biological activities, including antibacterial, antiviral, fungicidal,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, free radical scavenging, immunomodulatory&#xD;
      and anti-diabetic activity. Recently, investigations revealed that caffeic acid phenethyl&#xD;
      ester (CAPE) is an important active molecule found in propolis and is responsible for most of&#xD;
      its therapeutic properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actions of Chinese and Brazilian propolis in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus in Sprague Dawley rats was explored and the results indicated that both types of&#xD;
      propolis significantly inhibited more body weight loss and plasma glucose increase in&#xD;
      experimental rats. Additionally, rats treated with Chinese propolis exhibited an 8.4%&#xD;
      reduction in HbA1c levels in comparison to non-treated diabetic group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, it was hypothesized that periodontal therapy with SRP in conjunction with oral daily&#xD;
      supplementation of propolis in patients with chronic periodontitis and T2DM might improve&#xD;
      both diabetic and periodontal outcomes. Thus, the aim of the current study is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the adjunctive therapy of oral propolis supplementation to SRP compared to SRP plus&#xD;
      placebo, reduces glycated hemoglobin and improves clinical and periodontal parameters after 6&#xD;
      months of therapy in individuals with chronic periodontitis and T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Mansoura University. Subjects&#xD;
      were selected during their recall maintenance visits in the Internal Medicine Hospital,&#xD;
      Mansoura University, between June and December in 2014. Patients filled out questionnaires&#xD;
      gathering information on their dental and oral health care followed by a periodontal&#xD;
      screening examination to determine eligible individuals. Patients were considered eligible&#xD;
      for the study if they had T2DM with a minimum of five years duration and had been taking&#xD;
      stable doses of oral hypoglycemic drugs and/or insulin for at least 6 months. In addition,&#xD;
      they should have chronic periodontitis with probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss&#xD;
      ≥ 5 mm with detectable bleeding on probing in at least one site in each sextant. Patients&#xD;
      should have a minimum of 20 teeth to be selected. All patients were diagnosed to have&#xD;
      moderate to severe chronic periodontitis according to Armitage criteria (24). Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria included smokers, recent extended use of antibiotics or non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs within the last 3 months, patients who had any periodontal therapy&#xD;
      within one year, patients with grade 3 or 4 retinopathy, pregnancy or women using oral&#xD;
      contraceptives. Enrolled patients signed written informed consents for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty two people with T2DM diagnosed with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis were&#xD;
      randomly assigned using computer-generated random tables to receive propolis (400 mg capsule&#xD;
      orally once daily for six months) as adjuvant to scaling and root planing (Propolis+ SRP&#xD;
      group, n = 26), or matching placebo capsules for 6 months in addition to scaling and root&#xD;
      planing (Placebo+SRP group, n = 26) in this parallel randomized blinded controlled trial with&#xD;
      an allocation ratio = 1:1. The generated allocation sequences were concealed in closed&#xD;
      stapled envelopes until interventions were assigned. Investigators were not involved during&#xD;
      randomization. Propolis commercially named BioPropolis (Sigma Pharmaceutical Industries for&#xD;
      International Business Establishment Co. IBE Pharma, Cairo, Egypt) and matching placebo&#xD;
      capsules were used in the study. All participants in both groups were assigned to receive&#xD;
      equal number of capsules during the 6- month period. Vials which contain propolis and placebo&#xD;
      drugs were labeled with specific codes unknown to patients and investigators. Patients were&#xD;
      instructed to take only one capsule daily from the given vial. Patient compliance was&#xD;
      calculated by counting the remaining capsules in each returned vial every month. Untoward&#xD;
      side effects of both medications were queried and recorded at each visit during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals received meticulous full mouth scaling and root planing (SRP) with hand&#xD;
      curettes and ultrasonic tips under local anesthesia until root surfaces were smooth by&#xD;
      clinician (MA) in a single visit. Oral hygiene instructions and motivations for proper tooth&#xD;
      brushing and dental flossing were given to the patients. Chlohexidine 0.12% mouthrinse was&#xD;
      prescribed for all patients for only two weeks after SRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Periodontal Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment&#xD;
      level (CAL) (distance from the CEJ to the base of the pocket), Eastman interdental bleeding&#xD;
      (EIBI) , gingival (GI) and plaque (PI) indices were assessed at baseline, 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months after therapy by the examiner (HE). Intra-examiner calibration was achieved by&#xD;
      examination of 10 patients twice, 24 hours apart before starting the study. Calibration was&#xD;
      accepted if measurements of PD and CAL (by using UNC-15 probe) at baseline and 24 hours were&#xD;
      similar to 1 mm at the 90% level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection and analysis of Blood:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 mL of venous blood from the antecubital vein of all participants were collected in&#xD;
      heparinized vacutainer tubes at baseline, 3 months and 6 months after treatment. Measurements&#xD;
      of HbA1c were carried out via an automated affinity chromatography system (Bio-Rad Micromat&#xD;
      II, Hercules, CA). Fasting plasma glucose levels (FPG) were measured by the standard glucose&#xD;
      oxidase method. The serum concentration of N€-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) was assessed by&#xD;
      N€-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) ELISA Kit of CML protein adducts (OxiSelect™, Catalog Number&#xD;
      STA-316, Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The amount of CML adduct in protein samples&#xD;
      was evaluated by comparing the absorbance to a known CML-BSA standard curve as described by&#xD;
      the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the present clinical trial was the change in HbA1c levels after 6&#xD;
      months of therapy. Secondary outcomes included the change in HbA1c levels after 3 months in&#xD;
      addition to the amount of CAL gain, PD reduction and changes in FPG and serum CML levels&#xD;
      after 3 and 6 months of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis was performed before commencement of the trial with type I error α = 0.05, β&#xD;
      = 0.14 and (1-β) = 0.86. The power was calculated as p = 0.8641 and the estimated minimum&#xD;
      sample size required was found to be 20 per each group to achieve a power of 80% based on&#xD;
      achievement of 6-month reduction of HbA1c of the test group over the control by 0.8%. All&#xD;
      data were explored by using Kolmogrov-Smirnov test of normality. Parametric data were&#xD;
      presented as mean ± SD. Baseline comparisons were made using Student's t-test. One-way&#xD;
      analyses of variance (ANOVA) with Holm-Sidak post hoc correction for multiple comparisons&#xD;
      were used to determine significant changes at different time intervals. Wilcoxon signed rank&#xD;
      test and Mann-Whitney test were used to detect differences per group and between groups over&#xD;
      time. The α-level for significance was set at 0.05.Statistical analyses were calculated by a&#xD;
      statistical software program (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 19.0, SPSS,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL).&#xD;
