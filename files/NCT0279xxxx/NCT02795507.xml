  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of training of the non-involved upper&#xD;
      limb on the motor ability of the hemiparetic upper limb in patients with unilateral&#xD;
      sensorimotor motor impairments. The secondary aims are to investigate the relation between&#xD;
      lesion characteristics and responsiveness to the treatment, and to study which brain&#xD;
      structures are activated during a task trained in the treatment.&#xD;

      40 post-stroke subjects will be recruited from neurological rehabilitation department at&#xD;
      Loewenstein Hospital Rehabilitation Center, Raanana, Israel. Hospitalized patients,&#xD;
      discharged patients from this department and patients that visit the clinic at this&#xD;
      department will be recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1)&#xD;
      Experimental group. 2) Control group. The 3 weeks intervention (15 sessions) in each group&#xD;
      will include daily 30 minutes of structured training followed by 30 minutes of standard&#xD;
      physical therapy exercises of the upper limbs (conventional sensorimotor active and passive&#xD;
      exercises of the upper limb). During the structured training in the experimental group,&#xD;
      patient's hand will be positioned in a specialized motion control apparatus (Rehabit-Tec&#xD;
      System). This device consists of a forearm and wrist rest, and the fingers of each hand are&#xD;
      individually strapped to the device with palms facing down. The finger is connected to a&#xD;
      piston that moves a plunger on a potentiometer according to the degree of flexion. A control&#xD;
      module reads the location of every potentiometer on each finger of the 'moving' hand and&#xD;
      powers motors that push/pull the corresponding other hand finger to equalize the&#xD;
      potentiometer's position. Each finger channel is independent and acts as a stand-alone&#xD;
      control circuit. The device restricts voluntary movement of the 'other' hand fingers since&#xD;
      only 'moving' hand finger movement activates the motors. Thus when the hands are strapped to&#xD;
      the device, and the device is turned on, voluntary hand finger movement results in passive&#xD;
      yoking of the corresponding 'other' hand fingers. The patient can't see his real hands and&#xD;
      the device. Visual feedback of virtual hands are provided through a VR headset used for 3D&#xD;
      gaming. The patient will wear motion-sensing gloves (5DT Data Glove Ultra) that allow online&#xD;
      monitoring of individual finger flexure in each hand. The training setup contains a&#xD;
      head-mounted specialized 3D camera (PLAYSTATION Eye digital camera device) to provide online&#xD;
      visual feedback of the real environment. These devices allow detection of the patient's real&#xD;
      hand movements and translate them by customized software to the virtual hand movements&#xD;
      presented on the screen. The virtual hands are embedded in a specific location in space and&#xD;
      are presented only when the patient look down towards his real hand. In this group, the&#xD;
      patients will move their non-involved hand, and will receive a visual feedback of a moving&#xD;
      virtual hand in the non-involved side. A passive movement (providing kinesthetic feedback) of&#xD;
      the non-involved hand will occur simultaneously by the device. For example: in a left&#xD;
      hemiparetic patient, a movement of the right hand will result in observation of the left&#xD;
      virtual hand and a passive movement of the left hand. The structured pre-training of the&#xD;
      control group will be similar except that the patient will not receive a visual and&#xD;
      kinesthetic feedback (passive movement) of the hemiparetic hand. The subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to move their non-involved fingers as accurately and fast as they can.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after each intervention the following tests will be used: Fugl-Meyer Assessment&#xD;
      and box and blocks test as motor clinical assessment tests of the upper limb, and the ability&#xD;
      to move the fingers (using the aforementioned gloves, For example: amount of flexion).&#xD;
      Normalized lesion data will be computed using the ABLE module within MEDx software (Medical&#xD;
      Numerics). Only before the intervention, sensory ability will be characterized using:&#xD;
      Fugl-Meyer assessment of sensorimotor function (Sensory section) and Semmes-Weinstein&#xD;
      filaments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cases with specific theoretical interest, the subjects will be offered to be examined also&#xD;
      in a fMRI/DTI using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) System - Siemens Prisma 3T scanner. The&#xD;
      task during the imaging will be as during the structured pre-training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between groups will be done using t-tests or Mann-Whitney, depending on&#xD;
      distribution of normality with corrections for multiple comparisons. Correlations or&#xD;
      voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) analyses will be conducted to investigate the&#xD;
      relation between lesion extent and location and responsiveness to the treatments.&#xD;
