  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and effectiveness of esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy in the detection&#xD;
      of gastrointestinal-tract pathology in children has been established during the last three&#xD;
      decades. Insufflation of the intestinal tract, usually with room air, is necessary to improve&#xD;
      visualization during the procedure; however, air in the bowels can also result in abdominal&#xD;
      distension and increased pain. This potential discomfort associated with upper endoscopy and&#xD;
      colonoscopy may be an important barrier to patients undergoing this procedure. Insufflation&#xD;
      with carbon dioxide is another method used in endoscopic procedures for distention of the&#xD;
      lumen and is currently used at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin based on provider&#xD;
      preference. The aim of this study is to perform a randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      insufflation with room air to carbon dioxide in patients undergoing routine upper endoscopy&#xD;
      and colonoscopy. The investigators primary outcome is measurement of patient comfort level as&#xD;
      measured by pain scores during recovery. The investigators hypothesize that carbon dioxide&#xD;
      insufflation during endoscopy and colonoscopy improves patient comfort level as compared with&#xD;
      insufflation with room air. Secondary outcome measures include changes in end tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide, time to discharge, duration of colonoscopy and cecal intubation rate, changes in&#xD;
      abdominal girth, rescue pain medications used during recovery and post-procedure events. This&#xD;
      is a prospective randomized single-blinded study. The investigators will recruit consecutive&#xD;
      patients, between the ages of 8 and 21 years, scheduled for elective outpatient upper&#xD;
      endoscopy and colonoscopy at children's hospital of Wisconsin from March 2015 until we reach&#xD;
      target population numbers. The investigators will exclude all inpatients, non-English&#xD;
      speaking patients, children under 8 years of age, patients undergoing colonic manometry&#xD;
      studies, and patients with hemodynamic instability, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute abdomen,&#xD;
      previous colectomy, oxygen-dependent pulmonary disease and obstructive sleep apnea requiring&#xD;
      the use of continuous positive airway pressure device. On the basis of a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization scheme in a 1:1 ratio, patients will be assigned to receive room air or carbon&#xD;
      dioxide for insufflation during colonoscopy. Power calculation was done and determined that&#xD;
      we will need to enroll 100 patients in each arm of the study. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all patients by the endoscopist or gastrointestinal fellow.&#xD;
