  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a Cluster Randomised Trial (CRT) of community and facility-based HIVST&#xD;
      distribution by the Society for Family Health (SFH) in multiple rural and peri-urban&#xD;
      settings. The study will take place in 6 matched pairs of health facilities and their&#xD;
      catchment areas have been selected for study inclusion in collaboration with the district&#xD;
      medical office (DMO). One clinic catchment area from each pair will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      the HIVST arm (intervention) and the other to the standard of care (SOC) arm (Control).In the&#xD;
      HIVST arm, community-based distribution agents (CBDA), including Voluntary Medical Male&#xD;
      Circumcision (VMMC) mobilisers, will deliver HIVST kits. The kits will also be available at&#xD;
      the health facility. In the SOC arm, all HIV testing and counseling (HTC) services will be&#xD;
      conducted as currently.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use the OraQuick® HIV Self-Test (Orasure Technologies, Thailand). The kits&#xD;
      contain the HIV Oral Fluid Test (HIVOFT) test kit, stand, buffer solution, locally-translated&#xD;
      instructions for use (IFUs), materials on counselling and linkage to care, and primary and&#xD;
      secondary packaging. The kits will be distributed for free by CBDAs. Leaflets will be&#xD;
      provided in lieu of patient information sheets, but no other consent will be required for&#xD;
      HIVST implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following baseline enumeration, clinic pairs will be randomly allocated to either the&#xD;
      intervention or control arm at a public ceremony. An opaque bag containing 2 balls - one for&#xD;
      HIVST and one for SOC - will be used to allocate the HIVST arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will not be possible to blind participants, CBDAs, or their supervisors to the cluster&#xD;
      intervention allocation, but all forms will be managed without reference to the intervention&#xD;
      arm. Outcome data will not be analysed until completion of the trial, with the exception of&#xD;
      data analysis by an independent statistician for presentation to the Trial Advisory Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBDAs linked to intervention clinics will be provided with training in HIVST and Information,&#xD;
      Education and Communication (IEC) materials including flipcharts, used kits to show clients&#xD;
      how to interpret positive, negative and inconclusive results, a cotton bud and vial of water&#xD;
      to demonstrate the mouth swabbing and development process, leaflets and a buffer stock of&#xD;
      OraQuick® HIV Self-Test to be stored in a locked container in their own home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older adolescent and adult participants (age 15 - 17years or older) wishing to know their&#xD;
      status will be provided with information on where to obtain further counselling and care&#xD;
      together with the kit, and an envelope for return of the used kit, a self-completed&#xD;
      questionnaire (SCQ), a self-referral slip for the nearest clinic in case of a positive&#xD;
      result, and information on how to access VMMC for HIV-negative men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clients will be encouraged to return their used kits confidentially to the CBDA, either in&#xD;
      person or by posting in the sealed envelope into an opaque locked &quot;ballot box&quot; container kept&#xD;
      in/at the CBDA's/counsellor's house. Clients will also be encouraged to seek post-test advice&#xD;
      from the CBDA, which can be &quot;generic&quot; or results-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kits will be replaced by the clinic supervisors on presentation of used kits and following&#xD;
      inspection of an HIV test logbook to confirm recording of names and addresses, but not&#xD;
      results, of clients. Numbers of used kits, and re-read results, will be recorded by the&#xD;
      CBDA/clinic supervisor. HIVST logbooks will be kept at the CBDA's home in a locked container.&#xD;
      Couple's testing will be encouraged. In the case of couples wanting to self-test together,&#xD;
      both partners will be asked to attend the IEC session. Clients will be allowed to take up to&#xD;
      2 kits home if the partner cannot attend. Testing of children (aged 15 years or less) will&#xD;
      not be permitted as part of this trial, but can be arranged through special arrangement with&#xD;
      SFH supervisors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no sharps or hazardous materials that will be used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE SURVEY SAMPLING AND INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline enumeration will include approximately 2400 participants in the intervention&#xD;
      communities (400 per community) and 2,400 participants in the control communities (n=~4,800).&#xD;
      Within this sample, 20% of participants (~1,000) will be randomly selected for the extended&#xD;
      baseline survey. The sample size justification for the extended questionnaire is detailed&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated to ensure 80% power to detect a 50% change in the proportion&#xD;
      of individual tested for HIV over the last twelve months, with 95% confidence. Using&#xD;
      2013-2014 Demongraphic and Health Survey (DHS) data, baseline rates for individuals tested in&#xD;
      the last 12 months are estimated to be between 28.6-57.1% (lower in men than women); for this&#xD;
      sample calculation, we have assumed a baseline testing rate of 50%. For a two-sample&#xD;
      comparison of matched proportions across 6 pairs of matched communities, we estimate that it&#xD;
      will be necessary to recruit around 400 respondents per community, or 4,800 respondents in&#xD;
      total.&#xD;

    <description>Recent testing will be measured by self-report and analyzed at the individual level. Respondents will be asked to answer the following question: &quot;Have you tested for HIV within the past 12 months&quot; as part of the baseline, midline, and endline surveys.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Linkage to HIV care will be measured using clinic data. Self-testers will receive self-referral forms, and will be asked to bring these to clinics where they receive confirmatory testing and care. Clinic staff will log all clients seeking confirmatory testing following HIV self-testing. Data on linkage will be aggregated to the clinic level for analysis.</description>
