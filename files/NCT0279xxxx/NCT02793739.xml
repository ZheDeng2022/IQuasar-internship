  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fingers are a part of the body that are often subject to increased signs of aging due to&#xD;
      physical use, trauma and exposure to the environment. The FDA's recent approval of a dermal&#xD;
      filler, calcium hydroxylapatite, in hands has led to increased patient demand for hand&#xD;
      fillers which, in turn, has led to the question of rejuvenation of the dorsal fingers. Due to&#xD;
      the different anatomy of the fingers than the dorsal hand plus the new demand to improve the&#xD;
      entire hand plus the finger area, we aim to characterize the best approach. Youthful fingers&#xD;
      are devoid of wrinkles and often have fuller contours thus hiding the &quot;knuckles&quot; (proximal&#xD;
      and distal interphalangeal joints). With aging and loss of subcutaneous tissue volume,&#xD;
      fingers become wrinkled, look more skeletal, almost emaciated, and joints become much more&#xD;
      prominent, all aesthetic features often disliked by patients. By augmenting the volume in the&#xD;
      dorsal fingers, it is possible that the visibility of such bony structures will be decreased,&#xD;
      wrinkles will become smoother, and a more youthful appearance of the fingers will be&#xD;
      restored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been no published reports, to these investigators' knowledge, of the use of&#xD;
      injectable filler into the dorsal fingers for three-dimensional volume correction. The use of&#xD;
      exogenous hyaluronic acid (HA) filler in the fingers would be off-label. Given that HA filler&#xD;
      has been used safely and effectively in many areas of three-dimensional volume restoration&#xD;
      throughout the body, the investigators believe the HA filler may be used to effectively and&#xD;
      safely correct volume loss in the fingers. The investigators hope that this study will&#xD;
      present current, state of the art, never before reported technique, safety, efficacy and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction of HA filler in this region.&#xD;

      At Marmur Medical, subjects will be recruited and consented prior to any study evaluations or&#xD;
      procedures; if subjects meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      into this study. Informed consent will clearly say the use of hyaluronic acid filler for the&#xD;
      treatment of dorsal finger volume loss is investigational. Subjects will also be compensated&#xD;
      for their visits (initial and six follow-ups totalling seven visits). Pre and post treatment&#xD;
      photographs will be taken. Subjects will be given lidocaine cream to apply to the area of&#xD;
      injection for temporary numbing effect prior to injection (10-15 minutes). Ice packs will&#xD;
      also be applied to the area temporarily for numbing effect just prior to injection. The&#xD;
      patient's fingers will be injected with 0.5-2.0 mL of hyaluronic acid total at the level of&#xD;
      the sub-dermal plane. The injected filler will be molded as needed to optimize the correction&#xD;
      of the fingers. Syringes used and amount injected into each finger, as well as the total per&#xD;
      hand, will be documented to the 0.1 mL increment (e.g. 3.4 mL). The expected volume needed is&#xD;
      1-2 syringes per subject initially. On Day 14, subjects will return for evaluation and&#xD;
      possible touch-up of injectable hyaluronic acid filler if needed (at the injector's&#xD;
      discretion). The expected volume needed may be 1-2 syringes per subject for touch-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will return for follow-up at all time-points as follows: day 14 (+/- touch-up&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid injection if necessary), 6 weeks, 3/6/9/12 months. The patient and&#xD;
      investigator(s) will assess the volume enhancement in the fingers. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      rate their level of satisfaction with the treatment at follow-up visits (Global Satisfaction&#xD;
      Assessment, Natural Look/Feel Scale). In addition, at the initial visit, subjects will be&#xD;
      given a 30 day diary to fill out that will evaluate for symptomology after injection (pain,&#xD;
      bruising, swelling, redness, sensitivity/tenderness, itching, lumps/bump development,&#xD;
      temporary numbness, signs of vascular compromise or other/open comment box). The subject&#xD;
      diary will be collected at the 3 month follow-up visit. Statistical analysis of the data&#xD;
      gathered will be performed by an outside statistician using tests such as Wilcoxian&#xD;
      signed-rank test (for two observations) or Friedman's test (for more than 2 observations)&#xD;
      using STAT, version 13. All adverse events will be recorded at every follow-up visit. These&#xD;
      events include: redness, swelling, tenderness, nodule development under the skin and&#xD;
      restricted range of motion. More serious adverse events include: compartment syndrome,&#xD;
      infection at injection site, Tyndall effect, persistent granulomatous change, injection&#xD;
      necrosis, persistent erythema with edema, and vascular occlusion causing symptoms such as&#xD;
      pain, numbness and necrosis.&#xD;
