  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to evaluate the impact of sourdough fermented crisp bread on effects&#xD;
      on appetite and postprandial glucose and insulin responses. Beneficial effects on appetite&#xD;
      and postprandial insulin responses have been observed, particularly for unfermented rye crisp&#xD;
      breads in a previous study. In the present study, the investigators evaluated how the intake&#xD;
      of sourdough fermented rye crisp breads vs. unfermented rye crisp bread as well as a control&#xD;
      refined wheat crisp bread product may affect self-rated appetite and postprandial insulin and&#xD;
      glucose responses in healthy men and women in a meal-study. The investigators characterized&#xD;
      intervention products with regards to microstructural and chemical features in order to&#xD;
      elucidate underlying mechanisms for potential effects observed on appetite and postprandial&#xD;
      metabolic responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two commercial whole grain rye crisp breads processed differently (unfermented and sourdough&#xD;
      fermented) and a refined wheat control product were tested in the study. The rye crisp bread&#xD;
      products contained similar ingredients. All products provide similar amounts of available&#xD;
      carbohydrates (about 30g). The total amount of test product is about 50-60g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific primary aim of the study: To conduct a short-term breakfast intervention study&#xD;
      in humans (n = 24) to compare the effect of 2 high-fiber rye crisp bread products processed&#xD;
      in different ways (sourdough fermented or unfermented) and a refined wheat control crisp&#xD;
      bread as part of a normal breakfast on self-rated appetite, postprandial glucose and insulin&#xD;
      concentrations. Difference in post-prandial insulin response between products is the primary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim (conducted if significant effects in the primary endpoint have been&#xD;
      demonstrated): To assess changes in hormones and their relation to self-perceived satiety,&#xD;
      hunger and desire to eat and to differences in chemical and microstructural composition of&#xD;
      the tested foods.&#xD;
