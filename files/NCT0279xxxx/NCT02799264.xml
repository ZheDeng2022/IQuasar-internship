  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabotegravir is being developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1&#xD;
      infection. Specifically, it is being developed as a component of a 2-drug maintenance regimen&#xD;
      (post-induction of viral suppression) that includes rilpivirine. Rilpivirine requires food&#xD;
      for optimal absorption; therefore the recommended intake of cabotegravir in the planned Phase&#xD;
      3 treatment studies is with food regardless of fat or calorie content, when administered&#xD;
      along with rilpivirine. This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, two-way crossover&#xD;
      study in healthy adult subjects to assess the effect of a high fat meal on the single dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of CAB 30 mg. Approximately, 24 subjects will be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      will be screened for 30 days. Twelve subjects with at least 10 hours of fasting will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive a single dose of cabotegravir orally (Schedule 'A'). The remaining 12&#xD;
      subjects will receive a single dose of cabotegravir orally along with high fat meal (Schedule&#xD;
      'B'). After 15 days, the subjects earlier undergoing 'Schedule A' will be switched to&#xD;
      'Schedule B' and those undergoing 'Schedule B' will undergo 'Schedule A'. All the subjects&#xD;
      will be followed up to 30 days from the day of receiving first dose of cabotegravir to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir.&#xD;
