  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of a multifaceted intervention designed to improve the&#xD;
      safety of opioid prescribing. The specific aims of this study are to: (a) evaluate whether a&#xD;
      multifaceted intervention (Improving the Safety of Opioid Prescribing; ISOP) enhances opioid&#xD;
      safety, (b) assess whether participation in ISOP impacts the clinician-patient relationship,&#xD;
      and (c) explore to what extent ISOP is associated with changes in pain and pain-related&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will randomize primary care providers (PCPs) at the VA Portland Health Care&#xD;
      System to either ISOP or the control condition; patients will be nested by clinician status.&#xD;
      All PCPs who enroll will participate in either a two-hour educational workshop or the&#xD;
      two-hour educational workshop + nurse care manager (NCM). The NCM will maintain a registry of&#xD;
      enrolled patients, track opioid medication-related events from the medical record, and&#xD;
      provide decision support to PCPs for issues related to prescription opioid safety. The NCM&#xD;
      will also meet individually with enrolled participants to discuss strategies for&#xD;
      preventing/reducing opioid side effects, preventing diversion, and providing rationale for&#xD;
      screening for prescription opioid misuse. The investigators will recruit patients who are&#xD;
      already prescribed chronic opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled for one year. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Data collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) is an assessment of self-reported risk of prescription opioid misuse. There are 17 items, each rated on a scale of 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Total scores range from 0 - 68, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of prescription opioid misuse.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Urine Drug Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete urine drug tests (UDTs) to evaluate for presence of substances. UDTs will evaluate for cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opioids, and opiates. Study results are dichotomous.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Pain Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>The Chronic Pain Grade is a 7-item self-report measure that provides global scores of pain intensity and function. Scores for each subscale range from 0 - 100. Higher scores indicate more severe pain or more impairment in function. Pain intensity and function were tested in a non-inferiority analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Trust in Physician Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Trust in Physician Scale is an 11-item self-report measure. Scores range from 0 - 100, with higher scores indicating greater interpersonal trust between patients and their clinician</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Participatory Decision Making Style</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Participatory Decision Making Style is a 4-item self-report measures. Scores range from 0 - 100, where higher scores indicate greater patient involvement in medical decision making.</description>
