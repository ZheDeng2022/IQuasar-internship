      The investigators propose to develop a computational framework involving a novel automatic&#xD;
      image segmentation algorithm based on CTA images, an artery model reconstruction algorithm&#xD;
      for stenosis detection, and quantification of severity of stenosis in terms of area stenosis.&#xD;

      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a common [affecting about 6% in the general adult population]&#xD;
      cardiac disorder where a portion of the coronary artery is blocked. Among populations aged&#xD;
      more than 65 years, the prevalence increases to 19.8%. The incidence of CHD in Singapore and&#xD;
      other major countries is comparable. The prognosis of CHD is poor. CHD causes 1.2 million&#xD;
      heart attacks and nearly 19% of deaths in US.[2] In Singapore, cardiovascular disease (CVD)&#xD;
      accounted for 30.4% of all deaths in 2011, among these, 19% are due to CHD. In future, CVD&#xD;
      deaths will increase up to 24.2 million globally in 2030. Among these, CHD deaths will change&#xD;
      from 13.1% in 2010 to 14.9% in 2030 of all males; and from 13.6% to 13.1% of all females. The&#xD;
      direct costs of CHD are estimated at over $87 billion and indirect cost at $70 billion in US.&#xD;
      Unless current trends are halted or reversed, over a million people will die from CHD in US&#xD;
      annually. Globally, the majority of CHD deaths will be in developing countries and many of&#xD;
      the lives will be lost in middle age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive coronary angiography (ICA), is the gold standard method to delineate anatomical&#xD;
      coronary stenosis. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement with pressure wire is the gold&#xD;
      standard for assessment of the physiological importance of an anatomical stenosis.&#xD;
      Non-invasive computed tomography angiography (CTA), is a diagnostic alternative to invasive&#xD;
      coronary angiography from single and multi-centre trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTA enables visualization of coronary vessels in two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional&#xD;
      (3D) formats. Current available imaging techniques on CTA are limited in their abilities in&#xD;
      assessing physiological stenosis. First, the commonly used percent diameter stenosis to&#xD;
      describe the extent of coronary artery stenosis is only a modest descriptor of coronary&#xD;
      stenosis because it does not incorporate other lesion characteristics (e.g. length, shape and&#xD;
      eccentricity) or the effect of stenosis in series that may greatly affect the blood flow.&#xD;
      From our preliminary study, we found that diameter stenosis weakly correlated with golden&#xD;
      standard FFR from invasive catheterization (r = 0.30). Second, percent diameter stenosis&#xD;
      assessment is usually given per specific coronary artery lesion, the lesions being manually&#xD;
      identified by the expert reader. There is no method to comprehensively assess the entire&#xD;
      coronary tree in an automated fashion without the need for manual input. We propose the&#xD;
      development of an Automatic CTA analyzer to identify significant coronary stenosis in&#xD;
      coronary arteries that will provide rapid triage for patients suspected of CHD. This analyzer&#xD;
      can also facilitate disease surveillance and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed integrated solution is expected to achieve earlier and higher accuracy in&#xD;
      detecting severity of coronary stenosis. From 2004 to 2007 alone, the number of annual CTA&#xD;
      procedures in the US is around 4.7 million. In National Heart Centre Singapore, we performed&#xD;
      more than 1000 CTA per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diameter stenosis from CTA cannot determine the hemodynamic significance of the coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. For example, even if significant stenosis (&gt;50%) is identified at CTA, fewer&#xD;
      than 50% of the lesions actually cause ischemia. Furthermore, as many as 20% of patients with&#xD;
      severe stenoses (i.e., &gt;70%) on CTA turn out not to have ischemia confirmed by ICA and FFR.&#xD;
      As a result, these patients risk of being referred for ICA when they do not need it.&#xD;

    <description>FFR is defined as the distal pressure to coronary lesion divided by the proximal coronary pressure. FFR is measured through a standard diagnostic catheter during coronary angiogram. FFR is used to guide whether to perform angioplasty or stenting or not in patients with coronary stenosis.</description>
