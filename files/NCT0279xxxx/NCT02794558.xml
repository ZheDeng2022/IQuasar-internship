      Non-randomized, Single Arm Clinical study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of MR&#xD;
      Guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery in the Treatment of Early Breast Carcinomas&#xD;

      Study specific aim is to Coagulate the tissue volume of a proven breast cancer with MRgFUS&#xD;
      and Collect post treatment follow-up clinical and radiological data for a period of 5 years&#xD;
      following MRgFUS for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of the treatment will be evaluated by recording and assessing the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of device- related complications from the first visit through the 5 years follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective of this study is to evaluate post treatment local recurrence in the same&#xD;
      quadrant or less then 4cm from the periphery of the treated lesion, during a 5 year period&#xD;
      following the MRgFUS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with breast cancer in whom breast MR imaging identifies a single focal breast lesion up&#xD;
      to 1.5 cm in diameter will be eligible for the study.&#xD;

    <description>MR images of the breast will be obtained for lesion localization purposes. The breast surgeon or the radiologist will make a treatment plan or map. Sonication at therapeutic power level will be performed on multiple overlapping points successively until sonication of the target volume has been completed.&#xD;
Follow-up evaluation will be made within 14 to 21 days after the MRgFUS treatment.</description>
