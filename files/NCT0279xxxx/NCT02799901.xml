    <textblock>
      Combining nivolumab with conventional multisite high dose radiotherapy seems to be an&#xD;
      interesting approach that could increase the antitumoral effect of nivolumab by increasing&#xD;
      the diversity and quantity of tumoral antigen presentation thanks to radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Multifractionated high dose radiotherapy (HR) targeting various tumor sites could also&#xD;
      increase occurrence of tumor mutations and the diversity of the T-cell receptor repertoire of&#xD;
      intratumoral T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to combine nivolumab with 3 fractions of HR of one metastasis&#xD;
      for each tumor site (defined as skin/muscle, thoracic, abdomen, bone, other).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that combining nivolumab with multisite, multifractionated HR&#xD;
      increases the overall survival rate at 1 year compared to published data with nivolumab&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent progress has been made in advanced melanoma with drug targeting immune system such as&#xD;
      ipilimumab targeting CTLA-4 and nivolumab targeting PD-1. Some case reports and preclinical&#xD;
      data suggested that the antitumoral immune response of these immune check point inhibitors&#xD;
      (ipilimumab and nivolumab as well) could be enhanced if associated with massive tumoral&#xD;
      antigen release in the blood stream, due to local treatment such as high dose radiotherapy&#xD;
      (HR). The first rigorous scientific demonstration of this phenomenon was done by Demaria et&#xD;
      al. They showed that irradiation of xenograft tumor could induce decrease of tumoral growth&#xD;
      of a non-irradiated other xenograt tumor. This effect was due to immune response to&#xD;
      irradiation but it only occured when immune system was modulated by CTLA-4 inhibition. In&#xD;
      that experiences CTLA4 and radiation actions were synergistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dovedi et al. also reported that targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have greater anti-tumor&#xD;
      efficacy if concomitant radiotherapy was given and especially if radiotherapy was&#xD;
      multifractionated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very interestingly the fractionated radiotherapy also induced huge increase of tumoral PD-L1&#xD;
      expression by three times 5 days after beginning of radiotherapy. This could explain the&#xD;
      synergistic impact of this strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least eight clinical studies are ongoing, testing the combination of CTLA-4 blockade with&#xD;
      radiotherapy in metastatic melanoma or other tumors, with various treatment schedules either&#xD;
      for ipilimumab (3 or 10 mg/kg) or radiotherapy (before or after ipilimumab, fractions of 6 to&#xD;
      8 Gy; total body irradiation or treatment of only one metastasis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study (NCT01565837) is a phase II study that analyses the efficacy of 10mg/kg ipilimumab&#xD;
      (every 3 weeks) associated with HR for all metastatic sites but only for oligometastatic&#xD;
      patients (&lt; 6 metastasis), which reflects only a minority of metastatic melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such strategy is of high interest because it takes into account the putative tumoral&#xD;
      heterogeneity which could lead to failure of the association of nivolumab with the&#xD;
      irradiation of only one tumor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to combine nivolumab with 3 fractions of HR of one metastasis for&#xD;
      each tumor site (defined as skin/muscle, thoracic, abdomen, bone, other).They have chosen 3&#xD;
      fractions instead of only 1 for each tumor site because of preclinical data in mice showing&#xD;
      that one fraction is less efficient than several fractions to stimulate the immune system and&#xD;
      kill tumoral cells. The increase of the number of fractions could also lead to an increase of&#xD;
      the diversity of tumoral antigens released in the blood stream which could also favors&#xD;
      diversity of the T-cell receptor repertoire of intratumoral T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our protocol dose constraint for each tissue type can be easily achieved with the 3 X 6 Gy&#xD;
      schedule without excess of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion the present protocol aims to increase the quantity and diversity of released&#xD;
      tumoral antigens by providing multisite, multifractionated HR during nivolumab treatment in&#xD;
      advanced untreated melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that combining nivolumab with multisite, multifractionated HR&#xD;
      increases the overall survival rate at 1 year compared to published data with nivolumab&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
