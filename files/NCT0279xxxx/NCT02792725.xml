        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a diagnosis of hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
             receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  To fulfill the requirement of HR+ disease, a breast cancer must express, by&#xD;
                  immunohistochemistry, at least 1 of the hormone receptors (estrogen receptor or&#xD;
                  progesterone receptor).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  To fulfill the requirement of HER2- disease, a breast cancer must not&#xD;
                  demonstrate, at initial diagnosis or upon subsequent biopsy, overexpression of&#xD;
                  HER2 by either immunohistochemistry or in-situ hybridization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have recurrent, locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic breast cancer with&#xD;
             disease progression following anti-estrogen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of 0 to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer (including chemotherapy,&#xD;
             radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and endocrine therapy) for at least 21 days for&#xD;
             myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for nonmyelosuppressive agents prior to receiving&#xD;
             abemaciclib, and recovered from the acute effects of therapy (until the toxicity&#xD;
             resolves to either baseline or at least Grade 1) except for residual alopecia and&#xD;
             peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate organ function, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematologic: absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 10⁹/Liter (L), platelets ≥100 ×&#xD;
                  10⁹/L, and hemoglobin ≥8 grams/deciliter. Participants may receive erythrocyte&#xD;
                  transfusions to achieve this hemoglobin level at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
                  physician. Initial treatment should not begin earlier than the day after the&#xD;
                  erythrocyte transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic: bilirubin ≤1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) and alanine&#xD;
                  aminotransferase ≤3 × ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal: serum creatinine ≤ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a woman of child-bearing potential, must test negative for pregnancy at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment based on serum pregnancy test, and must agree to use a reliable method of&#xD;
             birth control during the program and for 3 months following the last dose of the&#xD;
             abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a man, must agree to use a reliable method of birth control and to not donate sperm&#xD;
             during the program and for at least 3 months following the last dose of abemaciclib&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving an investigational product or&#xD;

             scientifically or medically compatible with this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have progressive central nervous system metastasis that require immediate local&#xD;
             therapy including (but not limited to) whole-brain radiotherapy, stereotactic&#xD;
             radiosurgery, surgical resection, or intrathecal chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of progressive disease during prior therapy with a cyclin-dependent&#xD;
             kinase (CDK) 4&amp;6 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of either&#xD;
             unexplained or cardiovascular etiology, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular&#xD;
             fibrillation, or sudden cardiac arrest.&#xD;
