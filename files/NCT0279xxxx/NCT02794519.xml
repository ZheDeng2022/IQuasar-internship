  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sirukumab is a fully human anti interleukin (IL)-6 immunoglobulin G1-kappa monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody (MAb) which is in development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The&#xD;
      continuing unmet need in subjects with asthma refractory to corticosteroid therapy and&#xD;
      increased understanding of asthma pathogenesis have stimulated the development of targeted&#xD;
      biologics based on predictive biomarkers. The majority of approaches to date have targeted T&#xD;
      Helper 2 (Th2) cytokines or their downstream effects. Targeting IL-6 in severe asthma&#xD;
      represents an unprecedented approach that has potential to address non-Th2 drivers of severe&#xD;
      asthma. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind (sponsor-unblind), placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group study will investigate the efficacy of sirukumab compared to placebo in&#xD;
      subjects having uncontrolled severe asthma despite use of high dose inhaled corticosteroid&#xD;
      (ICS) in combination with long-acting Beta-agonist (LABA). The study will employ a variable&#xD;
      treatment period for individual subjects. Dosing will continue every 4 weeks until week 44&#xD;
      (inclusive), or until 24 weeks after the final subject has been randomized, whichever the&#xD;
      sooner. Upon receiving the final dose of study medicine or placebo, subjects will enter a 16&#xD;
      week Follow Up period. Overall, the duration of participation for subjects who complete the&#xD;
      full 44-week treatment period and Follow Up period may be up to 64 weeks. Approximately 175&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized such that 140 evaluable subjects complete the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-7 is a seven-item questionnaire that is a measure of a subject's asthma control. Six of the questions will be self-completed by the subject, recalling over the previous 7 days. The six questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze), and rescue bronchodilator use. The response options for all these questions consist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. The final question is a rating of forced expiratory volume in 1 second FEV1% predicted. The questions are equally weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of the 7 questions and therefore between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). Baseline value is the value obtained at Day 1 before administration of investigational product (IP). Change from baseline in ACQ-7 score will be analysed using a Bayesian repeated measures model.</description>
