  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to ascertain the best way to inform patients about their physicians'&#xD;
      conflicts of interest (COI) with industry. Currently, there is no institutional or national&#xD;
      standard for such physician-to-patient disclosures. The primary aim of this study is to test&#xD;
      different written disclosures and assess their impact on patients' knowledge of their&#xD;
      physicians' COIs and on patients' trust in their physician and their healthcare institution.&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to investigate whether physician disclosures of significant financial&#xD;
      industry relationships are desired by patients and whether disclosures impact patients'&#xD;
      knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors. The tertiary aim is to investigate physicians' current&#xD;
      practices of disclosure and perceptions about the risks, benefits, and feasibility of using&#xD;
      patient disclosures to manage financial relationships, and to determine whether any physician&#xD;
      fears are borne out in practice once disclosures are implemented.&#xD;

      This study uses a mixed-methods design. A randomized intervention (RCT) will be a mailed&#xD;
      letter sent to approximately 1310 patients, disclosing their physicians' financial&#xD;
      relationships with industry before patients meet with their physicians. There are 4&#xD;
      experimental conditions, systematically varying the wording of the COI disclosures, and one&#xD;
      control condition. These patients will be briefly surveyed after they see their physicians,&#xD;
      using standardized measures of trust and other questions. The goal is to achieve a 65%&#xD;
      response rate (final n=850).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was determined based on a 0.3 unit change in Mayer Trust Scale adapted to&#xD;
      refer to &quot;physician&quot; rather than &quot;management&quot; between the subgroups using the POWER procedure&#xD;
      in SAS software version 9.3. In its original presentation, the Mayer Trust Scale lists a&#xD;
      standard deviation for the 4-item trust score as 0.66 - 0.68. A sample size of 850 patients&#xD;
      (170 in each of the 5 groups) would provide 82% power to detect a 0.3 unit difference in&#xD;
      Mayer Trust Scale after Bonferroni correction for the 10 possible comparisons, assuming a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 0.7 and that the significance level of 0.005 (0.05 / 10 comparisons)&#xD;
      would be used in these analyses. In addition, this sample size would allow for multivariable&#xD;
      regression models sufficient parameters to be fit following the suggested ratio of 10&#xD;
      patients for each predictor in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, to supplement patient-derived RCT survey results, approximately 25 Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic physicians with industry relationships over $20,000 will be interviewed to gather&#xD;
      their perspectives on COI disclosure. These interviews will occur before and after the RCT,&#xD;
      and will collect qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      content analysis, an iterative process of data immersion and data coding, whereby narrative&#xD;
      data is categorized into discrete codes based on thematic content and then used to compute&#xD;
      descriptive statistics.&#xD;
