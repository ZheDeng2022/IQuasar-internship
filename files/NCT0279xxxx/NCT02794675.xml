  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the use of a treatment called interstitial&#xD;
      brachytherapy for patients who have a high risk resectable (able to be treated with surgery)&#xD;
      recurrent head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy that uses radioactive seeds and implants them&#xD;
      into a specific place on your body. This study is using Cesium-131 permanent interstitial&#xD;
      brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cesium-131 is FDA approve for brachytherapy use, however, there are currently no research&#xD;
      studies to show how effective it is for head and neck cancer. The goal of this study is&#xD;
      determine the effect that the placement of Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds has on overall&#xD;
      survival as well as to assess possible side effects.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of Cesium 131 brachytherapy in subjects with resectable recurrent cancer&#xD;
      of the head and neck by evaluating disease free survival (DFS) and comparing to a previous&#xD;
      cohort. Potential effects on locoregional control rate and overall survival will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess toxicity associated with cesium 131 brachytherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Patients with a head and neck recurrent cancer who are planned to undergo&#xD;
      definitive tumor resection surgery that meet our inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      offered participation in this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's Follow-up. The participant's medical records will be reviewed every 3 months&#xD;
      for 24 months to assess: loco-regional control, distant metastasis free survival, disease&#xD;
      free survival, and overall survival. This will allow us to assess the potential treatment&#xD;
      effect of cesium 131.&#xD;

    <description>Cesium 131 is the radioactive isotope in the protocol. The prescribed dose will range from 50-80 Gy at maximal delivery. It comes in 0.5 cm seeds that will be placed in the tumor resection bed at 1cm intervals. They are implantable seeds that do not require removal.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent head and neck&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Based on clinical and radiographic evidence the tumor needs to be deemed resectable&#xD;
             preoperatively by the surgeon and when necessary (determined by the surgeon) tumor&#xD;
             board review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have potentially curable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance status ≥ 60% (ECOG/Zubrod 0,1,or 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 7.0 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with recurrent/previous treated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that is&#xD;
             deemed surgically resectable by the treating physician but at high risk for recurrence&#xD;
             due to concerns regarding close and/or margins due to locations on or near critical&#xD;
             structures such as internal or common carotid, skull base, deep cervical musculature,&#xD;
             and other areas that may limit the possibility of an enbloc resection. This group&#xD;
             otherwise would be considered for retreatment with radiation and/or chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients deemed to have un-resectable disease by the treating surgeon or upon tumor&#xD;
             board review.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with exposed carotid artery preoperatively requiring sacrifice or bypass&#xD;
                  intra-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients may have had a recent previous hospital admission (within 30 days) or be&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Unstable angina&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Severe hypothyroidism TSH &gt;10&#xD;
&#xD;
                       ---- Endocrine consult and intervention may allow participation at the&#xD;
                       discretion of the principal investigator for a thyroid-stimulating hormone&#xD;
                       (TSH) &gt; 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients deemed to be &quot;High Risk&quot; by pre admission testing (CPM) or by a&#xD;
                       preoperative risk assessment by the hospitalist for perioperative&#xD;
                       complications&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects with more than one site of distant metastatic disease (beyond the&#xD;
                       head and neck) as evidenced by computerized tomography (CT) scan or positron&#xD;
                       emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) or biopsy ---- A subject with a single lung&#xD;
                       nodule (deemed cancerous by PET/CT or Biopsy) will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with untreated brain metastases/central nervous system disease will be&#xD;
             excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they&#xD;
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Cesium 131 or other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because Cesium 131 has&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown,&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with Cesium 131, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with Cesium 131. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are HIV-positive will be excluded from the study. HIV-positive patients&#xD;
             on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with Cesium 131. In addition, these subjects are at&#xD;
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow suppressive therapy.&#xD;
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
