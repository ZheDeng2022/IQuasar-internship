      This feasibility study was developed to evaluate the proposed approaches for enrollment,&#xD;
      sample collection, interview and retention over a six-month vaccination period for the&#xD;
      clinical trial: &quot;A scientific evaluation of one and two doses of the bivalent and nonavalent&#xD;
      prophylactic HPV vaccines&quot; (1DT) currently under development . These aspects will be assessed&#xD;
      quantitatively and qualitatively by measuring the efforts needed to identify and recruit each&#xD;
      study participant, the participation rate for the study, and the retention rate at six&#xD;
      months, as well as collecting information on the acceptability of study procedures. To&#xD;
      supplement the assessment of the acceptability of the self-collected swab among older girls,&#xD;
      a parallel effort will be done at the end of this feasibility study. Combined, this&#xD;
      feasibility work will allow for modifications to the design, approaches and methods of the&#xD;
      new trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selection of study population and recruitment. Costa Rica is divided in provinces that are&#xD;
      further divided in cantons, which are subdivided into districts. Districts are conceptually&#xD;
      divided into minimal geo-statistical units (MGUs), territorial units roughly equivalent to a&#xD;
      block. These MGUs were defined by the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC) for&#xD;
      the national census conducted in 2011; digital maps and census data by age and gender for&#xD;
      MGUs are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study area being proposed for the 1DT was defined to reach an adequate catchment area in&#xD;
      order to fulfill 1DT enrollment goals of 20,000 girls. This defined area includes ~125,000&#xD;
      girls in regions where previous NCI/PEG studies were conducted as well as new provinces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the feasibility study, three urban and three rural districts from three different&#xD;
      provinces were selected: San Ignacio de Acosta and Tibas in San José; Desamparados and Cirri&#xD;
      Sur in Alajuela and, Liberia and San Antonio de Nicoya in Guanacaste. MGUs in these districts&#xD;
      will be ordered randomly and the first MGU within the selection will visited. An experienced&#xD;
      study outreach worker (OW) will visit all houses within the selected MGU and will enumerate&#xD;
      and collect information on all girls ages 12 to 16 residing in the MGU. At that time, if a&#xD;
      potentially-eligible girl is present, the OW will invite her to participate in the&#xD;
      feasibility study by informing her and her parent/legal guardian of the feasibility study,&#xD;
      and if interested, will assign a participant study ID (PID). The informed consent/assent&#xD;
      process for the feasibility study will be conducted at that time. Once consented/assented,&#xD;
      the girl will be appointed to a medical office close to her house, where she will be expected&#xD;
      to attend the feasibility study visit. If a potential participant or her parent/legal&#xD;
      guardian is not present, the OW will leave study materials with the household and arrange to&#xD;
      return at another time to discuss the study. The brochure will include a phone number in case&#xD;
      the girl/parents want to get additional information by phone. Within an MGU, five contact&#xD;
      attempts will be made per house. Once all houses in the selected MGU have been visited, if&#xD;
      fewer than 15 households of participants have been enrolled, the next random selected MGUs&#xD;
      will be visited (note, this is defined as girls in a household instead of individuals girls&#xD;
      since girls within a household will likely be correlated in their response rate). If 15 or&#xD;
      more households of participants have been enrolled after visiting the originally-selected&#xD;
      MGU, then the team will move to the next district. This procedure will be repeated until&#xD;
      approximately 15 girls have been enrolled in the district, but once an MGU is selected and&#xD;
      visited, all houses in that MGU should be visited before moving to another district, even if&#xD;
      more than 15 girls are enrolled, to allow for valid computation of the participation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the number of houses approached, average number of visits necessary to collect&#xD;
      information in each house (maximum of five visits), percentage of houses contacted during&#xD;
      first visit, subsequent visits, number of houses where it was not possible to obtain&#xD;
      information, number with girls in the age range, number of girls potentially eligible as&#xD;
      determined during home visit, number which consent and agree to attend a study visit, and the&#xD;
      true number of girls who attend the study visit, will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Study Clinic Visits. The guiding principle for the feasibility clinic visit is&#xD;
      that it should parallel the clinic visits planned for the 1DT up to the point of&#xD;
      randomization (which cannot be mocked in the feasibility study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent/assent/enrolment medical history. The first feasibility study clinic visit will start&#xD;
      with an explanation of the proposed informed consent and assent of the 1DT (in other words, a&#xD;
      mock consent procedure). Girls will be asked if they would be willing to participate in such&#xD;
      study. A clinician will then obtain a medical history from the girl and her parent/legal&#xD;
      guardians and, if the medical doctor considers necessary based on the medical history, she&#xD;
      will perform a physical examination to confirm good general health. Reproductive history and&#xD;
      hormonal contraceptive use will also be obtained by the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire. A self-administered questionnaire will then be administered. It will query&#xD;
      information on years of education, socio-economic status, menstrual history, sexual history,&#xD;
      and smoking. The questionnaire will be used to evaluate acceptance of self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire, perception of the sense of confidentiality of the answers provided, ability to&#xD;
      understand the questions, percentage of girls needing help and completeness of the responses.&#xD;
      Girls will be also presented with a picture of the female genital anatomy in order to&#xD;
      evaluate their capacity to identify where a self-collected swab should be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine. In the 1DT, all participants will be asked to collect 15mL urine specimens for a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test and to store residual volume for HPV testing. While we are not conducting the&#xD;
      pregnancy test or the HPV testing during this feasibility study, we aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      acceptability of collecting urine following the specific procedure needed to obtain urine&#xD;
      samples suitable for HPV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spit. In the 1DT, the immunogenicity subcohort will be asked to provide a saliva sample by&#xD;
      spitting into a cryovial using a straw for the evaluation of mucosal immune response. Thus,&#xD;
      we plan to investigate the acceptability of this sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood. In the 1DT, blood specimens will be collected from all participants at the two&#xD;
      vaccination visits, the twelve-month visit and yearly after that. The purpose of these blood&#xD;
      collections will be to monitor immune response to vaccination. We will ask participants in&#xD;
      the feasibility study to provide a total of 10 mL of blood. To assure that participation and&#xD;
      retention rates in our trial are not negatively affected by the blood draws, refusal to have&#xD;
      blood collected will be allowed, and will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-collected Cervicovaginal Sample. In the 1DT, self-collected cervicovaginal samples will&#xD;
      be used for HPV testing. Participants 15 and older who report having had sexual intercourse&#xD;
      will be asked to self-collect a cervicovaginal sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to protect participant confidentiality, study staff will administer detailed&#xD;
      instructions and materials for sample collection to all participants 15 and older&#xD;
      irrespective of sexual experience. All these participants will be instructed to collect the&#xD;
      sample only if appropriate (defined as being sexually active). Refusal to collect this&#xD;
      specimen among sexually-active girls will be documented. The self-collected cervicovaginal&#xD;
      samples collected as part of the feasibility study will be used to assess the adequacy of the&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked about their impressions of the study procedures and time expended.&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the visit, they will receive a voucher for HPV vaccination at a local&#xD;
      pharmacy, while in the 1DT, vaccination would be offered during the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six-month feasibility study visit. The second visit will occur six months following the&#xD;
      baseline study visit. Qualified staff will conduct the second feasibility study visit, which&#xD;
      will include a self-administered questionnaire addressing behaviors during the time between&#xD;
      the enrollment and six-month study visit, blood specimen collection, and among participants&#xD;
      age 15 and older who report having had sexual intercourse, a self-collected cervicovaginal&#xD;
      sample. After answering questions about their impressions on the second visit procedures,&#xD;
      they will receive a voucher for the second dose of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological specimens obtained from participants in this study will be processed and stored to&#xD;
      evaluate quality of the sample and to generate de-identified pools of specimens to be used as&#xD;
      quality control specimens for various assays planned as part of the overall planning for the&#xD;
      One-dose trial. This could allow for the formal evaluation of assay performance and testing&#xD;
      batch effects in our future testing and maximize the quality of the research we conduct.&#xD;
