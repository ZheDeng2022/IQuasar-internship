  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a national, prospective study designed to investigate the genetic etiologies of&#xD;
      non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) and other birth defects. At least half of prenatally&#xD;
      diagnosed NIHF cases remain of unknown etiology after standard work up, and a substantial&#xD;
      proportion of other birth defects remain of unknown etiology as well. The investigators are&#xD;
      performing exome sequencing (ES) for the affected fetus or neonate in unexplained cases, as&#xD;
      well as enrolling cases with a genetic explanation to represent the full spectrum of diseases&#xD;
      underlying NIHF and other birth defects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 1:1700 pregnancies are affected by non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF), and this&#xD;
      condition is associated with significant perinatal risks ranging from preterm birth to&#xD;
      Ballantyne (maternal mirror) syndrome, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Birth defects affect&#xD;
      1:33 pregnancies, and are the leading cause of infant death (contributing to approximately&#xD;
      20% of infant deaths). The investigators are performing exome sequencing (ES) for the&#xD;
      affected fetus or neonate in unexplained cases, as well as enrolling cases with a genetic&#xD;
      explanation to represent the full spectrum of diseases underlying NIHF and other birth&#xD;
      defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is open for enrollment by invitation. In addition to performing ES, the&#xD;
      investigators are collecting clinical data prospectively on all cases of NIHF and other birth&#xD;
      defects, including demographics, medical and obstetric history, prenatal and delivery course,&#xD;
      and postnatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific research aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Create registry of clinical data for cases of NIHF and other birth defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate genetic variants underlying NIHF and other birth defects via ES.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characterize the features and outcomes of genetic diseases presenting with NIHF and&#xD;
           other birth defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In particular, the researchers are focused on enrolling cases of increased nuchal&#xD;
                translucency, cystic hygroma, abnormal fetal fluid collection (even single fluid&#xD;
                compartments such as isolated pleural effusion), and/or frank NIHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will contribute novel information about the frequency and types of genetic&#xD;
      disorders in fetuses and newborns with a diagnosis of NIHF and other birth defects, enabling&#xD;
      providers to more accurately counsel about prognosis and individualize perinatal care. This&#xD;
      information will also facilitate informed decision-making for parents, allow the care team to&#xD;
      anticipate specific perinatal needs, and enable more precise counseling for the parents about&#xD;
      recurrence risks for NIHF and other birth defects. Further, the research will facilitate&#xD;
      future aims such as novel fetal therapies for genetic diseases.&#xD;

    <description>Both NIHF and birth defects can be caused by a variety of genetic variants that researchers are continuing to learn more about. Exome sequencing will yield information about the specific genetic variants present in cases of NIHF and other birth defects, and about the specific diseases implicated by these variants. Investigators will determine the proportion of cases seen in the setting of particular genetic variants, and will correlate phenotypic outcomes with specific genotypes.</description>
