  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least a 1-point Improvement Change From Baseline on the Allergan Infraorbital Hollows Scale (AIHS) Based on Evaluating Investigator's (EI) Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Screening) to Month 3 post last treatment (JUVÉDERM® VOLBELLA™ XC arm) or Month 3 post randomization (No-treatment Control arm)</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluating investigator assessed hollowing in both infraorbital areas using the 5-point photonumeric AIHS where: 0=none (no visible hollowing or volume loss medially or laterally), 1=minimal (presence of hollowing with some volume loss medial to the mid-pupillary line; smooth lateral lid-cheek transition), 2=moderate (defined hollowing extending laterally beyond the mid-pupillary line with moderate volume loss; smooth lateral lid-cheek transition with mild volume loss), 3=severe (defined hollowing extending laterally beyond the mid-pupillary line with moderate volume loss creating a defined groove along the lid-cheek junction), 4=extreme (defined hollowing extends from medial to lateral canthus; severe volume loss creates a marked step along the lid-cheek junction). The percentage of participants with at least a 1-point improvement change (decrease) in the AIHS is reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Improved or Much Improved in the Overall Aesthetic Assessment Based on EI's Assessment of the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at Month 3 After the Last Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Randomization) to Month 3 post last treatment (JUVÉDERM® VOLBELLA™ XC) or Month 3 post randomization (No-treatment Control arm)</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluating investigator assessed a participant's global aesthetic improvement in the infraorbital area compared to Baseline using the 5-point GAIS where: 2=much improved (marked improvement in appearance), 1=improved (improvement in appearance, but a touch-up or retreatment is indicated), 0=no change (appearance is essentially the same as the original condition), -1=worse (appearance is worse than the original condition), -2=much worse (appearance is much worse than the original condition). The percentage of participants where the EI selected improved or much improved is reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Randomization) to Month 3 post last treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed their global aesthetic improvement in the infraorbital area compared to Baseline using the 5-point GAIS where: 2=much improved (marked improvement in appearance), 1=improved (improvement in appearance, but a touch-up or retreatment is indicated), 0=no change (appearance is essentially the same as the original condition), -1=worse (appearance is worse than the original condition), -2=much worse (appearance is much worse than the original condition). The percentage of participants who selected improved or much improved is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Rasch-Transformed Score Based on Participant Responses on the FACE-Q™ Appraisal of Lower Eyelids Questionnaire to Month 3 After the Last Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Randomization) to Month 3 post last treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their overall satisfaction by using 7 questions on the validated Appraisal of Lower Eyelids module of the FACE-Q™ questionnaire. Each question was answered on a 4-point scale where: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=moderately, and 4=extremely bothered. The responses to the items were transformed to create a Rasch transformed score that ranges from 0=worst to 100=best. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>JUVÉDERM® VOLBELLA™ XC injectable gel was injected into the infraorbital and adjacent area at Randomization as determined by the investigator.

A maximum of 2.2 milliliter (mL) per side was injected for initial and touch-up treatments combined.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Rasch-Transformed Score Based on Participant Responses on the FACE-Q™ Appraisal of Lower Eyelids Questionnaire to Month 3 After the Last Treatment</title>
        <description>Participants assessed their overall satisfaction by using 7 questions on the validated Appraisal of Lower Eyelids module of the FACE-Q™ questionnaire. Each question was answered on a 4-point scale where: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=moderately, and 4=extremely bothered. The responses to the items were transformed to create a Rasch transformed score that ranges from 0=worst to 100=best. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
