    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well osimertinib, surgery, and radiation therapy work in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations.&#xD;
      Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.&#xD;
      Giving osimertinib, surgery, and radiation therapy may work better at treating non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer with EGFR mutations.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether, in patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naive or TKI&#xD;
      resistant (acquired T790M) metastatic EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who do&#xD;
      not progress after 6-12 weeks of induction osimertinib, local consolidative therapy (LCT;&#xD;
      radiotherapy +/- surgical resection) followed by osimertinib prolongs progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) compared with osimertinib alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves time to progression of non-irradiated&#xD;
      lesions (TTP-NIL) and time to appearance of new metastases (TANM) compared with osimertinib&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves the time to progression of target&#xD;
      versus (vs.) non-target lesions compared with osimertinib alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves progression-free survival compared&#xD;
      with osimertinib alone in TKI naive EGFR (L8585R/exon 19 deletion) mutant metastatic NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves progression-free survival compared&#xD;
      with osimertinib alone in TKI resistant (acquired T790M) EGFR mutant NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves progression-free survival compared with&#xD;
      osimertinib alone in the subgroup of patients with oligometastatic NSCLC (up to 3&#xD;
      metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib with and without LCT. VII. To&#xD;
      determine whether osimertinib plus LCT improves overall survival (OS) compared with&#xD;
      osimertinib alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To determine if there is a difference in survival outcomes or toxicity by radiation&#xD;
      treatment modality (protons vs. photons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the association of baseline genomic, proteomic and gene expression profiles&#xD;
      (from tumor, germline deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA], and cell free [cf]DNA) with clinical&#xD;
      benefit and in patients treated with osimertinib with or without LCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine modulation of genomic, proteomic and gene expression tumor profiles by&#xD;
      induction osimertinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore osimertinib resistance mechanisms. IV. To determine the immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effects of osimertinib plus LCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (LCT): Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6-12 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients then undergo surgery and/or radiation therapy daily for 5 consecutive days every&#xD;
      week for up to 8 weeks. Patients continue osimertinib during and after radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (NO LCT): Patients receive osimertinib PO QD. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days, then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

             plus spermicide, cervical/vault cap or intrauterine device), and abstinence. Patients&#xD;
             should not father a child for 6 months after completion of the study medication.&#xD;
             Patients should refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months&#xD;
             after discontinuing the study medication. If male patients wish to father children&#xD;
             they should be advised to arrange for freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of&#xD;
             the study medication&#xD;

                  followed for progression on study but will not be randomized&#xD;

                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in&#xD;
                  first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT&#xD;
                  interval&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded from randomization if they meet any of the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Complete response to osimertinib or prior treatment to all visible lesions, such&#xD;
                  that no lesion is amenable to LCT. Note that patients can receive palliative&#xD;
                  radiation therapy prior to randomization to CNS lesions or those requiring urgent&#xD;
                  treatment (e.g. for pain or bleeding), but are only eligible for the study if&#xD;
                  they have one site amenable to further radiation therapy. In addition, these&#xD;
                  lesions will be counted towards the total number of metastases, and will also be&#xD;
                  counted as target lesions&#xD;
