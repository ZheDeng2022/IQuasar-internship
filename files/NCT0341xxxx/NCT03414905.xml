  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indwelling tunneled pleural catheters have been successfully used to palliate dyspnea&#xD;
      associated with recurrent malignant pleural effusions with few complications and spontaneous&#xD;
      pleurodesis occurring in 30-50% of patients when using vacuum assisted drainage systems.&#xD;
      Notably, all data on palliation of dyspnea as well as on rates of spontaneous pleurodesis&#xD;
      have been performed using indwelling tunneled pleural catheters with vacuum assisted drainage&#xD;
      systems. No current data exists regarding the efficacy, complications or rate of spontaneous&#xD;
      pleurodesis when using indwelling tunneled pleural catheters and non-vacuum assisted drainage&#xD;
      systems. This study is designed to evaluate an indwelling tunneled pleural catheter with a&#xD;
      non-vacuum assisted drainage system for the management of recurrent malignant pleural&#xD;
      effusions.&#xD;

    <measure>Relief of dyspnea as measured using the Visual Analog Scale for Dyspnea (VAS-Dyspnea)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 2 weeks following catheter insertion</time_frame>
    <description>This will be determined based on the difference between the VAS-Dyspnea score on the day of catheter insertion prior to catheter insertion compared with the VAS-Dyspnea score on the 2 week follow up visit&#xD;
The scale presents the question &quot;how much shortness of breath are you having right now?&quot; with a straight line. At one end it states &quot;no shortness of breath&quot; and the other end is &quot;shortness of breath as bad as can be&quot;. The participant will mark the line on how they feel&#xD;
No shortness is breath is 0% score and shortness of breath as bad as can be is 100% score</description>

&#xD;
          -  Male or female, at least 18 years of age, inclusive&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  There is cytological confirmation of pleural malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The effusion is an exudate (per Light's criteria Pleural fluid protein/Serum&#xD;
                  protein &gt;0.5, Pleural fluid LDH/Serum LDH &gt;0.6, or Pleural fluid LDH &gt;2/3 the&#xD;
                  upper limit of normal) in the context of histocytologically proven malignancy&#xD;
