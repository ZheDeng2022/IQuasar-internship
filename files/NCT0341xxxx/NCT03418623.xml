  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at examining whether GET73 modulates the indices of central glutamate and&#xD;
      γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in recently abstinent subjects that meet Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorder (AUD) criteria, as measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      (¹H-MRS), in order to provide a human translation of the findings demonstrated in different&#xD;
      preclinical models, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the study will examine the&#xD;
      effects of GET73 on alcohol cue induced brain activation by using a well-established&#xD;
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) paradigm in the same&#xD;
      individuals. In summary, the study should provide important information on (i) the potential&#xD;
      mechanism of action of GET73, (ii) on the brain mechanisms that would support its potential&#xD;
      use for reduction in craving and drinking in AUD patients, and (iii) expand data on its safe&#xD;
      use as a medication in heavy drinking individuals.&#xD;

      This study is aimed at examining whether GET73 modulates the indices of central glutamate and&#xD;
      γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in recently abstinent subjects that meet Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorder (AUD) criteria, as measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      (¹H-MRS), in order to provide a human translation of the findings demonstrated in different&#xD;
      preclinical models, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the study will examine the&#xD;

      individuals. In summary, the study should provide important information on (i) the potential&#xD;
      mechanism of action of GET73, (ii) on the brain mechanisms that would support its potential&#xD;
      use for reduction in craving and drinking in AUD patients, and (iii) expand data on its safe&#xD;
      use as a medication in heavy drinking individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolment period will last approximately 18 to 21 months. For each subject the study will&#xD;
      last 25 to 45 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether GET73 modulates central glutamate&#xD;
      levels in recently abstinent individuals with AUD, using proton nuclear magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy (¹H-MRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate whether GET73 modulates central GABA levels in recently abstinent&#xD;
           individuals with AUD, using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H-MRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate whether GET73 affects alcohol cue induced brain activity in reward areas of&#xD;
           brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore whether the effects of GET73 on glutamate and GABA levels are related to its&#xD;
           effects on alcohol cue induced brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Objective To evaluate the safety profile of GET73 in individuals with AUD, comparing&#xD;
      Adverse Events (AEs) occurrence during GET73 treatment period vs placebo treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a within-subject cross-over, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being a double blinded study, GET73 and placebo will be packaged identically. Both the&#xD;
      Investigator and the study participant will be unaware of the treatment administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product will be supplied to the Center packaged in &quot;patient kits&quot;. Each&#xD;
      &quot;patient kit&quot; will be made of 2 bottles (bottle A and bottle B) each containing 20 capsules&#xD;
      of either GET73 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being a cross-over design, all participants will receive both placebo and active treatment.&#xD;
      The sequential order in which they will be administered to each participant will be defined&#xD;
      by the randomization list. The participant will always receive bottle A in the phase A of the&#xD;
      study and bottle B in phase B, but the content of the two bottles varies according to the&#xD;
      randomization list. Research personnel will be blind to the content of the bottles, i.e. what&#xD;
      study medication the subject is taking.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After the eligibility of a subject has been determined in an initial screening period, the study will be conducted in 2 consecutive phases: in the first phase (phase A) the participant will be administered GET73 or placebo in a randomized order, in the other phase (phase B), the participant will be administered the treatment not received during phase A.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The study will be double-blinded. At initiation visit the Investigator will be instructed on the method for blind breaking. The Contract Research Organization (CRO) will provide the Investigator with a set of sealed envelopes, each containing the unblinding information for a patient kit; the envelopes will be kept in the Pharmacy until the end of the study. A second set of sealed envelopes will be kept by the Sponsor pharmacovigilance officer.&#xD;
Unblinding codes should only be used in emergency situations for reasons of patient safety. The Investigator should contact the Sponsor before breaking the blind or the Sponsor should be informed immediately afterwards. The reason for breaking the blind must be fully documented and entered on the case report form.&#xD;
The unblinding envelopes will be checked for integrity by the Clinical Research Associate (CRA) and returned to the Sponsor at the end of the study.&#xD;
The subjects for whom the blind will be broken will be withdrawn from the study.</masking_description>
