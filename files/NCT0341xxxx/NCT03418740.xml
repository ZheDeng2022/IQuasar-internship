      The purpose of this study is to identify ways to follow progression of Friedreich's Ataxia&#xD;
      (FA) and be able to measure changes over time in children with FA. Participants will have&#xD;
      biannual visits to observe how the disease progresses over time and determine the rate of&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators seek to identify biological and clinical tests to be used in future clinical&#xD;
      trials. The purpose of this research study is to learn more about Friedreich's Ataxia (FA)&#xD;
      progression in children. There will be biannual visits which will include a core set of tests&#xD;
      and procedures. These include: a collection of medical history, detailed neurological exam,&#xD;
      ataxia scales, and health questionnaires. At each visit, blood and cheek swab samples will be&#xD;
      obtained to monitor frataxin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A select number of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) participants will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to participate in further procedures to better understand how FA affects&#xD;
      different tissues. These include a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan and a Motor Evoked&#xD;
      Potentials (MEP) procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI scan analyzes how muscle activity is affected in FA. The magnet will be used to&#xD;
      capture images of the calf muscle before and after exercising on an ergonomic foot pedal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MEP procedure measures how strong the connection is between the brain's motor cortex and&#xD;
      a selected body part, specifically the participant's dominant hand.&#xD;

        This study will primarily take place at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP),&#xD;
        with a select number of subjects only participating in the clinical testing at the&#xD;
        University of Florida and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). The investigators&#xD;
        expect to recruit approximately 100 children across all three sites and study each of them&#xD;
        over a 3 year period. Children with a genetically or clinically confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
        Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) will be offered participation.&#xD;
