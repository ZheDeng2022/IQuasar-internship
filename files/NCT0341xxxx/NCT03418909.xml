  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the treatment related effects of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) or&#xD;
      oncological treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with a 1-year follow up.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are enrolled prospectively at the department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck&#xD;
      Surgery &amp; Audiology at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients with histologically verified squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx&#xD;
      regardless of treatment option (as long as the intent is curative) can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures are assessed at baseline and repeated 3 and 12 months after treatment.&#xD;
