  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the null hypothesis that use of antioxidant supplements during&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy will have no impact on toxicities and disease-free, as well as overall,&#xD;
      survival, and also evaluate the role of polymorphisms in genes related to oxidative stress in&#xD;
      relation to treatment outcomes.&#xD;

      This study will enroll 3000 women from S0221with node positive or high-risk node-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer receiving AC+T onto this ancillary study to address the following specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize use of antioxidant supplements with a survey instrument prior to and at&#xD;
           completion of treatment, and to evaluate reported use pre and post treatment in relation&#xD;
           to toxicity and disease-free survival. The potential effects of diet, physical activity,&#xD;
           and other lifestyle factors on relationships between supplement use and treatment&#xD;
           outcomes will also be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate if variants (polymorphisms) in genes that produce reactive oxygen species&#xD;
           (ROS) (MPO) and in genes that protect cells from the effects of ROS are associated with&#xD;
           treatment-related toxicities and with disease-free survival.&#xD;
