  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral cancer is a serious and growing problem in many parts of the globe. Oral cancer is the&#xD;
      eighth most common cancer worldwide.The annual estimated incidence is around 275,000 for oral&#xD;
      and 130,300 for pharyngeal cancers excluding nasopharynx, two-thirds of these cases occurring&#xD;
      in developing countries. In Pakistan, it is the second most common cancer in women and third&#xD;
      most common cancer in men. The Age Standardized Rates (ASR) for oral cancers are 13.8 and&#xD;
      14.1 in males and females respectively.To the best of investigators knowledge, no&#xD;
      intervention study has been done to improve knowledge and awareness of adults regarding&#xD;
      association of areca nut/betel quid with oral cancer. Therefore, the study aims to implement&#xD;
      a cluster randomized intervention trial in secondary schools to improve the knowledge and&#xD;
      awareness regarding this association among children 11-16 years. For resource poor countries&#xD;
      such as Pakistan, it is imperative to prevent oral cancer by improving knowledge about its&#xD;
      important risk factor such as betel quid, areca nut and chew tobacco. A school-based&#xD;
      intervention study will be carried out in secondary schools in Karachi. The target population&#xD;
      will be male and female school students in school grades 6 to 10 with intervention group and&#xD;
      control group at each site. School-based educational intervention will be given to the&#xD;
      intervention group while no specific education will be given to the control group.&#xD;
      Differences in attitudes, knowledge and behaviors between the intervention and control groups&#xD;
      will be compared each site separately before and after the intervention. The minimum sample&#xD;
      size required was 22 schools (clusters). The number of subjects in each arm will be 529 with&#xD;
      average cluster size of 50. The selected schools will be randomly assigned to a control group&#xD;
      or Interventions group. Randomization will be done at the school level to avoid contamination&#xD;
      between groups.The health education programme will be conducted for 3 consecutive weeks in&#xD;
      one academic year for all the selected schools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral cancer is a serious and growing problem in many parts of the globe. Oral cancer is the&#xD;
      eighth most common cancer worldwide. There is a wide geographical variation (approximately&#xD;
      20-fold) in the incidence of this cancer. In South and South East Asia, 40% of the people&#xD;
      with cancers have been diagnosed with it. Age-adjusted rates of oral cancer in India is high,&#xD;
      that is, 20 per 100,000 population and accounts for over 30% of all cancers in the country.&#xD;
      In Pakistan, it is the second most common cancer in women and third most common cancer in&#xD;
      men.The Age Standardized Rates (ASR) for oral cancers are 13.8 and 14.1 in males and females&#xD;
      respectively. Smoking, alcohol consumption and sunlight have been implicated in the&#xD;
      development of oral cancers in the developed countries. In addition to these, developing&#xD;
      countries have their own set of risk factors.These include poor infrastructure of the health&#xD;
      care system, illiteracy, poor socioeconomic status. A common risk factor shared by&#xD;
      populations from all over the world is substance abuse.There exists a large volume of&#xD;
      literature which links betel nut, areca, chewable tobacco and tobacco with development of&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study from South Asia have reported the risk of oral cancer and the use of oral tobacco in&#xD;
      various forms including ''paan'' with and without tobacco. A case-control study from Thailand&#xD;
      reported that, among all components of the betel quid, the presence in the quid of red slaked&#xD;
      lime had the strongest effect on the risk of oral cancer (OR,10.67; 95% CI = 2.27-50.08). A&#xD;
      recently published meta-analysis also explores the relationship between betel quid chewing&#xD;
      and risk of oral and oropharyngeal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral diseases are a major global health burden despite considerable investment in research&#xD;
      and dental services. A meta-analysis of fifteen case control studies (4,648 cases; 7,847&#xD;
      controls) has shown betel quid to have an independent positive association with oral cancer,&#xD;
      with OR = 2.82 (95% CI = 2.35-3.40). Studies conducted in Pakistan report about knowledge,&#xD;
      perception and correlation of betel quid and head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to implement a cluster randomized intervention trial in secondary schools to&#xD;
      improve the knowledge and awareness regarding this association among children 6-10 years. For&#xD;
      resource poor countries such as Pakistan, it is imperative to prevent oral cancer by&#xD;
      improving knowledge about its important risk factor such as betel quid, areca nut and chew&#xD;
      tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A school-based intervention study will be carried out in secondary schools in Karachi. The&#xD;
      target population will be male and female school students in school grades 6 to 10 with&#xD;
      intervention group and control group at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using the computer program WHO ACluster. The minimum sample size&#xD;
      required is 22 schools (clusters) with 95% confidence interval, 80% power, and ICC= 0.2. The&#xD;
      difference to be detected was 2 with standard deviation 9.5. The number of subjects in each&#xD;
      arm will be 529 with average cluster size of 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-stage cluster sampling with stratification based on school type (government or private)&#xD;
      will be employed. A multistage cluster sampling with stratification on school type&#xD;
      (government or private) will be employed for the selection of schools and recruitment of&#xD;
      adolescents. After stratification schools will be selected randomly proportionate to the&#xD;
      number of type of school from district east of Karachi. Each school will be considered as a&#xD;
      cluster. Schools will be the primary unit of randomization. Recruitment of participating&#xD;
      schools will be based on the willingness to participate in the study. One class will be&#xD;
      selected randomly from each of selected secondary (grades 6-10) schools and all the students&#xD;
      in the selected classes will be invited to participate in the survey. Hence, equal number of&#xD;
      clusters will be selected in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected schools will be randomly assigned to a control group or Interventions group.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done at the school level to avoid contamination between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval for the design and data collection procedures was obtained beforehand from the&#xD;
      ethics committee of the School. An approval was obtained from school authority after&#xD;
      explaining the purpose of the study. Written informed consent was taken from all&#xD;
      participating schools and it will be communicated to the students that participation is&#xD;
      completely voluntary. Absolute confidentiality of the data will be maintained throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      School-based educational intervention will be given to the intervention group while no&#xD;
      specific education will be given to the control group. Pre and post-test questionnaires will&#xD;
      be administered one week before and one week after the program intervention, respectively.&#xD;
      Tests will be administered in the students' usual classroom by research assistants under the&#xD;
      supervision of the researchers who are not affiliated with the schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Programme:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health education programme will be conducted for 2 consecutive weeks in one academic year&#xD;
      for all the selected schools. The intervention programme will comprise of health education&#xD;
      sessions that will emphasize on the hazard of betel quid and areca nut and chew tobacco. This&#xD;
      will be conducted through posters, pictorial booklets, video shows, and short documentaries&#xD;
      on the hazards of use of various tobacco products. The programme will be conducted by a&#xD;
      trained team. Educational materials about hazards of betel quid and areca nut will be&#xD;
      distributed to both intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The programme will be conducted by a professional team of physicians trained in this field. A&#xD;
      one-day training session for the program providers will be designed to maximize the success&#xD;
      of the program implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will perform analysis using STATA version 12. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      computed for categorical variables by computing their frequencies &amp; assessed by chi square.&#xD;
      The distribution of quantitative variables will be computed by their means and standard&#xD;
      deviations &amp; assessed by independent t test or median with inter-quartile range (IQR)&#xD;
      depending on distribution of the variables. Investigators will perform multivariable analysis&#xD;
      using generalizing estimating equation (GEE) to consider the clustering structure of the&#xD;
      data. Crude odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated using&#xD;
      univariate GEE. All the variables with a p-value of less than 25% significance will be&#xD;
      selected for inclusion in the multivariable analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confounding will be assessed by change in estimate of coefficient by 15%. After developing&#xD;
      main effect model, significance of all biologically plausible interactions will be evaluated&#xD;
      for inclusion in multivariable model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis will be conducted, if required, after completion of 50% of the follow-ups to&#xD;
      see the effect of educational intervention programme on the participant's knowledge.&#xD;
