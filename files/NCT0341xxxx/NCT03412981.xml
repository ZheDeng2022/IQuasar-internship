  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date very little research has been conducted on pregnant mothers. Research shows that&#xD;
      mothers with obesity and gestational diabetes have children who have a higher risk of later&#xD;
      developing obesity and diabetes compared to children born to non-obese mothers but the&#xD;
      mechanisms are not known. The maternal environment may place these babies at greater risk and&#xD;
      it is possible that fat tissue (adipose tissue) releases many chemicals (adipokines and&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines) which may have an impact on the baby. Mothers who have greater&#xD;
      amounts of adipose tissue most likely release these adipokines into the baby and it may&#xD;
      affect the baby's body composition and/or health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will establish if there is a relationship between obesity and adipose tissue&#xD;
      inflammation in pregnant mothers, and if there is a link between inflammation and the child's&#xD;
      body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit mothers with low risk pregnancies already schedule for a C section at about&#xD;
      36 wk. We will do initial testing at 36 wk, adipose tissue collection at delivery, and&#xD;
      conduct post testing at 1 month postpartum on the mother and the baby.&#xD;

      Study 1 Visit 1: Sign consent form, age, height, weight, and completion of questionnaires&#xD;
      (e.g. food record). Consent will allow the investigators to gain access to medical record to&#xD;
      record pregnancy-related health information on the mother (e.g., prenatal care including but&#xD;
      not limited to maternal vital signs, clinical documents and fetal well-being - such as #&#xD;
      pregnancies; reason for scheduled C-section; starting body weight and weight gain during&#xD;
      pregnancy; BP throughout pregnancy; glucose challenge test (GCT) and glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      (GTT) results; disease history; medications; pregnancy complications). The investigators will&#xD;
      also access any fetal monitoring (e.g., including any cardiac ultrasounds that may have been&#xD;
      performed.) Screening fasting bloods - glucose, insulin, HbA1c, blood lipids, CRP,&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokine panel (TNFa, IL-6, IL-4, IL-13), adipokines (adiponectin, leptin), and&#xD;
      sex hormones (e.g., estradiol, testosterone, progesterone). The investigators will also&#xD;
      perform a limited ultrasound to assess fetal cardiac function and adiposity at this time.&#xD;
      Subjects will be given a physical activity monitor to wear for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: C-section: At this visit during the C-section, a sample (~1000 mg/depot) of omental&#xD;
      and subcutaneous fat samples will be taken for assessment of inflammatory genes/proteins.&#xD;
      Cord blood (~15 ml) for assessment of inflammatory genes/proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: 1 month post-partum Mother: Resting blood pressure, fasting blood sample (glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, HbA1c, blood lipids, CRP, inflammatory cytokine panel (TNFa, IL-6, IL-4, IL-13),&#xD;
      adipokines (adiponectin, leptin)), sex hormones (estradiol, progesterone, testosterone), and&#xD;
      body composition measurement. Completion of questionnaires. Subjects will be given a physical&#xD;
      activity monitor to wear for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 Women will only be recruited to complete the C-section as described above They will&#xD;
      have the option to have the baby measured in the pea pod and to wear a physical activity&#xD;
      monitor for a week in the month before delivery.&#xD;
