        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male between 18-50 years of age, inclusive, on the date of signing the Informed&#xD;
             Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Judged by the investigator to be in good health based upon the results of a medical&#xD;
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and clinical safety&#xD;
             laboratory tests prior to the initial study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Clinical safety laboratory test results must be within the laboratory reference ranges&#xD;
             for males or test results that are outside the reference ranges for males need to be&#xD;
             considered non clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator. One retest&#xD;
             is allowed if deemed appropriate by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Liver function tests must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &lt;1.2x the&#xD;
                  upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Bilirubin not greater than ULN, however documented Gilbert's syndrome is&#xD;
                  acceptable. One retest is allowed if deemed appropriate by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject's screening ECG is considered normal or abnormal but clinically&#xD;
             non-significant. QTcF must not exceed 450 msec. First degree heart block will not be&#xD;
             considered as a significant abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) â‰¥ 80% of predicted normal for age, gender&#xD;
             and height at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Discontinuation of all medications (including over-the-counter and/or prescription&#xD;
             medication, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, vitamins and/or herbal supplements)&#xD;
             except occasional paracetamol (maximum dose of 2 g/day and maximum of 10 g/2 weeks) at&#xD;
             least 2 weeks prior to the first study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Negative drug and alcohol screen (opiates, methadone, cocaine, amphetamines [including&#xD;
             ecstasy], cannabinoids, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and&#xD;

             evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known hypersensitivity to study drug ingredients or a significant allergic reaction to&#xD;
             any drug as determined by the investigator, such as anaphylaxis requiring&#xD;
             hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Positive serology for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus&#xD;

             if calculated result â‰¤ 80 mL/min, a 24 hour urine collection to determine actual value&#xD;
             can be done) or other conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism, or excretion of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of malignancy within the past 5 years (except for basal cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has been treated and with no evidence of recurrence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Treatment with any drug known to have a well-defined potential for toxicity to a major&#xD;

             the initial drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Active drug or alcohol abuse (an average intake of more than 21 glasses of wine or&#xD;
             beer or equivalent/week) within 2 years prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participation in a drug, drug/device or biologic investigational research study within&#xD;
             12 weeks or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug, if the half-life is known&#xD;
             (whichever is longer) prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any condition or circumstances that in the opinion of the investigator may make a&#xD;
