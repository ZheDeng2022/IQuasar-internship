      Objective: This randomized and controlled trial was aimed at exploring the effect of a new&#xD;
      mentalization-focused 4D interactive ultrasound and a week-by-week pregnancy diary&#xD;
      intervention with substance-abusing pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Pregnant women referred to the hospital maternity outpatient clinic from primary&#xD;
      health care due to substance abuse were recruited to participate in a randomized and&#xD;
      controlled study. At admission, a psychiatric nurse offered all eligible women an opportunity&#xD;
      for participation. A written informed consent was obtained from all participants included in&#xD;
      the study. The participants were randomized into the intervention and control groups using a&#xD;
      computer-generated block-randomization with block size of four. A separate randomization&#xD;
      assignment was used for women in medication-assisted treatment for opioid dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group subjects were offered three mentalization-focused interactive 4D&#xD;
      ultrasounds at 24, 30 and 34 gestational weeks and a mentalization-focused week-by-week&#xD;
      pregnancy diary combined with three antenatal sessions and an option for one diary session&#xD;
      after delivery. The control group received active treatment as usual in an obstetric tertiary&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pregnant woman and the child were followed-up until the child was one year old. The&#xD;
      primary outcome was prenatal maternal depressive symptoms post-intervention, and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes were anxiety symptoms, prenatal parental mentalization, maternal-fetal attachment&#xD;
      and substance abuse. Other outcomes were utilisation of prenatal care, perinatal outcome,&#xD;
      neonatal withdrawal symptoms and neonatal neurobehavior, postnatal maternal depressive and&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms, parental mentalization, experienced stress from parenting and experienced&#xD;
      social support, and emotional connection and commitment with the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted at the hospital maternity outpatient clinic for substance-abusing&#xD;
      pregnant women at Turku University Hospital (Finland) between October 2011 and December 2015.&#xD;
      The registration of the trial is made retrospectively, but the research plan and outcomes are&#xD;
      reported in this registration as they were originally documented in the research plan&#xD;
      approved by The Joint Ethics Committee of the University of Turku and the Hospital District&#xD;
      of Southwest Finland on 14th of June 2011.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this controlled trial was to explore the effect of a new mentalization-focused 4D&#xD;
      interactive ultrasound and a week-by-week pregnancy diary intervention with substance-abusing&#xD;
      pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial was conducted at the maternity outpatient clinic for substance-abusing pregnant&#xD;
      women at Turku University Hospital, Finland, between October 2011 and December 2015. At Turku&#xD;
      University Hospital there is a specialized antenatal outpatient clinic for pregnant women&#xD;
      with substance abuse problems. Pregnant women referred to this facility from primary health&#xD;
      care due to substance abuse were invited to participate the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At admission, a psychiatric nurse offered all eligible women an opportunity to participate in&#xD;
      the randomized trial. A written informed consent was obtained from all individual&#xD;
      participants included in the study. The participants were randomized into the intervention&#xD;
      and control groups using a computer-generated block-randomization with block size of four,&#xD;
      and a separate randomization assignment was used for women in medication-assisted treatment&#xD;
      for opioid addiction. In post-intervention phase at 35 gestational weeks, all participants&#xD;
      were compensated with a 20 euros gift card targeted to the infant's needs. The research plan&#xD;
      was approved by The Joint Ethics Committee of the University of Turku and the Hospital&#xD;
      District of Southwest Finland on the 14th of June 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the intervention and the control condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group subjects were offered three mentalization-focused interactive 4D&#xD;
      ultrasounds at 24, 30 and 34 gestational weeks and a mentalization-focused week-by-week&#xD;
      pregnancy diary combined with three prenatal sessions and option for one diary session after&#xD;
      delivery. Detailed intervention method description including a theoretical background of the&#xD;
      intervention is already published and available (Pajulo et al. 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mentalization-focused interactive use of 4D ultrasound imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Three interactive 4D ultrasound sessions were offered for the intervention group&#xD;
           participants at 24, 30 and 34 gestational weeks at the maternity outpatient clinic. The&#xD;
           pregnant women participated in the sessions alone. The ultrasound sessions took around&#xD;
           20-30 minutes, and were performed by an experienced obstetrician and an infant mental&#xD;
           health professional working in cooperation. The sessions were based on the intervention&#xD;
           method called &quot;ultrasound consultation&quot; (Boukydis &amp; Stockman, 2012; Boukydis, 2006)&#xD;
           where the idea is to observe the fetus together with the parent(s); the fetal features,&#xD;
           position, sleep-awake rhythm, personal characteristics, activities in the uterus and&#xD;
           responses to mother's initiatives for interaction.The aim is to evoke the mother's&#xD;
           active interest in this particular child and hence to enhance parental mentalization and&#xD;
           maternal-fetal attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The mentalization-focused week-by-week pregnancy diary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To keep the fetus more actively in the mother's mind across pregnancy, a new&#xD;
      mentalization-focused pregnancy diary was designed for the intervention group. Three prenatal&#xD;
      meetings (45 minutes) with the infant mental health professional were offered for reflecting&#xD;
      the mother's experiences on using the diary. The diary contains short sections for each&#xD;
      pregnancy week including information about pregnancy, fetal development and health promoting&#xD;
      practices. The key elements in the diary are the mentalization-focused questions and tasks&#xD;
      encouraging the pregnant woman to reflect on her fetus and pregnancy and becoming a parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention and control group received active treatment as usual in an obstetric&#xD;
      tertiary setting, and treatment as usual formed the control condition for the intervention.&#xD;
      The treatment was offered by a multidisciplinary team consisting of an obstetrician, a&#xD;
      midwife, a social worker and a psychiatric nurse . The patients were referred to addiction&#xD;
      and psychiatric treatment when needed. The Child Protection Services were involved in&#xD;
      prenatal phase in accordance with the Finnish legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was prenatal maternal depressive symptoms post-intervention, and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes were anxiety symptoms, prenatal parental mentalization, maternal-fetal&#xD;
      attachment and substance abuse. Other outcomes were utilisation of prenatal care, perinatal&#xD;
      outcome, neonatal withdrawal symptoms and neonatal neurobehavior, postnatal maternal&#xD;
      depressive and anxiety symptoms, parental mentalization, experienced stress from parenting&#xD;
      and experienced social support, and emotional connection and commitment with the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pregnant woman and her child were followed-up until the child was one year old. The data&#xD;
      was collected from multiple sources: standardized measures, questionnaires constructed for&#xD;
      the study and information available from hospital medical records. As a part of routine&#xD;
      clinical practice, the pregnant women were interviewed by the psychiatric nurse and the&#xD;
      social worker. The interviews based on the European Addiction Severity Index-questionnaire&#xD;
      (EuropASI) (Kokkevi &amp; Hartgers, 1995), where the items regard maternal physical and mental&#xD;
      health, substance abuse, employment and income, legal status and close relationships.&#xD;
      Sociodemographic data was obtained by a ten-item questionnaire at baseline. Information&#xD;
      regarding maternal psychiatric diagnosis and/or history was based on documented self-report&#xD;
      or medical records. Information regarding maternal substance abuse was obtained through the&#xD;
      medical records, and was based on maternal self-report or clinical documentation&#xD;
      (intoxications, urine screening results, marks indicating intravenous substance abuse).&#xD;
      Meconium sample was collected after birth for detection of illicit drugs. Data regarding&#xD;
      utilisation of obstetric care and perinatal outcome was obtained from hospital medical&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standardized measures used to assess maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms,&#xD;
      maternal-fetal attachment and parental mentalization were administered during pregnancy at&#xD;
      two time points, i.e. before and after intervention (&lt; 24th and &gt; 34th gestational weeks,&#xD;
      respectively). Routine postnatal follow-up visits at the socio pediatric unit were conducted&#xD;
      when the infant was at 3 months and 1 year age. Standardized measures were administered&#xD;
      during those follow-up visits to assess maternal postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms,&#xD;
      parental mentalization, experienced stress from parenting and experienced social support, and&#xD;
      emotional connection and commitment with the baby. Medical records concerning health and&#xD;
      psychosocial situation of the mother and infant were available, based on informed consent,&#xD;
      until the child was one year old. The assessment time points and measures were the same for&#xD;
      both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registration of the trial is made retrospectively, but the research plan and outcomes are&#xD;
      reported in this registration as they were originally documented in the research plan&#xD;
      approved by The Joint Ethics Committee of the University of Turku and the Hospital District&#xD;
      of Southwest Finland on 14th of June 2011.&#xD;
