  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Watering eyes (epiphora) is a very common ophthalmic condition. It is frequently caused by&#xD;
      dysfunction of the lacrimal (tear) drainage system which is the 'pipework' that takes tears&#xD;
      from the eye to the nasal cavity. If the system is completely blocked then the patient is&#xD;
      offered surgery to unblock or bypass the obstruction. However, the system is often either&#xD;
      partially obstructed, or there is tear drainage delay despite there being no apparent&#xD;
      obstruction (functional obstruction). Currently this is investigated with two separate scans,&#xD;
      conducted at different times in different departments (CT and nuclear medicine). These are&#xD;
      dacryocystography (DCG) and dacryoscintigraphy (DSG) and both are required as they have&#xD;
      different limitations and benefits. Moreover DCG is a CT scan that uses radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional magnetic resonance dacryocystography (MR DCG) is increasingly widely used in other&#xD;
      fields of medicine (e.g. cardiology) because of the increasing acquisition speed and&#xD;
      resolution of MRI scanners in recent years. The investigators anticipate functional MRI of&#xD;
      the lacrimal drainage system (i.e. scanning as eye drops are instilled and pass down the&#xD;
      system) will overcome the shortcomings of DCG and DSG, by simultaneously providing both good&#xD;
      anatomical detail and physiological images. Various methods of MR DCG have been described in&#xD;
      the literature and there is no standard protocol for this procedure as of current. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators aim to develop a protocol for MR DCG that can be used in routine&#xD;
      radiological practice in place of DCG and DSG and get pilot data on tear drainage in&#xD;
      participants with known delayed tear drainage and controls with normal tear drainage systems.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tear drainage delay is a common problem that causes a watery eye. This can impair activities&#xD;
      of daily living such as reading and driving, can be a huge nuisance requiring continual&#xD;
      dabbing with a tissue and can cause infections and abscesses of the tear drainage system. The&#xD;
      current, standard investigations for tear drainage delay have significant limitations with&#xD;
      two separate scans in separate departments being required. A functional MRI scan would be&#xD;
      able to combine these two scans and provide both better anatomical and functional detail than&#xD;
      each one respectively. This would have several major benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improved diagnostic information to guide the treatment choice&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduced scan resource usage as one scan would provide all the required functional&#xD;
           anatomical and functional information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improved patient convenience&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improved safety as radiation is used for CT DCG, where MRI The study involves&#xD;
           investigation of both controls with normal tear drainage and individuals with known tear&#xD;
           drainage delay. Both groups are required for the development of the protocol as the&#xD;
           speed of tear transit will differ greatly which will facilitate optimisation of the MRI&#xD;
           scan protocol. This will also provide preliminary data on the speed of tear passage in a&#xD;
           normal lacrimal drainage system and in an impaired system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several other functional lacrimal drainage MRI studies have been done. However, a clear&#xD;
      protocol has not been developed and there is no data on normal and abnormal MRI appearances&#xD;
      and tear transit times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal standard of care will not be delayed by this investigation as it will be conducted&#xD;
      while patients are awaiting other lacrimal investigations (DCG and DSG) or lacrimal surgery,&#xD;
      none of which would be affected by this study.&#xD;
