    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory process which causes a local and systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response syndrome (SIRS). Although the majority of patients have a mild disease course,&#xD;
      around 20% will develop moderate or severe pancreatitis, with necrosis of the (peri)&#xD;
      pancreatic tissue and/or multiple-organ failure. Previous studies have correlated colonic&#xD;
      involvement as a prognostic marker in acute pancreatitis. It is well known that translocation&#xD;
      of the colonic flora may significantly influence the clinical course of patients with acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis. The correlation between collection(s) around colon in CT finding and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes has not been studied in necrotizing pancreatitis. In current study, the&#xD;
      investigators will do a prospective observational study correlating collection(s) around the&#xD;
      colon and clinical course of patients in acute necrotizing pancreatitis.&#xD;

      Introduction and rationale of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pancreatitis is the leading gastrointestinal cause of hospitalization in the US, with&#xD;
      270,000 admissions annually. Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory process which causes a&#xD;
      local and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Although the majority of patients&#xD;
      have a mild disease course, around 20% will develop moderate or severe pancreatitis, with&#xD;
      necrosis of the (peri) pancreatic tissue and/or multiple-organ failure About 5-10% of&#xD;
      patients develop necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma, the peripancreatic tissue or both. A&#xD;
      collection containing variable amounts of both fluid and necrosis associated with necrotizing&#xD;
      pancreatitis; the necrosis can involve the pancreatic parenchyma and/or the peri- pancreatic&#xD;
      tissues. A mature, encapsulated collection of pancreatic and/or peri- pancreatic necrosis&#xD;
      with well defined inflammatory wall is walled off necrosis (WON). It usually occurs &gt;4 weeks&#xD;
      after onset of necrotizing pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonic involvement may predict disease severity and outcome. Clinical features may appear&#xD;
      late in the course. Colonic complications occur in 1% patients with acute pancreatitis with&#xD;
      6-40% occurring with necrotizing pancreatitis. Correlation between colonic wall thickening at&#xD;
      CT and the clinical course has already been established in non-necrotizing pancreatitis.&#xD;
      Colonic necrosis is an adverse prognostic factor in pancreatic necrosis. Extension of&#xD;
      necrosis towards the transverse colon and the splenic flexure were seen most commonly&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have correlated colonic involvement as a prognostic marker in acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis. It is well known that translocation of the colonic flora may significantly&#xD;
      influence the clinical course of patients with acute pancreatitis. The correlation between&#xD;
      collection(s) around colon in CT finding and clinical outcomes has not been studied in&#xD;
      necrotizing pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, observational study, to be conducted in 20 bed ICU of department&#xD;
      of Critical Care Medicine, Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Postgraduate and Medical Sciences,&#xD;
      Lucknow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult (≥18 years) ICU patients who had acute necrotizing pancreatitis will be considered.&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical characteristics of all ICU patients who fulfill inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be collected along with relevant laboratory tests done for patient management routinely.&#xD;
      ICU prognostication scores, i.e., Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II&#xD;
      score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score will also be recorded. The&#xD;
      investigators will review all available computed tomography scans (CT Scans) of abdomen, from&#xD;
      2nd week to 6th week of pancreatitis, which will be done as per treating clinicians during&#xD;
      patient ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection around colon is classified as: 1. No pericolonic collection; 2. Less than 90&#xD;
      degree encasement of colon; 3. In between 90-180 degree; 4. More than 180 degree encasement&#xD;
      of colon. Other intra-abdominal collection will also be noted along with mesocolon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical course will be followed till ICU discharge in terms of need for drain and surgery,&#xD;
      intra-abdominal infection, and survival at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Descriptive analysis will be done and data will be presented as mean or&#xD;
      median.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: None. Waiver of consent has been granted by the Institute Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (IEC).&#xD;
