  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this cohort study, we will investigate short and long term outcomes after knee replacement&#xD;
      surgery and identify preoperative and early postoperative factors associated with long term&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients follow the same fast-track program including same day surgery for elective knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery at the Silkeborg Regional Hospital in Denmark, which includes detailed&#xD;
      preoperative written information, multidisciplinary education course for patients and&#xD;
      relatives, optimized multimodal pain treatment and early postoperative rehabilitation. Before&#xD;
      the admission for surgery, patients will be asked to fulfill several questionnaires and&#xD;
      baseline information regarding work situation, educational level and previous treatments. At&#xD;
      two weeks there, there is a scheduled follow up by a physical therapist and a nurse at the&#xD;
      hospital. At three months there is a scheduled follow up by telephone with a physical&#xD;
      therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will adhere methodologically to the STROBE guidelines and checklist for prospective&#xD;
      cohort studies (www.strobe-statement.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further description is provided elsewhere as eligibility criteria and outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addition to the description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In January 2019 we started collecting 1 year follow-up data and included questions regarding&#xD;
      treatment succes, satisfaction and willingness to repeat the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March 2019 we decided to make a change in the baseline collection of relevant predictors&#xD;
      for primary outcome. The reason for the change was to be able to answer more relevant&#xD;
      scientific questions in the cohort study. We replaced &quot;The General Self-efficacy Scale&quot; with&#xD;
      &quot;Pain Catastrophizing Scale&quot; and excluded &quot;The General Self-efficacy Scale&quot; from the 12 weeks&#xD;
      follow-up collection of outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      December 2020:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first substudies are planned using data from the SIKS cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Predictors of knee pain and functional outcome following Total Knee Arthroplasty - a&#xD;
           prospective cohort study with 12 months follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Oxford Knee Score at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Global Perceived Effect at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is it feasible and safe to discharge patients on the day of surgery after a total knee&#xD;
           arthroplasty?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes Feasibility measured as length of stay Safety measures as readmission (phone&#xD;
      calls, outpatient visits and inpatient visits) and the related reason&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes Oxfodr knee score (90 days) Pain intensity (90 days)&#xD;

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Reported Outcome Measure, that measures how patients experience pain. Pain catastrophizing is characterized by the tendency to magnify the threat value of a pain stimulus and to feel helpless in the presence of pain, as well as by a relative inability to prevent or inhibit pain-related thoughts in anticipation of, during, or following a painful event such as surgery for example. Each of the 13 questions is answered by ticking a box on a 5 point Likert Scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). A total score is yielded (ranging from 0-52 and 0 being the best), along with three subscale scores assessing rumination, magnification and helplessness. The PCS is included in the data collection from March 2019 til end of the cohort study, which corresponds to about 950 patient responses (instead of The General Self-efficacy Scale)</description>

    <measure>Global Perceived Effect (GPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>GPE measures patients' perception of the change in their knee problems after the surgery. GPE will be assessed with the anchor question &quot;Overall, how are the problems now (pain and ability to perform daily activities) in the knee on which you had surgery, compared to prior to your operation?&quot; Patients respond on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;better, an important improvement&quot; to &quot;worse, an important deterioration&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with the surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction is measured with the question &quot;Overall, how satisfied are you with the sugery?&quot;. Patients respond on a 5 point scale ranging from &quot;very satisfied&quot; to &quot;very unsatisfied&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>PASS measures satisfaction with the current knee function and will be assessed with the anchor question &quot;&quot;When you think of your knee function, will you consider your current condition as satisfying? With knee function, you should take into account your activities of daily living, your level of pain and other symptoms&quot;. Patients respond &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. If patients respond &quot;no&quot; they are asked if the consider the treatment of ther knee problem as a failure.</description>
