  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in Canada. For approximately 30% of&#xD;
      patients that present with locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the standard&#xD;
      treatment is curative-intent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Outcomes remain poor, with 5-year&#xD;
      survival of only 20%. Despite the long-held belief that higher radiation doses lead to&#xD;
      improved overall survival (OS), the landmark randomized trial (RTOG 0617) showed the&#xD;
      opposite. The investigators hypothesize that the inferior survival observed may be due to&#xD;
      unexpected heart toxicity as secondary analysis revealed that the heart dose was a strong&#xD;
      predictor of inferior OS. Up to now, change in heart function is typically detected&#xD;
      histologically, requiring autopsy tissue. Therefore, a non-invasive marker of early heart&#xD;
      damage is required. Hybrid PET-MRI has become available in Canada only recently. The ability&#xD;
      to simultaneously perform metabolic imaging with functional and tissue imaging allows for&#xD;
      novel assessment of heart toxicity. The primary objective is to examine the utility of hybrid&#xD;
      PET-MRI and DCE-CT to assess acute changes in heart function and to measure inflammation&#xD;
      before, and six weeks after NSCLC radiotherapy. A pilot of 20 patients with Stage I-III NSCLC&#xD;
      will be enrolled. The findings of this study will aid in the design of new studies to&#xD;
      reassess dose escalation for locally advanced NSCLC while limiting the risk of heart&#xD;
      toxicity. FDG PET will be used to simultaneously assess both cardiac inflammation and tumour&#xD;
      response. Quantitative DCE-CT will also be used to measure ventilation and perfusion changes&#xD;
      in the normal lung and tumour after radiotherapy, providing image data that can&#xD;
      comprehensively assess both tumour response and potential toxicity in both the heart and&#xD;
      lungs. Such information is crucial in understanding the disease and its response to&#xD;
      treatment. This data will also aid in the design of radiation techniques that spare the heart&#xD;
      in other patients with any thoracic malignancies, including breast cancer, lymphoma, and&#xD;
      esophageal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a longitudinal imaging pilot study composed of 20 Stage I-III NSCLC&#xD;
      patients before, and six weeks after standard radiotherapy using a hybrid 3T-PET/MRI system&#xD;
      (Biograph mMR, Siemens Healthcare) and a GE Revolution 256-slice CT scanner. The imaging&#xD;
      protocol is designed to detect acute changes in myocardial perfusion, inflammation, edema,&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction, normal lung and tumour perfusion, and tumour metabolism.&#xD;
      During each imaging session, patients will receive an 18F-FDG PET scan to image&#xD;
      macrophage-related inflammation and tumour metabolism, MRI to identify edema, mature fibrosis&#xD;
      or scar, and Dynamic contrast enhanced CT (DCE-CT) imaging to image perfusion and (LVEF). All&#xD;
      images will be fused and rendered with radiation treatment planning dose distributions.&#xD;
      Parameters such as Standard Uptake Value (SUV) will be used to compare PET scans, while heart&#xD;
      volume and presence of Gadolinium enhancement will be used to compare MRI scans. Blood flow,&#xD;
      blood volume, and permeability will be used to compare CT scans. Blood tests including&#xD;
      Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and troponin at&#xD;
      each timepoint will also be performed to detect cardiac inflammation. Comparisons between&#xD;
      Stage I/II and Stage III patients will allow us to determine whether our metrics for heart&#xD;
      changes is radiation related. Relative differences from the six-week time point to baseline&#xD;
      will be correlated with the radiation dose distribution to attempt to define a dose-response&#xD;
      relationship between radiation dose and cardiac toxicity.&#xD;

        Ultimately, the sample size was based upon practical considerations and that 20 NSCLC&#xD;
        patients (10 Stage I/II and 10 Stage III) could be accrued relatively easily from new&#xD;
        patient clinics, while sufficiently providing enough evidence to validate the imaging&#xD;
        techniques to be used as a non-invasive measure for future clinical trials aimed at&#xD;
        reducing or mitigating radiation-induced cardiac toxicity.&#xD;
