      Study to assess the safety, performance and durability of the TIES® transcutaneous titanium&#xD;
      implant in patients requiring a permanent ileostomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm clinical study that will assess the safety,&#xD;
      performance and durability of the TIES® transcutaneous titanium implant in patients requiring&#xD;
      a permanent ileostomy (a surgical procedure that involves connecting the small intestine to&#xD;
      the skin to create an opening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Transcutaneous Implant Evacuation System (TIES®) is a medical device designed to enable&#xD;
      continence control for patients who would otherwise need to wear an ileostomy bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will undergo a conventional ileostomy procedure under general anaesthesia&#xD;
      and have the TIES® Port implanted. To date, the TIES® has been evaluated in 11 patients in 2&#xD;
      clinical studies. This study aims to collect more data that will assess performance,&#xD;
      durability, safety and the impact that the TIES® has on a patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 50 patients across Europe that require a permanent ileostomy, including&#xD;
      patients with ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis coli or other diseases such&#xD;
      as Crohn´s disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects are expected to participate for approximately 1 year following surgical&#xD;
      placement of the TIES® Port. Participation will involve a screening period, surgical&#xD;
      implantation of the device (in-patient) and scheduled follow-up assessments out to 1 year&#xD;
      post implant.&#xD;

    <description>Visible leakage or fecal staining of clothing recorded on the 3-day diary Performance evaluation applies only among subjects with the TIES® Port in situ. Among subjects with the TIES® Port in situ, performance will be assessed according to (a) the proportion of subjects who use the TIES® Lid for continence control; (b) the proportion of subjects experiencing visible leakages around the implant; and (c) subject´s assessment on the ease of use of the TIES® Solution.&#xD;
The success criterion at 24 weeks requires at least 70% of subjects with the TIES® Port in situ having no visible leakage or staining of clothing adjacent to the implant between consecutive episodes of using the lid for continence control. Spillage that might occur at opening of the lid is not regarded as leakage.</description>
