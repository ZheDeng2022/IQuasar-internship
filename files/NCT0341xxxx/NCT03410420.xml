  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study designed to determine the safety and value of Hypoxyprobe-1&#xD;
      (pimonidazole hydrochloride (-HCl)) to detect levels of tissue hypoxia in patients presenting&#xD;
      with ascending aortic aneurysm.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to identify the level of tissue hypoxia in patients presenting&#xD;
      with ascending aortic aneurysm. Ascending aortic aneurysms affect approximately 15,000 people&#xD;
      in the United States each year, and represent a serious clinical problem because there is a&#xD;
      known, but unspecified risk of aortic rupture or dissection. Despite progress made in the&#xD;
      surgical management of ascending aortic aneurysms, the molecular and cellular mechanisms&#xD;
      involved remain elusive. However, indirect evidence of tissue hypoxia have recently been&#xD;
      described in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will use pimonidazole-HCl, a compound that is retained by hypoxic cells and&#xD;
      that has been used for detection of tissue hypoxia in human since the early 2000s. This pilot&#xD;
      study will involve twenty patients who are candidates for aortic replacement due to aneurysm&#xD;
      and twenty non-aneurysmal patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (controls).&#xD;
      Patients will be administered pimonidazole-HCl orally in a single dose (0.5g/m2) 24 hours&#xD;
      prior to scheduled surgical time. During surgery, the resected aneurysmal aortic specimens&#xD;
      (for patients undergoing aortic replacement) or aortic punch (for patients undergoing&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass graft) will be harvested. Tissue hypoxia will be qualitatively and&#xD;
      quantitatively assessed in the investigator's research laboratory. Based on previous&#xD;
      toxicological animal studies and previous use in human studies, the anticipated risk of&#xD;
      severe or serious side effect will be relatively minimal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Coronary artery bypass graft procedure due to coronary heart disease. Imaging CT&#xD;
                  scans and echography defining the presence of ascending aortic aneurysm will be&#xD;
                  centrally reviewed prospectively to ensure adherence to subject inclusion&#xD;
                  criteria.&#xD;
