  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is an extremely common and poorly treated problem in patients with substance use&#xD;
      disorders (SUD)s undergoing rehabilitation treatment in a residential facility. The&#xD;
      persistence of insomnia in substance use disorders (SUDs) may be associated with tonic levels&#xD;
      of drug craving. Insomnia and craving can predispose to relapse in patients with SUDs.&#xD;
      Insomnia and SUDs are independently associated with increased cortisol indicating&#xD;
      physiological dysregulation of the stress response system including the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Hence sleep disturbance, craving and increased&#xD;
      cortisol leads to relapse in SUD subjects. Suvorexant, an orexin 1 / 2 receptor antagonist,&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of sleep disturbance in subjects with primary Insomnia.&#xD;
      Previous animal studies report Orexin 1 receptor antagonist decreases craving and normal the&#xD;
      HPA axis. However, the efficacy of suvorexant on sleep and craving in SUD subjects is not&#xD;
      known. The primary aims of this study are-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if suvorexant will improve sleep quality (increased total sleep time, fewer&#xD;
           awakenings), as measured through wrist actigraphy and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)&#xD;
           in SUDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess whether or not SUDs patients treated with suvorexant endorse scale items on a&#xD;
           modified abuse liability assessment battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if daily reports of mood, stress, craving and sleep using Ecological&#xD;
           Momentary Assessment (EMA data) change during the course of the study as patients with&#xD;
           SUDs are treated with suvorexant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine if patients taking suvorexant will have a decrease in total daily salivary&#xD;
           cortisol over the course of the study by collecting samples at five time points in a&#xD;
           day, for two consecutive days at two different times in the study.&#xD;

      Insomnia is an extremely common and poorly treated problem in patients with substance use&#xD;
      disorders (SUD)s patients undergoing rehabilitation treatment in residential facility. The&#xD;
      persistence of insomnia in substance use disorders (SUDs) may be associated with tonic levels&#xD;
      of drug craving. Insomnia and craving can predispose to relapse in patients with SUDs.&#xD;
      Insomnia and SUDs are independently associated with increased cortisol indicating&#xD;
      physiological dysregulation of the stress response system including the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Hence sleep disturbance, craving and increased&#xD;
      cortisol leads to relapse in SUD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suvorexant is a novel orexin 1 and 2 receptor antagonist, FDA approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      insomnia. Suvorexant may be differentially beneficial in patients with opioid dependence: 1)&#xD;
      It is efficacious for treatment of insomnia in the general population, 2) Data from animal&#xD;
      models of opioid dependence suggest that orexins may be involved in reward (opioid) seeking&#xD;
      behavior and altered stress response while an orexin antagonist appears to decrease reward&#xD;
      (opioid) seeking while normalizing HPA axis function. A medication that can improve sleep,&#xD;
      decrease craving and normalize the HPA axis may theoretically be helpful in patients with&#xD;
      SUDs. At this juncture, the literature supports the case for an open trial of Suvorexant for&#xD;
      patients in residential care for SUDs, who complain of sleep disturbance. The patients will&#xD;
      be at least 5 days post-withdrawal, in order to minimize the residual sleep complaints&#xD;
      associated with that phase of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous, well-designed, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with insomnia,&#xD;
      suvorexant has been shown to be efficacious compared with placebo. However, substance&#xD;
      dependent patients with insomnia were not included in these studies. Although, as a new sleep&#xD;
      medication, suvorexant has been placed in Schedule IV by the FDA, the drug has not been&#xD;
      studied in the context of its potential abuse liability when administered at bedtime at the&#xD;
      therapeutic dose among patients in residential treatment for substance dependence disorders.&#xD;
      A modified abuse liability protocol will therefore be incorporated in this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study are-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Relative to a baseline, patients treated with suvorexant will experience an increase in&#xD;
           total sleep time, fewer awakenings after sleep onset, and improved subjective sleep&#xD;
           quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients treated with suvorexant are not likely to endorse scale items associated with&#xD;
           abuse liability 30 minutes after drug administration or the following morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relative to baseline, patients being treated with suvorexant are more likely to report&#xD;
           improved moods, and decreased ambient craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Relative to baseline, patients being treated with suvorexant are more likely to&#xD;
           experience decreased total daily salivary cortisol over the course of 7 days of&#xD;
           treatment with suvorexant.&#xD;
