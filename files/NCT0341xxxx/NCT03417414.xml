  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational cohort study of patients with a new diagnosis of B cell Chronic&#xD;
      Lymphocytic Leukemia or B cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma who will receive an anti-CD20&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody treatment during the induction phase of their treatment. Throughout the&#xD;
      study, patients will have four blood draws at specified time points throughout the study. The&#xD;
      initial blood draw will be analysed test patients for Cytomegalovirus and conduct a g-NK cell&#xD;
      analysis. The final three blood draws will be conducted to analyse the g-NK cells at&#xD;
      specified time points. The objectives of this study are to: 1) characterize the frequency of&#xD;
      CMV (+) and g-NK (+) individuals in the B-NHL and B-CLL populations, 2) Determine changes in&#xD;
      circulating g-NK cells during and after anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing remission&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy and 3) Evaluate whether the presence of g-NK cells improve the outcome&#xD;
      of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing remission induction treatment of patients with&#xD;
      B-NHL or B-CLL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CMV infection results in a unique population of highly effective ADCC effector cells (g-NK)&#xD;
      in more than 50% of individuals. Unlike most NK cells, g-NK cells are long-lived and persist&#xD;
      for years following primary infection. The g-NK population enlarges following antibody&#xD;
      binding through their Fc receptors (FcR) and target engagement by the antibody. The addition&#xD;
      of rituximab and other monoclonal antibodies directed against B lymphocyte targets to&#xD;
      remission-induction therapy has improved the depth and durability of response for patients&#xD;
      with B cell lymphoproliferative diseases, such as Non-hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The effects of rituximab and other monoclonal anti-cancer&#xD;
      antibodies are at least partially mediated through ADCC mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the clinically relevant aspects of g-NK biology&#xD;
      during antibody-containing therapy of lymphoproliferative diseases including whether the&#xD;
      presence of g-NK might correlate with improved treatment responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 160 patients with either B cell NHL or CLL will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study enrollment will occur over approximately 2 years. Patients will only be involved in&#xD;
      this study until their blood samples are collected at the time point described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be abstracted from the clinical record over the course of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age (at beginning of remission-induction therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight and height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathological diagnosis including subtype and genetic testing when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage at diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prognostic index score (IPI or FLIPI as appropriate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date that remission-induction therapy begins&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy used for remission-induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose of anti-CD20 antibody administered during remission-induction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remission status after 3 cycles of remission-induction therapy (if available)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Details of maintenance therapy (drug, dose, schedule)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of progression or relapse.&#xD;

      The CMV status of individuals will be measured by serology in the laboratory of Dr. Lee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence and function of g-NK cells will be identified and quantified following staining&#xD;
      with appropriate fluorescent monoclonal antibody conjugates using flow cytometry of&#xD;
      peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples from individuals will be examined to determine changes over time associated with&#xD;
