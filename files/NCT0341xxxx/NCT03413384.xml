    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled Phase II study to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      dementia (PDD).This study will enroll approximately 106 patients to have up to 84 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects, and conduct in Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, National Taiwan University&#xD;
      Hospital,Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital and Tungs'&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that can cause significant&#xD;
      disability and decrease quality of life. It is a chronic and progressive disease which means&#xD;
      the symptoms become worse over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is a decline in thinking and reasoning that develops in&#xD;
      many people living with PD at least a year after diagnosis. An estimated 50 to 80 percent of&#xD;
      patients with PD eventually experience dementia as the disease progresses. Key risk factors&#xD;
      or correlation consistently associated with PDD are older age, more severe parkinsonism&#xD;
      (particularly rigidity, postural instability and gait disturbance), male gender, certain&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms (depression, psychosis) and mild cognitive impairment. PDD has a unique&#xD;
      clinical profile and neuropathology, commonly reported symptoms include changes in memory,&#xD;
      concentration and judgment; trouble interpreting visual information; muffled speech; visual&#xD;
      hallucinations; delusions, especially paranoid ideas; depression, irritability and anxiety;&#xD;
      and sleep disturbances, including excessive daytime drowsiness and rapid eye movement sleep&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product (IP) is 1 g of ceftriaxone powder manufactured by Sandoz Company&#xD;
      reconstituted with 1% lidocaine as diluent before use. Ceftriaxone is a sterile,&#xD;
      semisynthetic, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic for intramuscular or intravenous&#xD;
      administration. Ceftriaxone is the drug substance of Rocephin first approved by FDA in 1984&#xD;
      as a cephalosporin antibiotic, and is clinically widely used and currently off patent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current main treatment goal of PDD focuses on the improvement of disease symptoms.&#xD;
      However, the irreversible deterioration of cognitive and motor functions is the most&#xD;
      challenge issue for therapeutic agent development. Ceftriaxone was found to have functions in&#xD;
      reducing glutamatergic hyperactivity and excitotoxicity and may exhibit neuro-protective&#xD;
      functions as the mechanism in PDD treatment. The therapeutic effects of ceftriaxone on the&#xD;
      animal model of PDD showed ceftriaxone works on 1) preventing cognitive and motor deficits,&#xD;
      2) inhibiting dopaminergic degeneration and restoring neuronal density and activity in the&#xD;
      striatum and SNc, 3) inhibiting cell loss and restoring neuronal density and activity in the&#xD;
      hippocampus , 4) increasing neurogenesis in the substantia nigra and hippocampus dentate&#xD;
      gyrus, 5) increasing glutamate transporter expression in the striatum and hippocampus , and&#xD;
      6) decreasing neuronal hyperactivity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The effects observed&#xD;
      in the animal model of PDD have suggested ceftriaxone as a potential promising medical&#xD;
      treatment for PDD patients to improve the cognitive and motor function defects. For such&#xD;
      reasons, the investigators plan to conduct this phase II trial of ceftriaxone to determine&#xD;
      the potential efficacy and obtain safety profiles in PDD patients.&#xD;
