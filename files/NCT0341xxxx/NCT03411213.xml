  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is accompanied by microvascular dysfunction (an impairment of blood vessels&#xD;
      to dilate or constrict in response to demand). The ability to reliably measure microvascular&#xD;
      dysfunction would help identify patients at risk of myocardial infarction and test new&#xD;
      treatments. All existing measures of microvascular dysfunction suffer significant&#xD;
      limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is an imaging method that uses an infrared light-source and&#xD;
      detector (called optodes) to painlessly shines light into tissue and collect reflected light&#xD;
      at different wavelengths. This data allows quantification of the amount of haemoglobin&#xD;
      (blood) in the tissue and whether it is oxygenated or de-oxygenated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a powerful analysis technique for data collected from&#xD;
      multiple NIRH optodes. Unlike most NIRS studies that use a single pair of optodes and&#xD;
      collects a single datapoint for each wavelength over time, DOT allows three-dimensional&#xD;
      spatial reconstruction of haemodynamic and anatomic changes in a large region of tissue over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preliminary work DOT had the potential to measure forearm reactive hyperaemia, a key&#xD;
      indicator of microvascular function. Team will test whether DOT can detect differences&#xD;
      between patients and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, 30 patients will be recruited with type 2 diabetes, 30 patients who have had a&#xD;
      previous myocardial infarction and 30 healthy volunteers. The Investigator will also recruit&#xD;
      50 patients who are on waiting lists for coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DOT will be used to measure participants' microvascular function after brachial artery&#xD;
      occlusion by a blood pressure cuff. The Investigator will then examine whether DOT can detect&#xD;
      differences between healthy volunteers, diabetics, and patients with a previous heart attack,&#xD;
      and whether DOT is able to predict existence of coronary artery disease on angiography. If&#xD;
      successful, DOT can be developed for assessment of microvascular function to the point where&#xD;
      it could be applied to clinical studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous pilot studies have shown ability to collect promising data safely. In the following&#xD;
      studies, the same study as in the pilot will be performed to apply the array of optodes to&#xD;
      the surface of the arm. These emit light painlessly into the tissue and collect scattered&#xD;
      light from the tissue. Inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the arm for 5 minutes, then&#xD;
      deflate the cuff to allow blood flow back into the tissue. From the data gathered before,&#xD;
      during and after the cuff is inflated, 3D reconstructions can be performed of HbO, HbR, and&#xD;
      HbT changes in the forearm during and after arterial occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1) Can DOT detect differences in vascular function between healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      patients with proven heart disease or diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will measure vascular function in patients with known heart disease (previous&#xD;
      myocardial infarction) or diabetes and compare this to matched healthy volunteers. This will&#xD;
      establish whether DOT can detect differences in vascular response between these groups. If&#xD;
      so, then the method has the potential to be useful diagnostically or prognostically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be approached by poster, or face to face in STH clinics and&#xD;
      provided with the information sheet which participants will be asked to read at home.&#xD;
      Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions by email or telephone at any time&#xD;
      afterwards. Participants will be asked to contact us if they are willing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be booked with an appointment to attend the Clinical Research Facility at&#xD;
      Sheffield Teaching Hospitals (at least 24hrs after receiving the information sheet and having&#xD;
      the chance to ask questions) for a visit of 30-45 minutes. Visits will be arranged in advance&#xD;
      at a convenient time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When participants attend, after agreeing to take part and signing a consent form,&#xD;
      participants will take a seat in a private room. Participants will need to wear short&#xD;
      sleeves, or roll their sleeves up. If necessary, the investigator can provide a gown to wear&#xD;
      if the sleeves are too tight. The investigator will then do the following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Record some details about medical history, height/weight, whether they take medications,&#xD;
           date of birth, whether male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure the blood pressure by briefly inflating a cuff around the upper arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Place an array of fibre optics on the surface of the forearm. Some jelly will be placed&#xD;
           on the skin first, and the array will be held in place by a strap or tape. This is not&#xD;
           painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After around 10 minutes of sitting quietly, the investigator will inflate a blood&#xD;
           pressure cuff around the arm that the array is placed on. This will temporarily prevent&#xD;
           blood entering or leaving the arm. This will feel tight and the arm may go numb. The&#xD;
           investigator will keep the cuff inflated for five minutes, but the participant can ask&#xD;
           for the cuff to be deflated at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The investigator will then deflate the cuff, allowing blood back into the arm. After&#xD;
           around 10 more minutes, the investigator will remove the cuff and array and the&#xD;
           participant will be free to leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first assessment, the investigator will ask participants if they would be willing&#xD;
      to attend for a second assessment where we would repeat the above measurements. This is to&#xD;
      test how reproducible the measurements are in the same individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2) Can DOT predict presence or severity of coronary artery disease on angiography?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will measure vascular function in patients awaiting diagnostic coronary&#xD;
      angiography (either invasive or by CT), in whom it is not known whether or not coronary&#xD;
      artery disease is present. Once the angiographic results are available the investigator will&#xD;
      correlate vascular function measured by DOT with presence and severity of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease to examine whether or not DOT identified&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be approached by poster, or face to face in STH clinics and&#xD;
      provided with the information sheet which participants will be asked to read. Participants&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to ask questions by email or telephone at any time afterwards.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to contact us if they are willing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be booked with an appointment to attend the Clinical Research Facility at&#xD;
      Sheffield Teaching Hospitals (at least 24hrs after receiving the information sheet and having&#xD;
      the chance to ask questions) for a visit of approximately 45 minutes. Visits will be arranged&#xD;
      in advance at a convenient time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When participants attend, after agreeing to take part and signing a consent form, particpants&#xD;
      will take a seat in a private room. Participants will need to wear short sleeves, or roll&#xD;
      their sleeves up. If necessary, the investigator can provide a gown to wear if the sleeves&#xD;
      are too tight. the investigator will then do the following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Record some details about medical history, whether they take medications, date of birth,&#xD;
           whether male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure the blood pressure by briefly inflating a cuff around the upper arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Place an array of fibre optics on the surface of the forearm. Some jelly will be placed&#xD;
           on the skin first, and the array will be held in place by a strap or tape. This is not&#xD;
           painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After around 10 minutes of sitting quietly, the investigator will inflate a blood&#xD;
           pressure cuff around the arm that the array is placed on. This will temporarily prevent&#xD;
           blood entering or leaving the arm. This will feel tight and the arm may go numb. The&#xD;
           investigator will keep the cuff inflated for five minutes, but the participant can ask&#xD;
           for the cuff to be deflated at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The investigator will then deflate the cuff, allowing blood back into the arm. After&#xD;
           around 10 more minutes, the investigator will remove the cuff and array and the&#xD;
           participant will be free to leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the angiogram is performed (as part of their routine clinical care) the results will be&#xD;
      reviewed by a clinically trained researcher. This will then be correlated with their vascular&#xD;
      function measured by DOT to determine whether this can predict angiographic findings.&#xD;
