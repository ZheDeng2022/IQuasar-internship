      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilonidal disease refers to a common disease affecting mostly young males. It may present as&#xD;
      asymptomatic pits, acute and painful abscess formation, or chronic discharging sinuses. There&#xD;
      are many treatment options for the latter two manifestations but broadly speaking the&#xD;
      surgical treatment of acute pilonidal abscess can fall into three categories: (1) incision&#xD;
      and drainage, (2) de-roofing and curettage and (3) wide local excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some authors believe that the incision and drainage method is an effective procedure.&#xD;
      However, this method would treat only the acute infection and produce the necessity of&#xD;
      re-operation for definite therapy. The alternative method is wide local excision in which the&#xD;
      patients receive definite therapy in a single staged operation reducing the number of&#xD;
      operations per patient, patient visits to hospital and overall cost to the health service.&#xD;
      However, concerns over the length of time to gain acceptable wound healing following wide&#xD;
      local excision has decreased its popularity with some surgeons. There is limited evidence&#xD;
      available for the surgical management of acute pilonidal abscess which has lead to&#xD;
      disagreement as to what is the best option. One randomised study of 76 patients compared&#xD;
      incision and drainage of acute pilonidal abscess followed by an elective excision of the&#xD;
      pilonidal sinus and primary closure at 3 weeks versus wide local excision with the wound left&#xD;
      open for secondary healing. At 12 months the incision and drainage followed by elective&#xD;
      excision group had 14% recurrence of pilonidal abscess whereas the wide local excision group&#xD;
      had 0% recurrence. Another randomised study of 131 patients compared incision and drainage&#xD;
      versus abscess excision (de-roofing) with curettage for acute pilonidal abscess and found&#xD;
      recurrence rates of 42% in the incision and drainage group verses 11% in the curettage group.&#xD;
      A prospective randomised study similarly compared incision and drainage versus abscess&#xD;
      excision (de-roofing) with curettage for acute pilonidal abscess and reported a significantly&#xD;
      higher rate of developing a chronic pilonidal sinus in the incision and drainage group (76%&#xD;
      vs 24%, p&lt;0.001). A retrospective study with median follow up of 5.3 years has recently been&#xD;
      published comparing abscess de-roofing with curettage and wide local excision for acute&#xD;
      pilonidal abscess. The authors reported an approximate three-fold increase in recurrence rate&#xD;
      in the curettage group compared with the wide local excision group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence available for the surgical management of acute pilonidal abscess is limited.&#xD;
      Previous studies have consistently demonstrated that incision and drainage results in high&#xD;
      recurrence rates and should not be considered as the first-line treatment option for the&#xD;
      management of acute pilonidal abscess. However, it is not clear whether abscess de-roofing&#xD;
      with curettage or wide local excision should be considered as the surgical procedure of&#xD;
      choice in acute pilonidal abscess. There has not been a prospective randomised study&#xD;
      comparing abscess de-roofing with curettage and wide local excision for acute pilonidal&#xD;
      abscess. The ideal surgical procedure would be one that results in the lowest rate of abscess&#xD;
      recurrence, treats the underlying pilonidal sinus thereby reducing the need for re-operation&#xD;
      but has acceptable post-operative pain, complications and time to complete wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does wide local excision when compared to abscess excision (de-roofing) with curettage result&#xD;
      in reduced recurrence rates and therefore provide a single-stage procedure for the management&#xD;
      of acute pilonidal abscess and the underlying causative sinus? Is wide local excision when&#xD;
      compared to abscess de-roofing with curettage a safe procedure in terms of complications&#xD;
      (bleeding, wound infection), post-operative pain and time to complete wound healing?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wide local excision for the management of acute pilonidal abscess results in lower recurrence&#xD;
      rates when compared with abscess de-roofing with curettage. Post-operative pain,&#xD;
      complications and time to complete wound healing will not be significantly different between&#xD;
      the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare therapeutic values of abscess de-roofing with curettage versus wide local excision&#xD;
      in the surgical treatment of patients with acute pilonidal abscess. Therapeutic values&#xD;
      include: recurrence rate, post-operative pain, time to complete wound healing, time to&#xD;
      returning to work or normal daily activities and complications of surgery (bleeding and wound&#xD;
      infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the practicality of abscess de-roofing with curettage and wide local excision in&#xD;
      the surgical treatment of patients with acute pilonidal abscess in terms of operative time&#xD;
      and total time in theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: Single centre randomised controlled clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute pilonidal abscess will be randomised into 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
      Randomisation of patients will be performed by the surgical registrar on call for either&#xD;
      admissions or the emergency theatre. The method of randomisation will be by identical sealed&#xD;
      envelopes. The principle investigator (Lalin Navaratne) will create trial packs within&#xD;
      identical sealed envelopes. These packs will contain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient information sheet (PIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 3 copies of the patient consent form (for the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A consent form for the operation (Consent Form 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Information sheet to the operating surgeon outlining which treatment arm the patient has&#xD;
           been allocated to&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The data collection sheet(s) for demographic data, medical history, smoking history,&#xD;
           previous pilonidal disease history, operative data, and follow up data&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Letter to GP&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sealed envelopes will be created in blocks of 20 (10 for each treatment arm) to keep the&#xD;
      groups of similar size during the study. Once the 20 envelopes have been created and sealed&#xD;
      (with a signed white label) they will be shuffled by another investigator who has not been&#xD;
      involved in creating the packs and placed in a secure location (locked filing cabinet within&#xD;
      the surgical assessment unit). When a patient has been referred to the emergency surgery unit&#xD;
      they will be seen on the surgical assessment unit and will be invited to join the study if&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria have been met. The patient will be given the Patient&#xD;
      Information Sheet (PIS) and have adequate time to read it. Once the patient has read the PIS&#xD;
      and had an opportunity to ask any questions they will be enrolled into the study if&#xD;
      applicable. The surgeon will take the trial pack 'on the top of the pile' within the secured&#xD;
      filing cabinet which will randomly allocate the patient to one of two treatment arms. The two&#xD;
      treatment arms are: (1) de-roofing and curettage and (2) wide local excision. The surgeon&#xD;
      will complete any data collection requirements at this stage and all documentation will&#xD;
      remain in the envelope and be tracked with the patients notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two arms of this trial will be performed in the operating theatre with the patient under&#xD;
      general anaesthesia. The surgical technique for each treatment arm is detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Abscess de-roofing and curettage. The patient will be placed in the lateral position&#xD;
           with the buttocks spread apart using tape. The cleft of the buttocks will be shaved&#xD;
           prior to cleaning and preparation of the skin. A spindle-shaped (elliptical) excision&#xD;
           will be performed to the lateral aspect of the abscess formation with a scalpel staying&#xD;
           away from the midline. Once the pus has been drained through this lateral incision the&#xD;
           wound cavity will then be curetted and washed out with hydrogen peroxide. The wound size&#xD;
           will be measured by the operating surgeon who will record the maximal length and width&#xD;
           of the wound. Once haemostasis (cessation of any bleeding) is achieved the wound will be&#xD;
           packed with Kaltostat ribbon and the wound dressed with blue gauze and mefix tape. The&#xD;
           wound is therefore left open.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Wide local excision. Patients will be placed in the prone position with the buttocks&#xD;
           spread apart using tape. The cleft of the buttocks will be shaved prior to cleaning and&#xD;
           preparation of the skin. Diluted methylene blue will be injected in all visible pits and&#xD;
           a wide spindle-shaped (elliptical) midline excision of the skin and the underlying&#xD;
           subcutaneous tissue down to the coccygeal (pre-sacral) fascia including all sinuses will&#xD;
           be performed with electrocautery. The specimen will be sent for histology as per routine&#xD;
           surgical practice. The wound will be washed with hydrogen peroxide. The wound size will&#xD;
           be measured by the operating surgeon who will record the maximal length and width of the&#xD;
           wound. Once haemostasis (cessation of any bleeding) is achieved the wound will be packed&#xD;
           with Kaltostat ribbon and the wound dressed with blue gauze and mefix tape. The wound is&#xD;
           therefore left open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be routinely prescribed any antibiotics following the operation. All&#xD;
      patients will have wound packing for the first 24 hours after the operation. For patients&#xD;
      within the drainage and curettage group no further packing is usually required. Patients&#xD;
      discharged the same day of surgery will have their packing removed and wound reviewed in the&#xD;
      community. Patients who stay in-hospital overnight following their surgery will have their&#xD;
      packing removed and wound reviewed in-hospital prior to discharge. For patients within the&#xD;
      wide local excision group, packing may be required following the first post-operative day and&#xD;
      packing is continued until no longer indicated. Dressing changes for these patients will&#xD;
      occur in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be advised to cleanse the wounds in the shower at least once a day and will&#xD;
      be followed up in a dedicated wound clinic weekly until their wounds have healed. After&#xD;
      healing, they will be followed up in a telephone clinic at 6 and then 12 months. When&#xD;
      attending the wound clinic, data will be collected on abscess recurrence, time to wound&#xD;
      healing, number of days until the patient can return to work (or when they resumed normal&#xD;
      daily activities), pain scores, wound size and any signs of wound infection. Further follow&#xD;
      up in the main outpatient department will monitor for abscess recurrence. With patient&#xD;
      consent, non-identifying photographs may be taken of the wound during the operation and the&#xD;
      subsequent healing process during the follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient enrolled within the study may re-present with an acute abscess recurrence within&#xD;
      the follow up period of one year. If the patient belongs to the de-roof and curettage group,&#xD;
      they would be offered a wide local excision as the surgical management of choice. If the&#xD;
      patient belongs to the wide local excision group, then they would be offered further drainage&#xD;
      and curettage or wide local excision based on what the attending surgeon feels is the best&#xD;
      surgical option for that particular patient. Analysis would be by intention to treat. Any&#xD;
      patient re-operated on during the study period would not need to be followed up in the weekly&#xD;
      wound clinic for the purposes of data collection (time to healing, time to returning to work,&#xD;
      pain scores, wound size etc). These patients would be followed up in the outpatient clinic as&#xD;
      per departmental standard operating procedures.&#xD;
