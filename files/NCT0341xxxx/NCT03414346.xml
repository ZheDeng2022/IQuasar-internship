  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a therapeutic modality, cryotherapy is highly used for soft tissue damage control during&#xD;
      acute and subacute stages. Cryotherapy is able to reduce pain, inflammatory condition, muscle&#xD;
      spasm, nerve conduction, metabolic rate, edema formation and to prevent secondary hypoxic&#xD;
      injury. These effects are due to the heat conduction, passing from tissue to different&#xD;
      cryotherapy modalities, leading to tissue temperature reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diversity of cryotherapy modalities in clinical practice, like crushed-ice packs, frozen&#xD;
      food, gel packs and wetted ice packs, are widely explored by studies. To achieve anesthesia&#xD;
      by cryotherapy it's settled that the skin temperature must reach 13,6 degrees celsius (ºC).&#xD;
      Ice packs are the most effective modality of cryotherapy when placed directly on the skin,&#xD;
      this effectiveness is accentuated when ice packs are associated with water. To improve the&#xD;
      contact area the pack must be wrapped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though wetted ice packs are the most effective modality, there are few studies&#xD;
      approaching it. There aren't studies analyzing an ideal percentage of water to ice in this&#xD;
      modality either. Also, it isn't observed if the amount of water interferes on the conduction&#xD;
      of the heat from the skin to the ice pack, and in rewarming time. Besides neither of the&#xD;
      studies measures the amount of pain during cryotherapy application, and if there was any&#xD;
      difference between wetted ice packs, and ice packs isolated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the most effective cryotherapy modality&#xD;
      for reducing skin temperature, rewarming time, and the amount of discomfort during the&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

      The data for the sample size calculation was taken from Kanlayanaphotpron and Janwantanakul&#xD;
      (2005), that also approached the cryotherapy application. The software used to calculate the&#xD;
      sample was GPower 3.1.9.2. A 16 subjects sample were obtained to reach a power of 90%, needed&#xD;
      to detect a difference on the average of the groups in repeated measures with an alpha of 5%.&#xD;
      The subjects will be chosen through social media and informal invitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will attend to the laboratory four times, the first day for orientation and&#xD;
      measurements (body mass and skinfold), and the data collection will start on the second day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The room temperature will be set between 23 ° C and 25 ° C, and the humidity around 70%. The&#xD;
      subject will be in supine position on the stretcher, relaxed and instructed not to touch the&#xD;
      right thigh region for 20 minutes before the intervention to stabilize the body temperature.&#xD;
      The thigh will be measured and the center marked to determine the place where the pack will&#xD;
      settle and the temperature collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will last 20 minutes, and the order of application will be according to the&#xD;
      randomization. The subject will be asked to mark his pain level on the visual analogue scale&#xD;
      every minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The temperature of the right thigh will be measured by infrared thermography, before the&#xD;
      intervention, right after the removal and every minute until the total time of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize the data, it will be used descriptive statistics, the values of average,&#xD;
      standard deviation and the collected measurements will be identified. Through Shapiro-Wilk&#xD;
      test the distribution of data regarding normality will be verified. To compare the initial&#xD;
      and the final test values the ANOVA and the post-hoc of Bonferroni will be used. In the case&#xD;
      of data being out of the normal standards, a transformation will be used to reach the&#xD;
      normality. If the data still don't reach the normality after the transformation, the&#xD;
      non-parametric tests will be used (Mann-Whitney e Kruskal Walis). The confidence level&#xD;
      adopted for all tests will be 95% (p &lt;0.05).&#xD;
