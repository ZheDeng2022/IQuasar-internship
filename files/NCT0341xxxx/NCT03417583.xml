      Phase A: Recruit 50 patients with HD, and their caregivers, to complete a neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      and quality of life battery of scales at baseline. Have these 50 patients complete a formal&#xD;
      psychiatric assessment with a psychiatrist within 2 weeks of this clinical battery, and the&#xD;
      results of these 2 types of assessments will be compared to establish the level of agreement&#xD;
      between clinical rating scales and formal psychiatric assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase B: Continue to follow Phase A cohort longitudinally and administer neuropsychiatric and&#xD;
      quality of life battery at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months form baseline. Recruit an&#xD;
      additional 50 patients, administer the same neuropsychiatric and quality of life battery at&#xD;
      baseline, implement medication and counseling intervention according to a standard of care&#xD;
      protocol, and follow up with the same neuropsychiatric and quality of life battery at 6, 12,&#xD;
      and 18 months.&#xD;

      As presented to Phase A (control) patient participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;If you are in this study, you will be asked to answer a series of online surveys assessing&#xD;
      your psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in the presence of a caregiver. These surveys&#xD;
      will be emailed to your consented caregiver in the week before your in-person visit. You will&#xD;
      then come to clinic for an in-person assessment of psychiatric and motor symptoms of HD. You&#xD;
      will also undergo an in-person psychiatric evaluation with a psychiatrist at Vanderbilt who&#xD;
      works with HD patients. This psychiatric evaluation will take approximately 60 minutes and&#xD;
      will occur up to 2 weeks before or after your first regular study visit. This involves a&#xD;
      clinical interview during which a psychiatrist, who is an expert in psychiatric symptoms of&#xD;
      HD, will ask about your experience with many different symptoms that can be experienced in&#xD;
      HD. These two in-person evaluations will occur within 2 weeks of each other. You will&#xD;
      continue to see your neurology provider for routine follow-up, and you will return for&#xD;
      in-person follow-up assessments at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months, repeating the online&#xD;
      surveys prior to each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-Related Quality of Life and Psychiatric Symptom Surveys (This will take approximately&#xD;
      60-90 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to answer on-line survey questions about your psychiatric symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life in the presence of a caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Neuro-QoL scales include 4 subscales created specifically to measure quality of life&#xD;
           in patients with neurological disease. These scales include 33 total questions which ask&#xD;
           you to report your anxiety, depression, sense of well-being, and satisfaction with&#xD;
           social roles within the previous week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PROMIS Anger scale includes 8 questions that ask you to rate your symptoms of anger&#xD;
           in the previous week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment short form includes 8 questions that ask about your&#xD;
           sleep quality and how you feel during the day after sleeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ-9) includes 9 questions about symptoms of&#xD;
           depression that you may be experiencing and how these affect you on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The HD Anosognosia Rating Scale includes 8 questions that ask you to assess how you&#xD;
           perform daily tasks compared to other people of your same age and education level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep Questionnaire includes 5 questions about your night and daytime sleep habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will also gather background information such as: date of birth, where you live, if&#xD;
           you have insurance, and your income. You will also be asked about health and medical&#xD;
           history such as: when you were diagnosed with HD and what medications you are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric and Motor Symptom Assessment (This will take approximately 60 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) asks you to rate the severity of 14 anxiety&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Problem Behaviors Assessment short form (PBA-s) asks you and your caregiver about&#xD;
           the frequency and severity of 11 different psychiatric symptoms that can be experienced&#xD;
           in HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale includes up to 6 items yes or no questions to&#xD;
           assess presence and severity of suicidal thoughts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) is short test to measure your memory and&#xD;
           thinking skills.&#xD;
&#xD;

           measure the presence and severity of your motor symptoms like chorea and walking&#xD;
           difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The UHDRS Total Functional Capacity (TFC) scale is used by HD clinicians to rate your&#xD;
           ability to carry out daily tasks such as household chores or managing finances.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      As presented to Phase B (protocol) patient participant:&#xD;
&#xD;

      your psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in the presence of a caregiver. These surveys&#xD;
      will be emailed to your consented caregiver in the week before your in-person visit. You will&#xD;
      then come to clinic for an in-person assessment of psychiatric and motor symptoms of HD. In&#xD;
      addition, your psychiatric symptoms will be treated according to a systematic protocol&#xD;
      developed by HD experts that guides treatment decisions based on our current clinical&#xD;
      standard of care. You will return for in-person follow-up assessment at 6 months, 12 months,&#xD;
      and 18 months, repeating the online surveys prior to each visit.&#xD;
