  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a common malignancy of digestive system with gradually increasing&#xD;
      incidence, is the fourth and seventh leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world&#xD;
      (1) and China (2) according to the statistics in 2014. The vast majority of patients were&#xD;
      confirmed as locally advanced or distantly metastatic disease at diagnosis with an estimated&#xD;
      five-year survival rate of 4% (3) due to occlusive development and rapid progress. Advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer is characterized by poor prognosis.&#xD;

      Gemcitabine has been approved as the standard chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      since 1996, but the efficacy is extremely limited by a response rate of 6-8%, and median&#xD;
      survival of 5.5-7 months. However, Gemcitabine-based combination treatments fail to transcend&#xD;
      GEM monotherapy on overall survival, including GEM + 5-Fu [10], GEM + Oxaliplatin[11], and&#xD;
      GEM + Irinotecan [12] and GEM + Cisplatin [13] (7-8) . Until 2011, Conroy et al.[15] reported&#xD;
      that FOLFIRINOX solutions significantly improved ORR (31.6% vs 9%, P=0.0008), PFS (6.4 vs.&#xD;
      3.3 months, P&lt;0.0001) and OS (11.1 vs. 6.8 months, P&lt;0.001) than GEM single-agent, but the&#xD;
      significant increase of grade 3/4 adverse reactions, to some extent, limited its wide&#xD;
      application. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to explore effective and safe&#xD;
      chemotherapy of advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nab-Paclitaxel was approved by FDA for advanced pancreatic cancer in September 2013. S-1 has&#xD;
      demonstrated potential value in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer as a new compound&#xD;
      oral 5-FU(4-5) and has been approved for pancreatic cancer treatment in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a single arm, prospective, phase II study in our center on the first-line&#xD;
      treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with nab-Paclitaxel and S-1 to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the combination regimen.&#xD;
