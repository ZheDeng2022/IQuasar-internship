  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by chronic&#xD;
      inflammation limited to colonic mucosa. Its pathogenesis is not still clear, even if a&#xD;
      multifactorial aetiology has been advocated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      long-term efficacy of two different doses of VSL#3® added on standard therapy (5-ASA) in&#xD;
      maintaining remission in an adult population of patients with UC, compared with the standard&#xD;
      therapy (5-ASA) plus placebo. The investigators hypothesized that adding VSL#3® to mesalamine&#xD;
      would lead to higher remission rate at long-term evaluation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II a, parallel-groups, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      single-center, dose finding study in subjects with UC in remission. Two different oral doses&#xD;
      of VSL#3® added to standard therapy (5-ASA) will be investigated compared to standard therapy&#xD;
      (5-ASA) plus placebo (in a 1:1:1 ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard therapy for maintaining remission. 39 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment arms for the 12-month treatment period as&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group A: 13 patients will receive mesalamine 2.4 g/day in once daily administration plus&#xD;
           VSL#3® 450 billion sachet, two sachets per day for 12 months (900 billion of bacteria&#xD;
           per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group B: 13 patients will receive mesalamine 2.4 g/day in once daily administration plus&#xD;
           VSL#3® 450 billion sachet, two sachets twice a day (1800 billion of bacteria per day)&#xD;
           for 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group C: 13 patients will receive mesalamine 2.4 g/day in once daily administration plus&#xD;
           placebo for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation in this study will be approximately 20 months which includes up to a&#xD;
      8-week screening period, a 12-month treatment period, and a 6-month follow-up period. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of the 12-month treatment period, subjects will continue in the 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      period (telephone contact conducted after 6 months).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that&#xD;
             the subject (or a legal representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects are willing and able to participate in the study, complete subject&#xD;
             assessments, attend scheduled clinic visits, and comply with all protocol requirements&#xD;
             as evidenced by written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male and/or female subjects aged ≥18 years at the time of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A diagnosis of UC for ≥3 months. A biopsy report must be available to confirm the&#xD;
             histological diagnosis in the subject's source documentation. In addition, a report&#xD;
             documenting disease duration and extent of disease (e.g., proctosigmoiditis,&#xD;
             left-sided colitis and pancolitis) based upon prior colonoscopy must also be available&#xD;
             in source documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must have a flexible sigmoidoscopy indicative of UC in remission (Mayo endoscopic&#xD;
             subscore ≤1) during screening period, to be performed after all other inclusion&#xD;
             criteria have been met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have history of previous mild-to-moderate active disease beyond the rectum (&gt;15&#xD;
             cm from the anal verge).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have UC in remission with a Total Mayo Score ≤2 with no individual subscore&gt;1 and&#xD;
             rectal bleed subscore of 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must be on maintenance treatment with oral mesalamine (&lt;2.5 g/day), sulfasalazine&#xD;
             (&lt;3.0 g/day) or olsalazine (&lt;1.5 g/day) on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks before&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male and female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to avoid pregnancy&#xD;
             throughout the duration of the study (defined as the time of the signing of the&#xD;
             informed consent through the conclusion of subject participation). A subject is of&#xD;
             childbearing potential if, in the opinion of the investigator, he/she is biologically&#xD;
             capable of having children and is sexually active.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
                  result at screening. WOCBP are defined as women who are biologically capable of&#xD;
                  becoming pregnant, including women who are using contraceptives or whose sexual&#xD;
                  partners are either sterile or using contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of non-childbearing potential (WONCBP) do not require a urine pregnancy&#xD;
                  test and must meet at least one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Have undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Have medically confirmed ovarian failure or are medically confirmed to be&#xD;
                       post-menopausal (cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive&#xD;
                       months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause; laboratory&#xD;
                       confirmation of Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level may be indicated if&#xD;
                       subject has history of amenorrhea for ≥ 52 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Are medically confirmed to be post-menopausal (cessation of regular menses&#xD;
                       for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or&#xD;
                       physiological cause; laboratory confirmation of FSH level may be indicated&#xD;
                       if subject has history of amenorrhea for ≥ 52 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis or Crohn's disease. Subjects with&#xD;
             clinical findings suggestive of Crohn's disease, e.g., fistulae or granulomas on&#xD;
             biopsy are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with colonic dysplasia or neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with a history of colonic or small bowel obstruction or resection, except for&#xD;
             appendectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of rectal 5-aminosalicylic acid or systemic or rectal corticosteroids within 30&#xD;
             days before baseline, use of immunosuppressive agents within 12 weeks before baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Use of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNFα) or anti-integrin therapy for UC at any&#xD;
             moment of previous patient history 6. Repeated use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
             drugs (NSAIDs), including the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or&#xD;
             ibuprofen (except for prophylactic use of a stable dose of aspirin up to 325 mg / day&#xD;
             for cardiac disease). Occasional use of NSAIDs is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Subjects who had received another investigational agent within 30 days before baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Any major illness/condition or evidence of an unstable clinical condition (eg, renal,&#xD;
        hepatic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, immunologic, or local active&#xD;
        infection/infectious illness) that, in the investigator's judgement will substantially&#xD;
        increase the risk to the subject if he or she participates in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        10. Women during pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
