  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cleft palate (CP) is a common congenital malformation, with an incidence ranging from 0.1 to&#xD;
      1.1 per 1000 births depending on the population group (liau et al, 2010). Early surgery is&#xD;
      necessary to reduce phonation and feeding difficulties and reduce complications such as&#xD;
      frequent sinusitis and other respiratory tract infections (Takemura et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CP repair is painful, necessitating high doses of intravenous (I.V.) opioids. Therefore, the&#xD;
      risk of postoperative respiratory depression and airway obstruction is important, and&#xD;
      continuous monitoring is required during the initial 48h postoperatively (Roulleau et al,&#xD;
      2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maxillary nerve block using the suprazygomatic approach is used in children since it presents&#xD;
      a lower rate of complications (Captier et al, 2009). By this way, one can reach the nerve as&#xD;
      it exits the skull at the foramen rotundum within the pterygopalatine fossa, before the&#xD;
      location where its nervous branches innervate the palate (Prigge et al, 2014). This simple,&#xD;
      reliable and almost risk-free approach can yield an effective and prolonged anesthesia with a&#xD;
      clear decreased use of morphine agents during and after cleft lip-palate surgery in small&#xD;
      children (Mesnil et al, 2010). The nerve block must be bilateral. The local anesthetic (LA)&#xD;
      is directly injected in the middle part of the fossa at a distance from the foramen rotundum&#xD;
      to avoid any trauma to the nerve or vascular injury, as soon as the tip of the needle has&#xD;
      crossed the temporal muscle (Binet et al, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various adjuvants to local anesthetics to increase the duration of block are described in the&#xD;
      literature and used in the daily clinical practice. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha 2&#xD;
      (α2) adrenergic agonist with both analgesic and sedative properties. Animal studies showed&#xD;
      that perineural dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine or ropivacaine prolongs the duration of&#xD;
      sensory and motor block (Brummett et al, 2011). Other clinical studies investigated the use&#xD;
      of dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing ulnar nerve, axillary brachial and greater palatine&#xD;
      nerve blocks, showed faster onset time and longer duration of block (Marhofer et al, 2013/&#xD;
      Esmaoglu et al, 2010&amp; Obayah et al, 2010).&#xD;

      Preoperative assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day prior to surgery, all patients will undergo pre-anesthetic checkup including detailed&#xD;
      history, physical, systemic examination and weight of the patient. All patients will be&#xD;
      investigated for exclusion of any of the above mentioned contraindications. Laboratory work&#xD;
      needed will include: Complete Blood Count (CBC); Prothrombin Time and Concentration (PT&amp; PC);&#xD;
      Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) and Bleeding Time (BT). All children will be kept nil per&#xD;
      mouth 6-8 h for solids and 2 h for clear liquids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent and emergency resuscitation equipments including airway devices, pediatric&#xD;
      advanced life support drugs for LA toxicity will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in this study will be anesthetized by the same team of anesthesiologists and&#xD;
      operated upon by the same surgeon who will be unaware of the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be standardized for all patients in both groups using 8 MAC&#xD;
      sevoflurane in 100% O2 with appropriate size face mask. Intraoperative monitoring will&#xD;
      include ECG, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, capnography and temperature probe.&#xD;
      After intravenous access securing, endotracheal intubation with appropriate size to the&#xD;
      patient's age will be performed after administration of 2 mg/kg propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After orotracheal intubation, assisted mechanical ventilation using Ayre's T- piece will be&#xD;
      used to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide at 35±5 mmHg. General anesthesia will be maintained&#xD;
      with 2-3 MAC sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, patients will receive an infusion of normal saline 0.9% solution 4ml/ kg /&#xD;
      h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bilateral SMB will be performed before surgery in anesthetized children, after aseptic&#xD;
      preparation of the skin. The patient will be in supine position with the head in neutral&#xD;
      position. The puncture site will be at the frontozygomatic angle, at the junction of the&#xD;
      upper edge of the zygomatic arch and the frontal bone. A needle with 50 mm length and 25&#xD;
      gauge will be inserted perpendicular to the skin. It will be advanced to reach the greater&#xD;
      wing of sphenoid at approximately 20 mm depth, then withdrawn a few millimeters and will be&#xD;
      redirected toward the nasolabial fold in a 20° forward and 10° downward direction. The&#xD;
      progression in the pterygopalatine fossa will be 35 to 45 mm. Loss of resistance after&#xD;
      passing through the temporalis muscle will assist in determining the puncture depth. After a&#xD;
      negative blood aspiration test, 0.2 ml/kg of the blinded study solution will be injected on&#xD;
      each side (Captier et al, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAP, HR, SPO2 and end-tidal CO2 will be recorded before induction of anesthesia, before&#xD;
      block, after the block and every 10 minutes till end of surgery. Skin incision will be made&#xD;
      20 minutes after SMB block. An increase in HR and MAP above 20% of baseline values with skin&#xD;
      incision will be considered as a sign of inadequate analgesia. In this case, fentanyl 1 µg/kg&#xD;
      will be given intravenously, and the case will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate complications related to regional anesthesia will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic toxicity related to local anesthetics (seizures, heart rhythm, or conduction&#xD;
           disorder)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding at puncture site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pupil alteration and ocular lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the end of surgery, IV paracetamol 15 mg/kg and dexamethasone 0.2 mg/kg will be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the surgical procedure, extubation will be done after ensuring adequate&#xD;
      orogastric suction and patients will be transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PACU: MAP, HR, modified CHEOPS, POV and sedation score will be recorded on admission to&#xD;
      PACU, 1, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24h postoperatively by an observer who will be unaware of the study&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain will be measured using a modified Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario&#xD;
      Pain Scale (CHEOPS) (Taddio et al, 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEOPS = SUM (points for all 6 parameters)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interpretation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  minimum score: 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maximum score: 13 Patients with modified CHEOPS &gt; 6 will be given rescue analgesia with&#xD;
           15 mg/kg paracetamol intravenously. Those with modified CHEOPS of 4-5 will be given&#xD;
           paracetamol 25-40 mg/kg as suppository. Pain scores will be recorded every 10 minutes&#xD;
           after administration of rescue analgesia to evaluate pain relief or need for further&#xD;
           rescue analgesia. The number of children who will need postoperative rescue analgesics&#xD;
           and the duration of analgesia that will be taken at the time when an analgesic is&#xD;
           required will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative vomiting episodes will be recorded and treated with intravenous metoclopramide&#xD;
      0.5 mg/kg. Postoperative sedation will be assessed using sedation score described by Culebras&#xD;
      et al, 2001 (1. Awake and alert. 2. Sleeping but easily arouses to voice or light touch. 3.&#xD;
      Arouses to loud voice or shaking. 4. Arouses with painful stimuli only. 5. Unarousable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed complications of the blocks will be also investigated and recorded as hematoma,&#xD;
      restricted mouth opening, vision, sensory or motor deficit, eating disorder, and local&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parents will be asked to evaluate their satisfaction regarding pain control at the end of&#xD;
      48h postoperatively through 5-point Likertscale (1 = very satisfied, 2 = satisfied, 3 =&#xD;
      neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4 = dissatisfied, 5 = very dissatisfied).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be discharged from the hospital when they are pain free and there is no other&#xD;
      medical reason to admit them to a surgical ward.&#xD;
