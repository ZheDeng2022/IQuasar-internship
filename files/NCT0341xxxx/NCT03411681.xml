  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has numerous comorbidities that are associated with exceedingly high healthcare&#xD;
      costs. In addition to well- characterized impairments in lipid and glucose metabolism,&#xD;
      obesity is associated with altered protein metabolism. We have recently observed that obese&#xD;
      individuals are essentially nonresponsive to protein ingestion with respect to myofibrillar&#xD;
      protein synthesis. This suggests that skeletal muscle remodeling in obese individuals is&#xD;
      impaired possibly contributing to a poor metabolic quality of muscle. Resistance exercise is&#xD;
      known to strongly augment muscle protein synthesis in response to protein ingestion. The&#xD;
      purpose of this research is to determine the muscle protein synthetic response during&#xD;
      post-exercise recovery in obese individuals. Using stable isotope methodology, we will&#xD;
      determine the postprandial muscle protein synthetic response in 14 male and female obese&#xD;
      adults (Age: 20-45, BMI: 30-39.9 kg/m2) immediately after an acute bout of resistance&#xD;
      exercise. Participants will be sedentary (&lt; 60 min exercise/ week) and weight stable for a&#xD;
      minimum of 6 months. During the testing blood and muscle samples will be collected. In&#xD;
      addition participants will be asked to perform moderate intensity resistance exercise.&#xD;
      Completion of the proposed research will identify the role of resistance exercise in the&#xD;
      maintenance of skeletal muscle tissue after the consumption of a protein-dense meal in obese&#xD;
      people.&#xD;

      Baseline procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parallel group design will be used for this study. Prior to the infusion trial,&#xD;
      participants will reported to the laboratory on two separate occasions in the morning. On the&#xD;
      first visit, we will determine participants' body weight and height as well as body&#xD;
      composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Finally, participants will be familiarized&#xD;
      with unilateral leg extension and the ten repetition maximum (10RM) procedure. On a separate&#xD;
      occasion, each subject will arrive to the lab after an overnight fast for the determination&#xD;
      of oral glucose tolerance in response to the consumption of 75 g glucose dissolved in 500 mL&#xD;
      of water. At the end of this visit, we will assess participant's unilateral 10RM for leg&#xD;
      extension. In addition, participants will be instructed to refrain from vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity and alcohol for three days prior to the tracer infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infusion protocol On the day of the infusion trial, participants will report to the&#xD;
      laboratory at ~0700 h after a 10 h fast. An intravenous catheter will be inserted into an&#xD;
      antecubital vein for baseline blood sample collection, after which a primed (2 μmol·kg-1),&#xD;
      continuous infusion (0.05 μmol·kg Lean Body Mass-1·min-1) of L-[ring-13C6]phenylalanine will&#xD;
      be initiated (t=-180 min) and maintained until the end of the trial. A second intravenous&#xD;
      catheter placed in a contralateral dorsal hand vein will be placed in a heated blanket for&#xD;
      repeated arterialized blood sampling. In the post-absorptive state, muscle biopsies of the&#xD;
      vastus lateralis are to be collected at 0 min of infusion from a non-exercised control leg&#xD;
      (CON). Subsequently, participants will perform moderate intensity unilateral leg extension&#xD;
      exercise. Upon completion, participants will consume 170 g of lean ground pork (36 g&#xD;
      protein). Additional muscle biopsies will be collected from both the exercised (EX) and CON&#xD;
      legs at 120 and 300 min after pork ingestion. Arterialized blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      every 30 or 60 min during the post-absorptive and postprandial-states and placed in&#xD;
      pre-chilled EDTA tubes.&#xD;
