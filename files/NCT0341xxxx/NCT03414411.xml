  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to follow a cohort of HIV-infected adults who have alcohol&#xD;
      and/or drug use to: 1) test the associations between alcohol (and illicit drugs and&#xD;
      polypharmacy (multiple prescribed medications)) and falls (fractures secondarily), and&#xD;
      whether frailty mediates these associations; and 2) test the associations between alcohol&#xD;
      (and illicit drugs and polypharmacy) and utilization (emergency department use and&#xD;
      hospitalization for falls and fractures), and whether frailty mediates them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the stated aims the investigators will expand (to 400) and continue to follow an&#xD;
      existing prospective cohort (The Boston ARCH Cohort) of adults with HIV infection and a high&#xD;
      prevalence of exposure to alcohol, other drugs, and polypharmacy. The Boston ARCH Cohort is a&#xD;
      longitudinal cohort (1-3.5 years of follow-up) of 250 HIV-infected men and women with current&#xD;
      substance dependence or ever injection drug use that have a spectrum of alcohol use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to a third of middle-aged people living with HIV infection (PLWH) experience falls each&#xD;
      year. Falls are the most common cause of non-fatal injury in the US and the cost from&#xD;
      emergency department visits and hospitalizations are enormous. PLWH are more susceptible to&#xD;
      falls and their serious consequences because 1) despite control of HIV viremia, inflammation&#xD;
      persists and underlies HIV-associated comorbidities and complications that occur at a&#xD;
      relatively young age (so-called premature aging); 2) specific comorbidities (e.g.,&#xD;
      neuropathy, osteoporosis) and complications (e.g., frailty and impaired physical function)&#xD;
      make falls more likely and recovery from them more difficult; 3) alcohol use exacerbates&#xD;
      inflammation, and may increase risk for comorbidities and complications; and 4) alcohol use,&#xD;
      illicit drug use and polypharmacy can increase the likelihood of a fall. Despite this, fall&#xD;
      prevention has not been extensively studied among PLWH. Interventions are needed to address&#xD;
      falls in PLWH but none have been tailored for this population. Understanding risk factors and&#xD;
      targets for intervention among PLWH are essential; cohort studies can provide the information&#xD;
      needed for intervention development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part the Consortia for HIV/AIDS and Alcohol-Related Research Trials (CHAART).&#xD;
      It describes the continuation and expansion of a cohort that is one of three in the Uganda&#xD;
      Russia Boston Alcohol Network for Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH).&#xD;
      The URBAN ARCH theme is to address consequences of alcohol use on HIV-associated&#xD;
      comorbidities and complications to increase treatment availability and improve outcomes. In&#xD;
      line with that theme the investigators will continue to follow and expand (to 400) an&#xD;
      existing cohort of PLWH and a high prevalence of exposure to alcohol, illicit drugs, and&#xD;
      polypharmacy (the Boston ARCH Cohort) in the Frailty, Functional impairment, Falls, and&#xD;
      Fractures (4F study) to: (in 2 Primary Aims) 1) Test the associations between alcohol (and&#xD;
      illicit drugs and polypharmacy) and falls (fractures secondarily); and 2) Test the&#xD;
      associations between alcohol (and illicit drugs and polypharmacy) and acute healthcare&#xD;
      utilization (emergency department use and hospitalization for falls and fractures). The&#xD;
      investigators will examine the role frailty plays in these associations between alcohol,&#xD;
      drugs and medications and the aforementioned clinical and utilization outcomes. By achieving&#xD;
      these aims the investigators will gain substantially greater understanding of these&#xD;
      comorbidities and complications in PLWH exposed to alcohol and other psychoactive substances;&#xD;
      this knowledge will serve to inform the development of ways to identify, prevent and manage&#xD;
      falls, fractures, frailty and functional impairment.&#xD;
