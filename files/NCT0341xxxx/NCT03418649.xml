  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a leading cause of disability and health care costs in the United States,&#xD;
      and treatments are ineffective for many patients. Epidural steroid injections are a common&#xD;
      treatment, but their efficacy has been questioned and for many patients they do not provide&#xD;
      complete relief. The investigators hypothesize, based on preclinical studies, that lack of&#xD;
      complete efficacy may be due to the fact that clinically used steroids activate not only the&#xD;
      intended drug target, the glucocorticoid receptor, but also the pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      mineralocorticoid receptor. To test this hypothesis, this pilot study will recruit patients&#xD;
      scheduled for lumbar epidural steroid injections for degenerative disc disease, and randomize&#xD;
      them to receive a concurrent treatment with oral eplerenone (a clinically approved antagonist&#xD;
      of the mineralocorticoid receptor) or placebo for 10 days starting just after the epidural&#xD;
      injection. At several time points during the following year, subjects will answer the&#xD;
      Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire, to report on both pain and functional outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with degenerative disc disease, who are recommended to have an epidural steroid&#xD;
      injection as part of their routine clinical care, will be invited to participate in the study&#xD;
      prior to their first epidural steroid injection. If they consent, they will complete the&#xD;
      Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire (version 2) just prior to their first injection which&#xD;
      captures the functional effects of back pain on various activities, providing a more&#xD;
      meaningful picture than a simple static pain rating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will complete the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire again four weeks after&#xD;
      their first injection, a time point at which patients routinely have a follow-up visit.&#xD;
      Patients referred for a second injection at this time will complete an additional Oswestry&#xD;
      just prior to that injection. Subjects will be asked to complete additional Oswestry Low Back&#xD;
      Pain Questionnaires at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year after their epidural injection (or after&#xD;
      their second epidural injection if this is recommended).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to receiving study medication (eplerenone or placebo), subjects will provide a blood&#xD;
      sample to examine their creatinine and potassium levels, to ensure there are no&#xD;
      contraindications to taking eplerenone. C reactive protein levels will also be measured just&#xD;
      prior to epidural steroid injections to determine whether this can help predict the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the pain questionnaires, data will be collected from the subjects' medical&#xD;
      charts regarding basic clinical demographics and clinical outcome of the epidural steroid&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
