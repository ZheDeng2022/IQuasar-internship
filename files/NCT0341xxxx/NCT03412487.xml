      25 women with Premature Ovarian Failure who attended Fayoum university hospital gynecology&#xD;
      outpatient clinic (case group) and another group of 25 women with normal ovarian function&#xD;
      (control group).Pelvic laparoscopy and ovarian biopsy To be examined histologically. All&#xD;
      procedures were performed under general anesthesia the utero-ovarian ligament was stabilized&#xD;
      with the round biopter introduced through the other. The round metal biopter 5 mm in diameter&#xD;
      with an inner protective trocar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tip of the biopsy instrument was placed on an area of the ovary free of cysts; the hilar&#xD;
      area was avoided because it is deficient in small follicles. After correct placement was&#xD;
      verified, the inner protecting trocar was removed to expose the sharp leading edge of the&#xD;
      round sheath. Gentle circular movements were made cutting through the ovarian cortex to&#xD;
      produce a 5-mm disk of 2-3 mm in thickness. The round biopter was removed, and a grasper was&#xD;
      introduced to recover the excised tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian biopsy specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin forming tissue&#xD;
      blocks. Two sections, 4Î¼ thick were cut from each block. One was stained with routine&#xD;
      haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain while the other was immunostained with anti-Leukocyte&#xD;
      Common Antigen (LCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of autoimmune oophoritis, sections were immunostained with anti-LCA (CD45)&#xD;
