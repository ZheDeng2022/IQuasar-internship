      Background: The microbiota-dependent metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) has been&#xD;
      reported as a novel and independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular and&#xD;
      metabolic diseases, but the association with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the association between plasma TMAO concentration and GDM in a&#xD;
      two-phase study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The initial discovery phase included 866 pregnant women (433 GDM cases and 433&#xD;
      matched controls) in Wuhan China. Study participants were recruited from pregnant women who&#xD;
      attended the outpatient clinics of the Department of Endocrinology, Tongji Hospital, to&#xD;
      screen for GDM between August 2012 and April 2015, or pregnant women who visited the Hubei&#xD;
      Maternal and Child Health Hospital or the Central Hospital of Wuhan for a routine antenatal&#xD;
      checkup from May 2014 to November 2016. The inclusion criteria of participants were: age ≥ 20&#xD;
      years, gestational age between 24 and 32 weeks, no history of a diagnosis of diabetes or&#xD;
      gestational diabetes, and no history of receiving pharmacological treatment known to affect&#xD;
      glucose metabolism. An independent replication phase study was nested within an ongoing&#xD;
      prospective cohort study, namely the Tongji Maternal and Child Health Cohort (TMCHC).&#xD;
      Beginning in January 2013, women receiving prenatal care prior to 16 weeks of gestation were&#xD;
      invited to join the TMCHC. Exclusion criteria included pre-pregnancy diabetes, clinically&#xD;
      significant neurological, endocrinological or other systemic diseases and multiple&#xD;
      pregnancies. All enrolled pregnant women received a regular prenatal checkup in hospital and&#xD;
      underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) during 24-32 weeks of gestation to screen for&#xD;
      GDM. 276 members who developed GDM before May 2016 and had fasting blood collected before 20&#xD;
      weeks'gestation were included as cases in this analysis. Two controls were individually&#xD;
      matched to each case from among women without GDM. These two studies were approved by the&#xD;
      ethics committee of Tongji Medical College. All the participants gave informed written&#xD;
      consent before they were included in the study. Plasma TMAO concentrations were determined by&#xD;
      stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography with online electrospray ionization tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry.&#xD;

    <description>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was diagnosed according to the American Diabetes Association criteria, which is based on the &quot;one-step&quot; approach recommended by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups. All women underwent a 75g OGTT in the morning after an overnight fast, with plasma glucose measurement fasting and at 1 and 2 hours. The criteria for GDM diagnosis was to have at least one abnormal value: Fasting glucose ≥ 5.1 mmol/L (92 mg/dL), 1 h glucose ≥ 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL), 2 h glucose ≥ 8.5 mmol/L (153 mg/dL).</description>
