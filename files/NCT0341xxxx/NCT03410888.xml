      Study Hypothesis The investigators approach to demonstrate noninferiority of analgesia&#xD;
      provided by popliteal block in TKA surgery will be based on a hypothesis of absence of a&#xD;
      clinically significant difference in pain visual analogue sores (VAS) between the analgesia&#xD;
      provided by the popliteal block and that of the infragluteal sciatic block in TKA surgery&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sciatic nerve block provides clinically significant analgesic benefits following total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA). These benefits include a reduction in pain scores and decrease analgesic&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these benefits, sciatic nerve block has remained among the least performed peripheral&#xD;
      nerve block by anesthesiologists. Some impediments relating to single shot sciatic nerve&#xD;
      block (SSNB) that may cause anesthesiologists to avoid it include, patient discomfort due to&#xD;
      needle passage through dense gluteal or thigh adipose and musculature, and unreliable success&#xD;
      because of difficulty in localizing the sciatic nerve (particularly in obese patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even in the current era of US guidance, sciatic nerve block remains a challenge. Despite its&#xD;
      helpfulness, ultrasound technology remains hindered by an intrinsic limitation: a trade off&#xD;
      between depth of penetration and image resolution; therefore, it works well for superficial&#xD;
      blocks but becomes less useful when deep structures are imaged-ironically where this guidance&#xD;
      is needed most. The challenge of anatomical depth, as in the case of the sciatic nerve, is&#xD;
      one remaining challenge that dictates practical restrictions on the patterns of practice of&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, the recommendations of the Joint Committee for Education and Training composed of&#xD;
      the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and the European Society of Regional Anesthesia&#xD;
      cite the depth of block resulting in degradation of both ultrasound and needle image as the&#xD;
      first among other causes that increase the level of difficulty of a nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the sciatic nerve travels caudally in the body, it becomes more superficial with less&#xD;
      thickness of tissue separating it from skin surface, making distal sciatic nerve block an&#xD;
      attractive alternative. Indeed, both articular branches which provide sensory innervation to&#xD;
      the knee joint as well as its muscular branches which provide innervation to the muscles&#xD;
      surrounding knee joint most commonly arise from the sciatic nerve either at the knee level,&#xD;
      or just above the knee or within the popliteal fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blockade of the sciatic nerve at the level of the popliteal fossa, commonly termed a&#xD;
      popliteal block, is technically easier to perform than gluteal sciatic block and may even be&#xD;
      associated with less risk of intravascular injection and nerve injury. Indeed, popliteal&#xD;
      block has been reported to provide good postoperative analgesia in total knee replacement and&#xD;
      other major knee surgery. However, the small posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh, which&#xD;
      supplies only the skin on the back of the thigh and knee, separates from the sciatic nerve&#xD;
      proximally and variably in the gluteal region, and will be spared in more distal approaches.&#xD;
      It is for this reason why many practitioners are hesitant to perform distal sciatic nerve&#xD;
      blocks for TKA. However, the relative importance of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the&#xD;
      thigh for post-operative analgesia following TKA is unknown and maybe clinically&#xD;
      insignificant.&#xD;

Under ultrasound guidance a 50 to 90 mm 22 G needle is inserted in and advanced to contact the target nerve until nerve movement is detected. The end point of nerve block in this group is obtaining a circumferential local anesthetic spread around the sciatic nerve.</description>

    <description>Infragluteal approach: The patients in this group will receive sciatic bock according to the approach described by Chan et al. Ultrasound scanning will be used to identify and mark the greater trochanter laterally and the ischial tuberosity medially. The sciatic nerve is usually found anterior (deep) to the gluteus maximus muscle and lateral to the origin of the biceps femoris muscle at the ischial tuberosity as well as medial to the greater trochanter. The end point of nerve block in this group is obtaining a circumferential local anesthetic spread around the sciatic nerve.</description>
