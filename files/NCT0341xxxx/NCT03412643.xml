  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, open label, multicenter interventional study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anti-HER2 antibodies in patients with&#xD;
      HER2-negative invasive breast cancer who have abnormal HER2 signaling activity determined by&#xD;
      the Celcuity CELx HER2 Signaling Function (HSF) testing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be required to have a prescreening research core needle biopsy to procure a&#xD;
      fresh tumor specimen that will be sent to Celcuity for CELx HSF testing, in order to assess&#xD;
      the status of their HER2 signaling activity (abnormally or normally active).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have abnormal HER2 signaling activity will receive weekly paclitaxel plus the&#xD;
      anti-HER2 therapy regimen of trastuzumab and pertuzumab following completion of initial&#xD;
      doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide.The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      patients with HER2-negative breast cancers based on standard American Society of Clinical&#xD;
      Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) testing criteria, but with abnormal&#xD;
      HER2-driven signaling pathways determined by the Celcuity HSF assay and receive HER2-targeted&#xD;
      therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, will have a higher rate of pathological complete&#xD;
      response in the breast and lymph nodes (pCR breast and lymph nodes) than has been found&#xD;
      historically in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone. Secondary endpoints include pathologic complete response (breast),&#xD;
      clinical complete response (cCR), residual cancer burden (RCB) 0-1 index, and relationship&#xD;
      between quantitative CELx score and pCR rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that approximately 270 patients will need to be prescreened in order to enroll&#xD;
      54 patients (26 ER-positive/HER2-negative and 28 ER-negative/HER2-negative) who have abnormal&#xD;
      HER2 signaling activity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        SCREENING PRIOR TO INITIATING CHEMOTHERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
        The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle&#xD;
        biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The primary breast tumor must be palpable and measure greater than or equal 2.0 cm on&#xD;
        physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The regional lymph nodes can be cN0, cN1, or cN2a.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histological grade II or III tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes must be evaluated by imaging (mammogram, ultrasound,&#xD;
        and/or MRI) within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy. If suspicious or abnormal, FNA&#xD;
        or core biopsy is recommended, also within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy.&#xD;
        Findings of these evaluations will be used to determine the nodal status prior to&#xD;
        initiating chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nodal status - negative: Imaging of the axilla is negative; Imaging is suspicious or&#xD;
             abnormal but the FNA or core biopsy of the questionable node(s) on imaging is&#xD;
             negative;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nodal status - positive: FNA or core biopsy of the node(s) is cytologically or&#xD;
             histologically suspicious or positive. Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but FNA or&#xD;
             core biopsy was not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis must have ER and progesterone receptor&#xD;
        (PgR) analysis assessed by current ASCO/CAP Guidelines. Patients are eligible with either&#xD;
        hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-negative tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis must have been determined to be&#xD;
        HER2-negative as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0-1+; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IHC 2+ and in situ hybridization (ISH) non-amplified with a ratio of HER2 to&#xD;
             chromosome enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) less than 2.0, and if reported, average HER2&#xD;
             gene copy number less than 4 signals/cells; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ISH non-amplified with a ratio of HER2 to CEP17 less than 2.0, and if reported,&#xD;
             average HER2 gene copy number less than 4 signals/cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Blood counts performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must meet the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal 1200/mm3;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platelet count must be greater than or equal 100,000/mm3; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hemoglobin must be greater than or equal 10 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function performed within 6 weeks&#xD;
        prior to initiating chemotherapy must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin must be less than or equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab&#xD;
             unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to&#xD;
             Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the&#xD;
             alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN, the&#xD;
             AST must be less than or equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less&#xD;
             than or equal to 1.5 x ULN, the alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to&#xD;
             ULN. Note: If alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is performed instead of AST (per&#xD;
             institution's standard practice), the ALT value must be less than or equal to 1.5 x&#xD;
             ULN; if both were performed, the AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in&#xD;
        the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, PET-CT, or PET scan) performed within 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
        initiating chemotherapy does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements in&#xD;
        next criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x&#xD;
        ULN or unexplained bone pain are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PET-CT&#xD;
        scan, or positron emission tomography (PET) scan performed within 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
        initiating chemotherapy does not demonstrate metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serum creatinine performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must be less&#xD;
        than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment by echocardiogram or multi-gated&#xD;
        acquisition (MUGA) scan performed within 90 days prior to initiating chemotherapy must be&#xD;
        greater than or equal 55 percent regardless of the facility's lower limit of normal (LLN).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of&#xD;
        contraception during therapy and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study&#xD;
&#xD;
