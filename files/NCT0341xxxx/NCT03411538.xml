  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective surveillance study to estimate excess deaths due to and risk factors&#xD;
      associated with antibiotic-resistant infection among patients with hospital-acquired&#xD;
      infection (HAI) in a resource-limited setting. We will focus on six pathogenic bacteria that&#xD;
      are of clinically important in the hospital.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will first identify patients with pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical sample&#xD;
      collected &gt;48 hours after admission. These patients will then be screened for eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. Signed informed consent will be sought from the enrolled patients. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is survival status within 28 days since the first specimen culture positive for one&#xD;
      of the six organisms of interest. All patients with hospital-acquired infection will be&#xD;
      assessed for in-hospital 28-day survival as part of the routine hospital surveillance system.&#xD;
      Follow-up to confirm 28-day outcome via telephone call will be performed only if patient&#xD;
      signed informed consent and permission is granted. All isolates from positive cultures will&#xD;
      be collected and stored securely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not interfere with standard patient care or routine diagnosis procedure,&#xD;
      hence subject will receive no direct medical harm or benefits from being in the study.&#xD;
      Researchers of this study will not be involved in the management, care and treatment of study&#xD;
      subjects. Patient care will remain under the responsibility of the attending medical staff&#xD;
      according to standard practice of care. The study team will work closely with the hospital&#xD;
      Infectious Control team to screen and enroll patients as part of the HAI surveillance data&#xD;
      system in Sunpasitthiprasong Hospital. This study will be an enhancement of the current HAI&#xD;
      surveillance system, which will provide data on 28-day survival status, Charlson&#xD;
      Comorbidities Index (CCI) score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for each&#xD;
      patient and risk factors related to acquiring hospital-acquired infection to the hospital&#xD;
      Infectious Control (IC) team.&#xD;

        The target study subjects include male and female patients of any age admit at the&#xD;
        hospital, and acquired hospital-acquired bacterial infection during hospital stay. We will&#xD;
        focus on six key pathogens that were in the WHO global priority list of&#xD;
        antibiotic-resistant bacteria and are also of clinical importance in resource-limited&#xD;
        settings, namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Staphylococcus aureus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enterococcus spp&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Escherichia coli&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Klebsiella pneumoniae&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pseudomonas aeruginosa&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acinetobacter spp&#xD;
&#xD;
        The severity of underlying illness will be assessed using Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)&#xD;
        score and severity of the infection will be assessed using Sequential Organ Failure&#xD;
        Assessment (SOFA) score. These score will be reported to the physician whenever&#xD;
        appropriate.&#xD;
