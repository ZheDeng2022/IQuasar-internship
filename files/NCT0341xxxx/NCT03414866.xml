  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, prospective non-interventional, multi-centre, post-market study of the&#xD;
      Vascutek Thoraflex™ Hybrid system in patients with acute thoracic aortic syndrome,&#xD;
      subacute/chronic dissection of the aorta and aortic aneurysm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aortic arch pathologies are rare, but pose significant challenges for treatment involving&#xD;
      open surgical or endovascular repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1983 the Elephant Trunk technique was introduced and has greatly facilitated the&#xD;
      management of patients with extensive thoracic aortic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, this traditional open surgery has been combined with thoracic endovascular&#xD;
      repair (TEVAR) and this is known as the 'hybrid' approach. Hybrid repairs, consisting of an&#xD;
      open surgical repair combined with endovascular techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further advancement in the types of prosthesis available has resulted in the evolution of the&#xD;
      conventional ET technique into the frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique. This utilises&#xD;
      devices that incorporate both a traditional dacron graft (for open surgical treatment of the&#xD;
      aortic arch) and a stented graft portion (for treatment of the descending thoracic aorta).&#xD;
      The stented portion of the graft is introduced via an antegrade approach through the&#xD;
      transected arch. The FET technique is now commonly used to treat patients with extensive&#xD;
      thoracic or thoraco-abdominal aortic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascutek Ltd has developed the Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device (Plexus™ 4 and Ante-Flo™) for the&#xD;
      repair or replacement of damaged or diseased vessels of the ascending aorta, aortic arch and&#xD;
      descending thoracic aorta in cases of aneurysm and/or dissection. The Thoraflex™ Hybrid&#xD;
      Device is one of the commercially available frozen elephant trunk prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 3000 Thoraflex™ Hybrid Devices have been sold and the current study seeks to provide&#xD;
      further evidence of the continuing safety and effectiveness of the device.&#xD;
