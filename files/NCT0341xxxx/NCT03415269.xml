      To assess the effect of a single doses of 20 mg ambroxol hydrochloride on cough reflex&#xD;
      sensitivity to citric acid, capsaicin, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and distilled water in&#xD;
      patients with acute cough related to upper respiratory tract infection&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cough is the 5th most common presenting complaint in adults. Cough results from the&#xD;
      stimulation of two types of afferent pathways whose receptors are located within the airway&#xD;
      epithelium. These include rapidly adapting receptors (RARs) and C-fibre receptors. Acute as&#xD;
      well as chronic, non-productive cough, which often follow viral upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection, may result from increased sensitivity of the cough reflex. Relatively little&#xD;
      research has been done to gain insight into the mechanisms of cough in health and disease,&#xD;
      and to properly evaluate potential antitussive therapies. Indeed, little consensus exists&#xD;
      regarding the optimal treatment of acute cough because of the lack of standardised outcome&#xD;
      measures for cough. Possibly the most significant clinical need in terms of cough therapy is&#xD;
      for the cough associated with an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Although the&#xD;
      cough associated with URTI is often self-limiting and resolves within several days, it&#xD;
      undoubtedly accounts for a major proportion of huge worldwide expenditure of over-the-counter&#xD;
      (OTC) cough and cold products where patients are still struggling to find an effective&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory study will enable us to identify the cough challenge agent (CCA) that is&#xD;
      most sensitive to the effect of ambroxol on cough reflex. This is expected to provide a&#xD;
      reproducible response, to use in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open label, study in subjects with acute cough associated with URTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a Screening/Baseline and combined Treatment visit. Subjects will return&#xD;
      approximately 1-4 weeks after their treatment once all symptoms have subsided and the subject&#xD;
      is no longer suffering from URTI, for a Follow-up Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 14 subjects with acute cough in relation to a URTI and who meet all entry criteria will&#xD;
      be assigned to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment p.o 20 mg ambroxol lozenge (Lysopain Ambr MintM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Baseline and post treatment, cough sensitivity will be measured by standard clinical&#xD;
      methodology incorporating a series of four cough challenges (citric acid, capsaicin, ATP and&#xD;
      distilled water).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/baseline visit 1a The Screening and Baseline visit will ensure that each subject&#xD;
      meets all the specified inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase visit 1b Subjects who satisfy all entry criteria at baseline will be&#xD;
      administered 20 mg ambroxol in the form of a lozenge which must be sucked until fully&#xD;
      dissolved in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be administered in the afternoon of the same visit day as the&#xD;
      screening/baseline assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The series of abbreviated cough challenges will be conducted at 30 min and 90 min post dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone contact Patients will be contacted by telephone once a week to determine if all&#xD;
      symptoms associated with URTI have abated. Once this is confirmed patient will be booked in&#xD;
      for the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Phase Subjects will return within 4 weeks after treatment for a Follow-Up Visit&#xD;
      once symptoms of URTI have abated. A series of full cough challenges will be performed at&#xD;
      this vist to determine reduction in cough hypersensitivity.&#xD;
