      The objective of this project is to determine the biological, neurobehavioral, and behavioral&#xD;
      compensatory responses to exercise training-induced energy deficits in overweight to obese&#xD;
      men and women. Participants will engage in exercise at either 2 days or 6 days per week for&#xD;
      12 weeks and have body composition assessed via DXA before and after the exercise&#xD;
      intervention. Accumulated energy balance (weight loss converted to kcal) will be compared to&#xD;
      exercise energy expenditure to determine each individual's level of compensation, termed&#xD;
      compensation index. Predictors of compensation index that will be assessed will include&#xD;
      hunger/satiety hormone concentrations at rest and in response to a meal, reward driven&#xD;
      feeding, changes in metabolic rate, and energy intake throughout the intervention. Exercise&#xD;
      reinforcement and physical activity will also be assessed as a separate aim to determine if&#xD;
      exercise reinforcement can be increased and if this can promote greater habitual physical&#xD;
      activity after the intervention has ceased.&#xD;

      Study Design: A factorial design will be employed with exercise frequency (6 days/week or 2&#xD;
      days/week) treated as a between-subjects variable and time (baseline, end of training, end&#xD;
      follow-up) treated as a within subjects variable. Subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      exercise groups (6 days/week, 2 days/week) or sedentary control. The control group will be&#xD;
      offered the intervention (personalized exercise plan, provided membership to YMCA) after&#xD;
      follow-up measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will aim to complete all assessments on 60 participants&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Tobacco use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a medical condition that prevents safe exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriateness of exercise will be screened using a Health History and Physical Activity&#xD;
      Readiness Questionnaire. Subjects will taste and rate their liking of the study foods.&#xD;
      Subjects must have a liking of at least 5 out of 10 for 50% of the study foods. Subjects will&#xD;
      provide informed consent before participation. There are no hypotheses on gender or race&#xD;
      effects and we will strive to recruit a representative sample that includes all gender and&#xD;
      ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: (Primary) Accumulated negative energy balance will be greater when exercising 2 times per&#xD;
      week than exercising 6 times per week at 3000 kcal/week for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: The RRVfood will increase more in response to 6 weekly exercise sessions than 2 sessions&#xD;
      after 12 weeks of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Energy intake will increase more in response to 6 weekly exercise sessions than 2&#xD;
      sessions after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: Changes in GLP-1 concentration and RRVfood will be positively associated. H5: GLP-1, PYY,&#xD;
      CCK, leptin, and pancreatic polypeptide concentrations will decrease in response to a meal&#xD;
      more with 6 weekly exercise sessions than 2 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H6: Ghrelin concentrations will increase in response to a meal more with 6 weekly exercise&#xD;
      sessions than 2 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H7: RRVexercise will increase more in response to 2 weekly exercise sessions than 6 sessions&#xD;
      after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H8: Tolerance to exercise discomfort will increase more in response to 2 weekly exercise&#xD;
      sessions than 6 sessions after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H9: The RRVexercise and tolerance to exercise discomfort will be positively associated with&#xD;
      maintenance of exercise behaviors 4 weeks after the intervention (week 16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H10: Changes in hunger hormones/peptides after 12 weeks of exercise will predict weight loss&#xD;
      maintenance at week 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial visit, participants will be informed about the study and have any&#xD;
      questions answered. If deemed eligible and the participant desires to participate, they will&#xD;
      be asked to provide written informed consent. After signing the consent, participants will&#xD;
      fill out a demographic form, a medical history form and Physical Activity Readiness form, and&#xD;
      be measured for anthropometrics (height and weight). These forms will be stored in a locked&#xD;
      file cabinet in Dr. Flack's office separate from other study files. Subjects will also be&#xD;
      provided an ActiGraph device to wear for the following week to monitor free-living physical&#xD;
      activity and complete the Preference for and Tolerance of the Intensity of Exercise&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PRETIE-Q), the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREVQ-3), and&#xD;
      the vendor form, so a payment can be processed) at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome visits: Outcome measures will be completed during baseline and immediately following&#xD;
      the 12 weeks of training (Post/ week 13). Outcome measures will be completed at the CCTS,&#xD;
      laboratory space in Funkhouser (room 117), Joe Craft Football Training Facility, or the Human&#xD;
      Performance Laboratory as needed. The sequential order of the visits to measure outcomes is&#xD;
      flexible in order to meet the scheduling complexities of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerometer administration: occurs at screening, after post-training assessments (week 14),&#xD;
      and after follow-up assessments (week 19). Subjects will wear an accelerometer for seven&#xD;
      consecutive days after receiving the accelerometer to measure usual physical activity. This&#xD;
      will be scheduled so no exercise tests or sessions will fall on the 7 days wearing the&#xD;
      monitor. This will be administered on participants' initial visit to Funkhouser 117 where&#xD;
      they will also sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys, taste test, height, weight: Will occur at screening, post-training/week 13, and&#xD;
      follow up/week 18. The taste test will be used to determine the foods to be used in the&#xD;
      RRVfood test. This visit will occur in Funkhouser 117.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RRVfood test: Will occur at weeks -1 or -2, 13, and 18. Subjects will report 2 to 3 hours&#xD;
      postprandial to room 117 Funkhouser and complete a task where they will earn points towards&#xD;
      their chosen foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RRVexercise test: Will occur at weeks -2 or -3, 13, and 18 at the Human Performance&#xD;
      Laboratory (MDS, B04). subjects will sample for 2 minutes each and rate their liking of the 3&#xD;
      exercise options (treadmill, elliptical ergometer, or cycle ergometer) and sedentary&#xD;
      alternatives (magazines, puzzles, card games). This testing can take place in the morning or&#xD;
      afternoon, but will occur at the same time of day for a given subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BodPod + RMR test: Will occur at weeks -1 or -2, and 13. Subjects will report at least 10&#xD;
      hours postprandial and be assessed for their body composition (BodPod) and resting metabolic&#xD;
      rate (RMR) at Funkhouser 117.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CCTS Meal test visit Will occur at weeks -1 or -2, and 13. Subjects will arrive to the CCTS&#xD;
      (Center for Clinical and Transnational Science) on the UK campus at least 10 hours&#xD;
      postprandial and have an IV-catheter placed and fasted blood sample collected. Subjects will&#xD;
      then be administered a standardized breakfast and have blood drawn immediately after&#xD;
      breakfast (-2.75), and every 15 minutes during the first hour (-2.5, -2.25, -2 hr) and then&#xD;
      every 30 minutes thereafter (-1.5, -1, -0.5, 0) for a total testing time of 3 hrs. Subjects&#xD;
      will also complete VAS scales for hunger and satiety at each blood draw time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CCTS Exercise test and DXA visit Will occur at weeks -1 or -2, week 6, week 13 Participants&#xD;
      will report to the CCTS to perform a graded exercise test to determine kcal expended per&#xD;
      minute at different heart rate intensities using indirect calorimetry. This information will&#xD;
      be used to set the intensity and duration of their exercise training sessions during the&#xD;
      intervention period of the study. This will be performed at baseline, on weeks 6 - 7, and&#xD;
      after training. The mid-point measure will be used to adjust the duration and intensity of&#xD;
      the exercise training sessions to account for any improvements in aerobic fitness. The&#xD;
      post-time point measure will be used to determine aerobic fitness improvements. Prior to this&#xD;
      test participants will also have a DXA scan preformed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional DEXA test: Will occur at weeks -1 or -2 and 13. Subjects will report to the Joe&#xD;
      Craft Football Training Facility to have an additional DXA performed on the UK athletics'&#xD;
      Norland model DXA, a different model than the &quot;gold standard&quot; iDXA used at the CCTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food Diary: for weeks -3, 4, 8, 12, 17 participants will record all foods they eat with&#xD;
      details on quantity and cooking methods in a dietary intake record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise session download meeting: Once per week during the exercise intervention (weeks&#xD;
      1-12) participants will return to Funkhouser 117 to have their exercise sessions for the&#xD;
      previous week downloaded to ensure compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: For the exercise treatments, participants will engage in aerobic exercise&#xD;
      (treadmill, stationary bike, elliptical) to induce a 3000 kcal/week energy expenditure&#xD;
      exercising either 6 sessions per week (500 kcal per session) or 2 sessions per week (1500&#xD;
      kcal per session). The exercise intervention will last 12 weeks, followed by one week of&#xD;
      post-testing and an unsupervised 4-week period where participants may exercise or not before&#xD;
      final follow-up assessments at week 17. Exercise will occur at a moderate to difficult&#xD;
      intensity and prescribed based on individual rates of energy expenditure (kcal/min) at&#xD;
      different heart rate zones. Most exercise will occur at 65% of HRR, an intensity commonly&#xD;
      prescribed for sedentary individuals beginning an exercise program [28]. The 6 session per&#xD;
      week group should be able to complete the session in 20 to 60 min, while the 2 session per&#xD;
      week group may take between 1.5 and 2.5 hours based on how many calories subjects burn&#xD;
      exercising at 65% HHR. Subjects can take rest breaks as necessary during the exercise&#xD;
      sessions. The first 2 to 5 exercise sessions will be supervised by research staff to&#xD;
      introduce subjects to the use of the equipment and to ensure participants will be able to&#xD;
      exercise for the prescribed time to meet their energy-expenditure goal. Then, exercise&#xD;
      sessions will be supervised on an as needed basis in order to encourage compliance. To verify&#xD;
      treatment implementation, subjects will wear a chest-strap heart rate monitor. Missed&#xD;
      sessions (unless due to injury or illness) will be compensated for during the following&#xD;
      sessions or made-up on another day. Heart rate and workout data will be reviewed by the&#xD;
      research staff every week. Subjects will be able to use a 12-week pass to the Lexington-area&#xD;
      YMCA(s) to assure access to exercise facilities if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height and Weight. Body weight will be measured with a Tanita bioelectrical impedance scale&#xD;
      after voiding. Subjects will wear scrubs or shorts and a t-shirt and no shoes when being&#xD;
      weighed. Height will be with a stadiometer and standard anthropometric technique. These&#xD;
      measurements will occur at screening to determine if subjects meets BMI inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food reinforcement task. Subjects will report 2-4 hr post-prandial to Funkhouser 117. RRVfood&#xD;
      is assessed by evaluating the number of responses (mouse button presses) a participant is&#xD;
      willing to complete to gain access to food. The foods used in the task were chosen to allow&#xD;
      subjects to choose foods that are often considered both &quot;junk&quot; foods and &quot;healthy&quot; snacks&#xD;
      with similar nutrient densities. The experimental environment will include two personal&#xD;
      computers on separate workstations. At one station is the computer on which the participant&#xD;
      can earn points towards their most liked junk food, with the other station being set up for&#xD;
      them to earn points for their most liked healthy food. The most liked foods of each category&#xD;
      are determined at screening by tasting a small portion of each food and rating each using a&#xD;
      Likert-type scale. Participants can freely go back and forth between stations. The program&#xD;
      used for the reinforcement task presents a game that mimics a slot machine. A point is earned&#xD;
      each time the 3 shapes that appear with each mouse button press match in shape and color.&#xD;
      Access to the alternatives is dependent on earning points, which can be exchanged for access&#xD;
      to the reinforcers. For every 5 points earned, the subject will receive a 70-100 kcal portion&#xD;
      of the food they were working for. Points are delivered on independent progressive&#xD;
      fixed-ratio schedules. The schedules of reinforcement for food and reading begin at a fixed&#xD;
      ratio of 4 and then doubles (8, 16, 32, […] 2048) each time 5 points are earned. For&#xD;
      instance, the participant initially has to click the mouse four times to earn each point, but&#xD;
      after the first portion is earned, then 8 clicks are required to earn each of the 5 points,&#xD;
      and so on. The reinforcer not earned does not increase to the next level until it is earned.&#xD;
      The testing session will end when participants no longer wish to earn points for access to&#xD;
      either food choice. Water will be provided ad libitum. Participants are instructed on how to&#xD;
      complete the computer task and will complete a practice session to demonstrate their&#xD;
      understanding of the task. The task is completed with the experimenter in an adjacent room.&#xD;
      Outcomes include the total number of responses (mouse-presses) performed for each type of&#xD;
      food and the Pmax [29] of each choice, which is the last schedule that a participant met the&#xD;
      response requirements for access to each food choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity reinforcement task. To assess the reinforcing value to be physically&#xD;
      active, one computer station is set-up for the subject to earn access to physical activity&#xD;
      (treadmill, elliptical ergometer, cycle ergometer) and the other computer station is set to&#xD;
      earn access to sedentary alternatives (magazines, puzzles, card games). Access to the&#xD;
      alternatives is dependent on earning points, which can be exchanged for the reinforcers using&#xD;
      the schedules of reinforcement described above. For every 5 points earned, the subject will&#xD;
      receive 5 min of access to exercise or 5 min of time to engage in the sedentary behavior,&#xD;
      depending on the reinforcer that they were working for. Prior to the test participants will&#xD;
      rate how much they like the exercise options and the sedentary alternative (APPENDIX 14) This&#xD;
      sedentary alternative is provided to reduce the likelihood that participants would engage in&#xD;
      responding for exercise out of boredom. This test will take place in the Human Performance&#xD;
      Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition. Body composition will be measured using a GE Lunar iDXA machine at the&#xD;
      CCTS. A total body scan will be conducted with participants lying supine on the table and&#xD;
      arms positioned to the side and palms flat on the table. Scans will be completed using the&#xD;
      standard mode, unless the thick scan mode is suggested by the software. All scans will be&#xD;
      analyzed using GE Lunar enCORE Software (13.60.033). Automatic edge detection will be used&#xD;
      for scan analyses. The machine will be calibrated before each scanning session, using the GE&#xD;
      Lunar calibration phantom. Outcomes will include total body lean mass, fat mass, bone mineral&#xD;
      content and bone mineral density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo total body composition testing using a total body dual-energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA) scan, and have their regional fat estimations performed using 3&#xD;
      circumference measures. Total body and regional, absolute and relative measures of soft&#xD;
      tissue (fat, fat-free and mineral-free lean) masses will be made and analyzed by DXA scanning&#xD;
      using a Lunar iDXA (GE Lunar Inc., Madison, WI; software version 13.10) using standardized&#xD;
      procedures. The Lunar iDXA is the machine that is used during standard clinical testing. The&#xD;
      waist, abdominal, and hip circumference measurements will be performed in triplicate using a&#xD;
      flexible steel anthropometric tape (Rosscraft Anthrotape; Rosscraft Innovations Inc.) using&#xD;
      standardized procedures. The body composition assessments testing will take place in the&#xD;
      University of Kentucky Clinical Services Core (CSC) Functional Assessment and Body&#xD;
      Composition Core (FAABC; inpatient suit 5th floor Chandler Medical Center) (CCTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional body composition tests will be performed on the Department of Dietetics and Human&#xD;
      Nutrition's BodPod (air-displacement plethysmography) and the UK Athletics' DXA (Norland&#xD;
      model) as a separate measure of internal reliability of these machines by comparing to the&#xD;
      iDXA. The iDXA is the &quot;gold standard&quot; and will be used as the primary measure to test the&#xD;
      current hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic Fitness. A graded exercise treadmill test will be used to test aerobic fitness in&#xD;
      addition to calculating rate of energy expenditure. Oxygen consumed and expired CO2 will be&#xD;
      analyzed by indirect calorimetry. The test begins with a 5 minute warm-up of walking at 0%&#xD;
      grade, 3.0 mph. Upon completion of the warm-up, the grade increases to 2.5% for 3 minutes&#xD;
      with the speed fixed at 3.0 mph. The treadmill grade will then increase every 3 minutes to&#xD;
      produce an approximately 10 beat/minute increase in heart rate from the previous stage. The&#xD;
      test will continue until a heart rate of 85% HRR was attained or the participant fells they&#xD;
      can no longer continue. The treadmill test will be performed at baseline, during week 6, and&#xD;
      post training. The week 6 measurements will be used to adjust the intensity and duration of&#xD;
      the exercise training sessions to account for improvements in aerobic fitness. Performance&#xD;
      work capacity (PWC) will be utilized as a measurement of sub-maximal aerobic fitness with the&#xD;
      rates of oxygen consumed at heart rates of 150 and 170 beats/minute serving as aerobic&#xD;
      fitness outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting Metabolic Rate. Subjects will arrive to Funkhouser 117 fasted one morning prior to&#xD;
      beginning the intervention (baseline) and 48 or more hours after their final exercise session&#xD;
      of the intervention (week 13) to determine their RMR via indirect calorimetry (Cosmed USA,&#xD;
      Chicago). This test lasts 45 minutes. Resting heart rate will be determined during the RMR&#xD;
      test to be used to calculate HHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormone measurement. Subjects will report fasted to the CCTS and have an IV catheter placed&#xD;
      to provide a fasted blood sample to analyze hormone and peptide concentrations associated&#xD;
      with hunger and body weight regulation and complete VAS to determine hunger and satiety&#xD;
      immediately prior to a standardized breakfast. The standardized breakfast will provide 20% of&#xD;
      estimated energy needs for each individual based on their RMR and a sedentary activity factor&#xD;
      of 1.4. Breakfast will consist of 2% milk and cornflakes (with the option of substituting&#xD;
      unsweetened soy milk for those with a lactose sensitivity). Breakfasts will be consumed&#xD;
      within 15 minutes. VAS scales for hunger and satiety and blood draws for hunger hormone&#xD;
      measurement will be completed immediately before breakfast (-3hr) immediately after (-2.75),&#xD;
      and every 15 minutes during the first hour (-2.5, -2.25, -2 hr) and then every 30 minutes&#xD;
      thereafter (-1.5, -1, -0.5, 0) [30, 31]. Blood samples will be collected in EDTA-coated and&#xD;
      serum tubes. Serum GLP-1, leptin, glucagon, and active grehlin will be measured using ELISA&#xD;
      (Millipore, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Alpco). Serum insulin will be measured with a&#xD;
      chemiluminescent immunometric assay (Siemens). Samples will be batch-analyzed to reduce&#xD;
      interassay variability and stored at the CCTS until the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Habitual physical activity. For a 7 day period starting the day after subject's screening, 7&#xD;
      days following post-testing outcome assessments, and for 7 days during week 17, an ActiGraph&#xD;
      accelerometer (GT3XPB model; Pensacola, Florida) will be worn to provide information&#xD;
      regarding changes in habitual, free-living physical activity. Subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
      wear it at the hip using the provided belt during all hours awake except when bathing or&#xD;
      swimming. Data will be cleaned of non-wear time, defined as consecutive strings of zeros&#xD;
      greater than 20 minutes. An epoch of 10 seconds will used for data collection. This will be&#xD;
      used to measure weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as well as&#xD;
      minutes of sedentary activity and light intensity activity using the Crouter et.al algorithm&#xD;
      [32], and Freedson cut-points [33].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Adherence. Subjects will be instructed to follow specific exercise plans that will&#xD;
      elicit a 3,000 kcal energy expenditure per week. The length of the exercise session will&#xD;
      depend on each individual's rate of energy expenditure. Each subject will be given a Polar&#xD;
      heart rate monitor device to wear for each training session and meet with a research staff&#xD;
      member weekly to download the previous week's exercise sessions to monitor compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerance for the discomfort of exercise. Discomfort tolerance will be measured by&#xD;
      questionnaires. Subjects will complete the validated Preference for and Tolerance of the&#xD;
      Intensity of Exercise Questionnaire (PRETIE-Q) at baseline and after training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy and macronutrient intake. During weeks -3, 4, 8, 12, 17, participants will record&#xD;
      their dietary intake for seven consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculations. The accumulated energy balance (AEB) will be calculated from changes in FM and&#xD;
      FFM as body composition changes reflect long-term alterations in energy balance (Rosenkilde&#xD;
      et al. 13). Gains of 1kg FM or 1kg FFM will reflect 12,000 and 1,780 kcal, respectively (Elia&#xD;
      et al., 2003). Losses of 1kg FM or 1kg FFM will be assumed to equal 9,417 and 884 kcal,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise energy expenditure (ExEE) is calculated from the training-induced energy expenditure&#xD;
      (TrEE) of 300 or 600 kcal/session with the addition of 15% excess post-exercise energy&#xD;
      expenditure (Bahr, et al., 1997). The resting energy expenditure (REE) that would have&#xD;
      occurred during the exercise sessions (REE x 1.2) will be subtracted. Thus, ExEE = (TrEE x&#xD;
      0.15) + (TrEE - training duration x REE 1.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of compensation in response to the increase in ExEE is assessed through a&#xD;
      compensation index calculated as (ExEE - AEB)/ExEE x 100%. When the compensation index equals&#xD;
      zero AEB equals ExEE, or changes in body composition equal calories expended during exercise.&#xD;
      Positive compensation suggests changes in body composition indicating a less negative energy&#xD;
      balance than expected, whereas a larger than expected negative energy balance is referred to&#xD;
      as negative compensation. Degree of compensation = (ExEE - AEB)/ExEE x 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan: Baseline demographic and physical characteristics will be reported&#xD;
      as means and standard errors. Baseline group (6 days/week, 2 days per week exercise,&#xD;
      sedentary control) differences will be tested with one-way ANOVA. Alterations in accumulated&#xD;
      negative energy balance, body composition, RRVfood, RRVexercise, dietary intake, energy&#xD;
      expenditure, exercise discomfort, hunger/satiety hormones, and fitness will be tested with&#xD;
      two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with group treated as a&#xD;
      between-subjects variable and time treated as a within subjects variable. Power Analysis: The&#xD;
      primary outcome is accumulated negative energy balance. Based on previous research the mean&#xD;
      accumulated negative energy balances for 300 kcal of exercise and 600 kcal of exercise&#xD;
      conditions were -83% + 100% (mean + SD) and 20% + 50%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Resources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will utilize CCTS staff and facilities for measurement of hunger/satiety&#xD;
      hormone concentrations, body composition (DEXA), and aerobic fitness tests. Laboratory space&#xD;
      at Funkhouser includes a Quark RMR measurement equipment (Cosmed), NDS-R software for&#xD;
      nutrition analysis, BodPod for air displacement plethysmography, and computers and space&#xD;
      necessary for the food reinforcement task. The reinforcing value of exercise measurement will&#xD;
      take place in the Human Performance Laboratory, where treadmills and cycle ergometers are&#xD;
      available for participant use. The Department of Dietetics and Human Nutrition recently&#xD;
      purchased new Polar A-300 heart rate monitors and ActiGraph accelerometers for the proposed&#xD;
      study. Dr. Flack (PI) has led similar studies and may be training up to three graduate&#xD;
      students that will assist in conducting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Potential Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DXA Scan. All subjects will be informed of the small amount of radiation they will receive&#xD;
      while going through this procedure. Female subjects of childbearing potential will receive a&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test prior to undergoing the DXA Scan. Those women found to be pregnant will&#xD;
      not undergo the scan and will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Draw/ placement of IV catheter: Upon placement of the IV catheter, there may be some&#xD;
      slight discomfort experienced from the insertion of the needle into the vein. Potential&#xD;
      infection, soreness, pain, bleeding, bruising, and fainting may occur. This pain and soreness&#xD;
      may last up to 24 hrs following the procedure. A trained nurse will place the IV catheter and&#xD;
      standard precautions will be taken to guard against the following potential risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Safety Precautions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provisions to guard against the potential risks and discomforts discussed in section 9 are as&#xD;
      follows: Every precaution to prevent a direct study injury will be taken by medical personnel&#xD;
      and the investigators. Should an adverse or serious adverse event occur, the research&#xD;
      participant will be followed by physicians, registered nurses and other research staff&#xD;
      members for the duration of the participant's hospitalization. Routine care will be provided&#xD;
      by the hospital staff. Emergency medical equipment, medications and supplies will be at the&#xD;
      physician's disposal should the participants have an acute untoward reaction.&#xD;
