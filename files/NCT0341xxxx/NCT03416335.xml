  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, Phase 1 / 2 clinical study for patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
      The study consists of 2 treatment arms - a monotherapy arm and a combination arm. The&#xD;
      monotherapy arm has 1 part: Dose Escalation (Part A) The combination arm has Dose Escalation&#xD;
      (Part B) only.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Part A in the monotherapy arm is to determine the RP2D of DSP-0509&#xD;
      when administered as a single agent. Approximately 21 to 30 patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors will be enrolled. At the time of this amendment, 12 patients have been enrolled in the&#xD;
      monotherapy cohorts with dose levels of 0.3, 1, and 1.5 mg DSP-0509 given once per week and&#xD;
      completed the DLT period. Based on review of DLTs and consistent with the BLRM model, the&#xD;
      Safety Review Committee has assessed that continuing at the 1.5 mg dose level is appropriate.&#xD;
      Under Protocol Amendment 4, the dose level of 1.5 mg given every two weeks will be applied in&#xD;
      Monotherapy Part A. Enrollment of additional cohorts will be based on the dose escalation&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Combination Part B is to determine the RP2D of DSP-0509 when&#xD;
      administered in combination with pembrolizumab, using a BLRM approach as described above. The&#xD;
      combination arm will enroll approximately 21 to 30 patients with advanced solid tumors that&#xD;
      are (a) metastatic or unresectable and recurrent, and/or refractory to available therapy, (b)&#xD;
      a condition for which pembrolizumab is an approved treatment, and (c) the patients have shown&#xD;
      either primary or acquired resistance to an ICI. Under protocol amendment 4, DSP-0509 will be&#xD;
      administered on Day 1 and then every 2 weeks thereafter. Pembrolizumab will be initiated on&#xD;
      Day 8 and administered using the dose and schedule described (200 mg IV every 3 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maximize patient safety, enrollment in the first combination escalation cohort will begin&#xD;
      at dose level of 0.3 mg DSP-0509 after safety and tolerability of DSP-0509 monotherapy has&#xD;
      been confirmed at least 1 dose level higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Combination Therapy Arm C is to determine preliminary efficacy in&#xD;
      the form of the ORR of DSP-0509 when administered in combination with pembrolizumab to an&#xD;
      expansion cohort of patients with HNSCC, using a Bayesian Adaptive design approach.&#xD;
      Combination Arm C will enroll approximately 20 to 40 patients with HNSCC tumors that are (a)&#xD;
      metastatic or unresectable, and recurrent and/or refractory to available therapy, (b) in&#xD;
      patients who have been treated with pembrolizumab or other PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in&#xD;
      monotherapy, and (c) who have subsequently shown either primary or acquired resistance to&#xD;
      ICIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation of DSP-0509 in combination with 400 mg pembrolizumab q6w will start at the&#xD;
      same dose of DSP-0509 as the highest (not exceeding the MTD) level tested in the combination&#xD;
      regimen with 200 mg pembrolizumab q3w. Upon completion of the DLT evaluation period for the&#xD;
      first DSP-0509 dose level tested in combination with 400 mg pembrolizumab q6w in newly&#xD;
      enrolled patients, if this dose level is found not to exceed the MTD, any ongoing patients&#xD;
      receiving DSP-0509 in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg q3w will be allowed, at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion, to transition to the 400 mg pembrolizumab q6w regimen, while&#xD;
      maintaining the originally assigned DSP-0509 dose level.&#xD;
