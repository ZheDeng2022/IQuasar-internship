  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      (1) Evaluate the efficacy of apatinib in combination with standard second-line chemotherapy&#xD;
      for advanced colorectal cancer. Whether it can prolong Progression Free Survival (PFS),&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and reduce symptoms and&#xD;
      improve quality of life compared with standard second-line chemotherapy; (2) Observe the&#xD;
      safety of apatinib for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard second line chemotherapy includes chemotherapy based on irinotecan or chemotherapy&#xD;
      based on oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that highly selectively binds to&#xD;
      and strongly inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), with a&#xD;
      decrease in VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tumor microvascular&#xD;
      density. A phase II trail of Apatinib has been demonstrated that Apatinib is safe to treat&#xD;
      the metastatic colorectal cancer and the disease control rate can reach 50%.&#xD;
