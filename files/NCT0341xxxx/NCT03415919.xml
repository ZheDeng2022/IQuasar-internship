      To collect human tissue, blood, and fecal samples from patients suffering from Inflammatory&#xD;
      Bowel Disease and Colorectal Cancer. The samples will be used to establish biomimetic human&#xD;
      organ-on-a-chip technology, as well as study the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      in human gastrointestinal diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed research is to collect tissue, blood and fecal samples from&#xD;
      patients undergoing standard of care for their gastrointestinal disease, including&#xD;
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), and Colorectal Cancer (CRC). Tissue and blood samples will&#xD;
      be obtained during procedures that are part of normal treatment, including blood and fecal&#xD;
      collection, surgical resection, and biopsy collection. Samples will be obtained from&#xD;
      consenting patients at Seton Dell Medical Center at the University of Texas (SDMCUT), or&#xD;
      other relevant facilities (see section 6.i below), and only tissue not required for&#xD;
      histopathological analysis will be collected. Initially, the focus will be on IBD, and CRC,&#xD;
      where there are extensive previous studies to draw from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected samples of the proposed study will be used to establish biomimetic human&#xD;
      organ-on-a-chip platforms by leveraging microfluidic tissue culture technology. Another focus&#xD;
      of the research will be study the human intestinal microbiome that is highly associated with&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of human gastrointestinal diseases. The investigators have developed the&#xD;
      microchip technology to mimic the structure and physiological function of human intestine by&#xD;
      integrating tools developed in a microfluidic device, tissue engineering, and clinical&#xD;
      microbiology, using intestinal cell lines. To recreate more reliable intestinal disease&#xD;
      models and to further investigate the host-gut microbiome interactions in these experimental&#xD;
      platforms, the investigators are transitioning to use human clinical samples. The&#xD;
      investigators will use tissue biopsies to culture human intestinal cells including&#xD;
      epithelium, endothelium, connective tissues on-chip. Blood samples will also obtained to&#xD;
      isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that represent mixed population of white&#xD;
      blood cells (WBC). Isolated WBCs will be co-cultured with intestinal cells. Any potential&#xD;
      application of microbiome-related therapies such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)&#xD;
      will also be further investigated.&#xD;

        No special populations are targeted for accrual to this study. However, racial background&#xD;
        may play a role in disease etiology, and a variety of races is optimal for this study to&#xD;
        address that question. Thus, the patient's race information will be included with the&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biopsy-proven colorectal cancer scheduled to have surgical resection of primary site,&#xD;
             at participating and approved facilities. Since it is standard clinical care to resect&#xD;
             certain suspicious gastrointestinal masses without a pre-existing biopsy, patients who&#xD;
             are undergoing resections for highly suspicious masses believed to be cancer, may be&#xD;
             consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) or Crohn's Disease (CD), scheduled to&#xD;
             have biopsy and/or fecal collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  scheduled to have a colonoscopy as part of routine screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study will not exclude potential subjects from participation on the basis of&#xD;
             ethnic origin or gender. Subjects recruited will include men, women, and all ethnic&#xD;
             origins, provided they meet all inclusion criteria listed above.&#xD;
