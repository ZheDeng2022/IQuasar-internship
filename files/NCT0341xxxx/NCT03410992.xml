    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>A PRO measured the PSD (further published as P-SIM) and was used to assess key symptoms relevant to patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

    <description>Only subjects with scalp involvement at Baseline will complete the scalp IGA. Subjects with scalp involvement at Baseline are defined as those with a scalp IGA score &gt;0 at Baseline.
