  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, single arm, phase II trial of the oral BRAF inhibitor,&#xD;
      vemurafenib, plus obinutuzumab in patients with previously untreated HCL. A Simon mini-max&#xD;
      two-stage design will be employed to assess the efficacy of the combination treatment of&#xD;
      vemurafenib and obinutuzumab. In the first stage of the protocol, 9 patients will be treated.&#xD;
      If fewer than 6 CRs are seen among the first 9 patients, the study will be closed for lack of&#xD;
      efficacy. If at least 7 patients respond to the treatment, then an additional 19 patients&#xD;
      will be accrued to the second stage, for a total of 28 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive vemurafenib at a dose of 960mg orally twice daily (b.i.d.)&#xD;
      continuously in cycles of 4 weeks (28 days) for a total of 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obinutuzumab will be administered concomitantly with vemurafenib starting at cycle 2 of&#xD;
      treatment in cycles of 4 weeks. Obinutuzumab infusions will be administered at 1000mg per day&#xD;
      on days 1, 8 and 15 during the cycle 2 and 1000mg per day every 4 weeks during the cycle 3&#xD;
      and 4 of treatment. After the completion of the treatment (i.e. after 4 cycles), a bone&#xD;
      marrow aspirate and biopsy will be performed for assessment of response and evaluation of&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD). In case of certain defined toxicities, dose reductions of&#xD;
      vemurafenib by 50% (480mg b.i.d.) or interruptions of up to 15 days are permitted. If&#xD;
      additional dose reduction is required, vemurafenib may be reduced to 240mg oral b.i.d.&#xD;
