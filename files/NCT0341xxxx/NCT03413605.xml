  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third highest&#xD;
      cause of mortality in Vietnamese and Asian Americans. CRC incidence is rising rapidly in&#xD;
      Vietnamese Americans, but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are&#xD;
      more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Over&#xD;
      85% of Vietnamese Americans in our region (PA, NJ and NYC) are foreign-born with limited&#xD;
      English proficiency, have low SES, and live in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Many&#xD;
      lack knowledge about CRC risks and screening benefits and have limited access to culturally&#xD;
      appropriate preventive care. Center for Asian Health, Temple University will be working with&#xD;
      Vietnamese CBOs to address their critical health disparities. The investigators will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the proposed multilevel CRC intervention will yield higher CRC screening&#xD;
      rates compared to the control at 12-month follow-up. This project represents the first&#xD;
      large-scale community-based randomized controlled trial of a multilevel,&#xD;
      culturally-appropriate intervention to increase CRC screening among underserved Vietnamese.&#xD;
      If effective, this innovative CRC intervention can be used as a model program that has&#xD;
      potential impact, generalizability and sustainability in Asian American and other underserved&#xD;
      ethnic communities.&#xD;

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third highest&#xD;
      cause of mortality in Vietnamese and Asian Americans. CRC incidence is rising rapidly in&#xD;
      Vietnamese Americans, but they have among the lowest rates of CRC screening (14%) and are&#xD;
      more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which is highly preventable. Over&#xD;
      85% of Vietnamese Americans in our region (PA, NJ, and NYC) are foreign-born with limited&#xD;
      English proficiency, have low SES, and live in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Many&#xD;
      lack knowledge about CRC risks and screening benefits and have limited access to culturally&#xD;
      appropriate preventive care. Thus, a multilevel intervention is needed to address the&#xD;
      multiple barriers to and determinants of CRC screening in this community. Vietnamese&#xD;
      community organizations (VCOs) serve dynamic social functions and represent an important&#xD;
      resource for addressing this critical health disparity priority by promoting CRC screening.&#xD;
      This project builds on established partnerships and successful work of Center for Asian&#xD;
      Health, Temple University with Vietnamese CBOs that address their overwhelming health&#xD;
      disparities. CBPR principles will be applied to engage 20 VCOs in all phases of planning,&#xD;
      implementing, evaluating, and disseminating a culturally appropriate, theory- and&#xD;
      evidence-based multilevel CRC intervention. The proposed intervention will be guided by&#xD;
      Social Ecological Model, which addresses sociocultural, behavioral and environmental&#xD;
      determinants and intervention strategies at the individual, interpersonal, and community&#xD;
      organizational levels. CDC's Clinical Preventive Services Guidelines for adults 50+ (CPS)&#xD;
      recommend that cancer screenings and other preventive services should be promoted. The&#xD;
      standard CPS will be provided to both intervention and control groups, and intervention group&#xD;
      will receive CPS + multilevel CRC intervention. Specific Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      CPS + multilevel CRC intervention will yield higher CRC screening rates compared to CPS&#xD;
      control at 12-month follow up; Aim 2 is to examine whether CPS + multilevel CRC intervention&#xD;
      (which includes CHW-led group education, automated and interactive text messaging and&#xD;
      phone-based peer support) is more effective in changing screening determinants (e.g. KAB,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, risk factors, lifestyles, social support, social norms, access barriers) than&#xD;
      CPS control condition; and Aim 3 is to assess costs and cost-effectiveness of CPS +&#xD;
      multilevel CRC intervention compared to CPS control condition in relation to CRC screening&#xD;
      rates in order to inform future dissemination efforts. In sum, this project represents the&#xD;
      first large-scale community-based randomized controlled trial of a multilevel,&#xD;
      culturally-appropriate CBPR intervention to increase CRC screening among underserved&#xD;
      Vietnamese. If effective, this innovative multilevel CRC intervention can be used as a model&#xD;
      program that has potential generalizability and sustainability in Asian American and other&#xD;
      underserved ethnic communities to impact preventive behaviors at the population level.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will be delivered in group-based education workshop format. The education session is a curriculum-based group education; each group will be having about 15-20 participants. We will allow 5-7 minutes for participants to get to know each other and to get comfortable talking to the group. Education will have two major topics.(a) CDC's standard Clinical Preventive Services Guidelines for adults 50+ (CPS). (b) culturally tailored CRC information discussion. This session is to increase knowledge, change cultural beliefs and attitudes on risks of CRC and benefits of screening by using interactive discussion approaches, visual aids, motivation video and print materials.</description>
