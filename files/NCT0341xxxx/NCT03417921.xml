      A Randomized Phase I/II Open Label Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of ABTL0812 in&#xD;

      Pancreatic Cancer at First Line Therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized phase I/II multicenter study to evaluate ABTL0812 in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel at first line therapy. Patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to the following groups during the study conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GROUP A: You will receive the standard treatment of chemotherapy and the investigational&#xD;
           drug ABTL0812.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GROUP B: You will receive the standard treatment of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For GROUP A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: A 3+3 de-escalation design followed by an expansion phase will be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABTL0812 will be administered chronically daily. Potential dose levels are 1300 mg tid,&#xD;
           1000 mg tid, 650 mg tid and 500 mg tid. Intrapatient escalation or de-escalation is not&#xD;
           permitted. A run-in period of one week for ABTL0812 is planned before starting the first&#xD;
           cycle of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy will be administered on 28-day cycles: gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 +&#xD;
           nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If any, or all, the components of the chemotherapeutic regimen must be interrupted for&#xD;
           any reason (excluding disease progression), ABTL0812 will be administered as maintenance&#xD;
           therapy until disease progression, onset of unacceptable drug toxicities, or&#xD;
           patient/physician's request to discontinue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABTL0812 will be administered chronically daily at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).&#xD;
           A run-in period of one week for ABTL0812 is planned before starting the first cycle of&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy will be administered on 28-day cycles: gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV +&#xD;
           nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8 and 15&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If any, or all, the components of the chemotherapeutic regimen must be interrupted for&#xD;
           any reason (excluding disease progression), ABTL0812 will be administered as maintenance&#xD;
           therapy until disease progression, onset of unacceptable drug toxicities, or&#xD;
           patient/physician's request to discontinue.&#xD;
