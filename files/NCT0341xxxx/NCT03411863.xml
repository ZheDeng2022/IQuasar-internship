  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans are at higher risk than non-Veterans of falling ill with amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
      sclerosis (ALS). ALS causes degeneration of motor neurons in both the brain and the spinal&#xD;
      cord. Evidence from studies in people with spinal cord injury suggests that activating spared&#xD;
      nerve circuits with electromagnetic stimulation improves nerve transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this goal, the investigators have developed a novel method of noninvasive cervical&#xD;
      (neck) electrical stimulation (CES). In this study, the investigators will investigate CES&#xD;
      for its potential to strengthen nerve circuits to the hands in ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge, electrical spinal stimulation for ALS has never been tested&#xD;
      previously. This study will be performed in two stages: First, basic experiments will be&#xD;
      performed to better understand how CES interacts with other types of electrical and magnetic&#xD;
      stimulations over the brain and peripheral nerves. Second, experiments will be performed to&#xD;
      determine the types of CES that can facilitate active arm and hand movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These experiments will improve understanding of electrical stimulation in ALS, and may set&#xD;
      the table for future treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both United States Veterans and non-Veterans are eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) reduces connections between the cortical motor neurons&#xD;
      that initiate movement and the spinal motor neurons that direct muscles to execute movement.&#xD;
      This situation shares many key features with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
      Accumulating evidence in SCI suggests that externally activating spared nerve circuits with&#xD;
      electromagnetic stimulation augments neural transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this goal, the investigators developed a novel method of noninvasive cervical electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (CES). CES activates multiple muscles on both upper limbs by triggering afferent&#xD;
      sensory or efferent motor nerve roots depending on stimulus intensity. This study will&#xD;
      investigate CES for its potential to strengthen residual circuits to the hands in ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge, electrical spinal stimulation for ALS has never been tested&#xD;
      or applied previously. Therefore, a pilot study is essential. This study will be performed in&#xD;
      two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Map CES circuit and synaptic targets: The experiments share a common structure&#xD;
           comprising conditioning and test stimuli delivered at a range of intensities, sites, and&#xD;
           interstimulus intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine parameters for combining CES with volitional movement: volitional limb&#xD;
           movements depend on the same corticospinal and motor neuron circuits as those activated&#xD;
           by TMS and F-waves. Since preliminary data shows that subthreshold CES facilitates TMS&#xD;
           responses, CES may also be able to facilitate volitional limb movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful completion of these experiments will: mechanistically elucidate CES circuit&#xD;
      interactions; investigate the potential for CES to enhance concurrent volitional muscle&#xD;
      activation; and establish CES as safe and feasible in the ALS population. Given the limited&#xD;
      treatment options for ALS, any amount of progress would represent a meaningful step forward.&#xD;
      Moreover, results of this pilot study could lead to direct translation for lasting clinical&#xD;
      benefit by combining repetitive subthreshold CES with repetitive task-oriented physical&#xD;
      exercise training in subsequent studies. CES would be compatible with other interventions,&#xD;
      including medications and cell-based treatments.&#xD;
