  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify in patients requiring active fluid resuscitation and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation for circulatory shock, can a controlled increase in intrathoracic&#xD;
      pressure (either by positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or tidal volume (TV)) predict&#xD;
      responsiveness to additional fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a temporary, physiologically-safe increase in positive-end expiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PEEP) and/or a temporary increase in tidal volume (from 6 cc/kg predicted body&#xD;
      weight (PBW) to 8 cc/kg PBW) in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation will&#xD;
      predict fluid responsiveness based upon an assessment of the change in pulse pressure and&#xD;
      stroke volume variation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once an eligible subject is identified and written or telephone consent is obtained from the&#xD;
      patient or surrogate as appropriate, we will record demographic data and clinical information&#xD;
      including age, sex, height, actual body weight, predicted body weight (PBW), APACHE II on&#xD;
      admission, primary diagnosis, reason for ICU admission, and dose of vasopressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be intubated and on assist-control volume ventilation receiving low tidal&#xD;
      volumes. Sedation will be titrated per current MICU protocol to minimize patient discomfort&#xD;
      and minimizing ventilator dyssynchrony. In keeping with standard practice, the dose of&#xD;
      vasoactive medications will be kept constant during the intervention period. The standard&#xD;
      practice is to titrate vasopressor therapy every five minutes, so keeping vasoactive&#xD;
      medications constant for sixty seconds is in keeping with the standard of care. All subjects&#xD;
      will be in an ICU setting and monitored per standard of care (vital signs, telemetry,&#xD;
      ventilator data) by a respiratory therapist, pulmonary and critical care fellow or faculty&#xD;
      member, and critical care nurse at the bedside throughout the entire intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A point of care (POC) echocardiogram will be performed by the investigator performing the&#xD;
      intervention in order to measure the stroke volume index (surrogate for cardiac output).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to either undergo the PEEP challenge or tidal volume challenge&#xD;
      first. After the initial challenge, subjects will cross over to whichever challenge has not&#xD;
      yet been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simple changes to the ventilator we are proposing to use as challenges in this study are&#xD;
      done frequently and routinely in the ICU with or without the supervision of a physician, but&#xD;
      we will have a physician present throughout the entire proposed intervention. For the&#xD;
      subjects undergoing PEEP challenge first, we will do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. POC echocardiogram performed to measure SVI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The tidal volume will be set to 6 mL/kg PBW and the patients will be monitored for 5&#xD;
           minutes for any variability in vital parameters. The subject's ventilatory parameters,&#xD;
           vitals, hemodynamics, and oxygenation will be recorded on initial ventilator settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PEEP challenge - PEEP will be increased by 50% for 60 seconds. The subject's ventilatory&#xD;
           parameters, vitals, hemodynamics, and oxygenation will be recorded after 60 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PEEP returned to initial settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 2 minute washout period to prepare for tidal volume challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Tidal volume challenge - tidal volume raised to 8 cc/kg PBW for 60 seconds. The&#xD;
           subject's ventilatory parameters, vitals, hemodynamics, and oxygenation will be recorded&#xD;
           will be recorded after 60 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Subjects ventilator settings returned to initial settings x 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. 500 cc crystalloid fluid bolus of the ICU team's choosing is then administered to the&#xD;
           patient. The subject's ventilatory parameters, vitals, hemodynamics, and oxygenation&#xD;
           will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. POC echocardiogram performed to measure SVI and determine if the subject is a fluid&#xD;
           responder or non-responder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure for those randomized into the tidal volume challenge first will be similar, but&#xD;
      the tidal volume challenge (e, above), rather than the PEEP challenge (b, above), will be&#xD;
      performed first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the management of a critically ill patient in circulatory shock, physicians encounter the&#xD;
      question of whether to administer fluid to the patient or not several times during the course&#xD;
      of the patient's stay in the ICU. To ensure that our study is generalizable and applicable,&#xD;
      we will perform the above protocol up to three times per subject. This is similar to previous&#xD;
      studies using changes in intrathoracic pressure to predict fluid responsiveness.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will have a larger number of interventions in order to better show a clear&#xD;
      difference statistically.&#xD;
