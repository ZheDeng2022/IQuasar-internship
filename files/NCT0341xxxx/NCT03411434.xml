  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention and / or&#xD;
      hyperactivity-impulsivity that affects nearly 6% of school-aged children and persists into&#xD;
      adulthood. More and more studies are interested in biomarkers of this pathology. The&#xD;
      oculomotricity, which allows to highlight deficits motor and attention present in ADHD, is&#xD;
      used routinely in the expert centers. In general, the pharmacological treatment of ADHD is&#xD;
      associated with a clinical response in approximately 70% of cases. Today, there is no review&#xD;
      to predict the individual response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses The investigators hypothesize that a precise analysis of the oculomotor markers&#xD;
      will allow to measure the improvement of the symptomatology of the ADHD disorder following&#xD;
      the introduction of the psycho-stimulatory treatment. In other words, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that these markers could be a useful aid in patient follow-up by the clinician&#xD;
      and allow early identification of responder and non-responder patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective The main objective of this study is to measure the added value of&#xD;
      oculomotor examination in the follow-up of psycho-stimulant-treated ADHD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Evaluation Criteria The primary endpoint is oculomotor performance. Parameters analyzed&#xD;
      for each saccade are latency, amplitude, duration, average speed, direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Criteria Evaluation (s) Correlations will be established between oculomotor data&#xD;
      and scores obtained at the clinical scales assessing ADHD symptoms of inattention and&#xD;
      hyperactivity as well as cognitive performance. The data obtained before the introduction of&#xD;
      the psycho-stimulant treatment (V0, baseline) will be compared with those obtained after&#xD;
      acute administration of methylphenidate (10 mg orally,V1) and during the follow-up visit at 6&#xD;
      months (V2).&#xD;

      Type of study and experimental plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an interventional study designed to evaluate routine care. Number of Necessary&#xD;
      Subjects Participants will be stratified by age to control the effect of age. The age groups&#xD;
      to be analyzed are: 7-9 vs 10-12 vs. 13-18 versus 19-29 vs 30-40 and 41-50, each with at&#xD;
      least 15 participants. total of 90 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Study population The patients included in this study are followed in the general&#xD;
      psychiatric department of the Rouffach hospital center for attention deficit disorder with or&#xD;
      without hyperactivity (ADHD). The study focuses on ADHD patients aged 7 to 50 years,&#xD;
      undergoing an oculomotor and cognitive examination before the initiation of psychostimulant&#xD;
      therapy with methylphenidate (MPH) (baseline, V0); two weeks later (V1) following a single&#xD;
      low dose administration of MPH (10 mg orally given at 8 AM) ; and at 6-month follow-up (V2)&#xD;
      when patients are medicated with adequate dose of MPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Clinical assessments All subjects are evaluated directly by psychiatrists and&#xD;
      neuropsychologists who are experts in the field of ADHD and are experienced in the use of&#xD;
      standardized or semi-standardized clinical instruments. Clinical investigation allows&#xD;
      extensive and standardized evaluation of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Categorical standardized assessment of ADHD symptoms Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&#xD;
           (DSM-IV-TR) ADHD Criteria: Subtype: Combined, Inattentive, Hyperactive-Impulsive.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • In children-adolescents: CONNERS Evaluation Scale for Teachers and Parents:&#xD;
           Hetero-Questionnaire for Assessing Behavioral Disorders in ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ADHD Questionnaire: self-assessment questionnaire for children and adolescents with&#xD;
           attention difficulties, agitation and behavioral problems allowing the quantification of&#xD;
           ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ADHD Questionnaire: Hetero-evaluation questionnaire for children and adolescents with&#xD;
           attention difficulties, agitation and behavioral problems allowing the quantification of&#xD;
           ADHD symptoms. This questionnaire is completed by one of the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • In adults: Adult Self Reporting Scale (ASRS 1.1): self-assessment grid to assess&#xD;
           current adult ADHD disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA 2.0): semi-structured interview&#xD;
           corresponding to the DSM-IV criteria, according to which the diagnosis of ADHD in adults&#xD;
           requires the demonstration of symptoms of ADHD both in childhood and at age adult. This&#xD;
           scale is composed of 3 parts that apply each to childhood and adulthood: inattention&#xD;
           criteria, hyperactivity-impulsivity criteria, age of onset and impaired functioning due&#xD;
           to symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS-25): a self-report scale that allows retrospective&#xD;
           assessment of the presence of ADHD registry disorders in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
           World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0): Self-Assessment&#xD;
           Scale, to measure pathology-induced disability in daily living during the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standardized neurocognitive assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intellectual level The intellectual level of the patients is assessed using the&#xD;
                Wechsler scales: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WIPPSI) and&#xD;
                Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) according to the age of the&#xD;
                subject. The variety of tests proposed by the Wechsler Ladders allows to appreciate&#xD;
                the level of cognitive development of the child and adolescents. Adults benefit&#xD;
                from Adaptation French National Adult Reading Scale (fNART) which aims to estimate&#xD;
                the intellectual pre-morbid level. It consists of a series of 40 words of the&#xD;
                French language. The patient is asked to read each word aloud whether or not they&#xD;
                know the word. It is therefore necessary to deduce the pronunciation of the word in&#xD;
                question.&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Standardized evaluation of oculomotor behavior Visually guided horizontal and vertical&#xD;
           saccade tests: A fixation point is shown in the center of the screen, after a time&#xD;
           interval of 200 ms, the center point disappears and a new point appears on the right or&#xD;
           left at 20 ° from the initial position. The eyes must move on the new target. Thirty&#xD;
           horizontal and 30 vertical saccades are presented Voluntary horizontal saccadic tests:&#xD;
           The parameters are identical to those exposed in visually guided saccadic tests except&#xD;
           that the central point does not disappear when the second point appears on the right or&#xD;
           on the left (top or bottom) at 20 ° from the central point. Thirty horizontal saccades&#xD;
           are presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anti-saccadic tests: A fixation point is presented in the center of the screen, after an&#xD;
           interval of 200ms, the central point disappears and a new point appears on the right or&#xD;
           on the left (top or bottom) at 20 ° from the initial position. The eyes must be pointing&#xD;
           away from the point. Thirty horizontal saccades are presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All oculomotor tests last 1 minute. Horizontal and vertical chase tests: A target moves&#xD;
           on the screen for about 50 seconds, the eyes must follow the target. The speed of the&#xD;
           target varies from 5 ° Reading and Visual Search Tests: A text of 4 lines is presented&#xD;
           on the computer screen. The participants must read it in a low voice, the movements of&#xD;
           the eyes are recorded while they perform the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the visual search test, the same text is presented but all vowels are replaced by&#xD;
           consonants. Participants must count in low voices the number of 'r' present in the text.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Other parameters collected Sociodemographic data, personal and family psychiatric and&#xD;
           somatic antecedents as well as previous and current treatments are collected.&#xD;
