      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of melphalan hydrochloride in&#xD;
      treating participants with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma who are undergoing a donor stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation. Giving chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplantation helps stop&#xD;
      the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and&#xD;
      cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the participant, they&#xD;
      may help the participant's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells,&#xD;
      and platelets. Giving melphalan hydrochloride before a donor stem cell transplantation may&#xD;
      work better than standard chemotherapy in helping to prevent multiple myeloma from coming&#xD;
      back.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the optimal dose and schedule of melphalan for injection (melphalan&#xD;
      hydrochloride [Evomela]) prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (auto-HCT) for multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To collect the pharmacokinetic data and compare the exposure-response evaluations between&#xD;
      the 2 infusion schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the incidence of treatment related mortality (TRM) at day 90 after auto-HCT&#xD;
      in newly diagnosed myeloma patients treated on different schedules and doses of Evomela.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response (CR)&#xD;
      rate at day 90 after auto-HCT in newly diagnosed myeloma patients treated on different&#xD;
      schedules and doses of Evomela.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) after auto-HCT in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      myeloma patients treated on different schedules and doses of Evomela.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of melphalan hydrochloride followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1: Participants receive melphalan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes&#xD;
      on day -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2: Participants receive melphalan hydrochloride IV over 8-9 hours on day -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSPLANT: Participants in both groups undergo donor stem cell transplantation IV on day 0&#xD;
      over 30-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-TRANSPLANT: Participants in both groups receive filgrastim-sndz subcutaneously (SC) once&#xD;
      daily (QD) starting on day 5 and continuing in the absence of disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or until evidence of an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.5 x&#xD;
      10^9/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 3 months, every 3 months&#xD;
      for 1 year, and then annually for 1 year.&#xD;
