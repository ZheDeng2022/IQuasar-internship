  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ichthyosis is a group of genetic skin disorders that present with dry, thickened, scaly, or&#xD;
      flaky skin. As of today, there is no cure or treatment. Doctors can only treat the dry skin&#xD;
      with different types of emollients to soften the scale. A deeper understanding of this&#xD;
      disease is required to develop better treatments. There are different types of cells and&#xD;
      cell-produced signals (biomarkers) that are being studied in order to help find these new&#xD;
      treatments. Looking at biomarkers has been successful in helping us to understand other skin&#xD;
      disorders better. The purpose of this study is to determine which blood and skin biomarkers&#xD;
      characterize ichthyosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We predict that the biomarkers correlating with disease activity in Netherton&#xD;
      syndrome will be different than the biomarkers found to correlate with the lamellar and other&#xD;
      ichthyosis phenotype.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define a panel of skin and blood biomarkers associated with disease activity and&#xD;
           pruritus in Netherton syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis, and other ichthyosis subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if blood samples can serve as surrogates for skin immune activation and&#xD;
           will correlate with disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine FLG, SPINK5, TGM1, or other mutation via buccal/saliva samples in&#xD;
           ichthyosis subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine differences in alterations of epidermal lipids and proteins in the outer&#xD;
           stratum corneum of epidermis collected from tape strips in patients with ichthyosis&#xD;
           compared to the general population. There will also be a difference detected in&#xD;
           epidermal lipids from blood samples.&#xD;

        150 subjects (1 year to 60 years of age) with diagnosis of Netherton Syndrome or ichthyosis&#xD;
        will be enrolled. Approximately 50 healthy controls will be enrolled. The blood sample,&#xD;
        skin biopsy, and buccal/saliva sample may be obtained from the same ichthyosis subject.&#xD;
        However there will be separate groups of control patients for the skin biopsies and blood&#xD;
        sample studies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Control and ichthyosis subjects may be of either sex and must be between 1-60 years of&#xD;
             age at the time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ichthyosis subjects include individuals with a diagnosis Netherton syndrome, lamellar&#xD;
             ichthyosis, or other ichthyosis subtypes&#xD;
