      Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are a novel and completely oral hepatitis C therapy . DAAs&#xD;
      are used in most patients being treated for hepatitis C, including those with decompensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis. This type of treatment has now completely replaced interferon-based therapy&#xD;
      .Therapy of chronic hepatitis C with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is able to induce a&#xD;
      sustained virological response (SVR) in over 85% of patients, even if liver cirrhosis is&#xD;
      present. Cirrhotic patients should be closely monitored after treatment.HCC is thought to&#xD;
      develop over time as the liver is exposed to inflammation and develops fibrosis. Thus, if&#xD;
      DAAs can eliminate inflammation mediated by HCV, the risk of HCC should decrease. However,&#xD;
      several centers have observed that this actually may not be the case. Tumor genesis occurs&#xD;
      through a multistep, multifactorial process. Eliminating HCV-induced inflammation may not be&#xD;
      enough to decrease risk of HCC.DAAs have provided an effective, well tolerated treatment for&#xD;
      hepatitis C in patents with cirrhosis . However, several studies have shown unexpectedly high&#xD;
      rates of recurrence of HCC in the early post DAAs treatment time period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HCV is a worldwide infection, it is estimated that about at about 3.0% (170-200 million&#xD;
      people) of the world's population are infected. HCV is associated with an increased disease&#xD;
      burden due to liver cirrhosis and considerable mortality . More than 350,000 people dying&#xD;
      each year from hepatitis C-related liver disease. Adding to the problem of HCV infection is&#xD;
      the presence of occult HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Egypt has the highest prevalence worldwide, it is estimated to be 14.7% among a&#xD;
      representative sample of Egyptian population, aged 15-59 year . Egypt is among countries&#xD;
      responsible for 80.0% of global infections. Further, prevalence is higher among hospitalized&#xD;
      patients and special clinical populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has great genetic variability, with 6 major genotypes (GTs); GT-1 to&#xD;
      6. In Egypt, HCV is almost exclusive GT-4 distribution. HCV has significant differences in&#xD;
      their global distribution and prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in men and the&#xD;
      seventh in women. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related&#xD;
      death worldwide and one of the leading causes of death among patients with cirrhosis. In&#xD;
      Egypt, HCC is the second most common cancer in men and the sixth most common cancer in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are a novel and completely oral hepatitis C therapy . DAAs&#xD;
      are used in most patients being treated for hepatitis C, including those with decompensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis. This type of treatment has now completely replaced interferon-based therapy&#xD;
      .Therapy of chronic hepatitis C with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is able to induce a&#xD;
      sustained virological response (SVR) in over 85% of patients, even if liver cirrhosis is&#xD;
      present. Cirrhotic patients should be closely monitored after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCC is thought to develop over time as the liver is exposed to inflammation and develops&#xD;
      fibrosis. Thus, if DAAs can eliminate inflammation mediated by HCV, the risk of HCC should&#xD;
      decrease. However, several centers have observed that this actually may not be the case.&#xD;
      Tumor genesis occurs through a multistep, multifactorial process. Eliminating HCV-induced&#xD;
      inflammation may not be enough to decrease risk of HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAAs have provided an effective, well tolerated treatment for hepatitis C in patents with&#xD;
      cirrhosis. However, several studies have shown unexpectedly high rates of recurrence of HCC&#xD;
      in the early post DAAs treatment time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a set of small, single-stranded, non-coding RNA molecules (21-30&#xD;
      nucleotides) that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by&#xD;
      translational inhibition or degradation of target mRNA, depending on the degree of&#xD;
      complementary base pairing. Aberrant expression of miRNA is common in various human&#xD;
      malignancies and modulates cancer-associated genomic regions or fragile sites. As for the&#xD;
      relationship between miRNA and HCC several studies have demonstrated that the aberrant&#xD;
      expression of specific miRNA can be detected in HCC cells and tissues. However, little is&#xD;
      known about the mechanisms of miRNA-related cell proliferation and development.ref&#xD;

      Aim of work:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evalution of occurrence and risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients&#xD;
           with HCV-related liver cirrhosis after direct acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To asses diagnostic value of novel markers in patients who developed hepatocellular&#xD;
           carcinoma (HCC) after direct acting antiviral drugs -DAAs -therapy.&#xD;
