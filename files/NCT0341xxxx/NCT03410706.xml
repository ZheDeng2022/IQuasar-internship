  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EINSTEIN PE study demonstrated that rivaroxaban is at least as effective as the current&#xD;
      standard therapy with 51% relative risk reduction of major bleeding (1.1% vs. 2.2%, HR 0.49,&#xD;
      95% CI, 0.31-0.79), in the treatment and secondary prevention of PE. However these patients&#xD;
      were required to meet strict eligibility criteria. Little is known about PE treatment in&#xD;
      China in routine clinical practice and in a real world study patients at higher or lower risk&#xD;
      for adverse events can possibly recruited. Bayer conducts this study to yield&#xD;
      post-authorization safety information in rivaroxaban under real-life conditions in China.&#xD;

    <description>Major bleedings defined as overt bleeding associated with: A fall in hemoglobin of ≥2 g/dL; or a transfusion of ≥2 units of packed red blood cells or whole blood; or occurrence at a critical site: intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, intra-muscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal; or death.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be confirmed by objective diagnostic tools, such as compression ultrasound, venography, CT scan or ventilation/perfusion lung scan, according to the real clinical practice.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.&#xD;
An AE is serious (SAE) if it:&#xD;
Results in death&#xD;
Is life-threatening&#xD;
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (see exceptions below)&#xD;
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity&#xD;
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect&#xD;
Is medically important.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient treatment satisfaction by using questionnaire of ACTS (Anti-Clot Treatment Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS) is a 17-item patient-reported measure of satisfaction with anticoagulant treatment. It includes 13 items about the burdens and 4 items about the benefit of ACT.</description>

    <description>The dosage and the anticoagulation duration is decided by investigators. As list in product information, the PE treatment dosage of rivaroxaban is 15mg bid for first 21 days and then 20mg qd. If CrCl is 30-49 ml/min and bleeding risk is over VTE recurrence risk, 20mg qd can be replaced with 15mg qd.</description>
