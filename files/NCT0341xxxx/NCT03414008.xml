  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI&#xD;
      1291583 in healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose&#xD;
      proportionality and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BI 1291583 after single dosing.&#xD;
