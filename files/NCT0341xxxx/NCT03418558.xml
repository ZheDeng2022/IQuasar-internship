  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label, multicenter study. Patients with advanced colon rectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC) harboring an amplified HER2 that have been previously treated and progressed with an&#xD;
      aNti-HER2 treatment, will be treated with the anti HER2 antibody conjugate trastuzumab&#xD;
      emtansine (TDM1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive study medication until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent or death. Main objective of the study is the evaluation of objective&#xD;
      response rate according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Disease control rate, defined as the sum of&#xD;
      complete, partial and stable disease patients over total patient, followed by response&#xD;
      duration, time to progression and safety are secondary endpoints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In metastatic colorectal cancer, HER2 amplified patients relapsing after initial long-lasting&#xD;
      response to the anti HER combination of trastuzumab + lapatinib, HER2 gene amplification, and&#xD;
      the ensuing high levels of HER2 expression on the tumor surface, persist in spite of the&#xD;
      tumor progression as determined by HER2 amplified ctDNA levels measured at progression and&#xD;
      HER2 IHC findings on rebiopsies of resistant tumors. These findings offer an unexpected&#xD;
      'precision chemotherapy' rescue potential, in spite of progression under anti HER2 treatment&#xD;
      and were confirmed experimentally in a HER2 amplified mCRC PDX (metastatic ColoRectal&#xD;
      Carcinoma Patient Derived Xenografts), model generated from the viable biopsy of a relapsing&#xD;
      HERACLES patient. In this model a randomized trial comparing TDM1 to pertuzumab versus&#xD;
      control (6 animal per arm), showed that T-DM1, but not pertuzumab treated animals achieved&#xD;
      tumor disappearance. The results of this experiment confirm the principle strength of&#xD;
      targeted toxins which is based on their bipartite structure, with one component binding to a&#xD;
      disease-specific cell-surface target molecule and the other conferring cytotoxicity, once&#xD;
      internalized. In this case HER2 amplification confer to the tumor the characteristics of a&#xD;
      'molecular sponge' for TDM1 with the trastuzumab moiety targeting the still over-abundant&#xD;
      HER2 bound to the cell-surface of anti HER2 resistant tumor cell clusters, thus allowing for&#xD;
      a 'surgical' delivery of the emtansine cytotoxicity moiety. Given the good predictability of&#xD;
      mCRC PDXs model, as testified by HERACLES TRIAL results (NCT03225937), investigators believe&#xD;
      that this activity signal should be tested in the clinic. It is therefore proposed a&#xD;
      proof-of-concept trial of T-DM1 in HER2 amplified mCRC patients progressing or relapsing&#xD;
      after trastuzumab-lapatinib treatment.&#xD;
