  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial comparing whether a mailed outreach&#xD;
      intervention offering patients who are not up-to-date with colorectal cancer (CRC) a choice&#xD;
      of completing a home Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) test or scheduling a screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy increases CRC screening completion compared to a mailed FIT kit outreach program&#xD;
      (which does not offer an explicit choice of screening modality). The trial will be conducted&#xD;
      in a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort of patients served by an integrated safety&#xD;
      net delivery system that has a &quot;FIT first&quot; population health screening strategy. All patients&#xD;
      will also have access to whatever CRC screening is recommended through usual visit-based&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the US, though CRC death&#xD;
      can be reduced by screening. In the NCI-funded UT Southwestern-Parkland PROSPR Center (U54&#xD;
      CA163308), mailed FIT-based outreach doubled the proportion of patients up-to-date with&#xD;
      screening compared to usual care. Investigators are now conducting a comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness trial to evaluate the effect of a mailed invite offering a choice of FIT or&#xD;
      colonoscopy (n=2,000) on one-time CRC screening completion compared to mailed FIT-based&#xD;
      outreach (which does not offer an explicit choice of screening modality (n=8,000.)&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified based on whether or not patients completed a FIT within the&#xD;
      prior 18-month period. Patients randomized to FIT outreach will receive: a) low-literacy&#xD;
      educational letters, b) mailed screening outreach invitations, c) a one-sample home FIT kit&#xD;
      and return mailer with prepaid postage, d) telephone reminder calls including one-on-one&#xD;
      education, and e) centralized patient navigation for follow-up of abnormal screening results,&#xD;
      and treatment for patients newly diagnosed with CRC. Patients randomized to the &quot;choice&quot; arm&#xD;
      will receive the same materials described above; however, the educational letter will explain&#xD;
      and offer the additional choice of screening by colonoscopy (instead of completing the mailed&#xD;
      FIT kit). The mailing will include a low health literacy one-page option grid outlining the&#xD;
      pros and cons of FIT vs. colonoscopy. We will not recommend a particular test as preferred&#xD;
      but instead emphasize that both are good choices, and the patient should choose the screening&#xD;
      option that seems right for them. Patients choosing colonoscopy will be provided a telephone&#xD;
      number to schedule the procedure. During scheduling, patients will be triaged by study staff&#xD;
      with a structured history and physical form to &quot;direct access&quot; colonoscopy or a&#xD;
      pre-colonoscopy clinic visit. Patients choosing FIT can return the one-sample mailed FIT kit&#xD;
      using the return envelope with prepaid postage.&#xD;
