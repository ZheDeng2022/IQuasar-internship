  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called atezolizumab as a possible treatment&#xD;
      HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) that has spread to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atezolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pertuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trastuzumab&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the&#xD;
      combination of atezolizumab, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab for use in humans. The FDA has not&#xD;
      approved atezolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atezolizumab is a protein that affects the immune system by blocking the PD-L1 pathway.&#xD;
           The PD-L1 pathway controls the body's natural immune response, but for some types of&#xD;
           cancer the immune system does not work as it should and is prevented from attacking&#xD;
           tumors. Atezolizumab works by blocking the PD-L1 pathway, which may help the immune&#xD;
           system identify and catch tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are targeted therapies approved by the FDA to be used alone&#xD;
           or in combination with a chemotherapy drug to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast&#xD;
           cancer that hasn't been treated with either trastuzumab or chemotherapy yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are called &quot;targeted therapies&quot; because they work by&#xD;
           attaching themselves to specific receptors on the surface of breast cancer cells, known&#xD;
           as HER2 receptors. When these targeted therapies attach to HER2 receptors, the signals&#xD;
           that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for&#xD;
           destruction by your immune system. This process allows pertuzumab and trastuzumab to&#xD;
           help slow or stop the growth of the breast cancer. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab target&#xD;
           different areas of the HER2 cell, so they are believed to work together more&#xD;
           effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, investigators are looking to see how well the cancer responds to the&#xD;
      combination of atezolizumab in combination with pertuzumab and trastuzumab.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No washout is required for endocrine therapy. If a patient has been on endocrine&#xD;
             therapy within 28 days of study entry, that same endocrine therapy is permitted to be&#xD;
             continued during protocol therapy, at the investigator's discretion, as is&#xD;
             continuation of ovarian suppression in premenopausal women. Starting a new endocrine&#xD;
             therapy during protocol therapy is not permitted&#xD;
&#xD;

             HepBsAg, or HCV RNA. HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
             are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             atezolizumab.&#xD;
