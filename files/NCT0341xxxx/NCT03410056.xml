      <pre_assignment_details>Enrollment of the phase 1b part of this study was stopped as of 30 September 2019, due to data that suggested that there is not sufficient benefit-risk for the use of Efavaleukin alfa plus standard of care therapy in this study population.

        <title>Phase 2a: Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score (28 Joint) Calculated Using The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate Formula (DAS28-ESR) at Week 12</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in DAS28-ER at Week 12. DAS28-ESR was to assess disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28-ESR is a composite score that includes 4 variables: tender joint count (TJC) (based on 28 joints); swollen joint count (SJC) (based on 28 joints); participant's global assessment of health activity using 100 mm VAS: range 0 (no pain) to 100 (maximum pain imaginable); marker of inflammation assessed by ESR in mm/h. DAS28-ESR total score range from 0-10, higher score indicates more disease activity.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Enrollment of the phase 1b part of this study was stopped as of 30 September 2019 due to data that suggested that there is not sufficient benefit-risk for the use of Efavaleukin alfa plus standard of care therapy in this study population. The study was terminated prior to the enrollment of any participants into phase 1b Cohort 4 and phase 2a cohorts.</limitations_and_caveats>
