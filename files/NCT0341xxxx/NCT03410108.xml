  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Brigatinib in Japanese&#xD;
      patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive NSCLC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called brigatinib. Brigatinib is being tested in&#xD;
      patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in order to evaluate efficacy and safety of oral doses of&#xD;
      brigatinib in Japanese patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 110 participants. Participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      non-randomized and opened manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Brigatinib 90 mg for the first 7 days, followed by Brigatinib 180 mg of Brigatinib tablets,&#xD;
      once daily in a 28-days cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take tablets of brigatinib once daily with or without food&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is approximately 53 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic during&#xD;
      the treatment period, and posttreatment period including a follow-up assessment after last&#xD;
      dose of study drug.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Received systemic treatment with strong inhibitors or strong and moderate inducers of&#xD;
             cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A within 7 days before the first dose of brigatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Had major surgery within 30 days before the first dose of brigatinib. Minor surgical&#xD;
             procedures such as venous catheter placement or minimally invasive biopsies are&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have been diagnosed with another primary malignancy other than NSCLC, except for the&#xD;
             following adequately/definitively treated malignancies: nonmelanoma skin cancer,&#xD;
             cervical cancer in situ, nonmetastatic prostate cancer; or patients with another&#xD;
             primary malignancy who are definitively relapse-free with at least 3 years elapsed&#xD;
             since the diagnosis of the other primary malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases (parenchymal or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal) at screening or asymptomatic disease requiring an increasing dose of&#xD;
             corticosteroids to control symptoms within 7 days before the first dose of brigatinib.&#xD;
             Note: If a patient has worsening neurological symptoms or signs due to CNS metastasis,&#xD;
             the patient needs to complete local therapy and be neurologically stable (with no&#xD;
             requirement for an increasing dose of corticosteroids or use of anticonvulsants for&#xD;
             symptomatic control) for 7 days before the first dose of brigatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Have current spinal cord compression (symptomatic or asymptomatic and detected by&#xD;
             radiographic imaging). Patients with asymptomatic leptomeningeal disease and without&#xD;
             cord compression are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Have ongoing or history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (including interstitial&#xD;
             pneumonitis, pneumonitis, radiation pneumonitis, drug-related pneumonitis, organized&#xD;
             pneumonia, and pulmonary alveolitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, specifically&#xD;
             including, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Myocardial infarction within 6 months before the first dose of brigatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Unstable angina within 6 months before the first dose of brigatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Congestive heart failure within 6 months before the first dose of brigatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Uncontrolled atrial arrhythmias despite appropriate medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. History of ventricular arrhythmia, including history of ventricular tachycardia,&#xD;
                  ventricular fibrillation, or torsades de pointes. Patients with premature&#xD;
                  ventricular contractions are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within 6 months before the&#xD;
                  first dose of brigatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Have uncontrolled hypertension. Patients with hypertension should be under treatment&#xD;
             at the start of screening and demonstrate adequate control of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Have an ongoing or active infection, including, but not limited to, the requirement&#xD;
             for intravenous antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Have a known history of HIV infection. Testing is not required in the absence of&#xD;
             history.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, detectable hepatitis B viral load, or&#xD;
             detectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection viral load. Note: Patients who have&#xD;
             positive hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) or hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) can&#xD;
             be enrolled but must have an undetectable hepatitis B viral load. Patients who have&#xD;
             positive HCV antibody can be enrolled but must have an undetectable hepatitis C viral&#xD;
             load.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Have malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal illness that could affect oral&#xD;
             absorption of brigatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Have a known or suspected hypersensitivity to brigatinib or its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Female patients who are lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test during the screening period. Note: Female patients who are lactating will be&#xD;
             excluded, even if they discontinue breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Have any condition or illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             compromise patient safety or interfere with the evaluation of brigatinib.&#xD;
