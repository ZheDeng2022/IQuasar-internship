&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned&#xD;
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;

                  However, in the setting of non-immune mediated indications for steroid use,&#xD;
                  chronic/active low dose steroid use may be permitted at the discretion of the&#xD;
                  principal investigator. The dose of steroid allowed in this setting is also at&#xD;
                  the discretion of the principal investigator. (Use of inhaled or topical steroids&#xD;
                  is permitted.)&#xD;
&#xD;

             drugs or biological agents used for treatment of autoimmune diseases) in past 2 years&#xD;
             prior to enrollment. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin&#xD;
             for diabetes or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or&#xD;

             following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for&#xD;
             injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal&#xD;
             influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;

             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational&#xD;
             device within 2 weeks of the first dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biological therapy, targeted small&#xD;
             molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 3 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has&#xD;

             administered agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy, alopecia or hypothyroidism are an&#xD;
                  exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from&#xD;
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy&#xD;
                  events due to a previously administered agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a gastrointestinal condition that may affect drug absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or reaction to any component of either study drug formulation&#xD;

          -  History or presence of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, is clinically meaningful. Screening QTc interval 480 milliseconds is&#xD;
             excluded. In the event that a single QTc is ≥ 480 milliseconds, the subject may enroll&#xD;
             if the average QTc for the 3 ECGs is &lt; 480 milliseconds. For subjects with an&#xD;
             intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval &gt; 120 milliseconds), the JTc interval&#xD;
             may be used in place of the QTc with the approval of the principal investigator. The&#xD;
             JTc must be &lt; 340 milliseconds if JTc is used in place of the QTc. Subjects with left&#xD;
             bundle branch block are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: QTc prolongation due to pacemaker may enroll if the JTc is normal.&#xD;

          -  History of prior therapy with an IDO1 inhibitor in combination with an&#xD;
             anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 agent/any other drug specifically targeting checkpoint pathways.&#xD;
             Patients who have received prior therapy with single agent anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1&#xD;
             therapy or single agent IDO1 inhibitor will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any other concurrent active malignancy&#xD;
