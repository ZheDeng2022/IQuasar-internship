  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to estimate the overall survival of patients with&#xD;
      cervical cancer after the administration of monoclonal antibody (mAb) Nimotuzumab (hR3) in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy of first intention. Patients will be randomized in two parallel&#xD;
      treatment groups. The first group will receive a dose of 200 mg of monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      anti-hR3 (weekly during 18 weeks), combined with a chemotherapy (6 cycles, every 21 days of&#xD;
      Cisplatin 70mg/m2, Vinorelbine 60 mg/m2 (Per Os) at D1 and D8 and then 80mg / m2. The second&#xD;
      group will receive a placebo in combination with the same chemotherapy regimen as the first&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first intention chemotherapy treatment, a dose of maintenance of&#xD;
      Nimotuzumab will be administered at the dose of 200mg every 14 days until progression. A&#xD;
      second chemotherapy in the second intention is proposed, this one is based on Carboplatin (&#xD;
      CBP) in an AUC (area under curve) of 6, and Paclitaxel (Txl) in 175 mg / m2 / BSA (body&#xD;
      surface area ) in drip of 3 hours, every 3 weeks, concomitant with the administration of hR3,&#xD;
      every 14 days, until a limit of toxicity or an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group)&#xD;
      status superior to 3, appears.&#xD;

      The objective of the present study is to assess the overall survival of patients after&#xD;
      administration of Nimotuzumab hR3 monoclonal antibodies (combined with a chemotherapy) in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with cervix epithelial tumors as first-line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included will be divided into two treatment groups. The first group receive a&#xD;
      200 mg dose of hR3 monoclonal antibody (weekly for 18 weeks), and chemotherapy (6 cycles,&#xD;
      every 21 days: Cisplatin (CDDP) 70 mg / m2 on day 1, Vinorelbine 60 mg / m2 on day 1 and day&#xD;
      8) and then 80mg / m2. The second group receive a placebo in addition to the listed&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first line , a 200mg dose of hR3 monoclonal antibodies will be given every 14 days&#xD;
      until progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second -line chemotherapy is proposed, this is based on Carboplatin (CBP) at AUC of 6, and&#xD;
      Paclitaxel (Txl) 175 mg / m2 / SC as 3 hour infusion, every 3 weeks, concomitant with the&#xD;
      administration of hR3, every 14 days, until a toxicity limit or an ECOG status greater than 3&#xD;
      appears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survival overall will be considered as the main variable of the response and survival&#xD;
      without progression from the antitumor response, the toxicity assessment and the quality of&#xD;
      life will be the secondary variables. In addition, the effects may arise during treatment&#xD;
      will be identified, and tumor biopsy markers such as, EGF-R and HPV will be determined and&#xD;
      those of p53, Ki67 and Bcl-2 by immunohistochemistry (IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected to achieve a difference in survival between the treatment groups of 6.5 vs&#xD;
      10.5 months (0.278 vs 0.62) in favor of the group with mAb hR3.&#xD;
