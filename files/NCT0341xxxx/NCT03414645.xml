      The purpose of this Phase 1/2 study is to compare the safety and tolerability of four times a&#xD;
      day (QID) dosing of a non-preserved topical ocular drop formulation of 10 vol/vol % and 30&#xD;
      vol/vol % of FD hPL to vehicle control eye drops in patients with Dry Eye Disease (DED)&#xD;
      secondary to Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients who do not find relief from other modes of therapy, autologous serum tears have&#xD;
      been used as an alternative therapy since the mid-1980s. Limitations such as the need for&#xD;
      periodic blood draws, the lack of standardization in the preparation of AST and&#xD;
      platelet-enriched plasma tears, the unknown shelf life of AST preparations, the use of&#xD;
      non-preserved multi-dose packaging and the practical difficulties patients face in storing&#xD;
      these products frozen or refrigerated have hindered their widespread use for treating GvHD&#xD;
      and other forms of severe tear deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these shortcomings, Cambium Medical Technologies, LLC has developed a proprietary&#xD;
      method of standardizing and manufacturing a fibrinogen-depleted standardized platelet lysate&#xD;
      using pooled human platelet lysates (phPL) collected from qualified healthy donors (CAM-101).&#xD;
      Because Cambium's proprietary manufacturing process depletes pooled human platelet lysates of&#xD;
      fibrinogen (the key clotting protein in platelets), the remaining product contains enriched&#xD;
      levels of several key nutritive and regenerative components than are normally found in&#xD;
      non-standardized AST as well as healthy tear film.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the multi-factorial nature of DED, the enriched levels of numerous key nutritive&#xD;
      components in CAM-101 may well prove to be superior to artificial tears and certain single&#xD;
      active ingredient products which treat only one cause or contributor of dry eye (e.g.,&#xD;
      inflammation) and other forms of tear deficiency.&#xD;
