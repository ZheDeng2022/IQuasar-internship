      A Phase IIa Open-Label Trial to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      Biological, and Clinical Activity of AGEN1884 in Combination with Pembrolizumab in Subjects&#xD;
      with Chemotherapy Naïve, PD-L1 high, metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa, open-label study, of AGEN1884 in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      subjects with stage IV NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression and no EGFR or ALK&#xD;
      genomic tumor aberrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety Run-in Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled in a &quot;3+3&quot; Safety Run-in followed by enrollment completing the&#xD;
      efficacy cohort. Two different dose levels of AGEN1884 may be tested in combination with the&#xD;
      approved pembrolizumab treatment for this indication (until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, or up to a maximum of 24 months). Each subject will stay on the dose level assigned&#xD;
      at trial entry.&#xD;
