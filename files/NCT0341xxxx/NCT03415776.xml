      Hemodialysis is the most worldwide prescribed renal replacement therapy for patients with&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease. The frequency of sessions per week remains a debatable issue. In the&#xD;
      majority of developed Western and Asian countries, patients on chronic hemodialysis are&#xD;
      undergoing three dialysis sessions weekly. In developing countries and some developed&#xD;
      countries, a twice-weekly schedule independent of residual kidney function is still accepted,&#xD;
      sometimes because of lack of resources and some other times because of patients' resistance&#xD;
      to undergo three sessions per week. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the&#xD;
      total mortality of patients on thrice against twice-weekly hemodialysis. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are a) to compare the rate of urgent supplementary hemodialysis sessions between&#xD;
      the two arms, mainly those due to pulmonary edema and hyperkalemia, b) to compare the number&#xD;
      of hospitalizations and duration of stay, c) to compare the rate of uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
      between the two groups, d) to analyze the quantity of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents&#xD;
      (ESAs) in units to achieve a haemoglobin (Hb) 11 to 11.5 g/dl, e) to assess the factors&#xD;
      associated with a higher mortality in the two groups.&#xD;

      Hemodialysis (HD) is the most worldwide prescribed renal replacement therapy for patients&#xD;
      with end-stage renal disease. This treatment that relies heavily on technology has undergone&#xD;
      major modifications in the last five decades in order to improve patients' outcomes. Those&#xD;
      changes that aimed at reducing the morbidity and mortality of patients targeted mainly the&#xD;
      water purification system, the membrane's permeability and biocompatibility, the dialysate&#xD;
      composition and the dose of hemodialysis. However, the frequency of sessions per week remains&#xD;
      a debatable issue influenced by the fluctuating scientific evidence and the patient's&#xD;
      disapproval of being increasingly dependent on a machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the majority of developed Western and Asian countries, patients on chronic hemodialysis&#xD;
      are undergoing three dialysis sessions weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2007 the European guidelines recommended the thrice-weekly hemodialysis with a session&#xD;
      duration 3-5 hours. This dose of treatment will ensure hemodialysis sessions adequacy defined&#xD;
      as urea reduction ratio &gt;65% . However thrice-weekly hemodialysis has been established&#xD;
      worldwide without randomized clinical trials. The rationale behind the thrice-weekly dialysis&#xD;
      seems to be the uncertainty about dialysis adequacy and the risk of malnutrition, anemia and&#xD;
      intra-dialytic hypotension with twice-weekly sessions. Several cohorts have also shown a&#xD;
      favorable effect on survival with thrice compared to twice-weekly hemodialysis especially&#xD;
      when duration of treatment per week of the twice-weekly schedule was less than 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incremental hemodialysis is defined as starting dialysis twice weekly for those who have a&#xD;
      substantial renal urea clearance and switching after 3 months to three times weekly. A large&#xD;
      retrospective study from the US showed that incremental hemodialysis compared to conventional&#xD;
      hemodialysis (three times per week) improved mortality in those with a renal urea clearance&#xD;
      &gt;=3 ml/min/1.73 m2 or urine volume &gt; 600 ml/day. The rationale behind the incremental&#xD;
      schedule is that preserving residual kidney function would lead to better outcomes. However&#xD;
      based on this incremental method, patients should be watched closely for the residual kidney&#xD;
      function and switched at the right moment to three sessions per week otherwise there will be&#xD;
      an overlap between the two phases and an information bias regarding the timing of residual&#xD;
      renal function loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developing countries and some developed countries, a twice-weekly schedule independent of&#xD;
      residual kidney function is still accepted, sometimes because of lack of resources and some&#xD;
      other times because of patients' resistance to undergo three sessions per week. Several&#xD;
      studies have shown that patients on twice-weekly hemodialysis without residual kidney&#xD;
      function have a shorter survival than those on three times per week. A recent prospective&#xD;
      study from Korea showed that residual kidney function is not the only factor that would favor&#xD;
      thrice over twice weekly HD. Another retrospective Indian study showed similar mortality&#xD;
      between those on twice versus thrice-weekly HD while a Chinese observational study&#xD;
      demonstrated longer survival in anuric patients on twice- than thrice-weekly dialysis. All&#xD;
      these controversial studies make it unclear whether patients are still allowed to undergo&#xD;
      twice-weekly hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lebanon is a developing upper middle-income country from the Eastern Mediterranean region&#xD;
      where around 3800 patients are undergoing chronic hemodialysis three or twice weekly.&#xD;
      Although the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health recommended in 2014 that all patients on&#xD;
      chronic hemodialysis be dialyzed three times weekly, many nephrologists are still allowing&#xD;
      the twice schedule if it is more convenient to the patients. With these circumstances,&#xD;
      Lebanon appears an attractive place to study the difference in outcomes between the two&#xD;
      hemodialysis schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design This is a non-randomized, multicenter, clinical trial. Randomization was&#xD;
      considered unethical and contradictory with the current international guidelines. Therefore&#xD;
      patient's allocation was left at the nephrologist and patient's agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossover will be allowed during follow-up to limit attrition. This study will assess the&#xD;
      equivalence between the two schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: participants, interventions and outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting Hemodialysis patients will be recruited from multiple Lebanese HD centers.&#xD;
      Lebanon is divided into 9 governorates and includes 77 HD units. From each governorate 50% of&#xD;
      the units will participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Patients will be assigned to one of two groups upon their agreement with the&#xD;
      treating nephrologist: Group 1 will receive three sessions of hemodialysis weekly. Group 2&#xD;
      will receive two sessions weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant timeline Recruitment of patients will be done over two years or until the&#xD;
      pre-determined sample size is reached whichever comes earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Knowing that the proportion of death varies between 10% and 40%, if we consider a&#xD;
      two sided alpha of 5%, a power of 80% and a small effect size = 0.20 (Cohen's d), the total&#xD;
      sample size needed would be 806 patients. Assuming an attrition rate of 10%, we would need&#xD;
      806/0.9 = 896 patients. The representative sample size for this study is ~900 patients. 600&#xD;
      patients are necessary for the three times weekly arm and 300 patients for the twice weekly&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment It may be difficult to reach 300 patients on twice weekly so the recruitment will&#xD;
      go on till this number is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Data collection, management, and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods eCRF (electronic case report form) will be used for data capture.&#xD;
      Data for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, medications and dialysis&#xD;
      prescription will be collected from the patients' medical records at dialysis initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, smoking,&#xD;
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), previous&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, dementia, Laboratory: serum creatinine (with&#xD;
      corresponding estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), phosphate, calcium, albumin,&#xD;
      potassium, sodium, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), alkaline phosphatase,&#xD;
      ferritin, transferrin saturation, uric acid, hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV)&#xD;
      serologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual renal function: Urine volume and renal urea clearance will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      by collecting the 24 hour-urine at dialysis initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications: statins, calcium-based and non-calcium-based phosphate binders, vitamin D,&#xD;
      antihypertensive medications, antiplatelet agents, erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA)&#xD;
      dose, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, oral anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dialysis prescription: Number of hours per week, blood flow, dialysate flow, type of vascular&#xD;
      access (catheter, graft or arteriovenous fistula), filter membranes (surface, low-flux or&#xD;
      high-flux), dialysate potassium and calcium content will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Chronic kidney disease stage 5 is defined as an eGFR &lt;15 ml/min. Coronary artery&#xD;
      disease is defined as a history of myocardial infarction or obstructive coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, treated medically or interventionally. Diabetes and hypertension are defined as&#xD;
      having a history for antidiabetic or antihypertensive treatment respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncontrolled hypertension is defined as a pre-dialysis BP &gt; 160/90 in more than 2/3 of the&#xD;
      sessions. Residual kidney function is defined as a diuresis &gt; 500 ml/d on a non-dialysis day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Continuous variables will be presented as mean ± standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD). Differences between the study groups will be tested using χ2 tests (for categorical&#xD;
      variables). Bivariate correlation analysis will be performed using the Pearson's correlation&#xD;
      coefficient. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the cumulative survival. Cox&#xD;
      regression will be used to determine the effect of dialysis frequency and other covariates on&#xD;
      mortality. Analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Statistical analysis&#xD;
      will be performed with SPSS. A P-value of ≤0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring Follow-up with laboratory measurements and medication dosage Every month:&#xD;
      hemoglobin, calcium, phosphorus, urea, creatinine, potassium, sodium, bicarbonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 months: PTH, ferritin, transferrin saturation. Every year: lipid panel, albumin. All&#xD;
      these biological parameters will be measured with the standard laboratory techniques and&#xD;
      medications adjusted to maintain serum calcium, phosphate and PTH within the target range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total ESA quantity used for each patient, as well as doses of alfacalcidol, cinacalcet,&#xD;
      phosphate binders and antihypertensive treatment will be collected every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up Data that will be collected monthly includes: mid-week pre-dialysis&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, average interdialytic fluid gain, number, causes&#xD;
      (myocardial infarction, angina, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary edema, hyperkalemia) and&#xD;
      length of hospital stay (LOS), residual kidney function, number of vascular access&#xD;
      thrombosis. Blood pressure will be recorded every week and presented as a monthly average.&#xD;
