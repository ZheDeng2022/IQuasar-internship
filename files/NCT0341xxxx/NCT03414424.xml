  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most spinal cord injuries are anatomically incomplete - some nerve circuits remain intact,&#xD;
      even if the individual cannot feel or control them. Activating spared nerve circuits may&#xD;
      improve functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this goal, the Investigators have developed a form of electrical stimulation over the&#xD;
      cervical spinal cord that can activate muscles in both hands simultaneously and comfortably.&#xD;
      This technique, called cervical electrical stimulation (CES), works at the skin surface - no&#xD;
      surgery or other invasive procedures are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal is to use CES to strengthen residual circuits to hand muscles after SCI.&#xD;
      Regaining control over hand function represents the top priority for individuals with&#xD;
      cervical SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the Investigators first need to better understand how CES works. In the&#xD;
      first half of this study, the Investigators will take a systematic approach to determining&#xD;
      how CES interacts with other circuits in the spinal cord and the brain. In the second half of&#xD;
      the study, the Investigators will test combinations of CES with active hand and wrist&#xD;
      movements to find ways to enhance physical movement with CES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These experiments will improve understanding of electrical stimulation in SCI, and may set&#xD;
      the table for future treatments to prolong any short-term benefits observed in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Roughly 60% of spinal cord injuries occur at the cervical level. Most injuries are&#xD;
      anatomically incomplete. Activating spared nerve circuits augments functional recovery of the&#xD;
      damaged nervous system. With this goal, the Investigators have developed a novel method of&#xD;
      non-invasive cervical electrical stimulation (CES). Preliminary data show that CES triggers&#xD;
      afferent sensory or efferent motor nerve roots depending on stimulus intensity, resulting in&#xD;
      concurrent activation of multiple muscles on both upper limbs. the Investigators aim to use&#xD;
      CES to strengthen residual circuits to hand muscles after SCI. Regaining control over hand&#xD;
      function represents the top priority for individuals with cervical SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, much more work needs to be done to better understand underlying CES mechanisms, its&#xD;
      interactions with segmental and supraspinal circuits, and its optimal stimulation parameters&#xD;
      for improving neural transmission to the hands. This proposal will address these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanistic experiments: 15 able-bodied volunteers and 15 subjects with motor-incomplete&#xD;
      cervical spinal cord injury will undergo systematic combinations of CES with transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation or peripheral nerve stimuli at varying intensities, sites, and&#xD;
      interstimulus intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanistic hypotheses: Conditioning subthreshold CES pulses will potentiate responses to&#xD;
      test pulses of TMS and peripheral nerve F-wave stimulation, will reduce responses to test&#xD;
      pulses of peripheral nerve H-reflex stimulation, and will modulate response to test&#xD;
      suprathreshold CES pulses in either direction depending on conditioning stimulus interval and&#xD;
      intensity. These experiments will elucidate CES circuit interactions at both the segmental&#xD;
      and supraspinal levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined CES-volitional movement experiments: 15 able-bodied volunteers and 15 subjects with&#xD;
      motor-incomplete cervical spinal cord injury will undergo systematic combinations of CES with&#xD;
      volitional wrist and hand movements at varying intensity and effort level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined CES-volitional movement hypotheses: Conditioning subthreshold CES pulses will&#xD;
      facilitate concurrent volitional wrist and hand muscle activation. Suprathreshold CES will&#xD;
      transiently inhibit concurrent volitional wrist and hand muscle activation. These experiments&#xD;
      will shed light on the clinically relevant possibility of using CES to enhance response to&#xD;
      physical exercise therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of the proposed studies will characterize CES circuit timing and distribution, and&#xD;
      will demonstrate in principle the potential for CES to enhance physical therapy for wrist and&#xD;
      hand muscles. Furthermore, this approach is compatible with other interventions, including&#xD;
      drug and cell-based treatments.&#xD;
