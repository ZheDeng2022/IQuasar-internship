      ABSTRACT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury associated with sport and recreation is a leading reason for physical activity&#xD;
      cessation, which is linked with significant long-term negative consequences. Lateral ankle&#xD;
      sprains are the most common injuries associated with physical activity and at least 40% of&#xD;
      individuals who sprain their ankle will go on to develop chronic ankle instability (CAI), a&#xD;
      multifaceted condition linked with life-long residual symptoms and post-traumatic ankle&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. Our long term goal is to develop intervention strategies to decrease&#xD;
      disability associated with acute and chronic ankle injury and prevent posttraumatic ankle&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. Conventional rehabilitation strategies, are only moderately successful&#xD;
      because they ignore the full spectrum of residual symptoms associated with CAI. Manual&#xD;
      therapies such as ankle joint mobilizations and plantar massage target sensory pathways not&#xD;
      addressed by conventional treatments and have been shown to improve patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes, dorsiflexion range of motion, and postural control in CAI patients. While these&#xD;
      early results are promising, the underlying neuromuscular mechanisms of these manual&#xD;
      therapies remain unknown. Therefore the objective of this R21 proposal is to determine the&#xD;
      neuromuscular mechanisms underlying the improvements observed following independent ankle&#xD;
      joint mobilization and plantar massage interventions in CAI patients. To comprehensively&#xD;
      evaluate the neuromuscular mechanisms of the experimental treatments, baseline assessments of&#xD;
      peripheral (ankle joint proprioception, light-touch detection thresholds, spinal (H-Reflex of&#xD;
      the soleus and fibularis longus), and supraspinal mechanisms (cortical activation, cortical&#xD;
      excitability, and cortical mapping, sensory organization) will be assessed. Participants will&#xD;
      then be randomly assigned to receive ankle joint mobilizations (n=20), plantar massage&#xD;
      (n=20), or a control intervention (n=20) which will consist of 6, 5-minute treatments over&#xD;
      2-weeks. Post-intervention assessments will be completed within 48-hours of the final&#xD;
      treatment session. Separate ANOVAs will assess the effects of treatment group (ankle joint&#xD;
      mobilization, plantar massage, control) and time (baseline, post-treatment) on peripheral,&#xD;
      spinal, and supraspinal neuromuscular mechanisms in CAI participants. Associations among&#xD;
      neuromuscular mechanisms and secondary measures (biomechanics and postural control) will also&#xD;
      be assessed. The results of this investigation will elucidate multifaceted mechanisms of&#xD;
      novel and effective manual therapies (ankle joint mobilizations and plantar massage) in those&#xD;
      with CAI.&#xD;

    <measure>ML COP Velocity From Baseline to Post Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24-72 hours post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>% Modulation of ML COP velocity.&#xD;
First, center of pressure (COP) is calculated in the mediolateral (ML) direction [side to side] with eyes open and closed. COP velocity represents the average speed at which an individual's COP moves during the 10 second single limb stance trial.&#xD;
Next, % modulation is calculated. This estimates the weight given to visual information during eyes open stance based on the magnitude of change in ML COP Velocity that occurs when vision is removed relative to the eyes open condition (control condition). The following formula is used: % Modulation = (eyes closed balance score - eyes open balance score) / eyes open balance score. Positive scores indicate a greater reliance on visual information as ML COP velocity increased when eyes were closed relative to the eyes open condition. A ML COP velocity change greater than the eyes open value would result in a value &gt;100%. This analysis focused on baseline to the immediate post-treatment assessment.</description>

        <title>ML COP Velocity From Baseline to Post Intervention</title>
        <description>% Modulation of ML COP velocity.&#xD;
First, center of pressure (COP) is calculated in the mediolateral (ML) direction [side to side] with eyes open and closed. COP velocity represents the average speed at which an individual's COP moves during the 10 second single limb stance trial.&#xD;
Next, % modulation is calculated. This estimates the weight given to visual information during eyes open stance based on the magnitude of change in ML COP Velocity that occurs when vision is removed relative to the eyes open condition (control condition). The following formula is used: % Modulation = (eyes closed balance score - eyes open balance score) / eyes open balance score. Positive scores indicate a greater reliance on visual information as ML COP velocity increased when eyes were closed relative to the eyes open condition. A ML COP velocity change greater than the eyes open value would result in a value &gt;100%. This analysis focused on baseline to the immediate post-treatment assessment.</description>

        <title>AP COP Velocity From Baseline to Post Intervention</title>
        <description>% Modulation of AP COP velocity.&#xD;
First, center of pressure (COP) is calculated in the anterioposterior (AP) direction [front to back]. COP velocity represents the average speed at which an individual's COP moves during the 10 second single limb stance trial.&#xD;
Next, % modulation is calculated. This estimates the weight given to visual information during eyes open stance based on the magnitude of change in ML COP Velocity that occurs when vision is removed relative to the eyes open condition (control condition). The following formula is used: % Modulation = (eyes closed balance score - eyes open balance score) / eyes open balance score. Positive scores indicate a greater reliance on visual information as ML COP velocity increased when eyes were closed relative to the eyes open condition. A ML COP velocity change greater than the eyes open value would result in a value &gt;100%. This analysis focused on baseline to the immediate post-treatment assessment.</description>

        <title>ML TTB From Baseline to Post Intervention</title>
        <description>% Modulation of ML Time-to-Boundary.&#xD;
First, time-to-Boundary (TTB) is calculated in the mediolateral (ML) direction [side to side] with eyes open and closed. TTB represents the time (s) it would take for a participant's center of pressure (i.e. vertical projection of the center of mass) to reach their base of support (i.e. boundary) based on the instantaneous position and velocity of the center of pressure. The base of support is represents the length and width of an individual's foot.&#xD;
Next, % modulation is calculated. This estimates the weight given to visual information during eyes open stance based on the magnitude of change in ML TTB that occurs when vision is removed relative to the eyes open condition (control condition). The following formula is used: % Modulation = (eyes open balance score - eyes closed balance score) / eyes open balance score. Negative scores indicate a greater reliance on visual information as ML TTB decreased with eyes closed.</description>

        <title>ML TTB From Baseline to Follow-Up</title>
        <description>% Modulation of ML Time-to-Boundary.&#xD;
First, time-to-Boundary (TTB) is calculated in the mediolateral (ML) direction [side to side] with eyes open and closed. TTB represents the time (s) it would take for a participant's center of pressure (i.e. vertical projection of the center of mass) to reach their base of support (i.e. boundary) based on the instantaneous position and velocity of the center of pressure. The base of support is represents the length and width of an individual's foot.&#xD;
Next, % modulation is calculated. This estimates the weight given to visual information during eyes open stance based on the magnitude of change in ML TTB that occurs when vision is removed relative to the eyes open condition (control condition). The following formula is used: % Modulation = (eyes open balance score - eyes closed balance score) / eyes open balance score. Negative scores indicate a greater reliance on visual information as ML TTB decreased with eyes closed.</description>

        <description>% Modulation of 95% Confidence Ellipse.&#xD;
First, center of pressure (COP) excursion [movement] is calculated and the magnitude of an ellipse that contains 95% of all data points is calculated with eyes open and closed. The resulting outcome is calculated from a 10 second single limb stance trial.&#xD;
Next, % modulation is calculated. This estimates the weight given to visual information during eyes open stance based on the magnitude of change that occurs when vision is removed relative to the eyes open condition (control condition). The following formula is used: % Modulation = (eyes closed balance score - eyes open balance score) / eyes open balance score. Positive scores indicate a greater reliance on visual information as the variable increased when eyes were closed relative to the eyes open condition. A change greater than the eyes open value would result in a value &gt;100%. This analysis focused on baseline to the immediate post-treatment assessment.</description>

        <description>This measure shows the percentage of excited alpha motor neurons (H) within a muscle upon electrical stimulation, relative to the total number of alpha motor neurons in the same muscle (M). Higher scores represent a greater percentage of excitability (i.e. activation) and is thought to represent better function of the spinal motor pathway. This analysis focused on baseline to the immediate post-treatment assessment.&#xD;
The test is performed using an electric stimulator and electromyography (EMG) to record muscle responses. Stimulation intensity is increased on sequential trials to capture both the H-wave and M-wave responses.</description>

        <title>Fibularis Longus H:M Ratio From Baseline to Follow-Up</title>
        <description>This measure shows the percentage of excited alpha motor neurons (H) within a muscle upon electrical stimulation, relative to the total number of alpha motor neurons in the same muscle (M). Higher scores represent a greater percentage of excitability (i.e. activation) and is thought to represent better function of the spinal motor pathway. This analysis focused on baseline to the immediate post-treatment assessment.&#xD;
The test is performed using an electric stimulator and electromyography (EMG) to record muscle responses. Stimulation intensity is increased on sequential trials to capture both the H-wave and M-wave responses.</description>

        <title>Cortical Silent Period From Baseline to Post Intervention</title>
        <description>A measure of corticospinal inhibition using transcranial electromagnetic stimulation. The cortical silent period (CSP) will be measured as the distance from the end of the motor evoked potential (MEP) to a return of the mean electromyographic (EMG) signal plus two times the standard deviation of the baseline (pre-stimulus) EMG signal. A longer CSP indicates a greater corticospinal inhibition. This analysis focused on baseline to the immediate post-treatment assessment.</description>
