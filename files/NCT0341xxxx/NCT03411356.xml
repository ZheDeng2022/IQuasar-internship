  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to is to determine if intermittent fasting (IMF) is an&#xD;
      effective dietary strategy for treatment of obesity. A 1 year randomized trial will be used&#xD;
      to compare weight loss generated by IMF versus Daily Caloric Restriction (DCR). The targeted&#xD;
      weekly energy deficit is designed to be similar (~30%) and a comprehensive behavioral support&#xD;
      program will be provided to both groups. The primary outcome is weight change at the end of&#xD;
      the 1 year intervention; follow up measures will also be obtained 6 months after completing&#xD;
      the intervention. This study will provide robust data regarding weight loss effectiveness of&#xD;
      IMF and will further our understanding of the impact of IMF on energy balance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restricting daily calorie intake is the primary dietary strategy currently used to treat&#xD;
      obesity. However, this approach is not effective for all individuals. Further, adherence to&#xD;
      daily caloric restriction (DCR) typically decreases over time and many individuals who lose&#xD;
      weight with this strategy will regain. Thus, novel dietary interventions are needed to&#xD;
      provide a broader range of treatment options. The objective of this proposal is to determine&#xD;
      if intermittent fasting (IMF) is an effective dietary strategy for treatment of obesity. IMF&#xD;
      is an alternative method of reducing energy intake (EI) which has gained lay popularity in&#xD;
      recent years as a strategy for weight loss. Short-term studies suggest IMF produces 3-8%&#xD;
      weight loss in individuals with overweight and obesity. However, few studies have compared&#xD;
      IMF to DCR and no studies have evaluated whether IMF is an effective long-term (≥1 year)&#xD;
      weight loss strategy. Data from an 8-week pilot study comparing IMF to DCR suggests IMF is&#xD;
      safe, tolerable, and produces similar short-term weight loss. After 6 months of unsupervised&#xD;
      follow-up, changes in body composition tended to be more favorable with IMF and almost twice&#xD;
      as many IMF participants maintained a ≥5 kg weight loss. Thus, IMF may be a more effective&#xD;
      dietary strategy for sustaining weight loss than DCR. However, longer-term data are needed&#xD;
      and little is known about adherence to IMF or the impact of IMF on energy expenditure (EE).&#xD;
      Short-term studies suggest adherence to IMF may be superior to DCR, however, energy intake&#xD;
      (EI) was based on self-report which may have significant limitations. Pilot data suggests&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure (REE) was preserved during IMF-induced weight loss, which could&#xD;
      decrease risk for weight regain. However, the impact of IMF on other components of EE&#xD;
      including physical activity (PA) is largely unexamined. The study design is a pragmatic&#xD;
      randomized trial to compare weight loss generated by IMF vs DCR. The targeted weekly energy&#xD;
      deficit will be equivalent: DCR will be prescribed a ~30% daily energy restriction and IMF&#xD;
      will be prescribed a modified fast (~80% energy restriction) on 3 non-consecutive days per&#xD;
      week. The hypothesis is that a weight loss program based on IMF as the primary dietary&#xD;
      strategy will result in greater weight loss at 1 year compared to a program based on&#xD;
      traditional DCR. The approach is innovative as the targeted energy deficit will be matched&#xD;
      between groups and EI will be assessed objectively (using doubly-labeled water) to provide an&#xD;
      accurate comparison of adherence. In addition, both intervention groups will receive&#xD;
      guidelines-based behavioral support to compare IMF to the current standard of care (DCR) in a&#xD;
      more robust fashion. This study is significant as it could identify an effective alternative&#xD;
      dietary strategy to help more people achieve and sustain weight loss.&#xD;
