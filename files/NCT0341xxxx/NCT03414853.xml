  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computer-aided diagnostic software has been used to assist physicians in various ways.&#xD;
      Text-based prediction algorithms have been trained on past medical records through data&#xD;
      mining and feature analysis. Currently, all text-based machine learning prediction problem&#xD;
      models have been built on extracted data with no research completed on free text based&#xD;
      prediction algorithms. This study aims to determine the accuracy of a free text prediction&#xD;
      algorithm in predicting the probability of appendicitis in patients presenting to the&#xD;
      Emergency Department with abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Developing machine learning models that have a strong prediction power for diagnosis of&#xD;
      appendicitis from physician entered free text input can improve diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      doctors. It also offers the possibility of using prediction algorithms to improve routine&#xD;
      clinical care. In the future, multiple machine learning models can be combined to increase&#xD;
      prediction accuracy and prediction algorithms can be extended to other diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18,000 cases of emergency department presentations over 10 years were used as a training and&#xD;
      validation dataset. To develop the appendicitis prediction model, deep learning neural&#xD;
      networks with a customized medical ontology were used. The diagnostic accuracy of the model&#xD;
      is expressed as sensitivity (recall), specificity and F1 score (harmonic mean). The developed&#xD;
      diagnosis predictive model shows high sensitivity (86.3%), specificity (91.9%) and F1 score&#xD;
      (88.8) in diagnosing appendicitis from patients presenting with abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predictive model algorithm will also highlight words in the free text (entered by the&#xD;
      attending physician) that it assigns higher probability for predicting an outcome. The&#xD;
      doctors will be instructed to provide a percentage likelihood of appendicitis based on the&#xD;
      clinical presentation and any available laboratory investigations. The doctor is then shown&#xD;
      the prediction of the algorithm as well as the highlighted words for the patient entered.&#xD;
      He/she must then provide another prediction of the likelihood of appendicitis after seeing&#xD;
      the algorithm generated prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and to assess if usage of the&#xD;
      algorithm is able to help emergency doctors improve their diagnosis of appendicitis. The&#xD;
      prediction results will be tabulated to assess accuracy of the algorithm, doctors before&#xD;
      algorithm input and doctors after receiving algorithm input. The accuracy will be expressed&#xD;
      as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive prediction value, F1 score and F0.5 score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 100 emergency doctors will be recruited over the course of 1 year as&#xD;
      participants in the study. The doctors will be split randomly assigned to two groups - the&#xD;
      algorithm arm and the no algorithm arm. The randomization will be by time (weekly) using&#xD;
      variable block randomization of 4 and 6. The patients will be followed up for the final&#xD;
      discharge diagnoses.&#xD;
