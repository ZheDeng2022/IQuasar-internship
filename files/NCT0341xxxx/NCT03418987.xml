  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and classification of scoliosis are almost exclusively based on frontal and&#xD;
      lateral radiographs. Current classifications of adolescent or adult idiopathic degenerative&#xD;
      scoliosis are based only on the 2D approach. The classifications consider only the lateral&#xD;
      deviation and the sagittal alignment and completely ignore all the changes (the axial&#xD;
      vertebral rotation and the lateral translation etc ...) in the horizontal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demand for an accurate assessment of the vertebral rotation in scoliosis is not new.&#xD;
      Biplane x-ray images provide insufficient quantitative or qualitative information on the&#xD;
      anatomical landmarks needed to determine axial rotation. Several measurement methods have&#xD;
      been published, all of which are based on the evaluation of the relative positions of various&#xD;
      posterior vertebral elements. The Perdriolle torsiometer is currently the most accepted&#xD;
      method in clinical practice, but its reproducibility is very limited and can not be&#xD;
      quantified accurately.The horizontal plane deviations are more accurately evaluated by the CT&#xD;
      scan, but the systematic use of this method is limited because of its relatively high cost&#xD;
      and excessive radiation dose. Expert opinion is also divided on the veracity and&#xD;
      reproducibility of CT scan for such measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the absence of a definitive and reproducible measurement method for 3D characterization&#xD;
      of the vertebral columnar deformities, the investigators introduced the concept and system of&#xD;
      vertebral vectors.The vertebral vector technique is currently the only technique in the world&#xD;
      that allows the visualization of vertebral column deformities by analyzing each vertebral&#xD;
      body and defining characteristic mathematical and geometric parameters that uniquely&#xD;
      characterize each vertebrae. A new digital radioimaging technique based on a low dose X-ray&#xD;
      detection technology simultaneously creates frontal and lateral whole body radiographic&#xD;
      images captured in a standing position, which is the basis of visualization of the vertebral&#xD;
      vector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the two phenotypes of scoliosis, it is necessary to collect the radiological data&#xD;
      specific to the disease. After generating the vertebral vectors and obtaining the&#xD;
      three-dimensional coordinates, an analysis and an exact mathematical description will be&#xD;
      performed. The projections of the curves in the three planes will also be analyzed, with&#xD;
      particular attention to the projections in the horizontal planes. Based on the mathematical&#xD;
      models and the axial projection of the curves, a new three-dimensional classification can be&#xD;
      imagined for the first time not only for adolescent scoliosis, but also for adult&#xD;
      degenerative scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to develop new evidence-based treatments based on the&#xD;
      unambiguous understanding of 3D features of vertebral columnar deformities.&#xD;
