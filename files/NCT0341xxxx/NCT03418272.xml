  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if the bacteria found in your mouth (oral flora&#xD;
      bacteria) in children admitted to the intensive care unit who need to be on a breathing&#xD;
      machine is different from the oral flora in healthy children undergoing anesthesia for their&#xD;
      dental caries. Children in the intensive care unit with a breathing tube are at a higher risk&#xD;
      for getting a lung infection due to the bacteria in the mouth slipping into their lungs past&#xD;
      the breathing tube over several days. This means that bacteria are found in the child's lung&#xD;
      when this is normally not the case. If the bacteria in the mouth have changed from normal&#xD;
      then they may get a pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The oral cavity has natural flora of microbiology that may be associated with the development&#xD;
      of dental decay. Another possible problem arising from this flora is the migration of the&#xD;
      bacteria into the trachea causing pulmonary infections such as trachietis or pneumonia. The&#xD;
      risk of developing a pulmonary infection appears to be increased in patients who have been&#xD;
      intubated for a period of time (days) such as those patients ventilated in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU). It has also been shown that in patients in the ICU the nature of the oral flora&#xD;
      changes over time to include bacteria that are more commonly associated with the nosocomial&#xD;
      pneumonia, ventilator associated pneumonia. We have previous demonstrated in a small pilot&#xD;
      study (CYIRB2779) that the changes in the oral flora in children intubated in the ICU was&#xD;
      similar to those bacteria grown from tracheal cultures ordered by the intensivist. Patients&#xD;
      intubated in the ICU maybe at risk of decreased salivary flow, sedated and unable to clear&#xD;
      secretions and are reliant on the bedside nurse to maintain adequate oral hygiene. Most ICU's&#xD;
      have guidelines and policies to ensure that oral hygiene is appropriately cared for. They are&#xD;
      also at risk for changes in the oral flora due to concomitant broad-spectrum antibiotic use&#xD;
      that is common in the initial 48 hours after admission with respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second are of interest is to determine whether children who are very sick and require&#xD;
      intubation and ventilation support have different bugs growing in their mouth that may&#xD;
      predispose them to future infection whilst in the ICU.&#xD;
