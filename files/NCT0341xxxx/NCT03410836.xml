      This study evaluates the impact of intraoperative intravenous lidocaine administered during&#xD;
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery on the intraoperative remifentanil consumption as well as&#xD;
      postoperative pain and opioid requirements. It will evaluate immune cell activity for 48hours&#xD;
      after surgical stress and general anesthesia with or without intravenous lidocaine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the intravenous lidocaine (IVL) versus placebo administered&#xD;
      during laparoscopic colorectal surgery will allow for: a reduction in intraoperative&#xD;
      remifentanil consumption, an improvement in patients' early rehabilitation after surgery, and&#xD;
      an enhancement of the immune profile of our patients through an increase in the balance&#xD;
      Th1/Th2 and cellular immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: so far, IVL was shown to have several properties: analgesic, anti-inflammatory,&#xD;
      and anti-hyperalgesic. Its effects on rehabilitation and pain are still controversial except&#xD;
      for abdominal surgery. To date, no study evaluated the impact of IVL in colorectal surgery on&#xD;
      intraoperative consumption of remifentanil. Postoperative immune suppression is&#xD;
      multifactorial and depends on the surgical traumatism, but also on the doses of opioids given&#xD;
      during anesthesia. No study evaluated in colorectal surgery the impact of IVL on&#xD;
      postoperative cellular immunity and on the risk of cancer recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives: primary objective: to reduce by 30% the consumption of remifentanil in&#xD;
      the IVL group versus the placebo group; secondary objectives: to evaluate the quality of&#xD;
      recovery from anesthesia in the OR (awakening and extubation time), in the PACU and on the&#xD;
      wards (pain scores, opioid consumption with patient controlled analgesia (PCA), postoperative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting (PONV), transit recovery time, time in PACU and time in hospital), and to&#xD;
      evaluate the postoperative inflammatory parameters and adaptative immune functions (Th1/Th2)&#xD;
      until postoperative 48h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 60 adult patients ASA 1-3 scheduled for elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery&#xD;
      will be included in this randomized controlled trial. Randomisation will be into group&#xD;
      Control (C) and Lidocaine (IVL). Anesthesia and monitoring will be standardized and&#xD;
      accompanied with the monitoring of the depth of anesthesia (BISpectral index, Medtronic) and&#xD;
      the depth of analgesia (NoL index, Medasense LTD, recorded on an observational manner). IVL&#xD;
      group will blindly be administered intravenous 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine bolus and then 1.5 mg/kg/h&#xD;
      until the end of the surgery as previously described. C group will receive the same amount&#xD;
      (ml) of placebo. Statistics: a preliminary analysis (idem group C) showed that the total&#xD;
      amount of remifentanil given for this type of surgery was 2481+/-985 mcg (duration&#xD;
      141+/-30Min). Considering that we wish to reduce by 30% the remifentanil consumption in the&#xD;
      group IVL, the number of patients to be included per group is 30 (alpha 0.05 and beta 20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Importance: this study will evaluate the impact of IVL on intraoperative&#xD;
      consumption of remifentanil but also on immune functions after surgery in order to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of cancer recurrence. If this study brings positive results, this will lead to a&#xD;
      significant change in clinical practice of anesthesia. This is a pilot study on the immune&#xD;
      functions, but this might bring very strong results to ask for future grants on the impact of&#xD;
      IVL on cancer recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, randomized controlled study. Subject Population: Adult patients&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 60 patients will be evaluated in this study. Study Duration: 1 year. Study&#xD;
      Center: Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, CIUSSS de l'Est de l'Ile de Montreal, Montreal,&#xD;
      Quebec, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events: None expected.&#xD;
