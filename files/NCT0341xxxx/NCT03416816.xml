  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, multi-center study of orally administered DSP-0337 in adult&#xD;
      subjects with advance solid tumors that are refractory to standard treatment, or for whom no&#xD;
      effective therapy exists.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is comprised of two parts: an initial dose escalation phase utilizing a 3 + 3&#xD;
      design to determine maximum tolerated dose followed by a dose expansion cohort in&#xD;
      approximately 30 additional subjects. Study participants will initially receive DSP-0337&#xD;
      orally for 28 days (one cycle of treatment). If clinical benefit is seen, treatment can&#xD;
      continue until disease progression.&#xD;

An additional subset of patients will be treated to assess the effect of food intake on the PK of DSP-0337 administration at the MTD level. Once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been established, patients will be treated with the RP2D to explore preliminary antitumor activity and safety profile.</description>
