  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is frequently suspected in the Emergency Department (ED).&#xD;
      However, usual diagnosis procedure based on clinical features and chest X-Ray has rather bad&#xD;
      performances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study on CT performance in suspected CAP found that 58% of classifications were&#xD;
      modified by CT when compared with usual procedure. However, extended CT usage in CAP&#xD;
      diagnosis is associated with many limitations :&#xD;
&#xD;
      availability in a majority of ED, delay, cost and irradiation, in particular In young&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung Ultrasound (LUS) has good performances in CAP diagnosis even when compared with CT. It&#xD;
      is a rapid, inexpensive, radiation-free tool available in a majority of ED. It is performed&#xD;
      at the patient's bedside with immediate results. The learning curve allows Emergency&#xD;
      Physicians (EP) to perform this exam after a relative brief training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators aim to investigate LUS performances in clinically suspected CAP&#xD;
      authentication , and assesses specific diagnostic contributions and impact on antibiotic&#xD;
      prescriptions .&#xD;

      120 patients will be enrolled on CAP suspicion. All explorations (radiography…) and&#xD;
      biological exams (blood culture…) will be performed as usual to build physician primary&#xD;
      diagnosis. Complementarily, an EP will be realized and final diagnosis will be made by&#xD;
      physician. Finally, at Day28 expert adjudication committee will authentic diagnosis&#xD;
      considering explorations and clinical issues. Frequency of discordant diagnosis between 1st&#xD;
      and 2nd assessment and against expert will be measured Primary Purpose: diagnostic Study&#xD;
