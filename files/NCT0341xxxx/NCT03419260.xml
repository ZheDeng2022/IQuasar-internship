  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrographic seizures are common in critically ill patients leading to increased use of&#xD;
      resource-intense continuous EEG monitoring for seizure identification and management. When&#xD;
      identified, electrographic seizures are generally treated with anti-seizure medications, but&#xD;
      there are very limited data available regarding optimal treatment in terms of the efficacy or&#xD;
      safety of specific anti-seizure medications or overall management strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center prospective observational study. The investigators aim to: (1) track&#xD;
      critically ill patients undergoing clinically indicated EEG monitoring and seizure management&#xD;
      to identify risk factors for electrographic seizures, (2) create prediction models guiding&#xD;
      EEG monitoring resources to the patients at highest risk for seizures, and (3) evaluate our&#xD;
      current management strategy in terms of safety.&#xD;

      Context: Electrographic seizures are common in critically ill patients leading to increased&#xD;
      use of resource-intense continuous EEG monitoring for seizure identification and management.&#xD;
      When identified, electrographic seizures are generally treated with anti-seizure medications,&#xD;
      but there are very limited data available regarding optimal treatment in terms of specific&#xD;
      medication selections or overall management strategies. The Children's Hospital of&#xD;
      Philadelphia (CHOP) has a formal ICU EEG Monitoring Pathway aiming to standardize EEG&#xD;
      monitoring and seizure management. This is a single-center prospective observational study of&#xD;
      patients undergoing clinically indicated EEG monitoring to identify risk factors for&#xD;
      electrographic seizures and create prediction models guiding limited EEG monitoring resources&#xD;
      to the patients at highest risk for seizures, and also to evaluate the current seizure&#xD;
      management strategy in terms of safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to identify risk factors for electrographic seizures in&#xD;
      critically ill patients and use these risk factors to create and validate a seizure&#xD;
      prediction model. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of a targeted and timely&#xD;
      electrographic seizure identification and management strategy among critically ill patients&#xD;
      guided by a CHOP ICU EEG Monitoring Pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Single center observational study of consecutive patients undergoing clinically&#xD;
      indicated EEG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting/Participants: Single-center study of critically ill children in the Pediatric ICU at&#xD;
      CHOP undergoing clinically indicated EEG monitoring and seizure management.&#xD;

        This study is a prospective observational study of consecutive patients undergoing&#xD;
        clinically indicated EEG monitoring in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Pediatric&#xD;
        ICU as guided by an institutional ICU EEG Monitoring Pathway. Each subject will participate&#xD;
        from the time of EEG monitoring initiation until the time of hospital discharge. This&#xD;
        duration will generally be from several days to several weeks depending on the duration of&#xD;
        the hospitalization.&#xD;
