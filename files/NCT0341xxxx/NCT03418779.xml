  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TCM-WINE study is a single-center, prospective, double-blind randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial. Based on optimal supportive care, the trial is aiming to assess&#xD;
      superiority with regard to renal protection and reduction of severe treatment-related adverse&#xD;
      events of Yi-Qi-Qing-Jie formula (YQF) combined therapy compared with immunosuppression&#xD;
      monotherapy in high-risk IgAN.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to randomize 60 participants with biopsy-proven IgAN to a YQF combined&#xD;
      group (YQF compound combined with prednisolone, and cyclophosphamide if necessary) or an&#xD;
      immunosuppression group (placebo-YQF combined with prednisolone, and cyclophosphamide if&#xD;
      necessary). The two groups will enter a 48-week in-trial treatment phase and receive&#xD;
      post-trial follow-up until 50% (30/60) have a composite endpoint or have been followed for 3&#xD;
      years (study completion). All patients will receive optimal supportive care.&#xD;

Schischk, Flos lonicerae, Angelica sinensis, Dioscorea nipponica, Hedyotis diffusa Willd, rhubarb, Spatholobus suberectus, with the effect of reinforcing Qi and activating blood, clearing away heat and poison, dissolving dampness and downbearing turbid) dissolved in 150 ml boiled water and taken orally twice a day for the duration of the treatment and follow-up phases.</description>

    <description>Immunosuppression therapy comprises oral prednisolone (0.5-0.8 mg/kg/day; exact dose decided by the investigator, maximum dose not exceeding 60 mg/day) for 8 weeks, then tapered by 5-10 mg/day every 4 weeks, with a total treatment period of 24-32 weeks. Participants with persistent proteinuria ≥ 1 g/day after 8 weeks of corticosteroid monotherapy will receive 0.8-1.0 g of intravenous cyclophosphamide (CTX) every 4 weeks, total dose of not exceeding 8 g (exact dose decided by the site investigator). If severe CTX-related adverse events occur, such as alanine transaminase (ALT) exceeding the upper limit of two times, infections requiring hospitalization, granulocytes &lt; 3.0 × 109/L and platelets &lt; 50.0 × 109/L, CTX will stop being administered, symptoms will be treated, and adverse events recorded. Also, the frequency of detection will be increased to once every 2 weeks and the affected participant will be withdrawn if persistent infection or myelosuppression occurs.</description>
