  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a cancer, caused by asbestos, which currently affects 2500&#xD;
      people in the UK each year. The main symptom is breathlessness caused by fluid building up in&#xD;
      the space between the lung and the chest wall (pleural effusion). Treatment involves draining&#xD;
      the fluid to allow the lung to re-expand (pleurodesis). However, sometimes tumour growth over&#xD;
      the surface of the lung can prevent it from re-expanding. This 'trapped' lung results in&#xD;
      fluid re-accumulation and repeated drainage which can lead to discomfort and multiple&#xD;
      hospital visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach to dealing with 'trapped' lung in mesothelioma is to insert a thin tube&#xD;
      (Indwelling Pleural Catheter - IPC) into the space around the lung. The tube can stay in&#xD;
      place for a long time allowing patients to drain off fluid at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another approach is a keyhole surgical operation (video-assisted thoracoscopic partial&#xD;
      pleurectomy/decortication - VAT-PD) to remove as much tumour as possible from the lining of&#xD;
      the lung to allow it to re-expand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While both approaches are currently offered in clinical practice, it is not known which of&#xD;
      the two is most effective at relieving breathlessness. The only way to find out is to conduct&#xD;
      a research trial comparing the two. The Investigators plan to do this, but first of all need&#xD;
      to carry out a small pilot study to collect information necessary to help plan the full&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled pilot clinical trial and&#xD;
      feasibility study comparing video-assisted thoracoscopic partial pleurectomy/decortication&#xD;
      (VAT-PD) with indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) in patients with trapped lung (TL) and&#xD;
      pleural effusion due to malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), aimed at addressing recruitment&#xD;
      and randomisation uncertainties as well as sample size requirements for a full phase III&#xD;
      study. 38 patients will be randomised and allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either VAT-PD or IPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be undertaken at mesothelioma surgical centres with expertise in either IPC,&#xD;
      VAT-PD or both procedures, together with their linked non-surgical referral hospitals (hub&#xD;
      and spoke). Patients meeting all eligibility criteria will be informed about the study,&#xD;
      provided with a patient information sheet and given at least 24 hours to consider&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent, patients will be randomised, baseline measurements will be taken and a&#xD;
      procedure date will be arranged. Following the procedure follow-up visits at 6 weeks, 3, 6&#xD;
      and 12 months post-randomisation are planned to coincide with clinical care visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel with the main study an observational sub-study will collect observational data on&#xD;
      a cohort of patients who have Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma and trapped lung, but who are&#xD;
      either not eligible to participate, or who decline to participate in the main study. Patients&#xD;
      in the Observational Sub-study will receive the same baseline and follow-up visits as those&#xD;
      in the main study, but will receive standard clinical care.&#xD;

    <description>VAT-PD is a type of &quot;keyhole surgery&quot; performed under general anaesthesia using a telescope and instruments put inside the chest. Through small incisions, or keyholes made between the ribs, the thoracic surgeon removes the hard rind of the tumour over the surface of the lung, thereby allowing the 'trapped' lung to fully expand again. Simultaneous removal of mesothelioma from the outer pleural membrane allows pleurodesis to occur.</description>

    <description>A soft silicone catheter (IPC) with a one-way valve at the end is inserted a few centimetres under the skin under local anaesthesia. The inside end of the catheter is inserted into the pleural space and the outside end is connected to a vacuum drainage bottle. The IPC permits regular fluid drainage.</description>
