  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caribbean nations, including Jamaica, exhibit HIV rates that are second only to sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa. Jamaican young women and adolescent girls are at particularly high risk due to a&#xD;
      number of cultural factors, gender norms, partnering with older male partners, and lack of&#xD;
      knowledge and skills related to sexual refusal and HIV prevention. U.S. studies have shown&#xD;
      that mothers may act as a key influence of their daughters' sexual risk beliefs and&#xD;
      behaviors. However, no such studies have documented these effects outside of the U.S. and no&#xD;
      studies have evaluated HIV risk-reduction interventions with Jamaican adolescent girls and&#xD;
      their mothers. Hence, the purpose of this study is to partner with the University of the West&#xD;
      Indies, Jamaican community based organizations (CBOs) and families in order to develop and&#xD;
      test a culture-specific mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention in a randomized field&#xD;
      experiment. Specifically, the investigative team will evaluate whether a culture-specific,&#xD;
      theory-based, skill-building intervention with Jamaican adolescent girls and their mothers&#xD;
      can directly and/or indirectly reduce these girls' HIV risk-associated sexual behaviors.&#xD;
      Jamaican girls, ages 13 - 17, and their mothers/female guardians will be recruited from CBOs&#xD;
      and randomly assigned to either: (a) a mother-daughter HIV risk-reduction intervention&#xD;
      condition or (b) a &quot;no intervention&quot; waitlist control condition. The HIV risk-reduction&#xD;
      intervention includes 12 1-hour modules scheduled over 2 days and implemented by trained&#xD;
      adult Jamaican women (nurses and CBO staff). The mother component is designed to increase&#xD;
      those parenting behaviors (e.g., monitoring and parent-teen sexual risk communication&#xD;
      [PTSRC]) associated with reduced adolescent sexual risk-taking; the teen component is&#xD;
      designed to improve girls' beliefs and skills related to abstinence, sexual negotiation and&#xD;
      condom use. A &quot;waitlist&quot; control condition is being employed as the proposed project is a&#xD;
      pilot study of the HIV risk-reduction intervention. Primary outcomes include&#xD;
      mothers'/daughters' reports of parenting behaviors (monitoring and PTSRC) and daughters'&#xD;
      self-reports of sexual risk behaviors (sexual intercourse, unprotected sex, condom use,&#xD;
      number of partners). Secondary outcomes include daughters' STI rates, mothers' beliefs&#xD;
      regarding parenting behaviors and daughters beliefs regarding sexual risk behaviors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caribbean nations, including Jamaica, exhibit HIV rates that are second only to sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa. Jamaican young women and adolescent girls are at particularly high risk for HIV and&#xD;
      other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) due to a number of cultural factors (including&#xD;
      male-dominated gender norms and older male partners) and lack of knowledge and skills related&#xD;
      to sexual communication, refusal and HIV prevention. Reducing the sexual risk behaviors of&#xD;
      Jamaican adolescent females is critical to reducing their risk for HIV/STIs. U.S. studies&#xD;
      have shown that parents, particularly mothers, may act as key influences of their daughters'&#xD;
      sexual risk beliefs and behaviors. However, no studies have documented these parental effects&#xD;
      outside of the U.S. and no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of family-based HIV&#xD;
      risk-reduction interventions with international populations, including Jamaican adolescents.&#xD;
      Further, it is not yet known whether the instruments used to assess the theoretical&#xD;
      constructs of interest are culturally sensitive or appropriate for use with Jamaican&#xD;
      adolescents and adults. Hence, the broad objective of this proposal is to develop and test a&#xD;
      culturally sensitive, theory-based, gender-specific Jamaican mother-daughter HIV&#xD;
      risk-reduction intervention by using community-based participatory research methods and&#xD;
      existing collaborative relationships between investigators from the New York University, the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania Center for Health Disparities Research (PENN) and the University&#xD;
      of the West Indies (UWI), Mona Campus. Building upon already completed preliminary&#xD;
      elicitation research with Jamaican adolescents, parents, teachers and stakeholders, the&#xD;
      investigative team proposes to a) conduct in-depth elicitation research into the social,&#xD;
      cultural and family factors that influence HIV-related sexual risk behaviors among Jamaican&#xD;
      adolescent girls; b) collaboratively develop a culturally appropriate, gender specific,&#xD;
      theory-based mother-daughter HIV risk reduction intervention for Jamaican adolescent girls&#xD;
      and their mothers; c) enhance the research capacity of the UWI School of Nursing and the&#xD;
      sustainability of the intervention program; d) assess the cultural appropriateness of study&#xD;
      instruments and adapt and refine as needed; and e) evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      mother-daughter HIV/STI risk reduction intervention through a randomized pilot study.&#xD;
      Although the term &quot;mother&quot; is used throughout the application, it is defined based upon the&#xD;
      preliminary elicitation research already completed in Jamaica. The term &quot;mother&quot; will be used&#xD;
      to represent the primary female guardian or caregiver; this may be the mother, step-mother,&#xD;
      aunt, grandmother or other related or unrelated female guardian or caregiver. In the proposed&#xD;
      pilot study, the plan is to recruit 360 Jamaican adolescent females, ages 13 - 17 years, and&#xD;
      their mothers from non-governmental community-based organizations (CBOs) in and around&#xD;
      Kingston, Jamaica and randomly assign them to either a mother-daughter HIV/STI risk-reduction&#xD;
      intervention condition or a &quot;no intervention&quot; waitlist control condition that includes only a&#xD;
      brief educational activity addressing heart disease. The HIV risk-reduction intervention will&#xD;
      be implemented by trained adult Jamaican women (nurses and CBO staff). The adolescent&#xD;
      component is designed to reduce HIV-related sexual risk behaviors (e.g., sexual intercourse,&#xD;
      unprotected intercourse, multiple partners); the mother component is designed to increase&#xD;
      those parenting behaviors (e.g., monitoring and parent-teen sexual risk communication&#xD;
      [PTSRC]) associated with reduced adolescent sexual risk-taking. A &quot;no intervention&quot; waitlist&#xD;
      control condition is being employed as the proposed project is a pilot study of the HIV/STI&#xD;
      risk-reduction intervention. Should the pilot study find evidence of intervention&#xD;
      effectiveness, a full RCT study with long-term follow-up and examination of moderation of&#xD;
      intervention effects will be proposed in a subsequent application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four specific aims for the proposed project. Aim 1 is to conduct broad, in-depth&#xD;
      elicitation research using community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods in order to&#xD;
      elucidate the social, cultural and family factors that influence Jamaican adolescent girls'&#xD;
      sexual risk-taking during Years 01 and 02. Aim 2 is to develop a culturally appropriate,&#xD;
      gender specific, theory-based, skill-building mother-daughter HIV/STI risk-reduction&#xD;
      intervention during Year 02. Aim 3 is to evaluate the cultural appropriateness of our&#xD;
      commonly used measures and research instruments using both qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      methods in Year 02. The remaining Aims evaluate the effectiveness of the Jamaican&#xD;
      Mother-Daughter HIV/STI Risk-Reduction Project through a randomized pilot study. Aim 4A is to&#xD;
      examine whether mothers in the HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention condition show a greater&#xD;
      increase in intentions and actual parenting behaviors (monitoring and PCSC) at 3- and 6-month&#xD;
      follow-ups compared with mothers in the control group. Aim 4B is to examine whether&#xD;
      adolescent girls in the HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention condition show a greater increase&#xD;
      in intentions and reduction in actual sexual risk behaviors (sexual intercourse, unprotected&#xD;
      intercourse, number of sexual partners) at 3- and 6-month follow-ups compared with girls in&#xD;
      the control group. Aim 4C is to examine whether adolescents in the HIV/STI risk-reduction&#xD;
      intervention exhibit a lower incidence of clinically documented STIs at 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      compared with the adolescents in the control condition. Aim 4D is to identify why and how the&#xD;
      mother-daughter HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention works (i.e., mediation of effects). The&#xD;
      mother-daughter intervention is based on a family expansion of the Theory of Planned&#xD;
      Behavior. The intervention is intended to affect the adolescents' sexual risk behaviors&#xD;
      (abstinence, intercourse, unprotected intercourse, condom use, number of partners) by&#xD;
      affecting their behavioral, normative and control beliefs and intentions toward safer sex and&#xD;
      sexual risk behaviors. It is also designed to affect mothers' key parenting behaviors&#xD;
      (monitoring and PTSRC) by affecting their behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, control&#xD;
      beliefs, and intentions toward those parenting behaviors. Parenting behaviors should, in&#xD;
      turn, indirectly affect adolescents' sexual risk beliefs, intentions and behaviors. Thus,&#xD;
      these theoretical mediators will be assessed in order to understand why the intervention is&#xD;
      effective or not. Findings from this study will contribute to the development of effective&#xD;
      HIV/STI risk-reduction programs for Jamaican adolescent girls. Significant information will&#xD;
      also be gained regarding the design of effective family-based interventions, how to partner&#xD;
      with international organizations and communities, and how to develop culturally appropriate&#xD;
      instruments and effective HIV risk-reduction interventions for use with international&#xD;
      populations at highest risk for HIV/AIDS.&#xD;

    <description>The adolescent HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention aims to: (a) increase knowledge of HIV risk and prevention; (b) strengthen behavioral beliefs regarding abstinence and safer sex; (c) increase self-efficacy and intentions to avoid unsafe sex; and (d) increase sexual communication and refusal skills. The mother component includes much of the same prevention knowledge and addresses parent-teen sexual risk communication, monitoring, and sexual role modeling. Interventions are held on two consecutive Saturdays for 6 hours each day. Mothers' groups meet separately from daughters' groups, although the groups will come together for the last module of each day.</description>

    <description>The control / comparison group is essentially a &quot;no intervention / wait-list&quot; control group. However, during pilot testing, participants expressed a strong desire to engage in some type of health activity. As a result, the control group members, both mothers and daughters, participated in a brief educational activity on reducing risk for cardiovascular disease. The educational activity was limited to a few hours on one Saturday. Participants returned the following week to complete post-test questionnaires along with the participants in the experimental group.</description>
