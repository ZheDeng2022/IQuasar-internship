  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The geriatric population is exposed to poly-medication. Furthermore, old people have&#xD;
      important pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic changes that expose to much drug iatrogenic.&#xD;
      Adverse drug effects are a great cause for hospitalization that is why the knowledge of the&#xD;
      complete list of medications taken by the patient is necessary. The poly-medication in&#xD;
      elderly can lead to extremely serious clinical consequences and significant costs. Reference&#xD;
      documents specific to geriatrics guide the doctor in therapeutic choices. On the one hand,&#xD;
      the Laroche's criteria lists all PIM of the French pharmacopoeia in elderly. On the other&#xD;
      hand, STOPP/START criteria are a tool for detect PIM listing inappropriate drugs and criteria&#xD;
      of potentially drug omissions. This has been validated in French language. It is important&#xD;
      that any changes proposed by the geriatrician resulting in just prescription is sustainable&#xD;
      beyond the hospitalization to prevent the recurrence of adverse effects. Effective&#xD;
      community-hospital coordination is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication reconciliation is defined as the formal process of checking the complete, accurate&#xD;
      list of a patient's previous medication - including drug name, dosage, frequency, and route -&#xD;
      and comparing it with the prescription after a transition of care (on admission, after&#xD;
      transfer to another medical unit, and/or at discharge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients will be created, one for which medication reconciliation at discharge&#xD;
      will be practiced and the other a similar process but not standardized. Four to eight weeks&#xD;
      after the discharge, the member of the pharmacy team is calling the usual community pharmacy&#xD;
      to get the first non-hospital prescription by fax and compare the number of PIM with the&#xD;
      prescription before hospitalization.&#xD;
