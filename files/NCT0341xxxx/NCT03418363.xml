  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized study is to learn more about how a supplement called DHEA&#xD;
      (dehydroepiandrosterone) affects clotting factors in women taking combined oral contraceptive&#xD;
      pills. Current research suggests that the progestin hormone in a specific type of birth&#xD;
      control pill may increase a woman's blood clot risk. However, it is unknown exactly how the&#xD;
      progestin causes the increased risk. This study aims to learn if taking a daily dose of&#xD;
      supplemental androgen (dehydroepiandrosterone, or DHEA) in addition to birth control pills&#xD;
      containing DRSP affects proteins related to coagulation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While the pro-thrombotic effects of estrogens are well established in women using combined&#xD;
      oral contraception (COC), controversy exists over whether the various synthetic progestogens&#xD;
      (progestins) used in combination with ethinyl estradiol in COC formulations may modify the&#xD;
      risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Several studies have demonstrated that different types&#xD;
      of progestins used in COCs influence the magnitude of the estrogen-induced changes in&#xD;
      coagulation pathway proteins. However, since hepatocytes do not express progesterone&#xD;
      receptor, any activity of a progestin must be indirect. While all progestins on the market&#xD;
      are strong agonists for the progesterone receptor (PR), most have variable affinity for the&#xD;
      androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).&#xD;
      Generations of progestins have been developed, each successive generation exhibiting&#xD;
      decreasing levels of androgenicity. Recent epidemiologic studies have suggested an increased&#xD;
      risk of VTE in women using low-androgen progestins relative to those using&#xD;
      levonorgestrel-containing products. Although no pattern of hepatic globulin changes has been&#xD;
      validated as a surrogate marker for thrombosis risk, the overall magnitude of change in&#xD;
      various hepatic proteins involved in coagulation is greater with the newer low-androgenic&#xD;
      progestins compared to levonorgestrel, leading some experts to suggest that a progestin's&#xD;
      androgenic profile may influence the risk of thrombosis. However, a series of well-designed&#xD;
      large prospective cohort studies have not confirmed the increased risk of VTE with&#xD;
      low-androgen progestins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major problem with reconciling the conflicting results from epidemiologic and prospective&#xD;
      studies has been the lack of a clear mechanism, as no studies have demonstrated whether these&#xD;
      observed changes are mediated through androgen receptor activity. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      androgen receptor activity opposes the estrogen receptor-mediated increase in hepatic&#xD;
      clotting factors in women using combined oral contraceptives. To test this hypothesis, we&#xD;
      propose a randomized clinical trial in which we will enroll healthy women using combined oral&#xD;
      contraception containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) with an antiandrogenic progestin&#xD;
      (drospirenone, DRSP). Participants will be randomized to treatment with oral androgen&#xD;
      (dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA) or placebo, and we will collect whole blood samples to measure&#xD;
      coagulation pathway-related hepatic globulins (APC-r, Protein S, SHBG) before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
