    <textblock>
      The objective is to establish an evidence base for a hyperhidrosis treatment algorithm in&#xD;
      amputees. This project will address a problem that has troubled Service members, Veterans,&#xD;
      and civilians with amputations for decades, impacting satisfaction with prosthetic use,&#xD;
      residual limb skin health, and negatively affecting quality of life. Prior research in this&#xD;
      area has been limited and insufficient. The Investigators are confident that improving the&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment of residual limb hyperhidrosis will reduce the secondary health&#xD;
      consequences of amputation and will lead to improved quality of life. This will be accomplish&#xD;
      by completing the following specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the validity of the Minor iodine-starch test in amputees. Hypothesis: The&#xD;
      iodine-starch test is a valid diagnostic tool of hyperhidrosis and can be useful for the&#xD;
      identification of focal areas of sweating on a residual limb Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      a prescription strength topical antiperspirant (Aluminum Chloride 20%) on hyperhidrosis of&#xD;
      the residual limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Aluminum Chloride will be more effective at controlling sweating than placebo&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One objective of the Prosthetic Outcomes Research Award (PORA) is to improve the&#xD;
      understanding of secondary health effects on Service members and Veterans who have undergone&#xD;
      limb amputation and to advance the adoption and implementation of evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions. The investigators will address the important secondary health problem of&#xD;
      excessive residual limb sweating (hyperhidrosis) in amputees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful use of a prosthesis requires a stable interface between the residual limb and the&#xD;
      prosthetic socket. Maintaining healthy skin, therefore, is paramount. However, the closed&#xD;
      environment necessary to provide this stable interface also creates an environment that may&#xD;
      lead to a multitude of skin problems. Amputees regularly deal with skin problems such as&#xD;
      sweating, eczematous itching and redness, infections, and mechanical problems such as&#xD;
      blisters and open wounds. Hyperhidrosis is the single most reported problem. Hyperhidrosis is&#xD;
      reported in up to 70% of amputee and is associated with reduced quality of life, reduced&#xD;
      prosthetic fit and function, decreased satisfaction with their prosthesis and skin&#xD;
      irritation. The investigators own published findings reveal that 66% of prosthetic users&#xD;
      (both veteran and civilian) experienced residual limb sweating that interfered with&#xD;
      activities of daily living. Sweating was rated as most bothersome in warm weather or with&#xD;
      vigorous activity, and the efficacy of treatment strategies was generally reported to be&#xD;
      poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the frequency and impact of hyperhidrosis in amputees, there is a lack of evidence&#xD;
      based guidelines for evaluating and treating this problem. A number of knowledge gaps exist,&#xD;
      including no clear standard for assessing the burden of sweating in amputees, and no evidence&#xD;
      base from which to inform treatment decisions for either simple or more elaborate&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no universally accepted standard for assessing the burden and precise location of&#xD;
      sweating in amputee patients. Among the several subjective scales of hyperhidrosis severity&#xD;
      in the dermatology literature, the most commonly used and rigorously validated one is the&#xD;
      Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS). The HDSS provides a qualitative measure for the&#xD;
      severity of the patient's condition based on the extent to which hyperhidrosis affects daily&#xD;
      activities. The HDSS is simple to administer and scored as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Score&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. My sweating is never noticeable and never interferes with my daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. My sweating is tolerable but sometimes interferes with my daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. My sweating is barely tolerable and frequently interferes with my daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. My sweating is intolerable and always interferes with my daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the general hyperhidrosis patient population (non-amputee), the HDSS exhibits moderate to&#xD;
      strong correlations with other quality of life and disease impact metrics, as well as with&#xD;
      gravimetric sweat production. A 1 point improvement on the HDSS correlates with a 50%&#xD;
      reduction in sweat production, while a 2 point improvement correlates with an 80% reduction&#xD;
      in sweat production. The investigators survey data shows the HDSS correlates well with&#xD;
      amputees' perception of the impact of sweating on their prosthesis fit and function, and is&#xD;
      therefore a valid outcome measure in the amputee population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the HDSS gives a global, patient-reported outcome of the significance of hyperhidrosis&#xD;
      in the patient's life, it does not inform the treating clinician on the precise location of&#xD;
      the problem. Dermatologists treating hyperhidrosis of other regions (i.e. axillary, palmar,&#xD;
      plantar) use the Minor iodine-starch test to identify the area of hyperhidrosis in order to&#xD;
      guide subsequent treatments. This test consists of an application of iodine, which is allowed&#xD;
      to dry and then dusted with cornstarch. Sweat will react with the iodine and starch and&#xD;
      produce a black/purple color. While this test is primarily used to identify the areas of&#xD;
      hyperhidrosis, a grading scale has been proposed for test interpretation and monitoring&#xD;
      response to treatments. There is scant literature describing the iodine-starch test in&#xD;
      amputees and the investigators early experience suggests that it is insufficient to simply&#xD;
      apply iodine and starch on a residual limb without then donning the patient's prosthesis. It&#xD;
      appears necessary to recreate the environment that produces the excessive sweating by donning&#xD;
      the prosthesis and ambulating. It is not known, however, what method is safe and effective,&#xD;
      without causing harm to the patient's skin and/or prosthetic materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the scope of the research proposed herein, the investigators have done pilot work&#xD;
      with 9 subjects and 11 amputation sites, utilizing the iodine-starch test under a variety of&#xD;
      conditions to assess which method is most feasible to allow the patient to use their&#xD;
      prosthesis in the test. Preliminary results suggest that plastic wrap is adequate to protect&#xD;
      the prosthesis from significant iodine stain and does not cause new skin irritation, but is&#xD;
      more often viewed as uncomfortable. It also appears to induce a very rapid and diffuse&#xD;
      pattern sweating, raising concern for creating too much of a false positive effect. A&#xD;
      prosthetic sheath appears to protect the liner from dense stain, though some light iodine&#xD;
      stain has been observed to seep onto the liner in some cases. This method, though, is&#xD;
      generally viewed as comfortable to the patient, does not cause new skin irritation, and does&#xD;
      produce a positive test after 10 - 15 minutes of walking in focal areas more consistent with&#xD;
      the patient's described experience with sweat and sweat location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that applying the iodine-starch combination, donning a prosthetic&#xD;
      sheath, the patient's own prosthesis, followed by a period of ambulation is the best method&#xD;
      for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the assessment of hyperhidrosis, treatment guidelines for this problem have not been&#xD;
      rigorously applied to amputees. In the dermatology literature, guidelines recommend using a&#xD;
      topical antiperspirant such as Aluminum Chloride (AlCl) as first line treatment. For axillary&#xD;
      hyperhidrosis, treatment success with AlCl (defined as a post treatment HDSS score of 1, has&#xD;
      varied from 33% to 72% in clinical trials). However, in the amputee population, there are no&#xD;
      published clinical trials describing the effectiveness or tolerability of a topical&#xD;
      treatment, and if it is ineffective or intolerable, when to consider another option such as&#xD;
      botulinum toxin injections, which are generally considered as second line treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators found through a survey that 50% of respondents had tried either an over the&#xD;
      counter or prescription strength antiperspirant. Of those respondents having tried such an&#xD;
      agent, nearly 50% reported them to have no efficacy, and only about 20% reported them to be&#xD;
      completely or mostly effective. Clearly this data has limitations, due to subject recall&#xD;
      bias, and is not the product of an intervention study. It does, however, illustrate that a&#xD;
      majority of amputees may not have satisfactory options to treat this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been a few case reports and/or case series reporting the use of botulinum toxin to&#xD;
      treat this problem in amputees. While these preliminary reports suggest that botulinum toxin&#xD;
      is an effective treatment option, they are limited by the fact that the intervention was&#xD;
      tried on such a small number of patients. Kern et al used botulinum toxin type B (BTX-B) in 9&#xD;
      patients while Charrow et al. used botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) in 8 patients. Both&#xD;
      reported good effectiveness in treating hyperhidrosis but neither utilized a validated method&#xD;
      to determine effectiveness, nor did the subjects fail a topical treatment prior to botulinum&#xD;
      toxin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, there is no published literature describing the best way to localize botulinum toxin&#xD;
      application for amputee hyperhidrosis. In considering the feasibility of widespread adoption&#xD;
      of botulinum toxin as a treatment for amputee hyperhidrosis, one of the biggest barriers&#xD;
      could be the large surface area involved that needs to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermatologists use the iodine-starch test to identify the hyperhidrotric area that will be&#xD;
      targeted with the botulinum toxin injection. For palmar, axillary, and plantar hyperhidrosis,&#xD;
      it is recommended that every patient be assessed with this method. A single case study has&#xD;
      reported the successful use of the iodine-starch test to help identify hyperhidrotic areas on&#xD;
      a residual limb. However, it has not been well studied to know if the iodine-starch test can&#xD;
      be utilized in amputees to identify potential sites for injection, or even if the pattern of&#xD;
      sweating can be demonstrated to be a focal, not a global, problem. If the iodine-starch test&#xD;
      can be used successfully in amputees, it could help direct botulinum toxin injections to a&#xD;
      focused area, rather than an entire residual limb. This could have significant impact on the&#xD;
      overall tolerability of the procedure and the willingness of both patients and providers to&#xD;
      implement it in usual clinical care.&#xD;

    <masking_description>For Aim 1 there will be no masking. Aim 2, recruitment methods will be by convenience sampling. Subjects in Aim 1 reporting an HDSS of 2 or greater and additional subjects as needed from the U of U or VA clinics with HDSS of 2 or greater will be invited to participate in this crossover study. Subjects will be randomized equally to two sequence arms by a random number generator. The first arm will receive in sequential order every 3 weeks: Aluminum Chloride, a placebo of ethyl alcohol base, Aluminum Chloride, and placebo. The second arm will receive in sequential order every 3 weeks: placebo, Aluminum Chloride, placebo, and Aluminum Chloride. Each condition will last for 3 weeks, which will allow enough time for the Aluminum Chloride and placebo to demonstrate their respective effects. The first week of each period will also serve as a sufficient washout for the previous period. The total trial length, then, will be 12 weeks.</masking_description>
