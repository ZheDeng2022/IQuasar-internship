  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study hopes to target the remaining 80% of low risk post-myocardial infarction patients&#xD;
      who have refused uptake the traditional cardiac rehabilitation program In Changi General&#xD;
      Hospital. This is a 6-week home-based Cardiac rehabilitation program enabling patients to&#xD;
      track their blood pressure, physical activity and medicine compliance through a mobile&#xD;
      application. Each patient in the intervention arm is provided with a blood pressure monitor,&#xD;
      activity tracker and a single lead ECG monitor. The data from these devices would be&#xD;
      automatically synced by a mobile application and uploaded to a confidential web portal which&#xD;
      is only accessible by physician care-givers. The application also provides educational&#xD;
      content/tasks, appropriate reminders for taking medications and daily goals on activity&#xD;
      targets set by the care provider. This would help to engage the patients to enable&#xD;
      behavioural change and improve compliance to mediation and activity recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, 50 patients who are randomized to the intervention group (mHealth) will be&#xD;
      enabled with remote monitoring devices (ECG, Blood Pressure, Activity tracker) and &quot;Kardia&quot;&#xD;
      mobile application, for home-based rehabilitation program followed by review in the&#xD;
      outpatient Cardiology clinics. The control group (50 subjects) will just be monitored at&#xD;
      fixed intervals in the outpatient Cardiology clinics. Fu AT 3-4 months &amp; 9-12 months.&#xD;
      Subjects will be advised to commence the exercise program 2 weeks after the myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Block randomization using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes would be used to&#xD;
      assign subjects to the intervention or control arms. The primary outcome measure is&#xD;
      compliance and adherence to the &quot;Kardia&quot; program. Other endpoints include 6MWT, patient&#xD;
      wellbeing and behaviour (e.g. dietary habits, stress levels, physical activity) assessed&#xD;
      using questionnaires, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), modification of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk profiles (i.e. LDL, BP, BMI, HbA1c, etc) and medicine compliance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in Singapore, accounting for&#xD;
      ~34% of deaths. This means 1 in every 3 deaths in Singapore is due to heart disease or&#xD;
      stroke. Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of mortality and accounts for 17% of all&#xD;
      deaths attributable to life-style related risk-factors. The total burden of this disease is&#xD;
      likely to increase given the aging population and the increase in prevalence of obesity and&#xD;
      predisposing conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of modifiable environmental and patient specific factors increase the chance of&#xD;
      developing coronary artery disease. These include smoking, high blood cholesterol, physical&#xD;
      inactivity, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Following myocardial infarction, acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes, surgical and percutaneous interventions, cardiac rehabilitation has&#xD;
      provided an avenue for reducing future cardiovascular risks in patients by positively&#xD;
      influencing these factors. The eventual goal of the program is to engage patients with&#xD;
      permanent behavioural and life-style changes. There is strong evidence for the effectiveness&#xD;
      of cardiac rehabilitation which is given a Class 1 recommendation from the American/European&#xD;
      Cardiology guidelines, particularly for post-myocardial infarction patients. Several studies&#xD;
      and meta-analyses have demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the clear benefits of cardiac rehabilitation programs, the uptake of these programs&#xD;
      has been poor due to various patient and system factors. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are&#xD;
      traditionally carried out in hospitals and health centres under the direct personal&#xD;
      supervision of mentoring clinicians. Patient barriers, such as time constraints and distance&#xD;
      from treatment centres lead to poor uptake of programs among eligible patients. To overcome&#xD;
      these barriers, home-based care models have been proposed as a viable alternative to&#xD;
      hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation programs even in the 1980s. The current state of mobile&#xD;
      phone communication and technology provides not only the capacity but an especially&#xD;
      attractive media option to support home-based cardiac rehabilitation programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate a smartphone-based cardiac rehabilitation program for patients&#xD;
      recovering from myocardial infarction. The program focuses on providing patient centric&#xD;
      self-monitoring platform enabling patients to take control and be actively involved in their&#xD;
      medical care. The program (&quot;Kardia&quot;) is a 6-week rehabilitation program enabling patients to&#xD;
      track their blood pressure, physical activity and medicine compliance through a mobile&#xD;
      application. Each patient in the intervention arm is provided with a blood pressure monitor&#xD;
      and activity tracker. The data from these devices would be automatically synced by a mobile&#xD;
      application and uploaded to a confidential web portal which is only accessible by physician&#xD;
      care-givers. The application also provides educational content/tasks, appropriate reminders&#xD;
      for taking medications and daily goals on activity targets set by the care provider. This&#xD;
      would help to engage the patients to enable behavioural change and improve compliance to&#xD;
      mediation and activity recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Changi General Hospital, the uptake of cardiac rehabilitation among eligible patients is&#xD;
      less than 20%. This study hopes to target the remaining 80% of patients who have refused the&#xD;
      traditional cardiac rehabilitation program. It will be the first time that a smartphone based&#xD;
      home cardiac rehabilitation program would be offered in Singapore. If shown to be safe and&#xD;
      feasible, &quot;Kardia&quot; will help to improve patient outcomes in short to medium term. In&#xD;
      addition, it may empower the patients to take a more active role in their medical care and&#xD;
      promote long lasting behavioural changes in the long term. There will also be a significant&#xD;
      operation impact if &quot;Kardia&quot; can be rolled out as an alternative care model to the&#xD;
      traditional centre-based cardiac rehabilitation program, enabling greater patient access to&#xD;
      &quot;cardiac rehabilitation&quot;. This is also in line with national initiatives to promote an active&#xD;
      and healthy lifestyle, i.e. National Steps Challenge by the Health Promotion Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is a randomized controlled study of smartphone based cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      program compared to routine care in patients who did not sign up for traditional&#xD;
      hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation. 50 patients who are randomized to the intervention&#xD;
      group (mHealth) will be enabled with remote monitoring devices (Blood Pressure and wearable&#xD;
      vital signs monitor, Biovotion) and &quot;Kardia&quot; mobile application, for home-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation program followed by review in the outpatient Cardiology clinics. The control&#xD;
      group (50 patients) will just be monitored at fixed intervals in the outpatient Cardiology&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be advised to commence the exercise program 2 weeks after the myocardial&#xD;
      infarction&#xD;
