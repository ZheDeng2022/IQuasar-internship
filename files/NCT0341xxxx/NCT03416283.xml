  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 3-arm randomized pilot trial aimed at comparing the effectiveness of different remote&#xD;
      approaches to improving blood pressure (BP) control.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to leverage the Way to Health (WTH) platform to develop and evaluate a&#xD;
      new HTN service-delivery model that is integrated with routine clinical care at Penn Family&#xD;
      Care (PFC), an academic family medicine practice in West Philadelphia. Among patients with&#xD;
      poorly controlled HTN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators will assess the effects of monitoring blood pressure and medication&#xD;
           adherence with feedback to the patient and to the clinical practice, as needed if out of&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will also compare the impact of providing feedback to a social support&#xD;
           partner with facilitated cheerleading.&#xD;
