  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of ETC-1907206 in combination with dasatinib in certain types of&#xD;
      blood cancers. The first phase of the study (1A) is designed to find the highest tolerated&#xD;
      dose of ETC-1907206, while the second phase (1B) will assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the recommended dose of ETC-1907206. ETC-1907206 has been designed to block the activity of&#xD;
      an enzyme of the body known as Mnk kinase, which is thought to be involved in the development&#xD;
      of a variety of cancers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts: a Phase 1A dose escalation to identify the MTD and the RD&#xD;
      of ETC-1907206 administered in combination with dasatinib and a Phase 1B expansion at the RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1A: A dose escalation with an adaptive design model using ordinal continual&#xD;
      reassessment method (oCRM) will be used to characterise the dose toxicity curve of&#xD;
      ETC-1907206 when administered orally every other day (EOD) under fasted conditions in&#xD;
      combination with oral once daily dasatinib (per locally approved product prescribing&#xD;
      instructions) in order to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD)&#xD;
      for Phase 1B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1B: Open-label, non-randomised, to assess preliminary clinical activity and safety of&#xD;
      ETC-1907206 administered orally EOD under fasted conditions at the RD identified in Phase 1A,&#xD;
      in combination with dasatinib (per locally approved product prescribing instructions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue in the study until disease progression, the start of new anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapy, unacceptable toxicity, death, or the completion of 12 separate 4-week treatment&#xD;
      cycles, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As long as the Sponsor agrees to continue treatment, patients who complete 12 cycles of&#xD;
      treatment and have no evidence of disease progression are allowed to continue on treatment&#xD;
      past the end of treatment (EOT) visit until there is disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, the patient decides to withdraw, or it is judged not to be in the patient's&#xD;
      interest to continue on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malignancy assessments of the underlying disease at enrolment (blood and bone marrow),&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling&#xD;
      for ETC-1907206 and dasatinib, sample collection for ETC-1907206 and dasatinib biomarker&#xD;
      analysis, and safety and tolerability assessments will be performed during the study.&#xD;

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Is a male patient with sexual partner(s) of childbearing potential who is unwilling to&#xD;
             use a highly effective method of contraception, one of which includes a condom.&#xD;
             Sexually active male patients must use a condom during intercourse throughout the&#xD;
             study and for 12 weeks after the end of treatment and should not father a child in&#xD;
             this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomised males in order to&#xD;
             prevent potential delivery of the study drug via seminal fluid. Female partners of&#xD;
             male patients must be advised to also use one of the following contraception methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  intrauterine device or intrauterine system;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  prior sterilisation; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total abstinence from male/female intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is a female patient of childbearing potential, defined as a female physiologically&#xD;
             capable of becoming pregnant (including a female whose career, lifestyle, or sexual&#xD;
             orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner, and females whose partners have&#xD;
             been sterilised by vasectomy or other means), unless they are using a highly effective&#xD;
             method for birth control throughout the study and for 12 weeks after the end of&#xD;
             treatment. Highly effective methods for birth control include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence: This is an acceptable method when this is consistent with the&#xD;
                  preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,&#xD;
                  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
                  not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilisation: The patient has had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with&#xD;
                  or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks prior to taking study&#xD;
                  drug. In case of an oophorectomy alone, the reproductive status of the patient&#xD;
                  must have been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male partner sterilisation: The patient has the appropriate post-vasectomy&#xD;
                  documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. (For female patients on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  patient.) These patients must also agree to the use an intrauterine device or&#xD;
                  intrauterine system AND a barrier method of contraception: condom or occlusive&#xD;
                  cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam, gel, film, or&#xD;
                  cream, or vaginal suppository. Reliable contraception must be maintained&#xD;
                  throughout the study and for 12 weeks after study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential: The&#xD;
                  definition applies to females who have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous)&#xD;
                  amenorrhoea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history&#xD;
                  of vasomotor symptoms) or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with serum&#xD;
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40 million international units per&#xD;
                  milliliter (mIU/mL) (for US only: and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL) or have had surgical&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  starting treatment. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the patient has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment is&#xD;
                  she considered not of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Is a pregnant or nursing (lactating) female, where pregnancy is defined as the state&#xD;
             of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a&#xD;

             (except for hydroxyurea, steroids, allopurinol, febuxostat, rasburicase, and&#xD;
             intravenous hydration), prior to starting study drug or the side effects of such&#xD;
             therapy have not resolved to Grade ≤1 within 2 weeks prior to starting study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is receiving concomitant anti-cancer therapy (except for hydroxyurea, steroids,&#xD;
             anagrelide, allopurinol, febuxostat, rasburicase, and intravenous hydration during the&#xD;
             first week of the study drug[s] administration, or corticosteroids when appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has used other investigational drugs within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             shorter) prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
