  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well apalutamide works in treating patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer before radical prostatectomy. Androgen can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells.&#xD;
      Hormone therapy using apalutamide may fight prostate cancer by lowering the amount of&#xD;
      androgen the body makes and may make it less likely for patients to receive radiation therapy&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether 6 months (24 weeks) of neoadjuvant apalutamide prior to prostatectomy&#xD;
      for intermediate risk prostate cancer results in a reduction of aggregate pathologic risk&#xD;
      features that drive post-operative radiotherapy recommendations from 35% to 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of 6 months (24 weeks) neoadjuvant apalutamide&#xD;
      followed by radical prostatectomy for intermediate risk prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the frequency of clinical complete responses and &quot;near&quot; complete responses&#xD;
      (currently defined as &lt; 6 mm total tumor volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the molecular features of the treated prostate cancers and link them to&#xD;
      morphologic characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure the 3-5 year biochemical recurrence rate of treated patients as a baseline to&#xD;
      inform a larger phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive apalutamide orally (PO) daily for 24 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2 weeks of completing apalutamide, patients&#xD;
      undergo radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>Aggregate pathologic risk features defined as any of the 3 pathologic staging features on a radical prostatectomy specimen that indicate elevated future risk of a patient needing pelvic radiation therapy. It can be any single or combination of the three. The three drivers per AUA/ASTRO guidelines are positive surgical margins, extraprostatic extension, and/or seminal vesicle invasion. These will be determined by a single expert genitourinary pathologist. The primary objective is to show a 20% decrease in these aggregate pathologic features.</description>
