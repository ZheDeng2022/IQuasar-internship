    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to study the safety and efficacy of anthocyanins in improving key&#xD;
      dementia-related mechanisms and cognitive functioning in older people at risk for dementia.&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will include a variety of biological measures, including biochemistry,&#xD;
      imaging and cardiovascular measures.&#xD;

      Design, Method, Material. Design: This is a randomized, 6-month, placebo-controlled Phase 2&#xD;
      study of anthocyanins (Medox) in people with increased risk for dementia, to explore the&#xD;
      effects of anthocyanins on cognitive performance and a range of biological markers including&#xD;
      blood markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, antioxidants, lipid profile, urine,&#xD;
      faeces, and cardiovascular functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Patients will be randomized (by means of a computerized program) to identically&#xD;
      appearing capsules with Medox or placebo, 1:1 (produced by MedPalett). Patients will undergo&#xD;
      monthly cognitive testing online. Brain MRI, structural and functional, will be performed&#xD;
      before study start and at week 24. FDG-PET will also be done at sudy-start and study-end in a&#xD;
      sub-group. Blood samples for analyses will be drawn at study start, after 12 weeks and at&#xD;
      study end (week 24). Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses, and faeces&#xD;
      analyses and urine will be done at study-start and study end, and additionally at week 12 for&#xD;
      feces and urine. Cardiovascular test inlude cardio ankle vascular index (CAVI), and&#xD;
      photopletysmography (PPG) measurements will be done at study start (baseline) week 2, 6, 12&#xD;
      and at study end (week 24). In a sub-group Flow mediated dilatation of brachial artery (FMD)&#xD;
      will be done at study start, week 12 and study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive assessment battery consists of the CogTrack, an online cognitive test battery&#xD;
      with proven utility, reliability, sensitivity and validity and sensitivity to change. The&#xD;
      battery consists of ten subtests, which, based on factor analysis, are combined into the&#xD;
      following domains: attention, memory and cognitive speed. The 15 word lists of the verbal&#xD;
      memory test have been translated into Norwegian. The primary outcome measure will be the&#xD;
      Quality of Episodic Memory combination of 2 accuracy scores from each of immediate and&#xD;
      delayed word recall, word and picture recognition (4 tasks in total), which has been shown to&#xD;
      be sensitive to cognitive changes . The battery will be administered online monthly at home,&#xD;
      or with assistance from a research associate at SESAM/local research site if Internet is not&#xD;
      available at home. Collection and registration will be performed securely online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be tested at the same time of day on all occasions, usually in the morning.&#xD;
      Testing procedures will be standardized (i.e. temperature, room, research associate, coffee&#xD;
      intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol amendment 17.08.20 Study: A randomized, 24-week parallel-group placebo-controlled&#xD;
      multicenter (Phase 2) study of anthocyanins in people at risk for dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background for amendment Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to disease and even&#xD;
      death within the Wesnes Cognition Ltd and contracted developers supporting the CogTrack&#xD;
      cognitive testing, the maintenance of the CogTrack platform suffered and went fully down in&#xD;
      June 2020. Accordingly participants were unable to access the platform and unable to complete&#xD;
      the cognitive testing as part of the ACID study. A lot of resources were directed towards&#xD;
      correcting the challenges. We have now been able to set up a different but nearly identical&#xD;
      system, eCogPro, as an alternative test system. This system is expected to be ready to be&#xD;
      administered to the participants in late August or early September.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of this inclusion of new participants has stopped, after having randomized 206&#xD;
      participants. There are 27 ongoing participants who have scheduled cognitive testing from&#xD;
      today and until early October. The company producing active and placebo capsules, MedPalett,&#xD;
      has agreed to distribute additional capsules to the remaining participants, enabling them to&#xD;
      continue treatment until the cognitive test platform is up and running. Staff at MedPalett&#xD;
      are unblended to allocation, and based on the study ID list of the remaining participants,&#xD;
      will be able to deliver the correct capsules to study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other assessments, including physical testing and biomarker collection, are now running as&#xD;
      normal, after having been shut down during the midst of the pandemic in April and May.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have not been any safety concerns in the study so far, and no additional safety&#xD;
      procedures will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendment summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are still in the study will continue treatment up to 4 weeks beyond the&#xD;
      scheduled 24 weeks.&#xD;
