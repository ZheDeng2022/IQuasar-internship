  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to histologically and radiographically evaluate the maxillary&#xD;
      sinus bone volume and density, with reference to percentage of vital bone present, after four&#xD;
      months of grafting with either Osteocel or a cortical-cancellous allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the quality and quantity of the maxillary sinus bone prior to the placement of&#xD;
           dental implants and subsequent restorations, approximately 20 patients will be randomly&#xD;
           assigned to receive an augmentation of the maxillary sinus region using either Osteocel&#xD;
           or a cortical-cancellous allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. With the use of pre-operative and four months post-operative CBCT radiography, the&#xD;
           maxillary sinus bone density will be assessed and compared between the individuals&#xD;
           receiving Osteocel and the individuals receiving conventional cortical-cancellous&#xD;
           allograft material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Histomorphometric analysis will be used to assess, compare and contrast the quality and&#xD;
           the quantity of the new vital bone cells generated when using these different graft&#xD;
           materials&#xD;

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned into one of two treatment groups using a&#xD;
      randomization table generated by a computer. The test group (10 sinuses) will receive&#xD;
      Osteocel Plus and control group (10 sinuses) will receive conventional cortical-cancellous&#xD;
      particulate allograft material. The objective of this research is to serve as a pilot study,&#xD;
      gathering information that will guide the design of a larger subsequent study. Little is&#xD;
      known about the distribution of bone quality changes in patients who receive Osteocel Plus&#xD;
      graft to augment the maxillary sinus. Ten subjects per group is reasonable for a pilot study,&#xD;
      providing an 89% probability of estimating the true mean for bone quality and implant&#xD;
      stability to within half a standard deviation in each group. These means, along with the&#xD;
      observed standard deviations and within-subject correlations that the investigators obtain&#xD;
      will prove essential for designing the larger, confirmatory study that constitute the next&#xD;
      phase of this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical radiographic/surgical guide will be fabricated for each patient to be used for&#xD;
      CBCT scan prior to sinus augmentation procedure. The same clinical radiographic/surgical&#xD;
      guide will be used for CBCT scan prior to the implant placement to measure the amount of bone&#xD;
      regeneration following four months of healing at the exact sites. One line will measure the&#xD;
      horizontal width and the other line will measure the vertical height. The horizontal width&#xD;
      will be measured at a vertical height of 10 mm from the sinus floor in the sinus cavity based&#xD;
      on the conventional average length of dental implant used in implant dentistry. The&#xD;
      difference in the measurements for all surgical sites after the grafting procedure and before&#xD;
      the implant placement will provide a clinical assessment of the amount of bone regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty trephined core samples will be retrieved surgically from two areas of the grafted&#xD;
      lateral window at the time of implant placement. One core sample will be retrieved from the&#xD;
      anterior area, approximately 4 mm distal to the anterior tack which was used to fix the&#xD;
      resorbable membrane, and the other one will be retrieved from the posterior area,&#xD;
      approximately 4 mm mesial of the posterior tack which was used to fix the resorbable&#xD;
      membrane. Histomorphometric analysis will be performed on three fields for each section using&#xD;
      specialized software. Volume of vital bone, graft remnants, and connective tissue will be&#xD;
      measured based on the averages of the percentages at a magnification of 63X. Data will be&#xD;
      statistically analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 13.0 for&#xD;
      Windows software) program to compare between test and control groups.&#xD;
