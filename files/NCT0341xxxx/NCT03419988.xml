  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced age is the main risk factor for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. One reason may be due to decreased&#xD;
      resistance to oxidative stress as antioxidant defenses and cell protection is reduced with&#xD;
      aging. This has been shown in animal studies and also that the impairment can be somewhat&#xD;
      restored with exercise. This will be the first study to test this in humans by comparing&#xD;
      young and older inactive adults before and after an exercise intervention, a practical and&#xD;
      cost-effective intervention that can have tremendous public health impact by lowering risk&#xD;
      for disease and medical-related costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced age substantially increases the risk for a host of diseases including cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. A major factor that appears to&#xD;
      underlie this increased risk with age is reduced capacity to resist oxidative injury or&#xD;
      oxidative stress. Therefore, maintaining or increasing the capacity to resist oxidative&#xD;
      stress appears critical to the prevention of age-related disease and promotion of successful&#xD;
      aging. One potential reason for the lower resistance to oxidative stress with age is a&#xD;
      gradual shift in the redox state toward a more oxidized cellular environment potentially&#xD;
      disrupting cell-signaling. Nuclear erythroid-2-p45-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is the master&#xD;
      regulator of antioxidant defenses. Nrf2 drives expression of a host of genes involved in&#xD;
      cellular detoxification and antioxidant defenses. There is strong evidence from animal&#xD;
      studies that Nrf2 signaling is reduced with aging and can be at least partially restored with&#xD;
      moderate exercise training, however the gap in current knowledge is whether these data do in&#xD;
      fact translate to humans. This study will test the following hypotheses in young and older&#xD;
      men and women: i) aging is associated with impaired Nrf2 signaling in response to acute&#xD;
      exercise and ii) moderate exercise training will improve Nrf2 signaling in older, inactive&#xD;
      individuals, and this will increase their resistance to oxidative stress. These hypotheses&#xD;
      will be tested by comparing 25 young (18-28y) and 25 older (≥60y) inactive individuals before&#xD;
      and after an 8-week exercise intervention (n=15 per age group) and in comparison to&#xD;
      non-exercising age-matched control groups (n=10 per age group). Nrf2 signaling will be&#xD;
      measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in response to acute exercise and will&#xD;
      include gene expression (NRF2, NQO1, HO1, GCLC), protein abundance (NRF2, KEAP1, NQO1, HO1,&#xD;
      GCLC) and Nrf2-ARE binding capacity. Resistance to oxidative stress will be measured by&#xD;
      plasma F2-isoprostane response to forearm ischemia/reperfusion. The results will increase&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms of diminished stress resilience with aging and the plasticity&#xD;
      of these pathways. This will determine whether targeting Nrf2 signaling will be effective for&#xD;
      prevention or treatment of these age-related changes which has an enormous public health&#xD;
      impact due to the potential of lowering disease risk and medical costs. An additional&#xD;
      significance of this project is creating opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students&#xD;
      to become involved in research, an important purpose of the Academic Research Enhancement&#xD;
      Award (AREA) program and a mission of Northern Arizona University.&#xD;
