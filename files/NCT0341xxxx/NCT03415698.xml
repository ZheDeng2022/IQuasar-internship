  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, cirrhosis is the fifth commonest cause of mortality. Its natural history is&#xD;
      typified by an initial, largely asymptomatic, &quot;compensated&quot; phase followed by&#xD;
      &quot;decompensation&quot; due to complications of raised portal pressures and hepatocellular&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the only definitive treatment option for cirrhosis is liver transplantation which&#xD;
      is limited in its applicability due to donor shortage, exorbitant costs and lack of&#xD;
      widespread availability. The need for long term immunosuppression and its attendant&#xD;
      complications are a further drawback. The ability of stem cells to differentiate into&#xD;
      multiple cellular lineages makes one speculate that they can be used for tissue repair and&#xD;
      regeneration when tissue-resident stem cells become overwhelmed. Bone marrow derived stem&#xD;
      cells have amazing plasticity. They can &quot;home&quot; to the liver in response to injury and help in&#xD;
      liver regeneration by trans-differentiation, cell fusion and augmentation of tissue- resident&#xD;
      stem cell mediated repair. Two methods are available for the mobilisation of stem cells from&#xD;
      the bone marrow to the liver. One involves the administration of cytokines like&#xD;
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and the other is the isolation of stem cells&#xD;
      from the marrow followed by their injection into the hepatic artery or portal vein after&#xD;
      purification. The latter is probably more cumbersome and may be potentially risky due to the&#xD;
      underlying coagulation abnormalities in cirrhotic patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-CSF has been shown to mobilise bone marrow stem cells and even increase survival in&#xD;
      patients of severe alcoholic steatohepatitis and ACLF. There is conflicting evidence on the&#xD;
      role of G-CSF in decompensated cirrhosis with some studies showing improved survival while&#xD;
      others have shown a lack of clinical or biochemical benefit. Many of these studies have used&#xD;
      a single course of G-CSF. Verma et al, in a recent study published in 2018, elegantly&#xD;
      demonstrated the beneficial effect of multiple courses of G-CSF in improving mortality and&#xD;
      transplant free survival in decompensated cirrhotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators too speculate that multiple cycles of G-CSF could result in better outcomes&#xD;
      in decompensated cirrhosis by causing more prolonged and sustained stem cell homing to the&#xD;
      liver. Thus, this study is being undertaken to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      multiple cycles of G-CSF in decompensated cirrhotics.&#xD;
