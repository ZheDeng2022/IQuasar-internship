    <textblock>
      This randomized, open label, four-way crossover phase I study is to evaluate the food effect&#xD;
      of Ibuprofen CR Tablets 600 mg (IBUCR), and its bioavailability comparison versus 3 doses of&#xD;
      the reference arms including Advil® Ibuprofen Tablets 200 mg (IBUAdv) and Motrin® IB&#xD;
      Ibuprofen Tablets 200 mg (IBUMot) in normal healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll at least 26 evaluable subjects. The duration for test and reference&#xD;
      treatments is 24 to 32 hours with a washout period of at least 5 days after the last dose&#xD;
      administration of study drugs. The total study will take at least 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all eligible requirements for participating in the study will receive all&#xD;
      following interventions according to one of the 4 random sequences by Williams design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One tablet of IBUCR 600 mg under fasting condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One tablet of IBUCR 600 mg under fed condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IBUAdv with a 4-hour dosing interval for 3 tablets (3×200 mg, q4h) under fasting&#xD;
           condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. IBUMot with a 4-hour doing interval for 3 tablets (3×200 mg, q4h) under fasting&#xD;
           condition&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood sampling schedule are described as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -For subjects receiving IBUCR (fed and fasted): Before dose administration (blank) and at&#xD;
      0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, 7h, 8h, 12h, 18h, 24h, 28h, 32h post-dose (A total&#xD;
      of 17 samples per subject)&#xD;
&#xD;
      -For subjects receiving IBUAdv/IBUMot (fasted): Before dose administration (blank) and at&#xD;
      0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h, 3h, 4h, 4.5h, 5h, 5.5h, 6h, 6.5h, 7h, 8h, 8.5h, 9h, 9.5h, 10h,&#xD;
