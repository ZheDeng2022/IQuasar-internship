  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study which aims to identify predictive factors of response to&#xD;
      PD-1 and PD L1 antagonists authorised for use in France in treatment of melanoma, NSCLC, or&#xD;
      HNSCC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 670 patients with melanoma, NSCLC, or HNSCC who are set to receive&#xD;
      treatment with a single-agent PD-1 or PD L1 antagonist regimen as indicated in the respective&#xD;
      European MA or under the conditions of a TAU and according to the standard practices at the&#xD;
      investigational site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be followed for a total of 5 years. Prior to initiation of PD-1 or&#xD;
      PD-L1 antagonist therapy, included patients will undergo a biopsy of a tumour lesion (unless&#xD;
      suitable archived material is available) and provide a blood sample for immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      and genomic studies. Patients at selected participating sites will also be asked to provide&#xD;
      stool and saliva samples (optional). Additional optional biopsy samples may be collected from&#xD;
      consenting patients after 42 (±3) days of PD-1 or PD-L1 antagonist treatment and in the event&#xD;
      of disease progression or recurrence. Additional blood samples will also be collected at&#xD;
      regular intervals throughout the observation period until disease progression, regardless of&#xD;
      whether PD-1 or PD-L1 antagonist treatment is ongoing or has discontinued. Efficacy of&#xD;
      treatment will be evaluated using both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST)&#xD;
      and immune-related RECIST (iRECIST). Information regarding the PD-1 or PD-L1 antagonist&#xD;
      related toxicities, subsequent antineoplastic treatments, and survival status will also be&#xD;
      collected during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An elastic-net approach will be used to identify correlations between different parameters&#xD;
      and develop a signature of response to treatment. For each indication, the patients will be&#xD;
      separated into two cohorts: a 'training' cohort and a 'validation' cohort. The 'training'&#xD;
      cohort will be made up of the first patients included in the indication and will be used to&#xD;
      develop a predictive response score. The 'validation' cohort will include all the remaining&#xD;
      patients. The performance of the predictive score will be tested in this second cohort.&#xD;
