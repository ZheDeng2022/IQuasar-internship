  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2a, open label, multi-centre, safety and efficacy study of glasdegib in&#xD;
      patients with sclerotic cGVHD refractory to second-line treatment. The design for the current&#xD;
      study is a standard 3+3 dose-finding scheme. A dose escalation/de-escalation design will be&#xD;
      applied in successive patient cohorts until identification of MTD. Glasdegib will be&#xD;
      self-administered orally once daily in the morning as monotherapy in continuous 28-day&#xD;
      treatment cycles for a maximum of 24 cycles. Those patients enrolled in the trial that obtain&#xD;
      objective clinical benefit under treatment with glasdegib (defined as the achievement of at&#xD;
      least a partial response at one or more target organs), will be allowed to proceed to a slow&#xD;
      dose withdrawal phase over a period of 6 months after the end of Cycle 24.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three patients will be initially treated at the corresponding dose level of glasdegib at each&#xD;
      dose escalation stage. Dose escalation will be started in a first cohort of 3 patients at a&#xD;
      starting dose of 50 mg (Dose Level 1) and will then proceed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no dose-limiting toxicity is observed among the first 3 patients in a cohort, then 3&#xD;
           additional patients will be treated at the next higher dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a dose-limiting toxicity is observed in 1 of the initial 3 treated patients, 3&#xD;
           additional patients, resulting in a total of 6 patients, will be enrolled and treated at&#xD;
           the same dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no further dose-limiting toxicity is observed (1/6 patients), dose escalation will&#xD;
           continue to the next dose level in a new cohort of 3 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ≥ 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity, then MTD has been exceeded&#xD;
           and the next lower dose of glasdegib will be expanded until a total number of 6 patients&#xD;
           treated at that dose level is reached. If 0 or 1 patient out of 6 experiences a&#xD;
           dose-limiting toxicity, this dose level will be declared MTD. If ≥ 2/6 patients&#xD;
           experience a dose-limiting toxicity, the next lower dose level will be expanded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior safety data evaluation and approval by an independent data monitoring committee&#xD;
           will be required before escalation at each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case that MTD is exceeded within the first cohort, then a -1 Dose Level (25 mg OD) will be&#xD;
      tested. If MTD is exceeded at 25 mg OD, the trial will be stopped and no additional testing&#xD;
      of glasdegib at lower doses will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will continue following the above-specified rules until MTD is declared. Once&#xD;
      MTD is defined, dose expansion at MTD in cohorts of 3 patients will proceed until the&#xD;
      pre-established sample size (20 patients) is reached. In the event that the highest&#xD;
      pre-defined dose (200 mg OD) is tested in two successive cohorts of 3 patients and MTD is not&#xD;
      attained, dose expansion at 200 mg OD will precede until a sample size of 20 patients is&#xD;
      reached. The administered dose level may be subject to further adjustment (dose reduction&#xD;
      only) in the dose expansion phase based on emerging safety, pharmacokinetic or&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional dose levels may be explored, if appropriate, based on emerging safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic data, prior safety data evaluation and approval by an&#xD;
      external monitoring committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are not evaluable for dose-limiting toxicity (e.g., those not receiving at least&#xD;
      80% of the planned dose of glasdegib in the dose-limiting toxicity monitoring period (first 2&#xD;
      cycles) for reasons other than study treatment-related toxicities) must be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the pre-specified sample size is completed before MTD is defined or before the highest&#xD;
      pre-defined dose (200 mg OD) is tested in at least 6 patients, additional patients may be&#xD;
      recruited into the study (for a total sample size of up to 24 patients) until MTD is defined&#xD;
      or two cohorts of 3 patients complete treatment at 200 mg OD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glasdegib may be dose reduced or discontinued during any cycle based on the patient's&#xD;
      individual tolerability. During the dose-escalation phase, once a patient has a dose&#xD;
      reduction for a study drug-related toxicity; the dose will not be re-escalated. Dose&#xD;
      re-escalation up to the MTD will be allowed at the investigator's discretion during the dose&#xD;
      expansion phase.&#xD;
