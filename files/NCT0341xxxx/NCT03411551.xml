      By means of an observer-blinded, randomized controlled trial, the analgesic efficacy of the&#xD;
      forearm intravenous regional anesthesia and the ultrasound guided peripheral nerve block will&#xD;
      be investigated in patients undergoing carpal tunnel release. The hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block is superior compared to the forearm intravenous&#xD;
      regional anesthesia with respect to the analgesic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, pre-, intra-, and post-operative pain will be investigated at several time&#xD;
      points as well as general patient satisfaction and satisfaction of the surgeon regarding the&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Belgium, several ways of anesthesia are used to perform hand surgery, being general&#xD;
      anesthesia, intravenous regional anesthesia as well as locoregional anesthesia. Locoregional&#xD;
      anesthesia and intravenous regional anesthesia are often performed since patients can be&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital more rapidly. A forearm intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA;&#xD;
      mini-Bier's block) is an effective and safe technique to perform hand surgery, especially&#xD;
      since the dose of the used anesthetic is reduced compared to a regular upper arm Bier's&#xD;
      block, leading to a reduced risk of local anesthetic toxicity. An ultrasound-guided distal&#xD;
      peripheral nerve block is often used for hand surgery, in which the nervus medianus and the&#xD;
      nervus ulnaris can be affected locally. Research showed that this technique is associated&#xD;
      with a reduced surgical procedure time when compared to intravenous regional anesthesia (1).&#xD;
      In the Jessa Hospital, a carpal tunnel release is often performed using the forearm&#xD;
      intravenous regional anesthesia. However, to date, the analeptic effectivity of the forearm&#xD;
      intravenous regional anesthesia has not been compared to the distal peripheral nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the analgesic effectivity of the forearm&#xD;
      intravenous regional anesthesia versus the ultrasound-guided distal peripheral nerve block.&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the latter technique is superior. A blinded surgeon will determine the&#xD;
      analgesic effectivity of these techniques (graded as &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot;) and divide&#xD;
      the effectivity in 4 grades. Grade 1 and grade 2 are considered &quot;complete&quot; blockade, while&#xD;
      grade 3 and grade 4 are considered &quot;incomplete&quot; blockade. Grade 1: complete motor and sensory&#xD;
      blockade, grade 2: partial motor blockade but no pain or deep pressure sensitivity, grade 3:&#xD;
      partial motor blockade with mild pain requiring rescue local or opioid analgesia, grade 4:&#xD;
      incomplete motor- and sensory blockade requiring sedation/conversion to general anesthesia).&#xD;
      Secondary study outcomes are patient's pre-, intra-, and post-operative pain scores at&#xD;
      several time points, measured via an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in which number 0&#xD;
      means &quot;no pain at all&quot;, number 5 means &quot;moderate pain&quot; and number 10 means &quot;worst possible&#xD;
      pain&quot;. General patient satisfaction as well as satisfaction of the surgeon regarding the used&#xD;
      technique will be measured via a 7-point Likert Scale, in which number 1 means &quot;extremely&#xD;
      dissatisfied&quot; and number 7 means &quot;extremely satisfied&quot;. Furthermore, the time spend in the&#xD;
      operating room, the time of surgical procedure and the use of post-operative medication use&#xD;
      will be recorded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this monocentric, investigator-initiated, observer-blinded, prospective, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, 2 groups of patients that will undergo carpal tunnel release surgery will&#xD;
      be compared. This study will be performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and will&#xD;
      be approved by the Ethical Committee of the Jessa Hospital before the start of the study. A&#xD;
      written informed consent will be obtained before participation in the study. Randomization&#xD;
      will be performed using a computer-generated random allocation sequence, created by the study&#xD;
      statistician. Allocation numbers will be sealed in opaque envelopes, which will be opened in&#xD;
      sequence by an independent anaesthesiologist who is not involved in the assessment of&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will first receive information about this study during the consultation with the&#xD;
      surgeon. After having ample amount of time to consider participation and before the start of&#xD;
      the study, written informed consent will be obtained. Afterwards, the patient will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the 2 study groups. All anesthesia techniques will be performed by only&#xD;
      2 anaesthesiologists, to reduce the inter-individual difference in anaesthesia. All patients&#xD;
      will receive an intravenous catheter, supplementary oxygen and standard monitoring&#xD;
      (non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram and saturation measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forearm intravenous regional anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous catheter will be placed in the dorsal vein of the hand that will undergo&#xD;
      surgery. Also, a tourniquet will be placed on the forearm, after which the anesthetic can be&#xD;
      administered via the dorsal vein catether (25ml linisol 0.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distal peripheral nerve block:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the distal peripheral nerve block, a General Electric LOGIQe device and a 12 MHz lineair&#xD;
      echotransducer with a foot of 4 cm will be used to locate the nervus medianus and the nervus&#xD;
      ulnaris. In total, 10ml linisol 2% will be used to affect the nerves (3ml linisol 2% around&#xD;
      the nervus medianus, 3ml linisol 2% around the nervus ulnaris and 4ml linisol 2% around the&#xD;
      peripheral distal nerves).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon and the researcher will be blinded for the used type of anaesthesia. To reduce a&#xD;
      possible deblinding, all patients receive a catheter in the dorsal vein of the hand that will&#xD;
      undergo surgery and all patients will receive disinfection on the specific locations on the&#xD;
      arm where the ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block would be performed. In that way, both&#xD;
      surgeon and researcher are blinded. Before the start of the surgery, the surgeon will assess&#xD;
      the quality of the block (primary outcome) in the nervus ulnaris and nervus medianus, using a&#xD;
      forceps. The quality of the block will be graded &quot;complete&quot; (grade 1 and grade 2) or&#xD;
      &quot;incomplete&quot; (grade 3 or grade 4). In case of grade 1 or grade 2, the surgical procedure can&#xD;
      start. In case of grade 3, the blockade will be enhanced (local anesthetic for peripheral&#xD;
      nerve block or intravenous opioid administration (alfentanil or sufentanil) for IVRA). In&#xD;
      case of grade 4, sedation/conversion to general anesthesia will be performed. Per-operative&#xD;
      paracetamol administration 15mg/kg (max 1gram) and taradyl 0.5mg/kg (max 30mg) will be&#xD;
      supplied (except when there are contraindications). All patients (both distal peripheral&#xD;
      nerve block and IVRA) will receive dexamethasone 0.1mg/kg (max 5mg) (except when there are&#xD;
      contraindications) due to the positive effect of dexamethasone on the extension of the&#xD;
      locoregional anesthesia and the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting. All&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures will be investigated by the blinded researcher via questioning the&#xD;
      patient's pain scores (measured via an Numeric Rating Scale) at several time points before,&#xD;
      during and after surgery, and the satisfaction of both patient and surgeon (measured via a&#xD;
      7-point Likert Scale). Post-operative pain medication in the hospital includes paracetamol&#xD;
      15mg/kg (max 1gr) 1x/6h and taradyl 0.5mg/kg (max 30mg) 1x/8h, while contramal serves as&#xD;
      rescue medication. Post-operative pain medication at home includes paracetamol 15mg/kg (max&#xD;
      1gr) 1x/6h or ibuprofen 600mg 1x/8h whenever necessary. On day 1 after surgery, the patient&#xD;
      will be contacted via telephone by the researcher who will question the use of post-operative&#xD;
      pain medication, as well as NRS pain scores and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was determined for the primary study outcome with the aim to reject the&#xD;
      superiority of the distal peripheral nerve block compared to forearm intravenous regional&#xD;
      anesthesia. Based on a retrospective analysis of unpublished data from our hospital, we&#xD;
      assume that 75% of patients will have a complete block (grade 1 or2) after a forearm IVRA.&#xD;
      Based on a previous study, we assume that 95% of patients will have a complete block (grade 1&#xD;
      or 2) after a distal peripheral nerve block (2). By using a binary outcome, we determined the&#xD;
      sample size for each group to be 47 (α=0.05, power=0.80). To account for a possible 6%&#xD;
      drop-out rate, the sample size was increased to 50 patients per group. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      will be presented as frequencies and percentages of the total amount of patients for&#xD;
      categorical variables, while numerical variables will be presented as mean ± SD. Group&#xD;
      comparison will be performed using Chi-square test (or a Fisher's Exact test when necessary)&#xD;
      for frequencies. Depending on normality, a Mann-Witney U test or a Student's t-test will be&#xD;
      used and a Mixed-model analysis will be used to correct for the multiple measurements of the&#xD;
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain scores. An average difference of 1.3 points or more on&#xD;
      the NRS pain score is considered clinical relevant. A p-value &lt;0.05 is considered statistical&#xD;
      significant, while p&lt;0.10 is considered a tendency.&#xD;
