      The aim of the project is to assess the efficacy of Adjunctive Selective Estrogen Receptor&#xD;
      Modulators (Raloxifene) on Negative and Cognitive symptoms of Schizophrenia in Postmenopausal&#xD;
      Women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For postmenopausal women with schizophrenia, current research suggests that these people can&#xD;
      be treated with estrogen, which can reduce cardiovascular and reproductive tissue problems,&#xD;
      help sleep and improve mood. In addition, cognitive problems in this group of people can also&#xD;
      be helped. Raloxifene is a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM), which means that it&#xD;
      can affect the central nervous system (CNS) effects of estrogen (eg. improving emotional&#xD;
      symptoms, memory, information processing and concentration), without adversely affecting&#xD;
      reproductive tissue/organs such as breast, uterus and ovaries. The investigators are&#xD;
      conducting a double-blind, placebo controlled, 12 weeks study comparing the negative symptoms&#xD;
      and cognitive functions in postmenopausal women with schizophrenia in both groups. One group&#xD;
      will receive clozapine plus 60mg Raloxifene (Usage: take 60mg Raloxifene tablets half an hour&#xD;
      after breakfast every day, that is, take 1 tablet a day), while the second group will receive&#xD;
      clozapine plus oral placebo (Usage: take 1 placebo half an hour after breakfast every day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Adjuvant raloxifene therapy in postmenopausal women with schizophrenia can&#xD;
      improve negative symptoms, as measured on the rating scales, compared with the women&#xD;
      receiving adjunctive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The cognitive function of postmenopausal female schizophrenic patients treated&#xD;
      with raloxifene would be better than that of the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: That the Raloxifene group has less adverse reactions in postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a mental illness with unknown cause and difficult treatment which the global&#xD;
      lifetime prevalence rate of about 1%. The core symptoms of schizophrenia include positive&#xD;
      symptoms, negative symptoms, and impairment of cognitive function. Positive symptoms in most&#xD;
      patients after antipsychotic treatment can significantly alleviate after antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment, but negative symptoms and cognitive deficits persist. Unfortunately, the long-term&#xD;
      prognosis and social function of patients mainly depend on the degree of the rehabilitation&#xD;
      of negative symptoms and cognitive function. At present, clinical research domestic and&#xD;
      overseas on the negative symptoms and cognitive function gradually increased, but end up with&#xD;
      the poor consistency of research results. The reason is various, but in any case, improving&#xD;
      the treatment strategy is still very important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological data suggest that the age of onset of female schizophrenia is later than men,&#xD;
      most of which are onset abruptly, and females have higher susceptibility to mental illness&#xD;
      and relapse during the two important periods with hormonal changes. The first is in the&#xD;
      postpartum, menopause is the second. It may be related to the lack of estrogen function.&#xD;
      Therefore, we believe that the onset and symptoms of some female patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      are related to the dysfunction of estrogen. Many studies abroad have found that estrogen and&#xD;
      selective estrogen receptor modulators have significant effects on female patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, especially on negative symptoms and cognitive functions, but the clinical&#xD;
      application is limited due to the potential side effects of estrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raloxifene is the second generation of selective estrogen receptor modulator, for the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, which can significantly&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of vertebral fractures. The common adverse drug reaction is slight&#xD;
      increase in hot flash and leg cramps, and the most serious adverse drug reaction is venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism. Past research has found that raloxifene can reduce the risk of decline in&#xD;
      memory and attention, and taking raloxifene helps sleep. Current research suggests that as an&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy, it can improve symptoms of menopausal women with schizophrenia (emotional&#xD;
      symptoms, memory, information processing and storage), and will not negatively affect&#xD;
      reproductive tissues or organs, such as breast, uterus and ovary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the domestic and overseas research results, and based on the theoretical&#xD;
      background of schizophrenia in estrogen insufficiency, we proposed randomized double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study, in order to understand the effect of raloxifene on negative&#xD;
      symptoms and cognitive function in adjuvant treatment of menopausal female patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, meanwhile assess the adverse reactions after the treatment, provide the basis&#xD;
      for clinical treatment of schizophrenia patients with negative symptoms and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
