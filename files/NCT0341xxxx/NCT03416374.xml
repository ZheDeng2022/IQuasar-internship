  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of long-term&#xD;
      administration of the oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib as part of ixazomib in combination&#xD;
      with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRd) therapy in patients with relapsed and/or refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (RRMM) treated initially with an injectable proteasome inhibitor-based&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have RRMM. This study will look at the effectiveness and safety of IRd in&#xD;
      participants with RRMM previously receiving an injectable proteasome inhibitor-based therapy.&#xD;
      This study consists of two treatment periods, Treatment Period I and Treatment Period II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 47 patients. All participants will receive following treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Combination therapy with Bortezomib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (VRd) or combination&#xD;
      therapy with Carfilzomib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (KRd), standard recommended dose&#xD;
      according to the package insert of each drug, as Treatment Period I, followed by Combination&#xD;
      therapy with Ixazomib 4.0 mg + Lenalidomide 25 mg + Dexamethasone 40 mg (IRd) as Treatment&#xD;
      Period II&#xD;
&#xD;
      At start of this study, combination therapy of VRd or KRd will be decided by investigator as&#xD;
      Treatment Period I after the baseline evaluations. After the start of Treatment Period I, a&#xD;
      participant's eligibility for Treatment Period II is then determined 3 cycles. Participants&#xD;
      who meet these eligibility criteria II subsequently continue into Treatment Period II and&#xD;
      receive IRd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. It is anticipated that the treatment&#xD;
      phase of this study will last up to 39 months, including 18 months for enrollment.&#xD;
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic in treatment period, and follow-up&#xD;
      period including a follow-up assessment after last dose of study drug.&#xD;

EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 28 questions (4-point scale where 1=Not at all [best] to 4=Very Much [worst]) and 2 questions (7-point scale where 1=Very poor [worst] to 7= Excellent [best]). Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status/QOL scale, higher scores represent better QOL; for the symptom scales, lower scores represent better QOL.</description>
