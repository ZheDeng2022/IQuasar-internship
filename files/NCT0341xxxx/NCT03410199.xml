    <textblock>
      Aortocaval compression by the gravid uterus during the third trimester contributes to&#xD;
      decreased venous return to the heart. Neuraxial anesthesia reinforces this hypotension by&#xD;
      causing a vasodilatation and venous pooling of blood in the lower limbs. The current practice&#xD;
      is to tilt the parturient 15 degrees on the operating table after neuraxial anesthesia in&#xD;
      order to decrease this hypotension. Recent meta-analysis suggests there is no conclusive&#xD;
      evidence to support the tilt position. The goal of our study is to compare ultrasound vena&#xD;
      cava variation measurements in the supine versus the tilt position in third trimester&#xD;
      parturients undergoing elective cesarean delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery (CD) is one of the most currently practiced surgeries in the world. In&#xD;
      2013, surgical deliveries represented 32.4% of births in the United States and 26.9% in&#xD;
      Canada. Maternal hypotension is a frequent adverse event during CD under spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      and can be detrimental to the fetus and mother. Many means have been studied to decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of hypotension in this context such as crystalloid/colloid pre-loading and&#xD;
      co-loading, vasopressors, and positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortocaval compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) by the gravid uterus is a major&#xD;
      contributor to this hypotension and many positions on the operating table have been&#xD;
      researched to decrease its influence.Current recommendations for term women undergoing&#xD;
      cesarean delivery include left lateral 15 degree tilt in order to reduce aortocaval&#xD;
      compression which may cause maternal hypotension and fetal compromise. However, a recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis did not show conclusive evidence to favour the tilted versus the supine&#xD;
      position. This is probably due to a compensatory mechanism involving venoconstriction of the&#xD;
      lower limbs, raising venous pressure and causing flow through collateral channels. Supine&#xD;
      hypotensive syndrome with clinically significant effects occurs in 8-10% of women at term,&#xD;
      possibly due to less compensatory mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory variations of the IVC diameter measured by an ultrasound may determine the best&#xD;
      position on the operating table for term parturients during cesarean delivery. Large&#xD;
      variations of IVC diameter during expiration and inspiration have been shown to be related to&#xD;
      hypotension in non-pregnant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of our project is to compare the collapsibility index of the inferior&#xD;
      vena cava during elective cesarean delivery after the administration of spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      with a phenylephrine infusion. Each participant will be their own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients scheduled for elective cesarean delivery will be included. Each participant will&#xD;
      be her own control for the ultrasound measurements of the inferior vena cava, with and&#xD;
      without a tilt before and after spinal anesthesia with a phenylephrine infusion. A&#xD;
      transcutaneous oximetry monitor (NIRS) will be used in order to measure the upper versus&#xD;
      lower body saturation difference. The newborn Apgar score and umbilical cord pH will be&#xD;
      noted.&#xD;
