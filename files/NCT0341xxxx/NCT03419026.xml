  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer, the first female cancer, affects one in eight women in her lifetime. The&#xD;
      increase and uneven distribution of its prevalence throughout the world cannot be fully&#xD;
      explained either by the increase in life expectancy, or by genetic factors present in less&#xD;
      than 10% of cases, or by early detection, or by the use of hormone therapy for menopause at&#xD;
      certain periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous experimental and epidemiological arguments, as well as the increased risk of breast&#xD;
      cancer in women after 50 years of age who were exposed in utero to Distilbene prescribed for&#xD;
      their mothers in the 1950s to 75's, suggest the involvement of environmental factors involved&#xD;
      in early development (nutrition, alcohol, tobacco, chemical pollutants) that may act as&#xD;
      endocrine disruptors, estrogenomimetic or intervening on other nuclear receptors such as the&#xD;
      However, the formal demonstration of the deleterious physiopathological role of such exposure&#xD;
      comes up against methodological difficulties in epidemiological terms: first of all, the fact&#xD;
      that correlation is sought at the time of the discovery of breast cancer when there are&#xD;
      critical windows of exposure (fetal, perinatal, peripubertal and pregnant) and that&#xD;
      persistent organic products or POPs, most often lipids, are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to correlate the per-gravidic exposure to POPs (dioxins,&#xD;
      dioxinlike, polychlorinated bisphenyls, organochlorine pesticides and flame-retardant&#xD;
      polybrominated derivatives) and the development, within 15 years of delivery, of breast&#xD;
      cancer, taking into account the confounding factors of classical breast cancer risk (age,&#xD;
      reproductive events, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project benefits on the one hand from a cord blood bank set up between 2002 and 2005&#xD;
      (6,242 samples) carried out at the Nice University Hospital and the Grasse University&#xD;
      Hospital, during a PHRC and on the other hand from the cancer observatory / CRISAP of the&#xD;
      PACA Corsica region, exhaustive to more than 92% since 2005, registers which will be&#xD;
      cross-referenced and whose cancer cases (N) will be compared to controls. The assays will be&#xD;
      carried out after purification, using high-resolution mass spectrometry gas chromatography&#xD;
      coupling, the quantification being carried out according to the principle of isotopic&#xD;
      dilution. They will be carried out by LABERCA in Nantes, the national reference laboratory of&#xD;
      the French Health Agencies ANSES and INVS and also involved in various European projects.&#xD;
      Concentrations related to blood lipids will be expressed in quartile and analyzed separately&#xD;
      or combined with a cumulative score taking into account confounding risk factors for breast&#xD;
      cancer and the geolocation of the initial and final residence in relation to the incinerator&#xD;
      of the City of Nice (Department of Public Health CHU of Nice).&#xD;

      of the City of Nice (Department of Public Health CHU of Nice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of such a protocol requires a preliminary feasibility phase, which is the&#xD;
      subject of this AOI request and which will depend on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sending a letter to the 6242 mothers whose sera (derived from cord blood) are stored in&#xD;
           the bank set up between 2002 and 2005 in order to&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Verify that they still live in the PACA region&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. confirm their willingness to participate in this study on the exposure/emergence&#xD;
                relationship of breast cancer by serum assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (c) indicate whether they agree to be part of the follow-up cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determination, by crossing the two registers (cord blood bank) and cancer register /&#xD;
           CRISAP, of women who gave birth at the Nice University Hospital or at the Grasse&#xD;
           University Hospital of a boy between 2002 and 2005 and who developed breast cancer in&#xD;
           the next 13 years (considered N cases); who have not developed breast cancer and will be&#xD;
           matched for age and date of delivery (controls 2N).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determination of their gynaecological characteristics, breast cancer risk factors and&#xD;
           cancer characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will then continue beyond the AOI, through the determination of dioxins,&#xD;
      dioxins-like, PCBs and brominated derivatives in the context of specific funding, and the&#xD;
      analysis of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These privileged conditions should make it possible, by resolving some of the methodological&#xD;
      difficulties inherent in the environmental epidemiology of cancers, to provide information on&#xD;
      the possible role of exposure to persistent organic products during critical periods, such as&#xD;
      pregnancy in the occurrence of breast cancer, and to justify preventive measures and the&#xD;
      development of new predictive risk factors.&#xD;
