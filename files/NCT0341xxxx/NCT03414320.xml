  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adoption of bolus calculators has been limited by the slow speed of the current trial and&#xD;
      error approach. The goal of this project is to automate the determination of patient specific&#xD;
      insulin pump parameters based on current automatic electronic logbooks of glucose&#xD;
      measurements, carbohydrate intake, and insulin usage, by means of a mathematical model. More&#xD;
      specifically, the investigators are interested in computing the carbohydrate to insulin ratio&#xD;
      (CIR) and insulin sensitivity factor (ISF), which are the main parameters of bolus&#xD;
      calculators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a proof-of-concept, open label, single arm clinical trial to validate&#xD;
      the new method and refine both the mathematical model and the numerical techniques in&#xD;
      well-regulated and disciplined type 1 diabetic subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a &quot;trial&quot; of the selected underlying mathematical model and the associated&#xD;
      algorithms to simulate the glucose values of a patient with uncertain meal-data.&#xD;

      After signing informed consent and checking eligibility criteria participants will receive&#xD;
      uniform education related to self-monitoring of blood glucose and continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring (CGM) using the CGM sensor as well as on the bolus calculator (BC). The study will&#xD;
      take three weeks (or three sensors) per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should live a close to normal life and should participate in their normal daily&#xD;
      activities. During the study, patients must consequently keep using the BC of their insulin&#xD;
      pump, record in the insulin pump when they eat extra food outside their regular meals and&#xD;
      when they inject extra insulin without the use of their insulin pump. Faulty 'meal markers'&#xD;
      have to be noted in a booklet and patients will also have to take pictures of their plate for&#xD;
      each meal or record their meals in detail in a booklet. Patients should also consequently&#xD;
      shut off insulin delivery when they disconnect their insulin pump and write it down in a&#xD;
      booklet. The patients will be asked to wear an activity tracker (i.e. Fitbit), this data will&#xD;
      help in the refinement of the model and will be used for research later in the same project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, patients must skip a total of three meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner (not&#xD;
      on the same day, but within the three weeks). This gives the investigators a period of&#xD;
      measurements in which they know that there are no significant amounts of unpredictable&#xD;
      carbohydrates in the blood. Patients can give correction insulin or take extra fast&#xD;
      carbohydrates to correct the glycaemia when needed and record this in the insulin pump or in&#xD;
      a booklet. The fast rescue carbohydrates should be in the form of Dextro energy tablets&#xD;
      (provided by the study team).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the three weeks, patients will come back to the hospital where the study team will&#xD;
      download data from the insulin pump, CGM sensor, and activity tracker. The booklet and&#xD;
      photographs of the meals will be handed over to the study team. This is the end of the study&#xD;
      for the patient. The collected patient data will further be used to assess the model fit of&#xD;
      the chosen mathematical model as in, i.e. the investigators evaluate how well the model is&#xD;
      able to reproduce the collected data.&#xD;
