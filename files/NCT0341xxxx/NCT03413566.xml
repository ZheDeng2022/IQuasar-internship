  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have reported that the prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP) has been relatively&#xD;
      stable and is mainly due to events before birth and therefore cannot be prevented. However,&#xD;
      these studies were undertaken in populations born towards the end of the last century. There&#xD;
      has since been significant improvement in both obstetrical and neonatal intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim is to investigate trends in the prevalence and clinical characteristics of&#xD;
      children with CP in Norway born from 1996 to 2010 in order to gain a modern understanding of&#xD;
      the panorama of CP in Norway. The investigators suspect that improved methods of obstetrical&#xD;
      and neonatal care introduced in Norway during the last 20 years has resulted in a decrease in&#xD;
      the prevalence of CP as well as in the proportion of children with severe CP subtypes and&#xD;
      comorbidities. The long term aim is to improve the quality of pregnancy care and newborn&#xD;
      medicine for children at risk of CP, and to ensure equal diagnostics and treatment of&#xD;
      patients with CP, regardless of place of residence in Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this project, the investigators will use data from three national health registers: The&#xD;
      Cerebral Palsy Registry of Norway (CPRN), The Medical Birth Registry of Norway and The&#xD;
      Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR). The use of data from these high quality health registries&#xD;
      provides us with a unique opportunity to study our aims on a population level, as well as per&#xD;
      health region/health trust.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of permanent motor disabilities in children, and&#xD;
      one of the patient groups that receive the largest proportion of health care resources in&#xD;
      high-income countries. CP is the result of a non-progressive injury in the immature brain&#xD;
      that occurs before, during or after birth (neonatal period). The injury may be caused by a&#xD;
      congenital brain abnormality, infection, trauma or other complications. Known risk factors&#xD;
      include premature birth, restricted fetal growth and lack of oxygen during birth (birth&#xD;
      asphyxia). Research shows that the panorama of causes has changed over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical characteristics of CP vary considerably, something one would expect from the&#xD;
      variation in potential causes. CP is categorized into subtypes based on the dominating&#xD;
      symptoms and which part of the body is affected. Further classification is often based on the&#xD;
      severity of the child's motor impairment. Also, children with CP often have additional&#xD;
      comorbidities such as epilepsy, impaired vision and/or hearing, impaired ability to&#xD;
      speak/communicate, cognitive disorders, and nutritional problems. Nor in these areas has the&#xD;
      situation remained static over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last 20 years, both obstetric and neonatal care has undergone significant changes&#xD;
      in Norway as well as in other countries. In the 1990s surfactant treatment of premature&#xD;
      children was established, and in the early 2000s, therapeutic hypothermia was introduced as a&#xD;
      new treatment for term born children with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). There have&#xD;
      also been improvements in fetal monitoring during labor from around 2004 with an increase in&#xD;
      the use of continuous electronic monitoring of the fetal heart using either the&#xD;
      cardiotocography (CTG) or ST analysis (STAN) method to assess the baby's well-being, as well&#xD;
      as Fetal scalp pH testing to determine if the baby is getting adequate oxygen supply. In this&#xD;
      project, the investigators intend to study if the introduction of these new treatments has&#xD;
      been associated with a decrease in the prevalence of CP and in changes in the clinical&#xD;
      picture (e.g. less serious motor disabilities and comorbidities) for children born 1996 to&#xD;
      2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study these questions, the investigators will take advantage of data from three national&#xD;
      health registers: The Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN), The Norwegian Patient Registry&#xD;
      (NPR) and The Cerebral Palsy Registry of Norway (CPRN). While the MBRN has recorded all&#xD;
      births since 1967, the NPR has recorded all patients treated in special health care service&#xD;
      since 1997 and with their national identification numbers since 2008. All children with CP&#xD;
      are diagnosed and their treatment assessed at pediatric habilitation centers, reporting to&#xD;
      the NPR. The CPRN is a national medical quality register, owned by the South-Eastern Norway&#xD;
      Regional Health Authority, and is located at the Vestfold Hospital Trust. Participation in&#xD;
      the CPRN is based-on parental informed consent. This register has systematically recorded&#xD;
      children with CP born since 1996, and has received high scores by The Norwegian Advisory Unit&#xD;
      for Medical Quality Registries (SKDE). Moreover, the investigators have recently documented&#xD;
      completeness and correctness of CP diagnoses in the CPRN as well as in the NPR. Thus, the use&#xD;
      of data from these three high quality health registries provides a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      study on a population level if the new obstetric and neonatal treatment options have been&#xD;
      followed by measurable reductions in the prevalence of CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the Cerebral Palsy Registry of Norway is to increase knowledge of the causes&#xD;
      and treatment of children and youths with CP through surveillance and systematic analyses,&#xD;
      including to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the prevalence of CP in Norway, including subtypes, severity and comorbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the quality of pregnancy care and newborn medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ensure equal treatment and follow-up of children/youths with CP in Norway, regardless of&#xD;
           place of residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase knowledge of CP&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study fulfills all of these aims, and also has the potential to go one step further and&#xD;
      impact children at risk for CP. By gaining better knowledge of children with CP in Norway&#xD;
      during this study period, the investigators can explore variations in the causes and&#xD;
      treatments for newborns at increased risk of CP and children with CP, per health region&#xD;
      and/or per health trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall design of this project is a register-based population study, comprising of three&#xD;
      sub-studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: Completeness and correctness of the CPRN and NPR There was a variation in the&#xD;
      reported prevalence of CP in Norway from different data sources used to identify children&#xD;
      with CP. The aim of this study was thus to combine data sources and to validate the CP&#xD;
      population in Norway for children born 1996-2007, and thereby gain an accurate estimate of&#xD;
      the prevalence rate of CP in Norway. This study was published in March 2017. A second&#xD;
      validation study of CP diagnoses for children born 2007-2010 and registered in the CPRN&#xD;
      and/or NPR was completed in January 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Trends in prevalence, causes, diagnostics and clinical characteristics of children&#xD;
      with cerebral palsy born in Norway 1999 to 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be to examine whether there has been a decrease in the prevalence&#xD;
      of CP and changes in the clinical picture (e.g. less serious motor disabilities and&#xD;
      comorbidities) following new standardized methods of obstetrical care, such as fetal&#xD;
      monitoring during labor, as well as of intensive care of sick newborns introduced in Norway&#xD;
      during the last 20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for 707 916 children born in Norway between 1999 and 2010 have been registered in the&#xD;
      MBRN. Of these, 1664 children have been confirmed to have CP and are registered in the CPRN.&#xD;
      A data linkage of the MBRN and CPRN was performed in February 2017. The MBRN includes data on&#xD;
      a number of well-known and unknown risk factors for CP (e.g. length of pregnancy, Apgar&#xD;
      scores, congenital malformations, intrauterine growth retardation, etc.). The CPRN contains&#xD;
      information on the clinical picture of CP at five years of age (gross, fine and oral motor&#xD;
      function, cognition, epilepsy, eating abilities, and magnetic resonance imaging findings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression using fractional polynomials will be used to estimate time trends in&#xD;
      prevalence rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI), according to Altman et al. Differences&#xD;
      in proportions of clinical characteristics will be analyzed by χ2 linear-by-linear&#xD;
      association or Cochran-Armitage test for trends. A p-value below 0.05 is considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis began in early 2017, and an article is currently being finalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3: CP and comorbidities Data from the NPR will be used, including administrative&#xD;
      (treating institution, consultation and/or hospitalization, patient place of residence) and&#xD;
      medical (diagnosis and treatments codes) and social (housing situation and care situation)&#xD;
      data on all children born 1996-2010 that have received treatment in specialist health&#xD;
      services since 2008. Children with CP will be compared to children without a CP diagnosis.&#xD;
      The main aim of this study will be to describe frequencies of comorbidities that occurred&#xD;
      before and after children are diagnosed with CP. Logistic regression analyses will be used to&#xD;
      compare children with CP to the general population. This study is a follow-up study in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Norwegian National Institute of Public Health, which recently&#xD;
      published a study on Comorbidity and Childhood Epilepsy: A Nationwide Registry Study.&#xD;
