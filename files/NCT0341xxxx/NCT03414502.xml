    <textblock>
      This is a 16-week, open-label study to identify factors that help predict clinical responses&#xD;
      to DMARD therapies for RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) patients. All patients will receive a&#xD;
      starting dose of DMARD medication(s) which may be adjusted by the investigator as needed. If&#xD;
      a subject becomes intolerant to a DMARD medication the subject will be withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study at the discretion of the investigator. Visits (prior to week 16) where withdrawal is&#xD;
      determined to be necessary will be considered end of study. End of study data (week 16) as&#xD;
      well as study serum will be collected. (Serum only collected on those subjects who have&#xD;
      consented to the addendum Serum and DNA of this study). A portion of the blood collected at&#xD;
      baseline, week 8 and week 16 with the addendum portion of the study is for future research&#xD;
      and will be utilized attempting to look to detect the generation of superoxide radicals. The&#xD;
      radicals have been shown to be associated with inflammation and may correlate with the&#xD;
      progression of RA. If this is true, then treatment with RA should decrease the levels of&#xD;
      these radicals signaling response to treatment.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to gather, in a prospective manner, information on patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and their response to DMARD therapy. Specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. To evaluate the efficacy of DMARD therapy as defined by attaining ACR 50 response after 16&#xD;
      weeks of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. To identify predictors of DMARD response in patients with RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the presence of certain genetic factors such as the shared epitope predict DMARD&#xD;
           response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the presence of serological factors (e.g. ccp (cyclic citrullinated peptide)&#xD;
           isotypes) predict DMARD response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does evidence of co-morbid conditions (e.g. periodontal disease) predict DMARD response&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 400 RA patients will be consented for this protocol. Subject accrual for&#xD;
      protocol v1.0 included UNMC (University of Nebraska Medical Center) and the RAIN (Rheumatoid&#xD;
      Arthritis Investigational Network) sites. Subject accrual for protocol v2.0 will be derived&#xD;
      exclusively from UNMC. Investigators have examined the discriminatory characteristics of&#xD;
      several clinical and biologic parameters in predicting treatment response (at least 50%&#xD;
      improvement based on ACR criteria) in initial analyses involving 54 participants with early&#xD;
      RA treated with methotrexate monotherapy in past RAIN clinical trials. In the initial&#xD;
      analyses, factors showing discriminatory characteristics have included rheumatoid factor (RF)&#xD;
      isotypes (particularly IgA (Immunoglobulin A) and IgM (Immunoglobulin M), matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, HLA-DRB1 (human leukocyte antigen-DR isotope) shared epitope&#xD;
      (SE)-containing alleles, C-reactive protein, and interleukin (IL)-1. For instance, we have&#xD;
      found that subjects with low serum concentrations of RF-IgM (&lt; 27 IU/ml) are more likely to&#xD;
      be non-responders than those with higher (&gt; 27 IU/ml) serum concentrations (79% vs. 43%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and females will participate in this protocol. As RA is approximately three times more&#xD;
      common in females, it is anticipated that a higher percentage of the study subjects will be&#xD;
      female. Subjects will be &gt; 19 years of age. This age range was chosen because the age of&#xD;
      majority in Nebraska is 19. RA diagnosed before the age of 19 may not have the same disease&#xD;
      characteristics as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criterion for RA.&#xD;
      Pediatric subjects will not be enrolled in this study. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs in all&#xD;
      races. No enrollment restrictions have been based on race or ethnic origin.&#xD;
