  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called Carboplatin with or without another study drug,&#xD;
      Nivolumab as a possible treatment for triple-negative breast cancer that has spread to other&#xD;
      parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carboplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab for your specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved carboplatin as a&#xD;
      treatment option for your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well carboplatin, by itself, or&#xD;
      together with nivolumab, works in treating breast cancer that has spread to other parts of&#xD;
      the body. Nivolumab is a recently discovered human monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a type&#xD;
      of protein that your immune system (the system that defends your body against potentially&#xD;
      harmful particles) uses to find and destroy foreign molecules (particles not typically found&#xD;
      in your body, such as bacteria and viruses). Scientists can now make antibodies in the&#xD;
      laboratory and produce them for the treatment of many different diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab works by attaching to and blocking a molecule called PD-1. PD-1 is a different&#xD;
      molecule that can turn off the immune system by interacting with PD-L1 on the cancer cell.&#xD;
      Nivolumab has been shown in research studies to prevent PD-1 from shutting down the immune&#xD;
      system, thus allowing it to recognize and help your body destroy the cancer cells. You are&#xD;
      being asked to participate in this study because triple-negative breast cancer has shown&#xD;
      elevated rates of PD-L1 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab has been used in other research studies and information from those research studies&#xD;
      suggests that nivolumab may help shrink or stabilize your triple negative breast cancer in&#xD;
      this study&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast&#xD;
             cancer, with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. Participants without&#xD;
             pathologic or cytologic confirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal&#xD;
             evidence of metastasis from physical examination or radiologic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor expression both â‰¤ 1% by&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2-negative status as determined by the current&#xD;
             ASCO/CAP guidelines. If a patient has more than one histological result, the most&#xD;
             recent sample will be considered for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have PD-L1 status available at the time of registration. Standard&#xD;
             local testing with any PD-L1 antibody that has been validated in a CLIA-certified&#xD;
             environment will be acceptable for including patients on trial.. Primary or metastatic&#xD;
             samples may be tested for PD-L1 status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable or evaluable disease by RECIST version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must agree to undergo a research biopsy, if tumor is safely accessible,&#xD;
             at baseline. Previously collected archival tissue will also be obtained on all&#xD;
             participants. For participants for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided&#xD;
             (e.g. inaccessible or participant safety concern) the archival tissue alone will be&#xD;
             acceptable. Tissue needs to be located and availability confirmed at time of&#xD;
             registration (See Section 9 for more details). Participants must agree to a mandatory&#xD;
             repeat biopsy 3-6 weeks after starting treatment, if tumor is safely accessible. For&#xD;
             patients randomized to carboplatin alone who decide to crossover to nivolumab and&#xD;
             nab-paclitaxel at time of progression, a mandatory biopsy will be required if tumor is&#xD;
             safely accessible prior to initiating crossover treatment; participants must also&#xD;
             agree to undergo this biopsy, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy: Participants must have received 0 prior chemotherapeutic regimens&#xD;
             for metastatic breast cancer. Prior platinum in the neo/adjuvant setting is&#xD;
             permissible, if at least 6 months elapsed since the end of adjuvant systemic therapy&#xD;
             to the development of metastatic disease. All toxicities related to prior chemotherapy&#xD;
             must have resolved to CTCAE v4.0 grade 1 or lower, unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior biologic therapy: Prior poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are not&#xD;
             allowed in the metastatic setting. Prior PARP inhibitors in the neo/adjuvant setting&#xD;
             are permissible, if at least 6 months elapsed since the end of adjuvant systemic&#xD;
             therapy to the development of metastatic disease. All toxicities related to prior&#xD;
             biologic therapy must have resolved to CTCAE v4.0 grade 1 or lower, unless otherwise&#xD;
             specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy: Patients may have received prior radiation therapy. Radiation&#xD;
             therapy must be completed at least 14 days prior to registration, and all toxicities&#xD;
             related to prior radiation therapy must have resolved to CTCAE v4.0 grade 1 or lower,&#xD;
             unless otherwise specified in 3.1.10. Patients may not have had &gt;25% of their bone&#xD;

             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Childbearing potential is defined as: participants who have not reached a&#xD;
             postmenopausal state (â‰¥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause&#xD;
             other than menopause) and have not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of&#xD;
             ovaries and/or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception. Contraception is required starting with the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication through 150 days (5 months) after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
             Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established and proper use of hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and&#xD;
             copper intrauterine devices. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;

             method(s) of contraception for the duration of study treatment with nivolumab and 7&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study treatment (i.e., 90 days (duration of sperm&#xD;
             turnover) plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo approximately&#xD;
             five half-lives.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants on bisphosphonates or RANK ligand inhibitors may continue receiving&#xD;
             therapy during study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant must be capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and&#xD;
             willing to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent administration of any other anti-cancer therapy during the course of this&#xD;
             study (bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors are allowed).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control&#xD;
             symptoms. Participants with a history of treated central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
             metastases are eligible. Treated brain metastases are defined as those without ongoing&#xD;
             requirement for corticosteroids, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain&#xD;
             imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or CT scan) completed during screening. Any&#xD;
             corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued without the&#xD;
             subsequent appearance of symptoms for â‰¥7 days prior to registration. Treatment for&#xD;
             brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy, radiosurgery, surgery or a&#xD;
             combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Radiation therapy must be&#xD;
             completed at least 7 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to registration. Patients must have recovered from&#xD;

             to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled non-malignant systemic disease,&#xD;
             uncontrolled seizures, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy (&gt;&#xD;
             10 mg of prednisone daily or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive&#xD;
             medication (including disease modifying agents) and has required such therapy in the&#xD;
             last 2 years. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic&#xD;
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is&#xD;
             not considered a form of systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome that currently&#xD;
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;

             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years or are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers that have been diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years are eligible:&#xD;
             cervical/prostate carcinoma in situ, superficial bladder cancer, non-melanoma cancer&#xD;
             of the skin. Patients with other cancers diagnosed within the past 3 years and felt to&#xD;
             be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed with the study sponsor to determine&#xD;
             eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),&#xD;
             HepBsAg, or HCV RNA. HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the potential&#xD;
             for pharmacokinetic interactions of combination antiretroviral therapy with study&#xD;
             drugs. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of fatal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;

             use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or adults of reproductive potential not&#xD;
             employing an adequate method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Childbearing potential is defined as: participants who have not reached a&#xD;
             postmenopausal state (â‰¥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause&#xD;
             other than menopause) and have not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of&#xD;
