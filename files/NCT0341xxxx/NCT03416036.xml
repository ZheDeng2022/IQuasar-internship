      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a single dose of a live attenuated&#xD;
      recombinant tetravalent dengue vaccine (TetraVax-DV-TV003, referred to as TV003) to protect&#xD;
      against infection with a controlled human infection strain of either DENV-2 (rDEN2Δ30-7169)&#xD;
      or DENV-3 (rDEN3Δ30) in adults 18 to 50 years of age with no history of previous flavivirus&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the ability of a single dose of a live attenuated recombinant&#xD;
      tetravalent dengue vaccine (TetraVax-DV-TV003, referred to as TV003) to protect against&#xD;
      infection with a controlled human infection strain of either DENV-2 (rDEN2Δ30-7169) or DENV-3&#xD;
      (rDEN3Δ30) in adults 18 to 50 years of age with no history of previous flavivirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either TV003 or placebo at study entry (Day&#xD;
      0) and either rDEN2Δ30-7169 or rDEN3Δ30 on Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur on Days 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42,&#xD;
