  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will be first performed on individuals with HF-ASD with their expected&#xD;
      heterogeneity and healthy control (HC) subjects in order to explore the pain processing and&#xD;
      modulation mechanisms underlying the pain sensitivity profile of adults with HF-ASD.&#xD;
      Secondly, we will focus on individuals with ASD and HC, without ASR (ASD-nonASR, HC-nonASR)&#xD;
      and with SHR (ASD-SHR, HC-SHR). This 2X2 factorial design will enable us to determine whether&#xD;
      the feature of SHR in individuals with HF-ASD contributes to pain sensitivity. This research&#xD;
      project will comprise of two sessions. Session I will include the following tests ADOS-2 for&#xD;
      ASD diagnosing (only for individuals with ASD), intelligence quotation testing (IQ Wechsler&#xD;
      Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence® - Second Edition (WASI®-II)107, serving for inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Session II will include familiarization with the researchers and lab, thermal&#xD;
      detection threshold testing for small fiber abnormality identification since detection&#xD;
      thresholds in some reports found to be abnormal pain threshold testing, and completion of&#xD;
      questionnaires (see section 3.6 for details), psychophysical testing and EEG recordings in&#xD;
      the following order: i) rEEG recordings; ii) psychophysical pain assessments; simultaneously&#xD;
      with iii) neurophysiological pain assessments with pain EPs recorded. Our research protocol&#xD;
      will be approved by the Helsinki Committee of the Rambam Health Care Center and The Chaim&#xD;
      Sheba Medical Center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A dysregulation of the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural activity (i.e. an E/I&#xD;
      imbalance) underlies ASD pathology. Neural hyper-responsiveness and impaired top-down&#xD;
      modulation represent the E/I imbalance, underpinning the ASD clinical characteristics. One of&#xD;
      the most frequent ASD characteristics is atypical sensory responsiveness, including&#xD;
      exaggerated behavioral responses to sensory stimuli (i.e. sensory hyper-responsiveness). In&#xD;
      healthy subjects, sensory hyper-responsiveness was found to be associated with pain&#xD;
      hyper-sensitivity.This study project aims to study whether : (1) the individuals with ASD&#xD;
      exhibit pain hyper-sensitivity, namely a pro-nociceptive profile, supported by the E/I&#xD;
      imbalance. (2) the pain sensitivity will be positively associated with ASD clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, and (3) sensory hyper-responsiveness will be found to be a contributing&#xD;
      factor to pain hyper-sensitivity in ASD individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a multi-method, comprehensive psychophysical and neurophysiological&#xD;
      evaluation of pain sensitivity along with self-reports of clinical characteristics, daily&#xD;
      function, and quality of life. The participants will be high functioning ASD (HF-ASD)&#xD;
      individuals (IQ &gt;80). Pain processing by means of pain hyperalgesia and pain inhibition&#xD;
      capability, along with EEG activity at rest and in response to noxious stimuli (pain-evoked&#xD;
      potentials), will be compared between ASD subjects and healthy controls. The best&#xD;
      pain-related psychophysical and/or neurophysiological measures differentiating between groups&#xD;
      will be tested for correlations with the ASD clinical characteristics. In order to test the&#xD;
      contributing role of sensory hyper-responsiveness to pain sensitivity in ASD, the&#xD;
      aforementioned psychophysical and neurophysiological evaluation will be performed in 4&#xD;
      homogenous groups: ASD with and without sensory hyper-responsiveness, and controls with and&#xD;
      without sensory hyper-responsiveness.&#xD;
