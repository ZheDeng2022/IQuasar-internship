      This study is a Cross-sectional study, which is conducted as part of a larger cohort study:&#xD;
      How Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POC-US) Affects the Diagnostic Process in General Practice. A&#xD;
      prospective follow-up study. (Clinical trials registration number: NCT03375333)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in 20 different general practices in Denmark where the general&#xD;
      practitioners (GPs) use POC-US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions There is no intervention in this study. The registration in this study will&#xD;
      reflect GPs routine daily use of POC-US not adding more examinations or in other ways&#xD;
      influence on the treatment of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Twenty general practitioners (GPs) are expected to use POC-US 2-3 times a day,&#xD;
      and assuming a participation rate of 80%, there will be between 640-960 US scan during the&#xD;
      study period of one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment All patients who consult the participating GP for conditions relevant for a&#xD;
      POC-US examination will be offered to participate in the study. Patients are excluded if they&#xD;
      do not wish to participate or if they are not able to give an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must provide written, informed consent before any study procedures occur. Only&#xD;
      patients assigned to the GPs practice can participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection method After the consultation in the GP's office, patients will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out a questionnaire about their experience with POC-US in the consultation. The GPs will&#xD;
      provide the patients with a unique ID-number and a link to an online questionnaire on the&#xD;
      SurveyXact server. The patients will access the online questionnaire using this ID-number&#xD;
      through Ipads or on a paper edition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline information regarding the participating GPs will be provided through the original&#xD;
      study. Baseline questions about the patients will be part of the patient-questionnaire&#xD;
      following the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The items in this questionnaire are generated from a qualitative interview study with GPs&#xD;
      working in general practice and using POC-US. The items are the GPs expressed believes and&#xD;
      concerns about how ultrasound was experienced by their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This questionnaire is developed through the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A first edition of the questionnaire is developed based on the results of a qualitative&#xD;
           interview study with Danish GPs on their experiences on how ultrasound can be used in&#xD;
           general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test face validity, comprehension and wording of the questionnaire, pilot tests are&#xD;
           done with laypeople and patients,using the &quot;think-aloud&quot; technique and cognitive&#xD;
           interviewing. The pilot-tests are done in two geographical-separated clinics including&#xD;
           five patients in each clinic. Adaptions and rephrasing follow after the results are&#xD;
           compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A validation test will include presenting the rephrased questions from the pilot-tests&#xD;
           to 5 GPs, who use ultrasound, and asking them to compare the phrased questions to the&#xD;
           original items from the qualitative interviews. Adaptions will follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A final pilot-test will include interviews with patients, who have been ultrasound&#xD;
           scanned in two other clinics using the &quot;Think-aloud&quot; technique. In this pilot-test the&#xD;
           patients are presented to both a paper-version and an online-version of the&#xD;
           questionnaire, to test functionality and feasibility. Pilot-tests and adaptions will&#xD;
           continue until the questionnaire is completed without difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retention Participant Retention GPs will be asked to register not-included patients, in whom&#xD;
      POC-US was used during the study period, on a separate form and to declare the reason for the&#xD;
      failed inclusion of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Withdrawal Participating GPs and patients may withdraw from the study for any&#xD;
      reason at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management Data will be saved electronically in the SurveyXact server and on a server at&#xD;
      Aalborg University and will only be accessed by the research group using passwords.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Unit for General Practice in Aalborg is the Data Controller. Each participating&#xD;
      GP will be data processor and can only process data pursuant to an agreement with the data&#xD;
      controller. A data processor agreements will be made between the Research Unit for General&#xD;
      Practice in Aalborg and each participating GP, between the Research Unit for General Practice&#xD;
      in Aalborg and Aalborg University, and between Aalborg University and SurveyXact according to&#xD;
      the Danish Data Protection Agency recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Key files identifying the patients will be safely stored at the GPs office and the&#xD;
      research group will not have access to this information during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The questionnaire data will be collected on an ordinal scale and reported&#xD;
      descriptively using frequencies. The correlation between the GPs reported confidence in the&#xD;
      tentative diagnosis on a numeric rating scale from 1-5 perceived at an ordinal scale and&#xD;
      patients reported experience of ultrasound in the consultation will be compared using&#xD;
      scatterplots and Goodman and Kruskal's gamma will be used to test association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring During the study period the research team will be able to observe if the GPs&#xD;
      include patients in the study and make contact to the GPs who fail to include patients in&#xD;
      order to help out with any difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms All adverse events occurring during the study will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research ethics approval The studies are approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency and&#xD;
      the Committee of Multipractice Studies in General Practice in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent or assent Prior to participation, patients will receive written and oral information&#xD;
      and a written consent to participate will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a GP or a patient wished to redraw their consent to participate in the study, the GP will&#xD;
      contact the research team and no further data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol amendments Will be declared and all editions and changes in the protocol will be&#xD;
      saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality All participating GPs have signed a confidentiality agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Declaration of interest None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to data Only the Research team will have access to data.&#xD;
