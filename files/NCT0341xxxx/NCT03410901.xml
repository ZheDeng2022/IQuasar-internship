      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of the anti-OX40 antibody&#xD;
      BMS-986178 when given together with the TLR9 agonist SD-101 and radiation therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with low-grade B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. TLR9 agonist SD-101 may stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Anti-OX40 antibody is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that enhances the activation of T cells, immune cells that are important&#xD;
      for fighting tumors Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and may&#xD;
      make them more easily detected by the immune system. Giving TLR9 agonist SD-101 together with&#xD;
      anti-OX40 antibody BMS 986178 and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      low-grade B-cell non-hodgkin lymphomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of TLR9 agonist SD-101 (SD-101) in combination&#xD;
      with anti-OX40 antibody BMS 986178 (BMS-986178) and local low-dose radiation in patients with&#xD;
      low-grade B-cell lymphoma. Adverse events and grades to be assessed by Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) II. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      BMS-986178 in combination with intratumoral SD-101 and radiation in patients with low-grade&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate preliminary efficacy by assessing overall response rate and progression-free&#xD;
      survival after treatment with intratumoral SD-101 in combination with BMS-986178 and&#xD;
      radiation in patients with low-grade B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I study of the combination of TLR9 agonist SD-101, anti-OX40&#xD;
      antibody BMS 986178, and local low-dose radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive radiation therapy on days 1-2, TLR9 agonist SD-101 intratumorally on days 2,&#xD;
      9, 16, 23, and 30, and anti-OX40 antibody BMS-986178 intravenously (IV) on days 3, 30, 58,&#xD;
      86, 114, and 142 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 72 weeks.&#xD;
