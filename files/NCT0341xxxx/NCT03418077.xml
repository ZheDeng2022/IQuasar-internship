    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of consuming an original flavor energy&#xD;
      drink on electrocardiographic (ECG) and hemodynamic responses during and after exercise in&#xD;
      healthy subjects. The effect of drinking an energy drink on exercise performance will also be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will employ a double-blinded, randomized, crossover design to evaluate the&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) effects of an energy drink during post-exercise recovery. Subjects who&#xD;
      express interest in the study will be screen for eligibility. Those who are eligible will be&#xD;
      consented. An inquire into usual caffeine intake to assess caffeine na√Øve or caffeine&#xD;
      tolerant. Participants height, weight and race will be recorded. A resting 12-lead baseline&#xD;
      ECG and blood pressure (BP) will be obtained to rule out CV anomalies. A cardiologist will&#xD;
      review every baseline ECG and BP reading to rule out everything but a normal sinus rhythm and&#xD;
      BP &lt; 130/80 mmHg. Subjects who meet inclusion criteria and are approved by the cardiologist&#xD;
      will be enrolled and allocated a randomized participant identification (ID) number. They will&#xD;
      be given the &quot;Participant Instruction Sheet&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned, blinded to consume a single 24 oz container of an&#xD;
      energy drink or a 24 oz container of a control drink. Participants will serve as their own&#xD;
      controls, so they will undergo testing in the experimental and control drink conditions,&#xD;
      separated by 4 to 14 day. Each 24 oz control drink will be comprised of 585 ml of carbonated&#xD;
      water, 30 ml of reconstituted lime juice and 105 ml of cherry flavoring. This control drink&#xD;
      formula is identical to that used by Fletcher et al. (2017). The carbohydrate content of the&#xD;
      24 oz control drink is 81 g, which is the same as the 81 g per 24 oz energy drink.&#xD;
      Participants will fast 12 hours, asked to refrain from vigorous exercised 24-hours, and&#xD;
      abstain from caffeine consumption 48-hours prior to consuming a randomly assigned single 24&#xD;
      oz can of an original flavor energy drink within a 30-minute period. Investigator and&#xD;
      participant will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to visit either Heart, Lung and Vascular clinic or exercised&#xD;
      physiology laboratory (CSUS subjects) twice, separated by 4-14 days to undergo testing. ECG&#xD;
      electrodes will be placed on the upper torso and remain in place throughout the experiment.&#xD;
      Baseline ECG, HR, BP, blood sample and body weight will be obtained. Catheter placement and&#xD;
      blood draws will be performed by a registered clinical cardiopulmonary technician, registered&#xD;
      nurse or a resident physician. Approximately 20 mil of blood will be taken at each time&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will perform a continuous, progressive treadmill or bicycle ergometry test until&#xD;
      volitional exhaustion. The treadmill test will begin with walking at 3.4 mph at 0% grade,&#xD;
      then speed increased to 7 mph (males) or 6 mph (females) and grade increased by 2.5% every 2&#xD;
      minutes until &gt; 85% ag-predicted maximum heart rate and volitional exhaustion has been&#xD;
      reached. Subjects performing the ergometry test will being cycling at a resistance of 100 W&#xD;
      for 2 minutes with the resistance increased by 25 W (males) or 15 W (females), each minute&#xD;
      thereafter. Maximum HR will be calculated using the Tanaka formula (Tanaka et al., 2001). A&#xD;
      12-lead ECG will remain in place on subject and monitored continuously during exercise, and&#xD;
      rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be recorded every minute of each workload increase.&#xD;
      After completion of exercise, subject will remain standing on treadmill (or seated on&#xD;
      ergometer) for 10 minutes while ECG, BP, HR and blood samples are obtained. Subsequent ECG&#xD;
      measures will be obtained at 1,4,7 and 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the subjects will be&#xD;
      free to sit, stand or move quietly in the lab. During the 2-hour post exercise monitoring&#xD;
      period, subject's ECG, HR, BP will be recorded at 30-minute intervals. Blood samples for&#xD;
      caffeine, taurine, L-carnitine, plasma free fatty acids, glucose and lactate will be&#xD;
      collected immediate upon cessation of exercise, at 1 and 2 hours post exercise.&#xD;
