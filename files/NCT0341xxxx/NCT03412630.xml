      This phase II trial studies how well computed tomography perfusion imaging works in&#xD;
      predicting outcomes in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer&#xD;
      who are receiving bevacizumab. Computed tomography perfusion imaging monitors the effects of&#xD;
      the drug treatment on the blood flow to the tumor, and may help to predict whether a certain&#xD;
      drug therapy is likely be successful in a patient with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether those patients with an increase in perfusion computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      tumor blood flow (BF) from T0 to T1 demonstrate poorer progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      compared to those patients with a decrease in BF from T0 to T1, among platinum-resistant,&#xD;
      recurrent ovarian cancer patients treated with bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether change in perfusion CT tumor BF from T0 to T1, as a continuous&#xD;
      variable, is associated with PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate whether changes in perfusion CT tumor blood volume (BV) or permeability&#xD;
      surface product area (PS) from T0 to T1 are associated with PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate whether changes in perfusion CT tumor BF, BV, or PS from T0 to T1 are&#xD;
      associated with response rate according to the standard anatomic response evaluation criteria&#xD;
      (RECIST 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To identify which combination of perfusion CT parameters, including tumor BF, BV, and PS,&#xD;
      can serve to optimally distinguish patients in terms of PFS outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate whether the association between change in perfusion CT parameters and&#xD;
      treatment outcome (PFS or tumor response) is stable when analyzed with various&#xD;
      commercially-available post-processing software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. In the subset of patients with multiple, eligible perfusion target lesions within the CT&#xD;
      imaging volume, describe the variability of perfusion CT changes across different lesions&#xD;
      within the same patient, and evaluate the impact of multiple target lesions on the&#xD;
      association between change in perfusion CT parameters and PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. In a subset of patients, measure the reliability of perfusion CT parameters by analyzing&#xD;
      the same perfusion imaging dataset using different readers and different post-processing&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo computed tomography perfusion imaging at baseline and on day 15 after&#xD;
      initiation of standard of care bevacizumab treatment and before the second dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 8 weeks for up to 18 months.&#xD;
