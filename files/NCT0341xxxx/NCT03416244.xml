  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer - including esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) - is a disease of the elderly but&#xD;
      little is known about the biology and progression of cancers in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While most patients receive chemotherapy and/or chemo-radiation as first treatment, no&#xD;
      treatment standard for following treatments has been established so far and there is a clear&#xD;
      unmet medical need, especially for elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, this study assesses the efficacy and safety of two experimental immunotherapy regimens&#xD;
      (Nivolumab monotherapy or Nivolumab/Ipilimumab combination) in elderly patients with advanced&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer - including esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) - is a disease of the elderly, more&#xD;
      than 60% of all tumors arise in patients with the age of 65 years or older. In contrast,&#xD;
      little is known about the biology and progression of cancers in these patients, since most&#xD;
      clinical trials enroll patients with age limits of 70 or 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While most patients undergo chemotherapy and/or chemo-radiation in first-line, the role of&#xD;
      second-line therapy is less well understood. No treatment standard has been established so&#xD;
      far and there is a clear unmet medical need. This is particularly true for geriatric patients&#xD;
      for whom palliative systemic therapies are especially challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate a significant survival benefit&#xD;
      of two experimental immunotherapy regimens (Nivolumab monotherapy or Nivolumab/Ipilimumab&#xD;
      combination) in elderly patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer compared to&#xD;
      historical data of standard chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (30 items) Version 3.0. The QLQ-C30 is composed of multi-item scales and single-item measures, including five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.&#xD;
All of the scales and single-item measures have a score range from 0 to 100. A high score shows a high response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems</description>

Items are assessed on a 4-level numerical scale with 1= &quot;not at all&quot;, 2= &quot;a little&quot;, 3= &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4= &quot;very much&quot;. Scores are linearly converted and summated into a scaled score from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a worse QOL or better QOL for purpose and family support.</description>
