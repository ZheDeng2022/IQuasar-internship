  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      34 patients with Miller class III will be included in this study, where 17 participants will&#xD;
      be treated with connective tissue graft with coronally advanced flap (control group) and 17&#xD;
      participants will be treated with a papillary extended connective tissue graft with coronally&#xD;
      advanced flap (test group) and followed up for 6 months.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will be inspected to check if the patient fits for the eligibility criteria. If&#xD;
      the patient meets the standards, phase I therapy for periodontal plastic procedures will be&#xD;
      performed including thorough supragingival scaling and subgingival debridement. Preservation&#xD;
      of appropriate plaque control (both mechanical and chemical) by the patient will be executed&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be done by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTG harvesting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A measurement of the approximate length and width of the graft required will be taken. A CTG&#xD;
      will be harvested from the palate using single incision technique as described by Kumar et&#xD;
      al. (2013) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The graft will be harvested from the palate between the distal aspect of the canine and the&#xD;
      mid-palatal region of the first molar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A template will be placed on the palate to mark the extent of the graft, after local&#xD;
           anesthesia is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A single incision 2 mm apical to the gingival margin will be done. The blade will be&#xD;
           placed approximately parallel to the long axis of the palate to provide the first&#xD;
           incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The partial thickness flap will be raised as far apically as required, in accordance&#xD;
           with the graft size, as measured by the template, using a periosteal elevator. The&#xD;
           thickness of the flap will be sufficient to reduce the probability of tearing and&#xD;
           sloughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following this, the blade will be angled perpendicular to the palate through the same&#xD;
           incision and continued to the bone. After the incision to the bone, the connective&#xD;
           tissue will be elevated from the underlying bone with a periosteal elevator. Then two&#xD;
           vertical incisions on the mesial and distal ends of the graft and one horizontal medial&#xD;
           incision will be performed (under the partial thickness flap), to release it from the&#xD;
           surrounding tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The graft will be harvested through that single incision and pressure applied to the&#xD;
           donor site with gauze soaked in saline after the graft was taken. The donor site will be&#xD;
           sutured using a 4-0 silk suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the peCTG, the CTG will be furtherly prepared by creating the papillary extensions using&#xD;
      a tissue punch, according to the number of teeth with gingival recession.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical area will be prepared and adequately anesthetized using 4% articaine&#xD;
      hydrochloride 1/100 000 epinephrine by giving block and/or infiltration anesthesia. After&#xD;
      attaining adequate anesthesia, at a point apical to the papilla tip, vertical incisions will&#xD;
      be made lateral to the area of recession extending into alveolar mucosa. The alveolar mucosa&#xD;
      between the two vertical incisions will then be undermined by sharp dissection with&#xD;
      undermining going into the vestibule while remaining parallel with the surface. Then, a&#xD;
      sulcular incision will be used to reflect the coronal portion of the flap by sharp dissection&#xD;
      close to the periostium until reaching the split thickness incision&#xD;
&#xD;
      previously made in alveolar mucosa. A gingivoplasty of each papilla adjacent to the recession&#xD;
      will then be performed. This excision will not reduce the height of the papilla, but is&#xD;
      designed to create a bleeding surface which will serve as a bed for the connective tissue&#xD;
      graft (Allen and Miller, 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A triangular flap will be elevated by a sharp dissection with no. 15c scalpel blade to raise&#xD;
      a combined full-partial thickness flap to the level of the MGJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the test group (group A), peCTG will be placed over the recession defect leaving the&#xD;
      coronal margin of the graft at the level of the CEJ, and the papillary extensions are&#xD;
      inserted interdentally covering the de-epithelized papillae, while in the control group&#xD;
      (group B), CTG will be also placed over the recession defect leaving the coronal margin of&#xD;
      the graft at the level of the CEJ. In both groups, all graft material will be sutured to the&#xD;
      periosteum using 6-0 resorbable suture. Finally the flaps will be positioned coronally to the&#xD;
      CEJ without tension using 6-0 polyglycolic acid suture material. Hemostasis will be achieved&#xD;
      by applying gentle finger pressure for 4 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative oral analgesics (Ibuprofen 600 mg t.d.s) will be prescribed to the&#xD;
           patients for the first 3 days then whenever desirable. Systemic antibiotic will be&#xD;
           prescribed (Amoxicillin 500mg t.d.s) for 5 days to prevent the infection postsurgical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be instructed to rinse with 0.12% Chlorhexidine oral rinse twice daily for&#xD;
           2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be instructed to avoid excessive muscle tractioning or trauma to the&#xD;
           treated areas for the first 3 weeks and will be told not to brush teeth involved in the&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 10-14 days the sutures will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three weeks post surgically the patients will be instructed to gently brush the operated&#xD;
           area with a soft tooth brush using roll technique.&#xD;
