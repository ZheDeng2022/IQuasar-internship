    <textblock>
      Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in combination with&#xD;
      lymphodepletion and high-dose interleukin 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most TIL ACT trials have been conducted as salvage therapy for patients who already had&#xD;
      failed numerous treatments; many study participants presented with multiple metastases,&#xD;
      frequently in visceral organs and even in the brain. The effectiveness of TIL ACT in&#xD;
      eradicating metastatic tumors of the responding patients underlines the value of this&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent developments in the identification and selection of tumor-specific T-cell populations&#xD;
      have facilitated the implementation of TIL ACT also in nonmelanoma malignancies. Building on&#xD;
      the experience of Ella Lemelbaum Institute, Sheba Medical Center with ACT TIL in the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic melanoma, the Dept. of Oncology, Tel HaShomer has expanded the use of&#xD;
      TIL ACT following a reduced intensity, non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting induction regimen&#xD;
      to metastatic Melanoma, Ovarian (OC) and Cervical cancer patients. The rationale supporting&#xD;
      these studies is to further develop the ACT TIL procedure and expand its applicability to&#xD;
      metastatic OC and cervical cancers.&#xD;

      The Sponsor is developing the ex-vivo expanded autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes&#xD;
      (TIL) as the Investigational Product (IP). Yet, the administration of the TIL cellular&#xD;
      product can only be accomplished in the context of an Autologous, Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT)&#xD;
      procedure which is composed of the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduced Intensity, non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting induction regimen using&#xD;
           Fludarabine (25 mg/m2 for 3 days) followed by Total Body Radiation (TBR) (2 Gray as a&#xD;
           single treatment) for 1 day&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preparation and administration of unselected or 4-1BB enriched TIL&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bolus high-dose (720,000 IU/kg) IL-2 will be administered to each patient every 8 hours,&#xD;
           to tolerance. A maximum of 10 doses will be administered per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Early-stage follow-up until 30 days post-discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Late-stage follow-up, such as CT scans, will be carried out four and twelve weeks after&#xD;
           TIL administration, and then every 3 months thereafter for the first year after TIL&#xD;
           therapy; for the second year and onwards, as clinically indicated.&#xD;

&#xD;
        SUBJECT EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous effects of the non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting induction&#xD;
             regimen on the fetus or infant. (Note: Pregnancies occurring in patients with Ovarian&#xD;
             cancer are very rare, but possible. For this reason, ELIM has decided to retain the&#xD;
             sections dealing with possible cases of pregnancy during the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Systemic steroid therapy required (patients who require replacement therapy for&#xD;
             adrenal insufficiency may be enrolled if steroid treatment dose do not exceed 10 mg of&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical&#xD;
             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, as evidenced by a&#xD;
             positive stress thallium or comparable test, myocardial infarction, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease&#xD;
             and AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Opportunistic infections (the experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol&#xD;
             depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may&#xD;
             be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its&#xD;
             toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in&#xD;
             this study , including history of an anaphylactic reaction to penicillin or gentamicin&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of coronary revascularization or ischemic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any patient known to have an LVEF less than or equal to 50 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Documented LVEF of less than or equal to 50 percent tested in patients with clinically&#xD;
             significant atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmias including but not limited to: atrial&#xD;
             fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, second or third degree heart block&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Documented FEV1 and DLCO (relative to predicted) less than or equal to 60 percent.&#xD;
