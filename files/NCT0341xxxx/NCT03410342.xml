    <textblock>
      The CIRCUS study is a randomised controlled, cross-over trial to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      increased intakes of citrus fruits and cruciferous vegetables on vascular function in 36&#xD;
      untreated, prehypertensive participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study comprises three 14-day dietary intervention periods, preceded by one week run-in&#xD;
      period and separated by one week wash-out periods, 9 weeks in total. The diet will be fully&#xD;
      controlled and provided by the researchers. Participants will receive in random order three&#xD;
      interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 portion of fruits plus 1 portion of vegetables, of commonly consumed types per day.&#xD;
           Intakes are at 25th percentile of UK consumption and will exclude citrus fruits,&#xD;
           cruciferous and allium vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 portions of fruits plus 4 portions of vegetables, of commonly consumed types per day&#xD;
           excluding citrus fruits, cruciferous and allium vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 portions of citrus fruits plus 4 portions of cruciferous vegetables per day.&#xD;
