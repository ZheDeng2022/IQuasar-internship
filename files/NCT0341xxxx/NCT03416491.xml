  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KW-136, an investigational&#xD;
      anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug, combined with sofosbuvir for treatment of Chinese adults&#xD;
      chronically infected with HCV. Thirty (30) non-cirrhotic subjects were medicated with KW-136&#xD;
      30 mg daily, 60 non-cirrhotic subjects with KW-136 60 mg daily, and 30 cirrhotic subjects&#xD;
      with KW-136 60 mg daily; all the 120 subjects received sofosbuvir 400 mg daily. The treatment&#xD;
      course lasted 12 successive weeks and thereafter all the study participants entered into a&#xD;
      12-week treatment-free follow-up period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that China has a population of over 10 million infected with HCV and also a&#xD;
      highly variable HCV genotype geographic distribution. A simple, universal,&#xD;
      non-genotype-specific treatment regimen is preferred for anti-HCV treatment in clinical&#xD;
      practice and public health. KW-136 and sofosbuvir are potent anti-HCV agents targeting at&#xD;
      different HCV proteins, namely, nonstructural protein 5A and 5B, respectively. The&#xD;
      combination regimen of KW-136 and sofosbuvir is expected to completely suppress HCV&#xD;
      replication in subjects chronically infected with HCV and achieve a sustained virologic&#xD;
      response, namely, HCV not detected or below a predefined limit in plasma, 12 or 24 weeks&#xD;
      after cessation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As KW-136 and sofosbuvir are both pan-genotypic anti-HCV agents (in simple words, effective&#xD;
      for all known common genotypes of HCV), the combination of these two agents is also supposed&#xD;
      to be efficacious for treatment of subjects chronically infected with HCV of all major&#xD;
      genotypes and subtypes. An apparent clinical benefit of this pan-genotypic anti-HCV treatment&#xD;
      regimen is that no complex, delicate HCV genotype sequencing is required before initiation of&#xD;
      treatment to determine genotype-specific treatment alternatives of choice. This advantage is&#xD;
      of great significance in the primary care setting.&#xD;
