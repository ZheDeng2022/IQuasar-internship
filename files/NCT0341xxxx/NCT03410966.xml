      Objective. Atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after catheter ablation (CA) is a relevant&#xD;
      clinical problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. 123 patients with paroxysmal AF will be identified and screened for participation in&#xD;
      this randomized, prospective, double blind, controlled placebo multicenter trial. 109&#xD;
      patients will be randomly assigned and enrolled in the study trial. Enrolled patients will&#xD;
      receive magnetic atrial resonance and then will be treated by CA to receive pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation (PVI). In this patients cytokines, inflammatory markers, and biomarkers such as ST2&#xD;
      protein and B type natriuretic peptide (BNP) will be evaluated at baseline, after CA, and&#xD;
      during follow up. These biomarkers will be correlated to clinical outcomes (AF recurrences&#xD;
      and heart failure progression and hospitalizations), and to fibrotic atrium extension as&#xD;
      evaluated by magnetic resonance.&#xD;

      Catheter ablation (CA) is first class treatment to restore sinus rhythm in patients with&#xD;
      paroxysmal, symptomatic, drug refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). The sinus rhythm&#xD;
      restoration after a successful CA may improve symptoms, New York Heart Association (NYHA)&#xD;
      class and quality of life, reducing thromboembolic complications, and the likely progression&#xD;
      of the arrhythmic disease towards forms of heart failure. Conversely, patients that do not&#xD;
      respond successfully to CA therapy may still have AF, that is linked to an increased risk of&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, heart failure, and overall mortality. AF recurrence after CA occurs in a&#xD;
      percentage of patients ranging from 20% to 60%. This high rate of therapeutic failure, and&#xD;
      the higher number of patients suffering for paroxysmal AF, represent a not acceptable problem&#xD;
      in the clinical practice. The causes to explain this therapeutic failure are not completely&#xD;
      clear, and broadly investigated by authors. To date, hyper activity of inflammatory tone, and&#xD;
      oxidative stress with secondary left atrium enlargement and fibrosis, may represent a crucial&#xD;
      part of molecular, and cellular adaptive processes linked to electro-anatomical remodeling,&#xD;
      and to the AF perpetuation after an ablative treatment. Intriguingly, if the atrial fibrosis&#xD;
      extension is a known process linked to worse prognosis, conversely the ablative approach&#xD;
      therapy by burning to destroy arrhythmic cells, may also induce inflammation and atrial&#xD;
      fibrotic lines around the veins' ostia. Therefore, the double face of the coin shows to the&#xD;
      investigators the atrial fibrosis as an adaptive remodeling process linked to worse&#xD;
      prognosis, and the atrial fibrosis as the result of a correct ablative approach to isolate&#xD;
      pulmonary veins ostia and to improve clinical outcomes. To simply the concept, authors have&#xD;
      to consider the first as an adaptive process leading to worse prognosis in AF patients, and&#xD;
      the second as a necessary treatment to improve clinical outcomes in AF patients. Different&#xD;
      studies have investigated cytokines, inflammatory markers, and other peptides such as B type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (BNP), before and after CA in paroxysmal AF patients. These markers, and&#xD;
      particularly BNP are correlated to atrial fibrosis extension, and worse prognosis after an&#xD;
      ablative approach, and to the progression towards failing heart disease. Recently, the ST2&#xD;
      protein has been proposed as a new marker of heart fibrosis, such as a predictor of heart&#xD;
      failure. Currently, no data has been reported about ST2 protein and AF recurrences after an&#xD;
      ablative approach. Moreover, in the current study authors will investigate at baseline, and&#xD;
      at follow up after an ablative approach, the using of cytokines, inflammatory markers, and&#xD;
      other peptides such as B type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and ST2 protein, regards to these&#xD;
      adaptive atrial fibrotic processes, and to AF recurrences after catheter ablation. Therefore,&#xD;
      in this study authors will evaluate these biomarkers in patients with symptomatic and drug&#xD;
      refractory paroxysmal AF undergoing catheter ablation interventions, and their correlation to&#xD;
      AF recurrence rate after catheter ablation. To date, in the present study authors will&#xD;
      correlate these biomarkers, and particularly ST2 protein to AF recurrences after CA, to left&#xD;
      atrium fibrotic remodeling, and to hospitalizations events for heart failure at 12 months&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;
