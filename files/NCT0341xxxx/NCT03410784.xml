      This study is designed to assess the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of the combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy Paclitaxel and Carboplatin with Pembrolizumab in patients with advanced ovarian&#xD;
      cancer. The main objective is to test whether the therapeutic intervention benefits the&#xD;
      patient evaluating the number of subjects who are progression-free after 18 months from the&#xD;
      beginning of the first line treatment.&#xD;

             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course&#xD;
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not&#xD;
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be not eligible to receive Bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and&#xD;
             paclitaxel, due to contraindication, patient refusal or investigator choice&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study&#xD;
             of an investigational agent or investigational device and received study therapy or&#xD;
             used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to Pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (Grade 0 or 1 at baseline) from adverse events due to&#xD;
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (Grade 0 or 1 at&#xD;
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Subjects with Grade 1 or 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may&#xD;
        qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the&#xD;
        toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned&#xD;
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             steroids for at least 28 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not&#xD;
             include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children within the projected&#xD;
             duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120&#xD;
             days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or other&#xD;
             co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g. CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137) or drug specifically&#xD;
             targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
