    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) consists of blood extravasation into the space between&#xD;
      arachnoid and pia mater. Bleeding is a consequence of cerebral aneurysm rupture in most&#xD;
      cases. Despite incidence being only 9 cases out of 1000 people per year, young age and high&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity lead to loosing several years of healthy life. Therapy priorities&#xD;
      are: preventing rebleeding, with endovascular treatment (when possible) or neurosurgical&#xD;
      aneurism clipping; preventing complications associated with blood extravasation into&#xD;
      subarachnoid pace, such as acute hydrocephalus treatment (that occurs in 20% of patients), by&#xD;
      ventricular external drainage positioning, and delayed cerebral ischemia, mainly due to&#xD;
      vasospasm, by endovenous administration of nimodipine; optimal perfusion pressure&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endogenous osteopontin (OPN) is thought to fulfill a protective activity over ischemic damage&#xD;
      both in brain and other organs, including kidney. Besides, recombinant OPN administration&#xD;
      markedly decreases ischemic area in a focal cerebral ischemia model, by an antiapoptotic&#xD;
      action. Recent in vivo studies on animal models of SAH demonstrated that OPN plays a major&#xD;
      role: treatment with OPN seems to prevent vasospasm reducing smooth muscle cells and&#xD;
      endothelial cells apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microparticles are mediators released by platelets, leucocytes, erythrocyte and endothelial&#xD;
      cells. In ischemic stroke endothelial microparticles levels directly relate to clinical&#xD;
      severity and ischemic area extension. In typical parenchymal haemorrhage microparticles&#xD;
      levels are higher both in blood and in liquor and associated with worse clinical outcome. In&#xD;
      SAH increased microparticle levels have been demonstrated, especially in the days of the&#xD;
      bleeding, and microparticle levels change based on subtypes. Data disagree about the subtypes&#xD;
      involved and their time course. This study aims to evaluate the correlation between OPN and&#xD;
      microparticles levels and vasospasm development/ischemic lesion at the CT-scan, and&#xD;
      subsequently with medium and long-term patients outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) consists of blood extravasation into the space between&#xD;
      arachnoid and pia mater. Bleeding is a consequence of cerebral aneurysm rupture in most&#xD;
      cases. It particularly affects females with an average age of 55 years. Despite incidence&#xD;
      being only 9 cases out of 1000 people per year, young age and high mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      lead to loosing several years of healthy life. As a matter of fact, patients that survived&#xD;
      cerebral aneurysm rupture suffer from cognitive deficits, behavior disorders and are unable&#xD;
      to come back to their former productivity level and jobs. Therapy priorities are: preventing&#xD;
      rebleeding, with endovascular treatment (when possible) or neurosurgical aneurism clipping;&#xD;
      preventing complications associated with blood extravasation into subarachnoid pace, such as&#xD;
      acute hydrocephalus treatment (that occurs in 20% of patients), by ventricular external&#xD;
      drainage positioning, and delayed cerebral ischemia, mainly due to vasospasm, by endovenous&#xD;
      administration of nimodipine; optimal perfusion pressure maintenance. Under a&#xD;
      pathophysiological point of view, after early mechanical damage, caused by aneurysm rupture&#xD;
      (due to tissue destruction consequent to hemorrhage mass effect, acute hydrocephalus,&#xD;
      herniation or a possible intraparenchymal hematoma) a subacute damage could be developed from&#xD;
      three to fourteen days post haemorrhage, because of delayed cerebral ischemia. Mainly&#xD;
      responsible for this event are vasospasm, that complicates 20-30% of SAH, microcirculation&#xD;
      dysfunction and microthromboembolism. Secondary damage pathogenesis is not clear, but&#xD;
      inflammation and endothelial apoptosis are shown to be involved in vasospasm development.&#xD;
      Moreover, some studies demonstrate that patients with acute neurological dysfunction have a&#xD;
      grater risk of organ failure, especially for lungs and kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays several roles in&#xD;
      physiological and pathological processes, such as tissue remodelling, fibrosis, cellular&#xD;
      migration, apoptosis inhibition and inflammation. Endogenous OPN is thought to fulfil a&#xD;
      protective activity over ischemic damage both in brain and other organs, including kidney.&#xD;
      Besides, recombinant OPN administration markedly decreases ischemic area in a focal cerebral&#xD;
      ischemia model, by an antiapoptotic action. Recent in vivo studies on animal models of SAH&#xD;
      demonstrated that OPN plays a major role; its administration attenuates cerebral damage&#xD;
      decreasing metalloproteinase 9 and inhibiting inducible nitric oxide synthase. Treatment with&#xD;
      OPN seems to prevent vasospasm as well, inducing an endogenous mitogen-activated protein&#xD;
      (MAP) inhibitor, i.e. MAP kinase phosphatase 1, and reducing smooth muscle cells and&#xD;
      endothelial cells apoptosis. A further research field in this area concerns microparticles,&#xD;
      that is mediators released by platelets, leucocytes, erythrocyte and endothelial cells.&#xD;
      Contrary to what it used to be thought, they do not represent a form of waste material from&#xD;
      apoptotic coagulation cells and recent studies show their paracrine ad regulatory activity.&#xD;
      In ischemic stroke endothelial microparticles levels directly relate to clinical severity and&#xD;
      ischemic area extension. In typical parenchymal haemorrhage microparticles levels are higher&#xD;
      both in blood and in liquor and associated with worse clinical outcome. In SAH increased&#xD;
      microparticles levels has been demonstrated, especially in the day of the bleeding, and&#xD;
      microparticles levels change based on type. On the other hand, data disagree among papers&#xD;
      about types involved in fluctuations and their time course: Lackner et al. evaluated 20 SAH&#xD;
      patients (Fisher II, III and IV) in their first fifteen days from bleeding and found higher&#xD;
      blood levels of platelet, endothelial, erythrocyte and leukocyte microparticles in comparison&#xD;
      to healthy controls [28]. Moreover, endothelial type positive for cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      (CD) 105 and CD 62 markers were particularly increased in patient affected by vasospasm,&#xD;
      documented with doppler. Vasospasm associated ischemia, also present especially high levels&#xD;
      of platelet CD 41 positive microparticles. Notwithstanding disability grade at the time of&#xD;
      discharge, microparticles levels are higher in comparison to full recovered patients (n=11).&#xD;
      More recently, Sanborn et al. study on 22 SAH patients with massive blood spreading (Fisher&#xD;
      III and IV) confirms microparticles elevation levels in these patients. Elevation of&#xD;
      endothelial and platelet microparticles levels is verified as well, while no correlation is&#xD;
      found with evidence of vasospasm, in both ultrasound (mean velocity higher than 125 cm/s in&#xD;
      anterior circulation or higher than100 cm/s in posterior circulation, in addition to a&#xD;
      Lindegaard ratio higher than 3) and angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published data are not unanimous on neither the correlation between vasospasm and CT scan&#xD;
      evidence of ischemia nor with disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) the correlation between OPN and microparticles levels and vasospasm development/ischemic&#xD;
      lesion at the CT-scan, and subsequently with medium and long-term patients outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changings of OPN amount in liquor and blood of patients with SAH on the day of bleeding&#xD;
           and post-hemorrhage i.e., days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Microparticles levels in liquor and blood patients with SAH on the day of bleeding and&#xD;
           post hemorrhage i.e., days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, in order to evaluate both their&#xD;
           predictive value for vasospasm and the correlation with renal or pulmonary function&#xD;
           worsening and 3-6 months outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Isolated microparticles will be used to activate in vitro renal and pulmonary&#xD;
           endothelial cells for the purpose of highlighting a possible cross talk, analyzing&#xD;
           endothelial damage markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment duration will be one year. At hospital entry, a CT scan will be performed as well&#xD;
      as Fischer score, Hunt and Hess score and World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS)&#xD;
      score. We will register demographic variables i.e., age, sex, symptoms at onset and&#xD;
      co-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiography or angio-CT scan will be performed according to the best clinical practice to&#xD;
      document presence, dimension and characteristics of patent aneurysm. SAH patients' treatment&#xD;
      will be carried out as routine clinical best practice. Patients will be monitored with&#xD;
      transcranial doppler beginning from day I and clinically every day. If no clinical changing&#xD;
      will occur, patients will be submitted to a CT perfusion angiography or angiography on day 7&#xD;
      (+/- 1 day). If clinical condition worsen or doppler velocity increase (considering vasospasm&#xD;
      as mild when mean velocity inside cerebral artery 120-150 cm/s, moderate 150-200 cm/s and&#xD;
      severe &amp;gt;200 cm/s) angiography and endovascular nimodipine will be considered, according to&#xD;
      the standard protocol therapy. Angiographic vasospasm consists in cerebral arteries narrowing&#xD;
      confirmed by neuroradiologist. Clinical vasospasm is defined as consciousness deterioration&#xD;
      (Glasgow coma scale (GCS) 2 points reduction) and/or a new focal deficit emergence, after&#xD;
      other causes has been excluded, such as seizure, rebleeding, fever. Every new CT evidence of&#xD;
      ischemia will be registered from day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3-6 months outcome will be evaluated by GOS-E (Extended Glasgow Coma Scale; 8 points&#xD;
      scale, from death to upper good recovery, without any disability left related to SAH). To&#xD;
      obtain this information, trained staff will interview either patients himself or a close&#xD;
      relative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples will be taken at admission, i.e., within 24 hours from the bleeding, and&#xD;
      in days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Sterile liquor will be sampled from the bag distal to&#xD;
      collection chamber, in an amount of 10 ml/die, at the same time frame each day. Blood in&#xD;
      amount of 3 ml/die and urine will be collected at the same time (about 7:00 am). Liquor,&#xD;
      plasma and urine will be centrifuge (2500 rpm for 30 minutes) and supernatants will be&#xD;
      aliquoted and frozen at the temperature of -80°C until analysis. OPN analysis will be&#xD;
      performed with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, following&#xD;
      manufacturer suggestion (AssayDesigns Inc., Michigan; Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford,&#xD;
      IL). In order to better describe inflammatory response, main T helper 1 (Th)1 and Th2&#xD;
      cytokines will be measured as well as cerebral damage markers (enolase neuron specific (NSE),&#xD;
      asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) etc.). On urine, markers of early preclinical impairment&#xD;
      will be quantified. Isolation and characterization of microparticles will be performed with&#xD;
      Nanosight based on dimension and concentration, while major surface antigens will be&#xD;
      identified in cytofluorimetry, specifying provenience: leukocyte, erythrocyte, platelet,&#xD;
      endothelial cells. In vitro analysis will be carried out on renal and pulmonary endothelial&#xD;
      cells monolayer. Water balance, creatinine, leukocytes number, infection/colonization,&#xD;
      nephrotoxic drugs will be monitored daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microparticles effect will be evaluated in vitro on umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC),&#xD;
      on smooth muscle cells (SMC), on pulmonary and renal endothelial cells, incubated with and&#xD;
      without patients' plasma derived purified microparticles. In addition, analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate: apoptosis (Tunel staining), angiogenesis (evidence of capillary-like&#xD;
      structures on Matrigen plate), leukocyte adhesion and adhesion molecule expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As no data are present in literature on OPN levels during SAH and data on microparticles are&#xD;
      not unanimous, a real sample size was not calculated. Considering that 20%-30% of the&#xD;
      patients were expected to be complicated with vasospasm, the enrollment was planned with 60&#xD;
      patients in one year to get 12-18 patients with vasospasm. Participants matching inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria will be enrolled both in ICU and Neurosurgery Ward of Novara Ospedale&#xD;
      Maggiore della Carità in one year period (i.e. January 31 st 2018, January 30 th 2019). Based&#xD;
      on last year admissions, 20 patients in ICU and 40 patients in Neurosurgery ward are&#xD;
      expected. At T0, microparticles levels will be analyzed in patients with and without&#xD;
      vasospasm with Wilcoxon rank test. With generalized steam equations microparticles levels&#xD;
      will be compared between patients with and without vasospasm or new ischemic events. 3 and 6&#xD;
      months GOS-E will be compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. The relation between microparticles&#xD;
      number and vasospasm and ischemia incidence will be defined with Spearman correlation. A&#xD;
      value of p less than 0.05 will be the threshold for statistical significance. Analysis will&#xD;
      be carried out with STATA. As far as concerns in vitro experiments, non-parametric tests will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
