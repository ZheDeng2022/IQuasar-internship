  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this investigation is to explore the effect of reducing conventional pulse width&#xD;
      of stimulation on known adverse effects of Subthalamic nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation (STN&#xD;
      DBS) treatment such as; slurring of speech, gait impairment, and unsteadiness. This&#xD;
      investigation is designed such that each of 16 patients (who have all had chronically&#xD;
      implanted DBS systems), will be assessed using conventional (DBS-60µs) and short (DBS-30µs)&#xD;
      pulse width DBS, in a randomised order.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional DBS most commonly uses 60µs pulse width stimulation. Higher pulse widths are&#xD;
      less well tolerated by patients as a result of adverse effects. The ability to use short&#xD;
      pulse width (30µs) DBS in chronically implanted STN-DBS patients has been made possible as a&#xD;
      result of the provision of a novel software flashcard (8870 XBP application card) developed&#xD;
      by Medtronic, compatible with the routine Medtronic N'Vision 8870 Clinician Programmer. The&#xD;
      Medtronic 8870-XBP flashcard will enable shorter pulse width (30µs) to be used with&#xD;
      previously implanted conventional Medtronic DBS hardware, however this is not licensed at&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this clinical investigation is to confirm the longevity of response and the&#xD;
      clinical relevance of DBS-30µs versus DBS-60µs in DBS patients using &quot;optimized&quot; stimulation&#xD;
      amplitudes for each pulse-width. This project will be conducted in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease who have had long term bilateral sub thalamic nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation&#xD;
      implants. As such, they will be regular attenders at the Unit of Functional Neurosurgery,&#xD;
      National Hospital for Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery, and will have had frequent previous attempts&#xD;
      at adjusting their DBS parameters including overnight stays, and off- medication assessments&#xD;
      to optimize motor function and minimize adverse effects. They will be familiar with all&#xD;
      procedures to be used in this study. They will be aware that the objective of the study is to&#xD;
      identify whether additional improvements in dysarthric speech can be achieved by the use of a&#xD;
      short pulse width setting and therefore will be highly motivated to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is designed such that each patient will be assessed under the DBS-30µs and&#xD;
      DBS-60µs pulse width condition, in a randomised order. The patients and rating clinicians&#xD;
      will be blinded to randomisation order. An unblinded clinician will be responsible for&#xD;
      programming the stimulation. The use of a crossover design allows each patient to essentially&#xD;
      act as their own control subject, and will maximise the ability to judge using paired&#xD;
      statistical tests whether there is a consistent advantage in speech intelligibility using the&#xD;
      shorter pulse width (DBS-30µs).&#xD;
