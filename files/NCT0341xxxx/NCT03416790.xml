  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IMPAACT 2015 is a cross-sectional, exploratory study that will investigate the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) reservoir in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and young adults on&#xD;
      effective antiretroviral therapy with neurocognitive impairment. The study will assess the&#xD;
      frequency with which HIV is detected in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in this population&#xD;
      and assess whether detectable HIV in the CSF correlates with markers of inflammation and&#xD;
      neuronal injury. Findings from this study will advance understanding of the role of the CNS&#xD;
      in HIV-1 persistence and its implications for future HIV-1 remission research.&#xD;

      IMPAACT 2015 is a cross-sectional, exploratory study aiming to investigate the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) reservoir in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and young adults on&#xD;
      effective antiretroviral therapy with neurocognitive impairment. The study will assess the&#xD;
      frequency with which HIV is detected in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in this population&#xD;
      and assess whether detectable HIV in the CSF correlates with markers of inflammation and&#xD;
      neuronal injury. CSF will be examined for persistence of HIV-1 RNA or DNA despite&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) and for evidence of intrathecal inflammation.&#xD;
      Perinatally-infected youth and young adults are of particular interest because there are very&#xD;
      limited CSF data available in this population and reasons to be concerned about the CNS&#xD;
      reservoir. In addition, measures of HIV-1 RNA in the CSF and associated biomarkers have not&#xD;
      previously been explored in this population. A better understanding of viral persistence in&#xD;
      the CSF, as well as CSF biomarker profiles, will provide preliminary data to move the field&#xD;
      forward in understanding the role of the CNS in HIV-1 persistence and will have implications&#xD;
      for future HIV-1 remission research.&#xD;
