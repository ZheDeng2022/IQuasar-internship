  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The erector spinae plane (ESP) block is a novel regional anesthetic technique for the&#xD;
      treatment of thoracic, cervical, and abdominal pain. This pilot study aims to investigate the&#xD;
      post-operative analgesic effectiveness of ultrasound guided single-shot ESP blocks for&#xD;
      patients undergoing minimally invasive thoracoscopic wedge resections of the lung in&#xD;
      comparison to those receiving conventional parental opioid analgesia alone. This will be&#xD;
      achieved through the use of objective measures including quality the 40 point Quality of&#xD;
      Recovery assessment (QoR-40) on postoperative day (POD) 1, visual-analogue pain scale (VAS)&#xD;
      in the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) and at POD 1, and oral morphine-equivalent (OME)&#xD;
      opioid consumption in the PACU and at 24 hours post-operatively.&#xD;

      Purpose To investigate the postoperative analgesic effectiveness of the ultrasound-guided ESP&#xD;
      block compared to a placebo injection for patients undergoing thoracoscopic wedge resection&#xD;
      of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Thoracoscopic surgery patients who receive an ESP block in addition to current&#xD;
      standard of care, consisting of parenteral and enteral opioids and surgical wound&#xD;
      infiltration, will have a clinically significant improvement in their QoR-40 at POD 1 and&#xD;
      lower pain levels, as measured by VAS in the PACU on arrival and one hour after, and on POD&#xD;
      1, and OME opioid consumption in the PACU and at 24 hours post-operatively, in comparison to&#xD;
      those patients who receive the current standard of care along with a placebo injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification The ESP block is a novel regional anesthetic technique that has shown efficacy&#xD;
      in the management of thoracic pain as published in numerous case reports and observational&#xD;
      case series. To date, no randomized control trials exist of its efficacy in comparison to&#xD;
      conventional parental opioid analgesic management. Thoracoscopic wedge resections of the lung&#xD;
      are procedures not usually treated with regional analgesia techniques, but given the moderate&#xD;
      pain experienced by many patients, this surgical population will serve as a proof-of-concept&#xD;
      for the potential of improved post-operative analgesic and recovery profiles. Proof of&#xD;
      analgesic efficacy in this setting may allow a future head-to-head comparison with more&#xD;
      invasive analgesic techniques currently used for thoracic surgery such as epidural and&#xD;
      paravertebral catheterizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In undertaking this aim, we will measure a number of different metrics. The 40-item Quality&#xD;
      of Recovery Score (QoR-40) will be our primary objective as it provides a patient-centered&#xD;
      global measure of overall health in the postoperative period. It has been tested for validity&#xD;
      and reliability, and has undergone quantification for the minimal clinically important&#xD;
      difference. Other traditional metrics of analgesic performance including the VAS and 24-hour&#xD;
      post-op OME opioid consumption will also be monitored as secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Quality-of-Recovery 40 scale at POD 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cumulative OME opioid consumption intra-operatively and through PACU, and at 24 hours&#xD;
           post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual analog pain scale assessments post-operatively in PACU on arrival, after 1 hour,&#xD;
           and at POD 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design The study will be a prospective, single center, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled pilot study requiring 2 patient visits for assessment in the PACU and on&#xD;
      POD 1. One interim analysis for safety monitoring will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Methods No prior studies have been conducted to&#xD;
      calculate an exact sample size calculation. Based on similar work, we will power this study&#xD;
      on an expected difference of at least 10 points on the QoR-40 and a SD of 15 when comparing&#xD;
      the block to placebo. This is a clinically meaningful difference. Assuming an alpha level of&#xD;
      0.05 and a power of 0.80, our sample size is 74. With a 10% dropout rate we will require&#xD;
      recruitment of 82 patients. All outcomes will be analysed with the independent student&#xD;
      t-test.&#xD;
