      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Melanocytic nevi, or &quot;moles,&quot; are non-cancerous growths of a type of skin cell called a&#xD;
           melanocyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Large congenital melanocytic nevi (LCMN) are a special type of mole that begins to grow&#xD;
           before birth and is larger than moles that develop after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining how melanocytes in moles and LCMNs differ from normal melanocytes may&#xD;
           increase the ability to predict whether a mole will give rise to a melanoma (a type of&#xD;
           skin cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand how melanomas develop, by studying moles, LCMNs, and pigmented skin&#xD;
           lesions that are suspicious for melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop better criteria for diagnosing melanoma, particularly by using a device&#xD;
           called a digital dermatoscope (a special camera, connected to a computer, that takes&#xD;
           pictures of moles when they are magnified and illuminated)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children 5 years old or older with an LCMN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults 18 years old or older with 100 or more moles larger than 2 mm in diameter and at&#xD;
           least one 4 mm or more&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults 18 years old or older with a pigmented lesion suspicious for melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' personal and family health history is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are examined by investigative team doctors, and several lesions are examined&#xD;
           with a dermatoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional photographs of part or all of the skin surface may be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some lesions may be biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional tests or examinations may be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are followed periodically for skin or physical examinations, photography,&#xD;
           laboratory and imaging evaluations, and possible skin biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children may undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to understand early transformation and malignant progression&#xD;
      events of cutaneous melanoma by obtaining detailed clinical information and lesional tissue&#xD;
      for analysis, cell culture, and immortalization from patients with melanocytic nevi, which&#xD;
      frequently are precursor lesions of melanoma, and primary melanoma. An important goal of this&#xD;
      study is the acquisition of melanocytes from lager congential melanocytic nevi (LCMN) and&#xD;
      acquired melanocytic nevi (AMN) for analysis, culture and experimental manipulation. We do&#xD;
      not propose to acquire melanocytes from pigmented lesions suspected to represent primary&#xD;
      melanoma because of the importance of preserving all lesional tissue required to render&#xD;
      accurate histopathological diagnosis. However, another aim of the study is the development of&#xD;
      enhanced clinical criteria for the diagnosis of primary cutaneous melanoma, particularly&#xD;
      using digital epiluminescent skin microscopy, or dermoscopy, for pigmented lesion image&#xD;
      acquisition and analysis. The close comparison of dermoscopic images of pigmented skin&#xD;
      lesions suspicious for melanoma with lesional histopathology should be useful for expanding&#xD;
      the knowledge base about how dermoscopy , a relatively new technique used to evaluate&#xD;
      pigmented skin lesions, can be used to diagnose a pigmented skin lesion as benign or&#xD;
      malignant. These detailed comparisons may also provide information about how specific visual&#xD;
      features within the dermoscopic image field correlate with histologic features of the lesion.&#xD;
      This information may be useful for future possible studies designed to predict accurately&#xD;
      which portions of a primary malignant melanoma can be removed for esperimental study while&#xD;
      retaining sufficient lesional information to guide further treatment and render an accurate&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of three categories of patients: (1) infants and children&#xD;
      with large congenital melanocytic nevi, (2) adults with numerous (less than 100) melanocytic&#xD;
      nevi, and (3) patients with primary malignant melanoma. Establishment of the Pigmented Lesion&#xD;
      Clinic required for the execution of this protocol will provide a mechanism for the&#xD;
      evaluation of patients with numerous or unusual pigmented lesions, and for the entry of&#xD;
      eligible patients into ongoing therapeutic trials for malignant melanoma. As the study&#xD;
      progresses, it is anticipated that a substantial amount of formalin-fixed nevus and primary&#xD;
      melanoma tissue with a high-degree of clinical annotation will be collected. As a secondary&#xD;
      objective , the availability of this collection will be useful to support studies designed to&#xD;
      evaluate new markers and techniques for the diagnosis of melanoma and atypical nevi, and for&#xD;
      incorporation into a tissue microarray that will be available to the melanoma research&#xD;
      community for target foundation validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular events resulting in melanocyte transformation and the development of early&#xD;
      melanoma are incompletely understood. Risk factors for the development of melanoma include&#xD;
      genetic, phenotypic and environmental risk factors and can overlap. Also, persons with large&#xD;
      numbers of nevi face a higher risk of melanoma. These risk associations, combined with&#xD;
      knowledge obtained from basic studies on the survival, differentiation, and proliferation of&#xD;
      the melanocyte, can provide hints about the molecular mechanisms that underlie the&#xD;
      development of nevi and melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we plan to acquire lesional tissue from pigmented lesions and develop enhanced&#xD;
      clinical criteria for the diagnosis of primary cutaneous melanoma, particularly using digital&#xD;
      epiluminescent skin microscopy, or dermoscopy, for pigmented lesion image acquisition and&#xD;
      analysis. This information may be useful for future possible studies designed to predict&#xD;
      accurately which portions of a primary malignant melanoma can be removed for experimental&#xD;
      study while retaining sufficient lesional information to guide further treatment and render&#xD;
      an accurate prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain tissue from benign melanocytic nevi and from large congenital melanocytic nevi&#xD;
      (LCMN) for experimental study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To refine culture and immortalization methods for melanocytes derived from melanocytic nevi,&#xD;
      permitting in vitro expansion of these cells for functional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To correlate clinical and dermoscopic observations of primary melanomas with histopathology&#xD;
      to establish standards for sampling primary melanomas in a possible future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants/Children less than 5 years of age with large congenital melanocytic nevus (LCMN,&#xD;
      diagnosed clinically or by biopsy) that is greater than 20 cm in any one dimension or that is&#xD;
      greater than 8 cm in any one dimension involving the scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults greater than 18 years of age with greater than 100 melanocytic nevi greater than 2 mm&#xD;
      in diameter with at least one melanocytic nevus greater than 4 mm in longest dimension or&#xD;
      with a current pigmented lesion clinically suspicious for primary melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a natural history protocol designed to enroll 110 subjects who will be evaluated and&#xD;
      followed over the course of their disease.&#xD;
