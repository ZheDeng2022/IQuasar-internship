    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the pictures of heart arteries obtained by MSCT&#xD;
      scanner to the pictures obtained during heart catheterization. Our specific question is&#xD;
      whether the MSCT scanner is accurate enough to replace heart catheterization in some&#xD;
      situations for the evaluation of coronary heart disease.&#xD;

      QUESTION: Compare the accuracy of multi-slice CT angiography (CTA) with invasive&#xD;
      catheterization (Cath) in detecting and grading coronary lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A prospective cohort analysis comparing the quantification of coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis by Computed Tomographic angiography to that of invasive Catheterization.&#xD;
      Subjects will be patients who are scheduled for non-urgent cardiac cath based on a clinical&#xD;
      need to evaluate the coronary anatomy. Cath may be scheduled after a positive stress test or&#xD;
      on the basis of concerning symptoms. If a patient consents to participation they will be&#xD;
      scheduled for CTA no less than 3 and no more than 30 days prior to Cath. Comparison of&#xD;
      lesions detected by the two imaging modalities in the proximal, mid and distal coronary&#xD;
      arteries will be made. Grades of disease used will be the following 1). less than 50% 2).&#xD;
      50-75% 3). greater than 75% 4) Uninterpretable. Sensitivity and specificity will be&#xD;
      calculated for CTA; in addition PPV and NPV will also be calculated. The 2 readers of the CTA&#xD;
      will be blinded to the invasive angiography results. The 2 readers of the invasive&#xD;
      angiography, who are blinded to the CTA results will be the standard of comparison. Analysis&#xD;
      of data will be performed on a segmental, vessel, and patient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL RISK: Risks associated with contrast exposure include the risk of allergic reaction&#xD;
      and renal injury. There is a small risk of excessive bradycardia and hypotension with&#xD;
      administration of metoprolol and nitroglycerine. CTA is associated with radiation exposure&#xD;
      similar to the lower range of diagnostic catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL BENEFITS: No direct benefits are expected for the subjects of this study as the&#xD;
      information will not be used to alter clinical decisions. Benefits to future patients may&#xD;
      include the development of an non-invasive alternative to cardiac catheterization.&#xD;
