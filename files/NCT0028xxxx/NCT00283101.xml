  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the tolerability, safety profile,&#xD;
      and antitumor activity of SGN-40 in patients with CLL. All patients will receive dose&#xD;
      escalation during the first two weeks regardless of cohort designation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A minimum of three patients will be entered into each dose-level cohort for five weeks.&#xD;
      Escalation to the next cohort will occur when three patients have received at least one&#xD;
      infusion at the highest scheduled dose level, and at least one patient has completed the&#xD;
      entire five week dosing schedule. Cohorts will be enrolled at a maximal dose level of 3, 4,&#xD;
      6, or 8 mg/kg/week. Initial therapy will last for 5 weeks. Responding patients will receive&#xD;
      additional infusions every two weeks x 4 at the maximal dose for each specific cohort.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of CLL as defined by the WHO criteria and&#xD;
             exhibit active disease requiring treatment as per the NCI working group on CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have a fresh tumor specimen available (peripheral blood or bone marrow)&#xD;
             for flow cytometry evaluation (e.g. CD40, CD38, CD20, CD19, and CD5).For the phase 2&#xD;
             portion of the study, CD40 expression on malignant cells must be confirmed prior to&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have relapsed after receiving at least one fludarabine containing&#xD;
             regimen or an equivalent purine analog.&#xD;
&#xD;
             At study start patients must be at least 8 weeks or 5 plasma half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             greater) from prior chemotherapy/radiation/investigational agents, 8 weeks from prior&#xD;
             antibody therapy and 6 months from autologous stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have an ECOG performance status ≤ 2 and a life expectancy &gt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have the following required baseline laboratory data:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3 (may be maintained by transfusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 7.5 g/dL (may be maintained by transfusions or growth factors)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm3 (may be maintained by growth factors)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT/AST ≤ 2.0 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 times ULN (unless related to hemolysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative B-hCG pregnancy test result&#xD;
             within 3 days prior to the first dose and must agree to use an effective contraceptive&#xD;
             method during the course of the study and for 6 months following the last dose of&#xD;

             radiographic confirmation that thrombosis is resolved. Prophylactic anticoagulant&#xD;
             therapy for indwelling catheters is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;

             prednisone per day or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
