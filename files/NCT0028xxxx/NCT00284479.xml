  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an 8 week program of walking for&#xD;
      45 minutes, twice a week, on fitness, body composition , blood pressure and blood markers of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk. We hypothesised that this 90 minutes of walking per week would result in&#xD;
      measurable increases in fitness and reductions in body fat, resting blood pressure and&#xD;
      improved blood lipid profiles.&#xD;

      Current physical activity guidelines suggest that every adult should accumulate 30 minutes or&#xD;
      more of moderate intensity physical activity on most days of the week. However, compliance&#xD;
      with these guidelines requires considerable commitment in terms of time spent exercising per&#xD;
      week (&gt; 150 minutes) and this may deter individuals from starting an exercise programme.&#xD;
      Accordingly, randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effects of smaller&#xD;
      volumes of exercise on health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      37 civil servants (24 women) aged 41.5 + 9.3 years, were randomly assigned to either two 45&#xD;
      minute walks per week (walking group) or no training (control group). Aerobic fitness, body&#xD;
      composition, blood pressure (BP), CRP and lipoprotein variables were measured at baseline and&#xD;
      following 8 weeks. Steps counts were measured at baseline and during weeks 4 and 8 of the&#xD;
      intervention&#xD;
