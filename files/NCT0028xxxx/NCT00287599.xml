      The military is subject to traumatic wounds of various types and severity. Such wounds are&#xD;
      predisposed to infection because they 1) tend to be extensive and deep, 2) may affect areas&#xD;
      of normal carriage of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract, and the female genital tract, 3) typically produce tissue damage, 4) may&#xD;
      introduce foreign bodies, 5) may interfere with local blood supply, 6) tend to produce&#xD;
      ischemia, edema and hemorrhage, 7) may be complicated by fractures or burns and 8) may lead&#xD;
      to shock and overwhelming of the body's systemic defenses. It will not always be possible in&#xD;
      the military setting to cleanse and debride the wound promptly and effectively or to promptly&#xD;
      provide surgery in the event of damage to vital structures. In the active military setting,&#xD;
      the probability of wound infection following trauma is relatively high. In the absence of&#xD;
      rapid identification of infecting flora and provision of information on antimicrobial&#xD;
      susceptibility, clinicians must resort to empiric therapy rather than a tailored therapy.&#xD;
      There is a tendency to use one of the top available agents that would likely be active&#xD;
      against the vast majority of bacteria. This leads to increases in antimicrobial resistance,&#xD;
      an important problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of molecular biology techniques will provide&#xD;
      identification of the microorganisms responsible for wound infection more rapidly and&#xD;
      accurately. The investigators will evaluate real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction)&#xD;
      technique under this proposal. This procedure can be applied directly to material from the&#xD;
      wound without need for first growing the organisms. It can be used to define the total flora&#xD;
      of the wound within five hours. The investigators will first develop primers and probes that&#xD;
      will detect the various bacteria anticipated in a given wound in a certain location. These&#xD;
      primers and probes will be used in real-time PCR for rapid and accurate identification of the&#xD;
      wound flora. The information obtained with real-time PCR is quantitative so that one may&#xD;
      judge the relative importance of different isolates. The investigators will also use another&#xD;
      molecular approach, 16S rRNA gene cloning, and conventional cultures; these will provide&#xD;
      further information about the flora of various wounds. Definitive identification of anaerobes&#xD;
      can be provided quickly and that, along with information on usual antimicrobial&#xD;
      susceptibility patterns, can be life-saving or shorten the course of the infection&#xD;
      considerably.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Wound infections are typically mixed, with both anaerobic and non-anaerobic&#xD;
      bacteria present and there are usually more anaerobes than aerobes (for example, in&#xD;
      perforated or gangrenous appendicitis, we have found an average of 9 anaerobes and 3&#xD;
      aerobes). Many clinical laboratories do limited anaerobic bacteriology, using commercial kits&#xD;
      based on inadequate phenotypic characteristics and inaccurate taxonomy. As a result,&#xD;
      physicians and surgeons must treat wound infections empirically and tend to use drugs active&#xD;
      against the most resistant anaerobes which leads to increased resistance to antimicrobials.&#xD;
      Molecular techniques now available permit accurate and rapid characterization of&#xD;
      microorganisms, both aerobic and anaerobic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Hypothesis: The use of molecular biology techniques will provide identification of&#xD;
      the microorganisms responsible for wound infection both more rapidly and more accurately. The&#xD;
      current conventional method of culture and identification by phenotypic testing is slow and&#xD;
      inaccurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: 1) Develop a rapid identification method, to include quantitation, for&#xD;
      important wound pathogens, 2) Analyze bacterial flora of wound infection by molecular means&#xD;
      and by conventional culturing; both tissue biopsies and pus will be studied by both&#xD;
      methodologies, 3) Determine the incidence and significance of the so-called &quot;uncultivable&quot;&#xD;
      flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: We will study 50 postoperative and traumatic wound infections and 50 closed&#xD;
      soft tissue abscesses in intravenous drug abusers annually, from a general surgical service&#xD;
      at Olive View County Hospital, affiliated with UCLA and the VA Medical Center West Los&#xD;
      Angeles, in collaboration with Dr. Robert Bennion. Whenever possible, we will obtain tissue&#xD;
      biopsies from the active edge of the wound for processing, along with pus from the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will develop species-specific primers/probes for organisms that are encountered in&#xD;
      different types of wound infections based on information about the flora of wound infection&#xD;
      obtained from previous studies by our group and others and supplemented with primers/probes&#xD;
      made from cultural isolates not previously encountered. The primers and probes will be used&#xD;
      in a high-throughput procedure (real-time PCR) that permits rapid identification and&#xD;
      quantitation of organisms. The entire procedure, including both DNA extraction and real-time&#xD;
      PCR, can be completed within 5 hours for one sample. Multiple samples can be done&#xD;
      concurrently. While it may be necessary to start therapy empirically, it will be possible to&#xD;
      change to more appropriate antimicrobial agents when the bacteriologic data becomes available&#xD;
      in 5 hours. Concurrently, we will utilize another molecular approach, 16S rRNA gene cloning,&#xD;
      to analyze the total flora of the sample. We will first amplify 16S rRNA genes using&#xD;
      universal (all bacteria) primers by PCR of DNA extracted from the sample. Then, a clone&#xD;
      library will be constructed in E. coli and all clones will be studied by 16S rDNA sequencing&#xD;
      of ~1500 base pairs. This permits detection of organisms called &quot;uncultivable&quot;, as well as&#xD;
      organisms that can be cultured successfully. Any &quot;uncultivable&quot; organisms that are&#xD;
      encountered frequently may be important; therefore, we will develop primers and probes for&#xD;
      their rapid identification and we will use a variety of techniques to attempt to cultivate&#xD;
      these (we have done this successfully in a few cases already). At the same time as the&#xD;
      molecular approaches are being done, we will use conventional cultural processing. The&#xD;
      cultural approach will provide organisms for additional study (especially for antimicrobial&#xD;
      susceptibility testing) and will serve as the current standard for comparison with the newer&#xD;
      molecular approaches. Culture will be done semiquantitatively and identification will be done&#xD;
      by 16S rDNA sequencing supplemented by phenotypic testing as indicated. The cultural approach&#xD;
      typically takes several days to isolate the organisms in pure culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two molecular approaches will be compared with the conventional cultural approach in&#xD;
      terms of organisms detected; each specimen will be studied by all techniques, for comparative&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: The speed of the various identification schemes indicated above shows clearly that&#xD;
      we would be able to provide accurate, quantitative identification (more accurate than by the&#xD;
      conventional cultural approach) a great deal sooner than has been possible in the past. This&#xD;
      should lead to much earlier application of the most appropriate therapy and minimize empiric&#xD;
      use of our most powerful agents. This is likely to result in improved clinical outcome, less&#xD;
      chance for antimicrobial resistance, and cost savings as well. It will provide us with a much&#xD;
      more accurate picture of the infecting flora of various surgical wounds and the antimicrobial&#xD;
      susceptibility pattern of these organisms. We will learn whether, as in burn wound&#xD;
      infections, quantitative study of tissue biopsies will provide a better picture of the true&#xD;
      infecting flora than conventional wound cultures. We will learn whether &quot;uncultivable&quot;&#xD;
      bacteria (which actually make up the greatest percentage of the indigenous flora of the bowel&#xD;
      and the upper respiratory tract) are important clinically or not. Finally, we will develop a&#xD;
      more complete set of primers/probes to improve the molecular approach.&#xD;
