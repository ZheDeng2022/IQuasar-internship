  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is two-fold. The first is to establish that bone mineral density is&#xD;
      diminished among children admitted to this regional burn center as compared to healthy&#xD;
      non-burned children. The second purpose of this study is to examine the short and long-term&#xD;
      effects of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in on bone metabolism and accrual in&#xD;
      children who have been burned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: 1) To measure bone mineral content and bone mineral density and their change&#xD;
      during growth in convalescent burned children admitted to a regional burn center and to&#xD;
      compare them to normal, healthy children.; 2) To measure lean body mass, fat mass, total body&#xD;
      water in convalescent burned children admitted to a regional burn center and compare them to&#xD;
      normal, healthy children with focus on how these components of body composition relate to&#xD;
      indices of bone mineral content and density; 3) To identify alterations in bone metabolism&#xD;
      and calcium and vitamin D homeostasis following burn injury and relate these to bone mineral&#xD;
      density in burned children; 4) To test the effect of short term calcium and vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation on improving bone mineral density, bone mineral content, and indices of&#xD;
      calcium and vitamin D metabolism in acutely burned children.&#xD;

      The 60 acute patients will be randomized into 4 groups. Acute patients must be enrolled&#xD;
      within 3 weeks of their admission to be eligible for study. Treatment is defined as provision&#xD;
      of a supplement of 1000 mg elemental calcium with 400 IU of vitamin D daily as available in&#xD;
      our standard hospital formulary and deemed appropriate by the pharmacist. Group 1 will take&#xD;
      the supplement of from the day of enrollment in the study to the time of wound closure. Each&#xD;
      group will consist of 15 patients. Upon enrollment into the study, 10 mL of blood will be&#xD;
      obtained to measure baseline 25 and 1,25 vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, vitamin D binding protein, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-6 . The patients will&#xD;
      be randomized into one of 4 groups: the early treatment group (Group 1), late treatment group&#xD;
      (Group 2), total treatment group (Group 3) and the no treatment group (Group 4). Group 1 will&#xD;
      take a supplement of 1000 mg calcium with 400 IU of vitamin D daily during their early acute&#xD;
      phase of care (from the day of enrollment in the study until the time of wound closure).&#xD;
      Group 2 will take the supplement during their rehabilitation phase of care (from the time of&#xD;
      wound closure to the time of discharge). Group 3 will take the supplement for the entire&#xD;
      duration of their stay (from the time of enrollment into the study to the time of discharge).&#xD;
      Group 4 will receive no supplement. Patients who have a DXA scan of less than -2 SD units and&#xD;
      who are in a group that is not receiving a supplement at that time (Groups 1 or 4), will&#xD;
      begin supplementation (1000 mg calcium and 400 international units vitamin D) as part of&#xD;
      routine care. They will remain in the study for monitoring and reporting of results. Blood&#xD;
      levels as described above for baseline assessment will be repeated every 4 weeks for all&#xD;
      acute patients during their initial hospital admission. At the time of wound closure, all&#xD;
      acute patients will have their bone mineral content, bone mineral density, lean body mass,&#xD;
      fat mass and total body water measured. This will be repeated immediately prior to discharge&#xD;
      and at their next 2 planned reconstructive admissions (approximately 6 months to 1 year; and&#xD;
      again at 2 years). A 10 mL blood draw to measure biochemical indices as described above will&#xD;
      be obtained during these repeat hospital admissions as well.&#xD;
