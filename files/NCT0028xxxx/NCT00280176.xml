      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving bortezomib and fluorouracil together with radiation&#xD;
      therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when&#xD;
      given together with fluorouracil and external-beam radiation therapy in treating patients&#xD;
      with stage II, stage III, or stage IV rectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when administered in combination with&#xD;
           fluorouracil and external beam radiotherapy as preoperative or palliative treatment in&#xD;
           patients with stage II-IV rectal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the dose-effect relationship of bortezomib on NF-kappa B activation induced by&#xD;
           chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine downstream events induced by NF-kappa B activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine downstream events related to activation of p53 in response to treatment with&#xD;
           chemoradiotherapy and bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the rate of complete pathologic remission in patients who undergo surgical&#xD;
           resection of their primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the gene expression pattern of tumors by cDNA microarray analysis before and&#xD;
           during treatment with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 and fluorouracil IV&#xD;
      continuously on days 2-38. Patients also undergo external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for&#xD;
      5½ weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo tissue biopsy at baseline and on days 1 and 2. Samples are collected and&#xD;
      evaluated by tissue microarray analysis for NF-kappa B pathway activation; cDNA analysis,&#xD;
      RNase protection assay, and immunohistochemistry for analysis of downstream events induced by&#xD;
      NF-kappa B activation; and modified TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end label for analysis of&#xD;
      apoptosis by DNA fragmentation. NF-kappa B subunits are quantified by enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay. Serum samples are collected at baseline and stored for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
