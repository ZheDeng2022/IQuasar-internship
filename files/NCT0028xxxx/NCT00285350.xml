  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MM) in combination with prednisone as the&#xD;
      initial form of immunosuppression in patients with acquired myasthenia gravis (MG).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      80 patients with seropositive MG at 18 academic centers will be randomized to 3 months of&#xD;
      treatment with 2.5 gm MM/day (1,250 mg q 12 hours, +/- 2 hours) plus 20 mg prednisone/day&#xD;
      versus placebo plus 20 mg/day prednisone. The primary measure of efficacy will be the change&#xD;
      from baseline in Quantitative MG (QMG) score at the end of 3 months. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures include survival analysis for treatment failure, MG-related impairment of daily&#xD;
      activities, functional assessment, manual muscle testing, SF-36 Health Status, and serum&#xD;
      concentration of antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor. Study completers will have the&#xD;
      option of taking open-label MM for an additional 6 months, during which prednisone will be&#xD;
      reduced to the lowest dose necessary to maintain the optimum clinical response.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Acquired generalized MG diagnosed by one of the Principal Investigators based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Examination by site PI showing myasthenic weakness that is not limited to the&#xD;
                  ocular or peri-ocular muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Elevated acetylcholine receptor antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Positive edrophonium chloride test or abnormal neuromuscular transmission&#xD;
                  demonstrated by single fiber EMG or repetitive nerve stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Aged at least 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Taking a constant dose of Mestinon for at least 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Symptom severity that would, in the judgment of the site investigator, justify&#xD;
             initiation of immunosuppressive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able and willing to comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Thymoma now or in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Plasma exchange or IVIG treatment within 90 days of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Treatment with azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medication since onset of MG. Treatment with prednisone or other&#xD;
             corticosteroids within the previous 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             â€¢ Exception: patients may have taken doses of these immunosuppressant medications that&#xD;
             are judged by the Principal Investigator to have been clinically insignificant, i.e.&#xD;
             unlikely to produce improvement in MG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant, breast-feeding or not practicing&#xD;
             effective contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Renal failure, active thyroid or hepatocellular disease, chronic infection, poorly&#xD;
             controlled cardiac disease, or any other illness, including psychiatric disease, that&#xD;
             would, in the opinion of the treating physician, make it unsafe for the patient to&#xD;
             participate or would interfere with the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Weakness affecting only ocular or peri-ocular muscles (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of&#xD;
             America Class I).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Severe weakness predominantly affecting oropharyngeal, respiratory muscles or both&#xD;
             (MGFA Class IVB).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Crisis or impending crisis (defined as FVC &lt;10ml/Kg or bulbar weakness severe enough&#xD;
             to compromise airway protection.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Hemoglobin &lt;10mg/dl; WBC &lt;3,500.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of non-compliance with treatment and office visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Thymectomy within 12 months before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Concurrent medical condition that would pose an unacceptable risk from&#xD;
             immunosuppression, including a positive skin test for tuberculosis (PPD), unless the&#xD;
             patient has previously received appropriate treatment.&#xD;
