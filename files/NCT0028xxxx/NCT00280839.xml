      Cigarette smoking is a pernicious national and global public health problem.1, 2 Nearly 50&#xD;
      million Americans smoke cigarettes despite widely publicized and acknowledged health warnings&#xD;
      and restrictions on public smoking. Smoking has been branded as the most important&#xD;
      preventable cause of all deaths in the United States (US), and 45% of smokers will die of&#xD;
      tobacco related disorders.3, 4 Tobacco dependence is mediated, in part, by the reinforcing&#xD;
      effects of nicotine.5 According to the US Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline,&#xD;
      Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, every patient attempting to stop smoking should be&#xD;
      offered pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.6 Pharmacological treatment strategies have&#xD;
      included nicotine replacement therapy (NRT (nicotine formulations)), antagonist therapy&#xD;
      (mecamylamine), therapies to make nicotine intake aversive (silver acetate), non-nicotine&#xD;
      medications that mimic some of nicotine's neurophysiological effects (antidepressants), and&#xD;
      medications to block craving and withdrawal symptoms (nicotine formulations, antidepressants,&#xD;
      clonidine). A number of drug therapies for smoking cessation have demonstrated some efficacy&#xD;
      in facilitating smoking cessation. These include NRT using a variety of nicotine formulations&#xD;
      (e.g., pill, gum, patch, etc.);7-14 combined nicotine replacement and mecamylamine;15 the&#xD;
      antidepressants, bupropion SR,16-19 nortriptyline,19-21 doxepin,22 and fluoxetine;23, 24 the&#xD;
      alpha2 agonist, clonidine;25-27 and the anxiolytic, buspirone.28 Among these agents,&#xD;
      first-line pharmacotherapies approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that&#xD;
      include bupropion SR and various NRT products have been found to approximately double&#xD;
      long-term abstinence rates compared with placebo.29-31 However, roughly 7 to 8 out of 10&#xD;
      individuals who use these medications do not achieve long-term abstinence. I n addition to&#xD;
      the limitations of currently available treatments for smoking cessation, several other&#xD;
      clinical factors complicate the treatment of nicotine dependence. First, patients with a&#xD;
      history of major depressive disorder appear to have a lower likelihood of achieving sustained&#xD;
      smoking abstinence and an increased risk of depressive symptom emergence than patients&#xD;
      without a history of major depressive disorder.32-44 Second, the emergence of prominent mood&#xD;
      symptoms associated with nicotine withdrawal (e.g., anxiety, dysphoric or depressed mood,&#xD;
      insomnia, irritability, and restlessness) reduce the likelihood of abstinence.35, 37, 44&#xD;
      Third, appetite increases and weight gain are also components of nicotine withdrawal and have&#xD;
      negative health consequences.30, 45 Activation of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system&#xD;
      has been implicated in the reinforcing and dependence-producing effects of nicotine.46, 47&#xD;
      However, attempts to ameliorate the symptoms of nicotine dependence/withdrawal using DA&#xD;
      receptors as therapeutic targets has met with only modest success.48, 49 Recent studies in&#xD;
      rodents suggest that glutamatergic activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors within&#xD;
      the ventral tegmentum (VT) may be needed for nicotine to stimulate dopamine release in the&#xD;
      nucleus accumbens.50-52 These findings are consistent with the reduction of nicotine-induced&#xD;
      increases in locomotor activity observed with microinfusion of ionotropic glutamate receptor&#xD;
      antagonists.53, 54 Thus, agents that indirectly modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission in&#xD;
      the mesocorticolimbic reward circuit via their effects on presynaptic glutamatergic inputs to&#xD;
      these dopamine neurons offer promise as novel adjuvants in the treatment of nicotine&#xD;
      addiction.&#xD;
