      Specific Aims - We propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to study the&#xD;
      effectiveness and tolerability of adding risperidone to stable yet only partially remitted&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia maintained on clozapine. We anticipate enrolling a total of 40&#xD;
      subjects over a period of two years at the Freedom Trail Clinic and affiliated sites in&#xD;
      Boston, Massachusetts. Our primary outcome measure will be change in total score on the&#xD;
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Secondary hypotheses are (1) that the&#xD;
      clozapine-risperidone combination is well tolerated, (2) that clozapine levels will not be&#xD;
      influenced by risperidone, and (3) that prolactin elevation is suitable as a surrogate marker&#xD;
      of sufficient D2 blockade to predict response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background - Despite a new generation of antipsychotics, many patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      achieve only partial syndromal remission. In an effort to improve symptomatic and functional&#xD;
      outcomes, it has become common practice to combine antipsychotic medications. Since this&#xD;
      strategy is largely unproven and expensive, empirical trials are urgently needed. Our group&#xD;
      has found in an open trial that adding risperidone to clozapine was well tolerated and led to&#xD;
      improvement in psychopathology. Additional support for increasing D2 blockade in clozapine&#xD;
      partial responders comes form two small studies using sulpiride and pimozide. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that there is a subgroup of patients who might benefit from additional D2 blockade beyond&#xD;
      what clozapine alone accomplishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods - The proposed trial will be placebo-controlled, randomized, and double-blind, and it&#xD;
      will last 8 weeks. We expect to enroll 40 subjects overall. Subjects will be eligible if they&#xD;
      are diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with clozapine. In addition, they must have&#xD;
      residual symptoms of schizophrenia as we are interested in improvement of residual&#xD;
      psychopathology. Subjects with dementia or mental retardation as well as pregnant women will&#xD;
      be excluded. After a 2-week placebo lead-in period to assure stable psychopathology and&#xD;
      minimize placebo-response, subjects will be randomly allocated to receive 6 weeks of either&#xD;
      risperidone (20 subjects), or matching placebo (20 subjects) added onto their customary&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication, clozapine. Overall, there are 5 study visits every 2 weeks plus the&#xD;
      initial screening visit. On each visit, subjects will be evaluated with standard psychiatric&#xD;
      rating scales of psychopathology and side effects. In addition, we will measure serum levels&#xD;
      of the medications used, clozapine and risperidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting glucose will be measured at screening, week 4, and week 8 visits. This is done to&#xD;
      monitor subjects for worsening glucose control. This is a possible concern due to the&#xD;
      association between atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, and hyperglycemia.&#xD;
      Subjects who are discovered to either have diabetes or develop diabetes during the study, or&#xD;
      who have worsening glucose control if diabetic, will be discontinued and referred to their&#xD;
      PCP for further work-up and treatment. This additional blood test will not lead to additional&#xD;
      blood draws but will simply be added to the subject's routine and mandated biweekly WBC&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study endpoint will be a 20% improvement on our primary rating scale of psychopathology,&#xD;
      the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). No worsening of psychopathology is expected&#xD;
      in this trial as subjects are maintained on primary antipsychotic, clozapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits - There are no definite benefits to participating in this trial. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive a thorough psychiatric evaluation, a review of their pharmacologic treatment, and a&#xD;
      physical exam with some baseline laboratory studies. The results of the initial evaluation&#xD;
      will be communicated to the treating psychiatrist. Subjects will receive a nominal fee of $20&#xD;
      per study visit (5 study visits are scheduled overall).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has direct clinical applications, and it is of theoretical interest. Few&#xD;
      data are available from controlled trials to guide clinicians when patients remain&#xD;
      symptomatic on clozapine. From a conceptual standpoint, the study will clarify the value of&#xD;
      additional D2 blockade for treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Discomforts - Risperidone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The dose of 4 mg is on the lower end of the dosing recommendations and is&#xD;
      usually well tolerated. Possible side effects are sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms,&#xD;
      akathisia, hyperprolactinemia, or orthostatic hypotension. Tardive dyskinesia is a long-term&#xD;
      side effect and would not be expected in a 6-week trial. However, existing tardive dyskinesia&#xD;
      could worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood drawing entails transient discomfort, and it might lead to a hematoma at the site.&#xD;
      Being interviewed for clinical symptoms with the help of rating scales can be tiring and&#xD;
      upsetting if sensitive psychological experiences are discussed. There is also an association&#xD;
      between atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, and hyperglycemia, requiring some&#xD;
      monitoring of blood sugars during treatment. No inpatient hospital time is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimization of Risks - To minimized discomfort from blood draws, the study blood work will&#xD;
      be added onto the mandatory blood draws that subjects undergo because they receive clozapine.&#xD;
      Vital signs will be monitored at baseline and every two weeks. Side effects will be monitored&#xD;
      at baseline and every two weeks. The Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events&#xD;
      (SAFTEE) will be the primary instrument used to detect side effects. The SAFTEE will be used&#xD;
      to tabulate side effects for the yearly IRB summary. Serious adverse events, as well as&#xD;
      adverse events, will be reviewed by the PI and reported to the IRB according to institutional&#xD;
      policy. The PIs in our group meet weekly to review study protocols and study events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting glucose will be measured at screening, week 4, and week 8 visits. This is done to&#xD;
      monitor subjects for worsening glucose control. This is a possible concern due to the&#xD;
      association between atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, and hyperglycemia.&#xD;
      Subjects who are discovered to either have diabetes or develop diabetes during the study or&#xD;
      who have worsening glucose control (poor glucose control as judged by new-onset diabetes or&#xD;
      new-onset glucose intolerance.) will be discontinued and referred to their primary care&#xD;
      physician (PCP) for further work-up and treatment. In patients with established diabetes, the&#xD;
      six weeks of active treatment will not be long enough to meaningfully judge if diabetes&#xD;
      control is more difficult than usual (typical parameters of glucose control such as&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1C are a reflection of long-term glucose control, i.e. several months). We will&#xD;
      follow those patients clinically in cooperation with the PCP to decide if patients can stay&#xD;
      in the trial. This additional blood test will not lead to additional blood draws but will&#xD;
      simply be added to the subject's routine and mandated biweekly white blood cell count&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they become suicidal or deteriorate&#xD;
      psychiatrically. This will be assessed every 2 weeks using the PANSS and Calgary Depression&#xD;
      Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS): clinical deterioration will be defined as a 20% increase in&#xD;
      total PANSS scores, and suicidality will be defined as a rating of &quot;mild&quot; (frequent thoughts&#xD;
      of being better off dead, or occasional thought of suicide) on the CDSS. Subjects who have&#xD;
      worsening symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD) will be discontinued and referred to their&#xD;
      psychiatrist for further work-up and treatment (Worsening TD as judged by 20% increase in&#xD;
      Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)).&#xD;
