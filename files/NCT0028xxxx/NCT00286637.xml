      The purpose of this research is to evaluate novel technologies for the assessment of ocular&#xD;
      structure and function, including the scanning device called Optical Coherence Tomography&#xD;
      (OCT). We will test the OCT and other devices in their ability to image diseases of the eye&#xD;
      and also compare the measurements made with OCT to those of other imaging and visual field&#xD;
      devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). OCT may be useful for the early&#xD;
      diagnosis and monitoring of a variety of types of eye diseases&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate a new technology, optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT), to image diseases of the eye and to compare the measurements obtained using OCT with&#xD;
      those of other imaging and visual field devices. OCT may be useful for the early diagnosis&#xD;
      and monitoring of a variety of eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (ARMD),&#xD;
      glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and other pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three sub-studies: cross-sectional, longitudinal and reproducibility. The&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal arms study the effectiveness of the OCT technology in terms&#xD;
      of detecting and monitoring eye diseases. The reproducibility study is designed to test the&#xD;
      measurement likeness of the OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a continuation of an ongoing study from the New England Eye Center (NEEC), Tufts&#xD;
      Medical Center, Boston, MA. This study started when our research group was located at NEEC&#xD;
      and in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where we conducted&#xD;
      the first clinical studies with OCT. The first investigation using OCT was published in&#xD;
      Science in 1991 and showed in vitro imaging of the human retina and atherosclerotic plaque.&#xD;
      We developed an OCT prototype system for performing preliminary ophthalmic clinical studies&#xD;
      and in 1993, began clinical OCT imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prototype ophthalmic OCT instrument acquired OCT images of the retina with an axial&#xD;
      resolution of 10µm within an acquisition time of 2.5 sec. The OCT imaging system was&#xD;
      integrated with a slit-lamp biomicroscope for in vivo tomography of the anterior and&#xD;
      posterior eye. The beam is directed into the eye using computer controlled galvonometric&#xD;
      scanners, which can scan arbitrary transverse patterns. The beam focus is coincident with the&#xD;
      slit-lamp image plane to permit simultaneous scanning and visualization of the eye through&#xD;
      the slit-lamp or via a CCD camera. For tomography of the anterior eye, the microscope is&#xD;
      focused directly on the structure, while for retinal imaging, a lens relay images of the&#xD;
      retina onto the slit-lamp image plane. A computer provides real-time display of the tomogram,&#xD;
      image processing, and data management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT technology was patented and subsequently transferred to industry (Zeiss Humphrey Systems,&#xD;
      CA). Our prototype ophthalmic OCT system was developed into a clinical instrument and was&#xD;
      introduced into the ophthalmic market in 1996. The commercial OCT technology has an axial&#xD;
      resolution of 10 µm and can acquire a 100 transverse pixel retinal tomogram in 1 second. A&#xD;
      third generation ophthalmic OCT imaging device, OCT3, was introduced three years ago. OCT&#xD;
      imaging is now used as a standard diagnostic procedure as part of an ophthalmic examination&#xD;
      for many retina and glaucoma patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)&#xD;
      Eye Center and New England Eye Center (NEEC). OCT imaging is in use in major research and&#xD;
      clinical centers internationally. The OCT has been approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration for use in ophthalmology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT enables tissue pathology to be imaged in situ and in real time with a resolution&#xD;
      approaching that of conventional histopathology but without the need for excising and&#xD;
      processing specimens. OCT provides a quantitative method of directly measuring ocular&#xD;
      structures with high precision and could provide an objective, early diagnosis for glaucoma,&#xD;
      age related macular degeneration (ARMD), diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and other&#xD;
      pathologies. Extensive studies have been performed with OCT in cross-sectional as well as&#xD;
      longitudinal setting. In this ongoing protocol, our objective is to continue these studies&#xD;
      using the commercial ophthalmic OCT imaging instruments to develop methods for early&#xD;
      detection and improve longitudinal assessment for the above mentioned ocular pathologies.&#xD;
