      Patients enrolled on this study will have been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      which cannot be removed by an operation. The standard treatment for this disease is a&#xD;
      combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy; however, the best way to combine these&#xD;
      treatments is not known. This study will examine if the combination of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy has an increased effect on slowing tumor growth with the addition of a drug&#xD;
      called ZD1839.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, chemotherapy will be given initially (induction therapy) to try to control the&#xD;
      spread of the cancer. Then radiation and chemotherapy will be given together. Receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy at the same time as radiation treatments can enhance the effect of the&#xD;
      radiation. In this study, patients will receive a drug called ZD1839. In laboratory tests on&#xD;
      cancer cells, ZD1839 has shown an additive effect when used in combination with radiation.&#xD;
      ZD1839 has also been shown to slow or stop growth in tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the side effects and effectiveness of using ZD1839&#xD;
      when used with radiation in this treatment regimen (induction chemotherapy followed by&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy, ZD1839, and radiation therapy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. In&#xD;
      2002, approximately 170,000 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed, and approximately&#xD;
      160,000 deaths will occur. Eighty percent of cases of lung cancer are of the non-small cell&#xD;
      type, and 30 to 35% will be Stage IIIA/B and are considered potentially curable. The standard&#xD;
      of care in the United States for those patients with unresectable Stage IIIA/B and a good&#xD;
      performance status (PS) is a combination of systemic chemotherapy and thoracic radiation&#xD;
      therapy (TRT). What is not clear in the management of these patients is the optimal strategy&#xD;
      to employ in the combined-modality approach, as well as the optimal chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation therapy dose and schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction and Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy for Stage IIIA/B NSCLC The use of combined&#xD;
      modality has become the standard of care in unresectable Stage IIIA/B non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC). In the curative approach to this disease, both local control and eradication&#xD;
      of occult micrometastatic disease must be achieved. Combined-modality trials employing&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy have suggested a reduction in the rate of metastatic disease,&#xD;
      suggesting that effectively delivered chemotherapy can eradicate occult micrometastatic&#xD;
      disease. All of the trials cited have shown improved survival for the combined-modality arm.&#xD;
      Combined-modality trials employing concurrent chemoradiation have suggested improved&#xD;
      loco-regional control resulting in improved survival. These data suggest that both induction&#xD;
      and concurrent treatment may be important and may exert their benefit in different manners:&#xD;
      induction therapy with effective chemotherapy reduces the rate of overt metastatic disease,&#xD;
      while concurrent treatment improves local control by enhancing the local effect of TRT. Four&#xD;
      trials to date have been published addressing sequential versus concurrent therapy. In these&#xD;
      trials, concurrent treatment yielded improved survival over the sequential approach. The&#xD;
      value of either induction or consolidation therapy in addition to concurrent chemotherapy is&#xD;
      currently being addressed in randomized Phase III trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the incorporation of ZD1839 with concurrent CP and TCRT to a dose of&#xD;
      74 Gy following 2 cycles of induction CIP. The primary objective will be to define the&#xD;
      toxicity profile of this approach. With amendment 2, patients will no longer receive&#xD;
      maintenance ZD1839. Given the data generated on LCCC 9603 and 2001, this &quot;hybrid&quot; platform of&#xD;
      induction CIP followed by concurrent TCRT (74 Gy) and CP seems appropriate for incorporation&#xD;
      of ZD1839 because of the general tolerance of this therapy in good PS, unresectable, Stage&#xD;
      III NSCLC subjects. Given that esophagitis is the primary toxicity seen with this approach,&#xD;
      stopping rules will be in place for excessive esophageal toxicity.&#xD;
