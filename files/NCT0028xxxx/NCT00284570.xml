      First, we, the researchers, hope to find out the PCT response to heart surgery in children by&#xD;
      taking blood before surgery and each day for four days after surgery. These blood draws will&#xD;
      help us figure out the typical Procalcitonin (PCT) response, the normal increase in PCT after&#xD;
      heart surgery, and when the PCT level returns to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, we, the researchers, hope to determine the accuracy of PCT as a marker of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that Procalcitonin is superior to other currently used markers of infection&#xD;
      and will prove to be a clinically useful tool for evaluation of infection in children&#xD;
      following cardiac surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this research study, we want to look at the difficulty in identifying infections in&#xD;
      children who have heart surgery. We also want to look at differentiating between actual&#xD;
      infections and the normal post-surgery course that patients go through. We use a number of&#xD;
      tools in the Intensive Care Unit to pick out children at risk for an infection. These tools&#xD;
      are the physical examination, a fever, white blood cell count, and C-reactive Protein (CRP)&#xD;
      level. When a patient has an infection, they usually have a fever, have a high white blood&#xD;
      cell count, and have an increased CRP level. However, these are not always correct. The&#xD;
      identification of infection remains a challenge and the laboratory markers of infection&#xD;
      (white blood cell count and CRP) that are used now are not perfect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new marker of infection, Procalcitonin (PCT), has been found and has been tested in adults&#xD;
      and children. PCT has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a&#xD;
      marker of infection. PCT has been shown to be a more accurate marker of infection for some&#xD;
      groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior work on a small number of children shows that PCT increases shortly just from heart&#xD;
      surgery itself, even without infection. There is little information published about how&#xD;
      accurate PCT is for identifying infection in the child heart population. In order to use PCT&#xD;
      in our patients, we need to know what the normal levels of PCT are after surgery. Thus, when&#xD;
      an infection does happen, we can identify it. We also need to take PCT levels when patients&#xD;
      are thought to have infections. We will then need to watch for an infection over the next few&#xD;
      days to see if the PCT level rises and can actually predict the presence an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the Procalcitonin response to cardiopulmonary bypass in children undergoing&#xD;
           open-heart surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass causes a pro-inflammatory state in the&#xD;
           patient, and associated rise in Procalcitonin. The ability to use PCT as a marker for&#xD;
           infection will require knowledge of its typical response to bypass and the time course&#xD;
           to return to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the accuracy of Procalcitonin as a marker of infection, and to compare and&#xD;
           contrast these findings with currently used laboratory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate PCT in the postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patient as a marker for&#xD;
           infection and sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate PCT's response to cardiopulmonary bypass, and as a predictor of outcome&#xD;
           following cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare PCT to other markers of inflammation and infection (C-reactive protein and white&#xD;
           blood cell response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By doing this study, we hope to find out two things. First, we hope to find out the PCT&#xD;
      response to heart surgery in children by taking blood before surgery and each day for four&#xD;
      days after surgery. These blood draws will help us figure out the typical PCT response, the&#xD;
      normal increase in PCT after heart surgery, and when the PCT level returns to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, we hope to determine the accuracy of PCT as a marker of infection. Whenever we think&#xD;
      a patient may have an infection, it is routine care to take some blood and run lab tests such&#xD;
      as a white blood cell count, blood culture, and a C-reactive protein level. Patients in the&#xD;
      study will also have an additional 10 drops of blood taken for a PCT level at the same time&#xD;
      as the routine blood draw. Even though patients may show signs of an infection, the routine&#xD;
      blood test do not always come back positive for an infection. We will compare the routine&#xD;
      blood test results (positive or negative for an infection) with the PCT level taken at the&#xD;
      same time. If most patients with an infection also have a rise in PCT and those patients&#xD;
      without an infection have a normal PCT, then we will prove that PCT is a good, accurate&#xD;
      marker for infection in our patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will help us study infection in our patients. It will help distinguish patients&#xD;
      with infection, what the risk factors are, how they are treated, and the response to&#xD;
      infection. This information will potentially allow us to use an improved test for identifying&#xD;
      infection in a high-risk population of children. Patients in the research project will&#xD;
      continue to receive the standard of care treatment after heart surgery and there will be no&#xD;
      changes in their care during the study.&#xD;
