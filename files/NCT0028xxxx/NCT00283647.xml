      Exposure to lead during pregnancy, infancy, and childhood increases the individual likelihood&#xD;
      of impaired school performance, increased impulsiveness, aggression, and delinquent behavior.&#xD;
      Disorders that result from exposure to environmental neurotoxicants are a complex web of&#xD;
      interactions between genetic, neurochemical, biochemical, environmental and social factors&#xD;
      that influence children during critical periods of development. To date, research in the area&#xD;
      of human developmental neurotoxicology focuses primarily on global measures of sensory-motor&#xD;
      development and cognition. However, studies elucidating the biological basis for&#xD;
      developmental and behavioral disorders due to environmental toxicant exposure are lacking.&#xD;
      Although gross brain structure appears normal, underlying problems exist at a neural level.&#xD;
      Our proposal seeks to relate childhood environmental lead exposure at various levels and&#xD;
      stages of development with detriments in brain structure and neurochemical functioning&#xD;
      assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).&#xD;
      Cortical and subcortical brain volumes will be determined with high resolution MRI. Neuronal&#xD;
      and glial cell markers will be measured using proton MRS. These structural and chemical&#xD;
      measures will also be correlated with behavioral measures from the young adult participants&#xD;
      of the Cincinnati Lead Study (CLS). These participants represent a unique and ideal cohort of&#xD;
      approximately 240 subjects with detailed histories of exposure and behavioral outcomes in&#xD;
      lead exposed children monitored for approximately 20 years. A pilot study examining language,&#xD;
      working memory and attention in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      will also be performed to better understand the functional and behavioral deficits.&#xD;

      Overview of Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      All MRI and MRS investigations will be acquired on a 1.5 clinical MR scanner. The MRI and MRS&#xD;
      procedures will take approximately a half-hour to complete. Subjects also having fMRI&#xD;
      performed will require another scanning session on the research 3T MR scanner with one hour&#xD;
      for completion. Orientation to the scanning procedures will take place during the visit to&#xD;
      the Imaging Research Center, upon completion of informed consent. The subject will be given a&#xD;
      brief introduction to the general MR scanning procedures and demonstration of the MRI&#xD;
      machinery. Prior to beginning studies, subjects will be allowed to familiarize themselves&#xD;
      with the scanner to decrease anxiety about the experiment. Subjects will receive instruction&#xD;
      and practice in the appropriate behaviors necessary for a successful MR study. The research&#xD;
      MR technologist has over 10 years experience in pediatric neuroimaging and takes great care&#xD;
      to make subjects comfortable in the head coil so that they can remain as motionless as&#xD;
      possible for the duration of the scan. The subject is asked to select a video to watch and is&#xD;
      given the video goggles to focus and adjust to fit, immediately upon entering the scanner&#xD;
      room. Once on the table, the subject's head is restrained within a padded head holder with&#xD;
      additional foam pads, while the subject is watching the video. This arrangement is snug but&#xD;
      not uncomfortable. The subject is asked to hold a button box in one hand; this will be used&#xD;
      to make responses that will provide performance data used for validity checks on task&#xD;
      engagement as well as correlation with the activation results. A &quot;panic ball&quot; will also be&#xD;
      provided to each subject. The subjects will be carefully oriented to the equipment and&#xD;
      environment and will engage in explicit practice of all of the task requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical Localizer and High Resolution Imaging Acquisitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subjects are positioned in the scanner, the scanner will be shimmed to provide a&#xD;
      homogeneous magnetic field for image acquisition. An initial alignment scan is done in 3&#xD;
      orthogonal planes simultaneously using a fast gradient echo sequence developed for the&#xD;
      scanner. This scan takes approximately 30 seconds and provides a quick view of the subject's&#xD;
      head position. Next, a high-resolution T1-weighted 3-D neuroanatomic scan will be obtained&#xD;
      using a inversion recovery, fast spoiled gradient echo (IR-prepped FSPGR) protocol to provide&#xD;
      images for morphometric studies, localization of MRS and anatomical localization of the&#xD;
      activation maps. The acquisition takes approximately 6 minutes and yields a minimum spatial&#xD;
      resolution of 1mm x 1mm x 1.5mm with sufficient signal to noise ratio and contrast between&#xD;
      gray and white matter for both manual and semi-automated segmentation of regional brain&#xD;
      volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proton MR Spectroscopy Acquisitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proton MR spectroscopy data is acquired using the point resolved spectroscopy localization&#xD;
      (PRESS) method. Graphically, 3D cubic volume elements &quot;voxels&quot; are positioned in the anatomic&#xD;
      locations based upon the 3D images. Voxel 1 is placed in the anterior cingulate, voxel 2 the&#xD;
      left dorsalateral prefrontal cortex, voxel 3 within the basal ganglia encompassing the&#xD;
      caudate, putamen and internal capsule and voxel 4 is placed along the superior temporal&#xD;
      gyrus. Voxel 5 is used as a control and is positioned in the left centrum semiovale, a&#xD;
      believed to be unaffected white matter region. Voxels 6 and 7 are positioned within the&#xD;
      cerebellum and vermis, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional MRI Acquisitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The location of the 24 axial slices to be imaged in the fMRI procedures is identified from&#xD;
      the high resolution anatomical imaging sequence. These 24 slices, 5 millimeters thick (120&#xD;
      mm), are sufficient to cover areas extending superiorly from below the inferior aspect of the&#xD;
      cerebellum to the apex of the cerebrum in an adult brain. Subjects undergo the fMRI scan&#xD;
      sequence during which they will be asked to perform tasks which can involve language, memory&#xD;
      and attention. The protocol for the fMRI scans will be a T2 - weighted gradient -echo Echo&#xD;
      Planar Imaging (EPI) method. The time sequence of alternating periods (30 sec) of task&#xD;
      conditions is repeated 5.5 times for a total of 11 intervals with 10 acquisitions per&#xD;
      interval, resulting in 240 images. 24 image slices are acquired for each time point.&#xD;
      Synchronization of the fMRI scans with the video stimuli is fully automated so that when the&#xD;
      visual presentation commences on the Macintosh computer, it triggers the Bruker MR scanner to&#xD;
      begin acquisitions. The MacStim presentation and the fMRI scan timing are synchronized from&#xD;
      the trigger point to the end of the experiment. The high resolution MDEFT sequence allows for&#xD;
      the 24 fMRI scan planes to be extracted from this 3D anatomical data set by interpolation for&#xD;
      use as an anatomical underlay for the activation maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing paradigms&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Verb Generation task is based on that described by Binder et al. and involves the&#xD;
      auditory presentation of a series of nouns. The subject is required to generate verbs that&#xD;
      are associated with each noun. For example, if the noun &quot;ball&quot; is presented, the subject&#xD;
      might generate the verbs &quot;throw,&quot; &quot;kick,&quot; and &quot;hit.&quot; The subject is instructed to think the&#xD;
      verbs silently, without saying them, in order to minimize the motion artifact associated with&#xD;
      speech. Task performance is monitored by a button push each time the subject thinks of a&#xD;
      verb. This expressive task is assumed to require the engagement of dominant frontal lobe and&#xD;
      parietal lobe language areas. This task is derived from the clinical literature as an MRI&#xD;
      analog of the procedure used in the Wada test. It is now widely used for testing hemispheric&#xD;
      dominance for language in adults. It is included in the current protocol partly to provide a&#xD;
      point of comparison with the existing literature as well as with our own preliminary data&#xD;
      from other populations. Finally, this is a difficult semantic task and fits neatly into the&#xD;
      scope of the language skills we are seeking to monitor with lead exposed young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For studies designed to examine working memory, the &quot;n-back&quot; tasks are administered using&#xD;
      MacStim software on a Macintosh PowerBook laptop computer. The &quot;n-back&quot; is a working memory&#xD;
      task in which subjects view numbers from one to four that consistently appear in one of four&#xD;
      quadrants on the screen. Subjects view the stimuli through the audiovisual goggle system and&#xD;
      respond using a button box on which the buttons had been arranged so as to correspond with&#xD;
      the numbers appearing on the screen. In the &quot;zero back&quot; condition, subjects press the number&#xD;
      that corresponds to the number then appearing. In the &quot;two back&quot; condition, the subject&#xD;
      presses the button corresponding to the number that appeared two places prior to the number&#xD;
      then on the screen. During the fMRI scans, subjects are asked to perform the &quot;zero and two&#xD;
      back&quot; tasks in a block-periodic design. During each condition, 15 numbers appear over a 30&#xD;
      second interval. In all, 11 intervals are presented over a 5 1/2 minute scan. The &quot;zero-back&quot;&#xD;
      task serves as the contrast for the &quot;two back&quot; tasks. Data from the first &quot;zero back&quot; task&#xD;
      interval is discarded during post-processing to avoid any non-equilibrium intensity&#xD;
      modulation effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In assessing attention, the CPT-IP is administered using MacStim software and MRI compatible&#xD;
      audiovisual system. During the fMRI scans subjects are asked to perform the CPT-IP task in a&#xD;
      block-periodic design. Participants alternate between two conditions. During the first&#xD;
      condition, subjects perform in a control task during which they view a four-digit number&#xD;
      repeating at a constant rate (0.75 sec.) and are instructed to simply look at the flashing&#xD;
      number without responding in any way. During the second condition, subjects watch a series of&#xD;
      high resolution four digit numbers appearing in a random sequence and are instructed to press&#xD;
      a response button when they see any number repeat twice in a row during the sequence. Numbers&#xD;
      again appear every 0.75 sec.&#xD;
