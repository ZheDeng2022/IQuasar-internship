  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a double blind randomized clinical trial with cross-over design, treatment using&#xD;
      naratriptan will be compared to placebo within a group of 30 convicts with psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders such as psychosis or psychopathy with repeated aggressive outbursts resistant to&#xD;
      conventional psychopharmacologic and other psychotherapeutic treatment. Hypothesis is that&#xD;
      addition of naratriptan to the individual treatment regime reduces aggression -and improves&#xD;
      general outcome- as compared to addition of placebo and is well tolerated in this group and&#xD;
      under these conditions.&#xD;

      EFFICACY OF A TRIPTAN IN THE TREATMENT OF HOSTILITY AND AGGRESSION AMONG CONVICTS WITH A&#xD;
      PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT ORDER&#xD;

      University&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a large number of studies, hostility, impulsivity and aggression have been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be associated with decreased activity of the serotonergic system (Nelson and Chiavegatto&#xD;
      2001). In rodents a specific role for the serotonin-1b receptor has been reported (Olivier et&#xD;
      al. 1995) and it has been shown that specific central serotonin-1b/d agonists such as&#xD;
      lipophilic triptans have a specific anti-aggressive effect. To date, no studies have been&#xD;
      conducted on treatment of hostility, impulsivity or aggression among humans using a triptan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim is to establish the efficacy of naratriptan, registered for the treatment of migraine, as&#xD;
      an anti-aggressive agent in patients with refractory disorders of impulse control due to&#xD;
      psychosis or psychopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary question is whether or not violent behavior and aggressive incidents decrease when&#xD;
      naratriptan is administered daily in addition to treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does overall prognosis of the underlying condition improve with the intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can responders be differentiated from non-responders in terms of covariants including&#xD;
           endocrine factors and polymorphisms in areas in the genome that are involved in&#xD;
           serotonergic neurotransmission?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the triptan well tolerated in this group and in this dose-range?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample consists of male adult volunteers with a psychiatric disorder who have been&#xD;
      convicted and sentenced to undergo psychiatric treatment in Forensic Psychiatric Hospital &quot;De&#xD;
      Kijvelanden&quot; after having committed a violent crime and have in the previous year been&#xD;
      involved in violent incidents at least three times in spite of comprehensive psychiatric&#xD;
      treatment of the underlying disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention /Drug /Dosage&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the course of a four-week period either a naratriptan 2.5 mg. tablet or a placebo tablet&#xD;
      will be added twice to the daily medication in a double blind randomized fashion.&#xD;
      Subsequently, after a two-week washout, patients will cross-over towards the alternative&#xD;
      treatment condition for another four-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome will be measured using the AVL (aggression questionnaire) and the SDAS (social&#xD;
      dysfunction and aggression scale) after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of treatment. Change on the&#xD;
      CGI (Clinical Global Impression) will be compared to baseline. As usual at the study-site,&#xD;
      the SOAS-R (Staff Observation Aggression Scale) will be filled in in case of violent&#xD;
      incidents and type, number and duration of restraining interventions will be registered. Also&#xD;
      recorded will be symptoms occurring during treatment and number and cause of dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description and Estimate of Risk and Burden for Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability of both naratriptan and placebo are very well documented. Incidence&#xD;
      and nature of side-effects and interactions has been described to be low and relatively mild,&#xD;
      also with frequent (daily) use of naratriptan. Patients at risk for side-effects will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Drugs will be added to the usual medication of the participants. A&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered and blood will be collected upon inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      Data including genotype will be processed anonymously.&#xD;
