      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of testosterone replacement therapy&#xD;
      in frail elderly female hip fracture patients who have testosterone deficiency, and to obtain&#xD;
      preliminary information about the effects of testosterone therapy on muscle strength and&#xD;
      size, bone density, mobility, daily functioning, and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures are common among elderly women and can have a devastating impact on their&#xD;
      ability to remain independent. A significant functional decline following a hip fracture has&#xD;
      been documented, and many patients have persistent strength and mobility deficits that impair&#xD;
      their capacity for independent function. Such individuals are at high risk for continued&#xD;
      supportive services, recurrent injury, and institutionalization. High-risk patients include&#xD;
      those with deficits in skeletal muscle strength during the post-fracture period.&#xD;
      Age-associated androgen deficiency contributes to deficits in muscle mass and strength that&#xD;
      are common in this patient population. The role of testosterone therapy for improving&#xD;
      deficits in muscle mass, strength, and functional capacity in the frail elderly is unclear,&#xD;
      particularly for elderly women. There is insufficient information regarding tolerability of&#xD;
      testosterone therapy, and the appropriate medication dosage and target serum testosterone&#xD;
      levels necessary to induces changes in skeletal muscle mass and functional measures in&#xD;
      elderly women with physical frailty due to muscle weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this project are to conduct a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      prospective study to determine the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of 6 months of&#xD;
      testosterone therapy in community-dwelling, physically frail, elderly female hip fracture&#xD;
      patients. Twenty-seven female hip fracture patients will be recruited, using objective&#xD;
      criteria for testosterone deficiency and frailty. We plan to evaluate two dosages of&#xD;
      testosterone, administered as a 0.5% topical gel: a physiologic replacement dosage, and a&#xD;
      supraphysiologic dosage. We plan to carefully monitor testosterone levels, side effects,&#xD;
      biochemical parameters, and factors related to compliance with therapy. We plan to obtain&#xD;
      preliminary information regarding the changes in measurements of muscle strength, total score&#xD;
      on an Objective Physical Performance Test, total lean body mass by dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA), thigh cross-sectional areas by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and&#xD;
      self-reported performance of activities of daily living, and quality of life. These data will&#xD;
      be used to develop a full-scale proposal to test the long-term hypothesis that testosterone&#xD;
      therapy combined with exercise training can improve physical function after a hip fracture.&#xD;
