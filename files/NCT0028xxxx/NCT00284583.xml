  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interdigital neuroma is a painful forefoot disorder characterized by plantar pain and toe&#xD;
      paresthesias thought to result from entrapment of the interdigital nerve by the overlying&#xD;
      transverse metatarsal ligament. Multiple treatments have been recommended for this condition&#xD;
      and range from modification of shoe wear to surgical excision of the painful nerve. Serial&#xD;
      ethanol injection therapy has been reported to be an effective alternative to surgical&#xD;
      excision. However, despite wide adoption of this treatment, no randomized, double blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study exists to verify the efficacy of this treatment in comparison to&#xD;
      longer standing similar therapies, such as corticosteroid injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 patients from one Orthopaedic group's foot and ankle offices with single foot neuromas&#xD;
      and no previous history of neuroma or foot disorder treatment will be selected for the study.&#xD;
      These patients will be randomized to three treatments, specifically lidocaine injection,&#xD;
      corticosteroid injection, or ethanol injection. Outcomes will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      month time points using validated questionnaires as well as a non-validated disease specific&#xD;
      questionnaire. Primary endpoint will be graded change in the physical function portion of the&#xD;
      SF-36 form. Secondary endpoints will be the graded change in the McGill Short Form for Pain&#xD;
      and ultimate satisfaction with treatment as assessed by a non-validated questionnaire&#xD;
      designed for Morton's neuroma symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interdigital neuroma, or Morton's Neuroma, is a painful forefoot disorder characterized by&#xD;
      plantar pain and paresthesias radiating to toes. The condition was first described in 1845 by&#xD;
      Lewis Durlacher as a painful &quot;neuralgic affection&quot; of the plantar nerve between the third and&#xD;
      fourth metatarsals. T.G. Morton, in 1876, attributed the painful symptom complex to a&#xD;
      &quot;neuroma.&quot; His observation was confirmed by Hoadley who, in 1893, performed a curative&#xD;
      excision of a &quot;neuroma&quot; between the third and fourth metatarsals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current understanding of interdigital neuroma is based on Gauthier's conclusion in 1979 that&#xD;
      the symptom complex was a result of an entrapment neuropathy of the interdigital nerve by the&#xD;
      overlying transverse metatarsal ligament. Presently, no definitive single etiology has been&#xD;
      confirmed. Additional potential pathoetiologies include the aberrant anatomy of the plantar&#xD;
      nerve in this location, trauma and extrinsic mass effect above or below the level of the&#xD;
      transverse metatarsal ligament.(3,6) The histological appearance of the affected nerve,&#xD;
      however, is consistent and suggests that &quot;neuroma&quot; is a misnomer for this condition. The&#xD;
      nerve tissue demonstrates demyelination and deposition of amorphous eosinophilic material,&#xD;
      but no exuberant proliferation of nerve endings characteristic of neuroma.(3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple treatments have been recommended for the management of interdigital neuroma. The&#xD;
      usual algorithm begins with an attempt at conservative therapy consisting of shoe wear&#xD;
      modifications and the application of a metatarsal pad. Failure of conservative management may&#xD;
      prompt a trial of corticosteroid injections.(8) Persistent symptoms ultimately require&#xD;
      surgical excision or division of the transverse metatarsal ligament, both of which have good&#xD;
      long term outcomes in literature.(2,7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, serial ethanol injection therapy has been reported to be an effective alternative&#xD;
      to surgical excision and has been widely adopted in the treatment of Morton's neuroma.&#xD;
      Dockery et. al. reported 89% success rate in a series of 100 consecutive patients treated&#xD;
      with 3 to 7 injections of 4% ethanol solutions with an average follow-up of 13 months.&#xD;
      Fanucci and Masala reported a 90% success rate at 10 month follow-up after 3 to 7 injections&#xD;
      of 30% alcohol in a consecutive series of 40 patients. However, none of these studies were&#xD;
      performed in a randomized, double blinded fashion with adequate controls. Therefore, no&#xD;
      scientifically valid conclusions concerning treatment efficacy can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study investigates alcohol sclerosing therapy for the treatment of Morton's&#xD;
      neuroma in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The primary end&#xD;
      point will be evaluation of patient physical function according to the standardized SF-36&#xD;
      questionnaire after the treatment period. Secondary end points include evaluation of pain and&#xD;
      satisfaction levels after treatment using, respectively, a standardized and a novel&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
