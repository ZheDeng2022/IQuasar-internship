  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, single-center evaluation of the Cypher™ Sirolimus&#xD;
      eluting coronary stent system in the treatment of de novo bifurcated coronary lesions&#xD;
      comparing provisional modified T stenting with systematic modified T-stenting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bifurcations involving a significant side branch (SB diameter ≥ 2.25 mm) occur in&#xD;
      approximately 15-20% of all coronary lesions considered for percutaneous intervention. If a&#xD;
      side branch (SB) subtends significant myocardium, failure to preserve SB vessel patency can&#xD;
      lead to complications such as myocardial infarction or persistent chest pain despite full&#xD;
      patency of the main branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bifurcation lesions are inherently complex and interventional treatment remains a challenging&#xD;
      problem for physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal technique for stenting bifurcated lesions is still unknown. Several dual vessel&#xD;
      stenting techniques have been described in the literature, such as &quot;T&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Culotte&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;Crush&quot; procedures. However, most studies of bifurcation stenting have found that optimal&#xD;
      long-term results are obtained by stenting the main vessel and then performing plain balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty of the side branch (&quot;kissing balloon&quot;-technique). Nevertheless, occlusion or&#xD;
      reduced flow of the SB are frequent after stenting of the MB. Therefore, the SB is stented in&#xD;
      approximately 50% of procedures even if PTCA alone was intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with plain dilatation of side branch, the placement of Cypher-Stent in side branch&#xD;
      using modified T-stenting technique will reduce &quot;in-segment percent diameter stenosis&quot; of the&#xD;
      side branch at 9 months post procedure as measured by quantitative coronary angiography.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. The target vessel must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Bifurcated lesion Type 1, 2, 3 or 4 of a native coronary artery with a reference&#xD;
                  vessel diameter of 2.5 mm to 4.0 mm in the main branch and of ≥ 2.25 mm in the&#xD;
                  side branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The target lesion (main branch and / or side branch) must be at least 50%&#xD;
                  diameter stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The target lesion has not been previously treated with any interventional&#xD;
                  procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. The target vessel (main branch and side branch) must be feasible for stent&#xD;
                  implantation (successful passage with the guide wire; successful predilatation&#xD;
                  with an appropriately sized balloon; no heavy calcification; no diffuse distal&#xD;
                  disease that might impede run off).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Patient has stable or unstable angina pectoris (CCS classification I or&#xD;
                  greater) or a positive stress test for ischemia.&#xD;

             congestive heart failure) that may cause the patient to be non-compliant with the&#xD;
             protocol, or is associated with limited life- expectancy (less than 2 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Patient must be excluded from the study if any of these angiographic criteria are&#xD;
