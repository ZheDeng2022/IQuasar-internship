      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a serious chronic condition affecting over 14 million Americans, but the prevalence&#xD;
      rates are higher in certain populations (e.g. 10 percent in inner-cities and 30 percent among&#xD;
      the homeless vs. 5 percent in a general population of whites). African Americans and&#xD;
      Hispanics from the Northeast are twice as likely to die from asthma as whites. African&#xD;
      Americans are four times as likely to be hospitalized for asthma and are five times more&#xD;
      likely than whites to seek care for asthma at an emergency department. Reasons for these&#xD;
      higher rates are not certain, and most likely result from an interaction of risk factors such&#xD;
      as environmental exposures, genetic predisposition, access to appropriate medical care,&#xD;
      socioeconomic status, and cultural health practices. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
      Institute supports a variety of activities to address the pressing public health problems&#xD;
      posed by asthma. However, progress in reducing disparities has been disappointingly slow.&#xD;
      Separate, independent research projects have generated important clues for understanding the&#xD;
      nature and scope of the problem. A more coordinated, interdisciplinary and comprehensive&#xD;
      approach to research is needed to take advantage of these clues, move the science further and&#xD;
      faster, and increase our capacity to improve health outcomes among minority and economically&#xD;
      disadvantaged populations. Cooperative centers of research that foster partnerships among&#xD;
      minority medical centers, research intensive institutions, and the communities in which&#xD;
      asthma patients live will promote such advancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Request for Applications for the Centers for Reducing Asthma Disparities was released in&#xD;
      October, 2001. The objective of the program is to promote partnerships (called Centers)&#xD;
      between a minority serving institution (MSI) that may not have a strong research program and&#xD;
      a research intensive institution (RII) that has a track record of NIH-supported research and&#xD;
      patient care. The purpose of the partnership is to conduct collaborative research on asthma&#xD;
      disparities (i.e. greater prevalence of asthma, higher rates of morbidity due to asthma, and&#xD;
      lesser access or use of quality medical care among minorities and poor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rhode Island : Puerto Rico Asthma Center (RIPRAC) has been established to reduce&#xD;
      disparities in asthma among Latino children. Brown University faculty involved with an&#xD;
      extensive pediatric asthma research program will join with epidemiologists, clinicians, and&#xD;
      health services researchers from the minority serving University of Puerto Rico to study&#xD;
      potentially overlooked determinants of disparity. A training component (based on a successful&#xD;
      T32 research training program) will involve individuals from both sites at both sites. The&#xD;
      Rhode Island : Puerto Rico Asthma Center includes four projects that seek to understand the&#xD;
      causes of disparities at multiple levels : the biomedical, the individual/family, and the&#xD;
      socioenvironmental level. The four projects, respectively, will 1) examine discrepancies&#xD;
      between the diagnosis of asthma as assessed by parental report, the primary care medical&#xD;
      record and our systematic diagnosis based on the NHLBI guidelines; 2) assess characteristics&#xD;
      (prescription practices, shared decision making, continuity and access to care) of the health&#xD;
      care system that may differentially affect asthma morbidity; 3) evaluate family beliefs, the&#xD;
      burden of asthma management and medication adherence as they affect asthma morbidity and&#xD;
      health care utilization in Latino and Anglo children; and 4) study the relation of symptom&#xD;
      perception to pediatric asthma discrepancies. Subjects for all four projects will be the same&#xD;
      300 mainland Anglos, 200 mainland Latinos (of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent) and 400&#xD;
      island Puerto Rico children with asthma, aged 7-15, thereby promoting comparability and&#xD;
      efficiency. Chi-square analyses and ANOVA's will be used to assess differences between&#xD;
      groups; techniques of logistic regression and multiple regression will be used to model the&#xD;
      effects of covariates. The Center Training component will provide clinical research education&#xD;
      and supervision to Puerto Rican trainees and faculty, enhance cultural awareness of Brown&#xD;
      personnel as it relates to asthma disparities, and launch at least three trainee-led pilot&#xD;
      research projects in the area.&#xD;
