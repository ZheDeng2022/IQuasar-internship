  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is will gather critical information on the safety, tolerability, and the&#xD;
      immunogenicity (capability of causing an immune response) of A/H5N1 (Bird flu) virus vaccine&#xD;
      in healthy adults. Up to 400 healthy adults, aged 18 to 64, will participate. Each subject&#xD;
      will participate for about 7 months and will be randomly placed in one of several different&#xD;
      study groups receiving a different dose of vaccine or placebo. All subjects will receive two&#xD;
      injections of their assigned study product, about 28 days apart, in the muscle. Subjects will&#xD;
      keep a journal of their temperature and any adverse effects between study visits. A small&#xD;
      amount of blood will also be drawn before the first injection, 7 days after each injection, 1&#xD;
      month after the first injection, and 1 and 6 months after the second injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of novel influenza A virus strains in humans (including subtype A/H5N1, H7N7&#xD;
      H9N2 viruses) has added urgency to ongoing efforts to develop plans for responding to&#xD;
      potential pandemic situations. This study compares the safety, reactogenicity, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of increasing doses of monovalent subvirion influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine&#xD;
      administered by intramuscular (IM) injection to healthy adults alone or combined with the&#xD;
      adjuvants aluminum hydroxide or MF59. The primary objectives are to determine: the&#xD;
      dose-related safety of subvirion inactivated H5N1vaccine with and without adjuvants in&#xD;
      healthy adults; the dose-related immunogenicity of subvirion inactivated H5N1vaccine with and&#xD;
      without adjuvants in healthy adults approximately 1 month following receipt of 2 vaccine&#xD;
      doses; to provide information for the selection of the best dosage level for further studies.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate dose-related immunogenicity and the percent of&#xD;
      subjects responding about 1 and 7 months after the first vaccination. The primary endpoints&#xD;
      are: adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) information; proportion of subjects in&#xD;
      each dose group achieving a serum neutralizing antibody titer of 1:40 against the influenza&#xD;
      A/H5N1 virus 28 days after receipt of the second dose of vaccine; proportion of subjects in&#xD;
      each dose group achieving a serum hemagglutination (HAI) antibody titer of 1:40 against the&#xD;
      influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 days after receipt of the second dose of vaccine; geometric mean&#xD;
      titer (GMT) and frequency of 4-fold or greater increases in neutralizing antibody titers in&#xD;
      each group 28 days after receipt of the second dose of vaccine; geometric mean titer and&#xD;
      frequency of 4-fold or greater increases in serum HAI antibody titers in each group 28 days&#xD;
      after receipt of the second dose of vaccine. The secondary endpoints are: GMT and frequency&#xD;
      of 4-fold or greater increases in neutralizing antibody titers in each group 1 month and 7&#xD;
      months after receipt of the first dose of vaccine; geometric mean titer and frequency of&#xD;
      4-fold or greater increases in serum HAI antibody titers in each group 1 month and 7 months&#xD;
      after receipt of the first dose of vaccine; development of serum antibody responses against&#xD;
      antigenically drifted variants of H5N1 influenza virus. The primary outcome measures will be&#xD;
      the frequencies and severities of AEs in each group and the proportions of subjects who&#xD;
      achieve a serum neutralizing antibody titer of 1:40 against the influenza A/H5N1 virus on Day&#xD;
      56. About 390 healthy adults, 18 to 64 years old, inclusive, will be enrolled into this&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging clinical trial. Nine groups of&#xD;
      randomized subjects will receive two doses of saline placebo or influenza A/H5N1 vaccine at&#xD;
      45, 30, or 15 micrograms; or influenza A/H5N1 vaccine at 15 or 7.5 micrograms with MF59; or&#xD;
      influenza A/H5N1 vaccine with aluminum hydroxide at 30, 15, or 7.5 micrograms (N=30, 60 or&#xD;
      90/vaccine dose group total 390). Laboratory safety profile blood will be drawn prior to the&#xD;
      first immunization. Subjects will receive 2 doses approximately 28 days apart. Subjects will&#xD;
      be observed after inoculation and maintain a memory aid for 7 days afterwards. Subjects will&#xD;
      be telephoned 1 to 3 days after vaccination for AE assessment, and they will return to the&#xD;
      clinic on Day 7 for AE and concomitant medication assessment, targeted physical examination,&#xD;
      safety laboratory tests and a review of the memory aid. Telephone calls assessing AEs will be&#xD;
      performed after each vaccination. Serum for safety laboratory tests will be obtained prior to&#xD;
      and approximately 7 days after first and second immunizations. I&#xD;
