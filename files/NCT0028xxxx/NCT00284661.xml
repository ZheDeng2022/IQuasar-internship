  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meniscal repair resulting in meniscal preservation is the most desirable treatment of a torn&#xD;
      meniscus and is one of the most commonly performed arthroscopic procedures. The inside-out&#xD;
      meniscal suturing technique allows precise placement of sutures under direct visualization&#xD;
      and studies have reported excellent healing rates and low re-tear rates. However,&#xD;
      complications associated with the use of the inside-out technique (injury to the knee's&#xD;
      neurovascular structures and infection) and the fact that it is a time consuming procedure&#xD;
      have generated the development of alternative methods and devices. The FasT-Fix is reported&#xD;
      to be quicker and safer. It is applicable to tears in most locations and requires no&#xD;
      additional incisions or portals. Even though this and many similar devices are widely used&#xD;
      with reported clinical healing rates of 75 -92% and relatively minor complications, few&#xD;
      prospective, randomized clinical trials evaluating and comparing different techniques have&#xD;
      been carried out. Patient outcome studies are necessary to evaluate which technique&#xD;
      ultimately results in the most effective repair and the least patient disability following&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that an inside-out suturing technique will have a higher complication rate but&#xD;
      a significantly lower failure rate than the FasT-Fix Menisical Repair System&#xD;

      In this prospective, randomized, trial subjects will be randomly assigned to the inside-out&#xD;
      group or the FasT-Fix group and will be followed for at least 24 months. Primary outcome is&#xD;
      the difference between groups in the disease specific quality of life assessment - The&#xD;
      Western Ontario Meniscal Evaluation Tool. Secondary outcome measures include range of motion,&#xD;
      functional outcome scores, surgical time, complication rate, meniscal retear and differences&#xD;
      between groups in post-operative pain. The data collector will be blinded to patients'&#xD;
      intervention group. Secondary outcome measures include range of motion, functional outcome&#xD;
      scores, disease-specific quality of life outcome scores and the standard knee clinical&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The investigators will assess all patients presenting with suspected&#xD;
      meniscal tears. Those meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be asked to sign an&#xD;
      informed consent. Subjects who have successfully been screened and are slated to be&#xD;
      randomized into the study must have a pre-operative visit within 12 months of their scheduled&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine knee x-rays will be performed on all patients to rule out extensive degenerative&#xD;
      changes, loose bodies, fractures, osteochondritis dissecans and other lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Protocols: Intervention group assignment will take place at the time of surgery,&#xD;
      once the patient has undergone the initial arthroscopy and a diagnosis of a repairable&#xD;
      meniscal tear has been confirmed. Patients will be stratified for surgeon and for concurrent&#xD;
      ACL reconstruction. They will then be randomized to one of the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meniscal repair is a day surgery procedure performed under general anaesthesia and tourniquet&#xD;
      control as required. Prior to the repair, synovial abrasion and debridement of scar tissue&#xD;
      will be carried out to promote vascular ingrowth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FasT-Fix Technique A suture that is pre-attached to a T-bar is placed across the meniscal&#xD;
      tear via a sheathed needle. A small obturator pushes the &quot;T&quot; out of the needle engaging the&#xD;
      outer rim of the meniscus in the synovial recess. The suture tails are tied arthroscopically,&#xD;
      stabilizing the tear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inside-Out Suturing Technique Repairs of the medial meniscus will be carried out with the&#xD;
      knee in 10-30° flexion. This allows both preservation of the posterior capsular recess and&#xD;
      full knee extension once the repair is complete. A vertical incision is made posterior to the&#xD;
      medial collateral ligament. The deep fascia is incised and the posteromedial capsule&#xD;
      visualized. The lateral meniscus is repaired through a vertical incision posterior to the&#xD;
      lateral collateral ligament made with the knee flexed 90°. The iliotibial band is split in&#xD;
      line with its fibers at the level of the joint line. The biceps femoris and lateral&#xD;
      gastrocnemius tendon are retracted posteriorly, protecting the common peroneal nerve and&#xD;
      exposing the capsule and popliteus tendon. Vertical sutures will be placed in at 5mm&#xD;
      intervals along the tear. Sutures are tied over the capsule once ligamentous reconstruction,&#xD;
      if necessary, is completed. This is done with the knee in full extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Patients will be assessed pre-operatively and by a blinded research assistant at&#xD;
      3, 6, 12, and 24 months. A tubi-grip will cover the operative knee in order that the data&#xD;
      collector may be blinded to treatment group. Effusion and joint-line tenderness will be&#xD;
      assessed by the physician prior to the data collector's appraisal. The viability of the&#xD;
      meniscal repair will be based on the clinical examination. The absence of effusion,&#xD;
      joint-line tenderness and locking all correlate well with a healed meniscus. The&#xD;
      International Knee Documentation Form, the Western Ontario Meniscal Evaluation Tool and the&#xD;
      Lysholm score, validated measures for knee problems will be utilized. Patients will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a pain journal for a period of 2 weeks following their surgery.&#xD;
