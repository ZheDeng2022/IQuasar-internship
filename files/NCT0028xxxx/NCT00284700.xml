  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori is recognized as a major gastrointestinal pathogen in developing&#xD;
      countries. This microorganism infects up to 60% of children less than five years in those&#xD;
      countries and is strongly associated with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in&#xD;
      children and adults. The progression of gastritis to atrophy often leads to decreased gastric&#xD;
      acid output, which is a well-known risk factor for anemia. Gastric acid is essential for&#xD;
      increasing the bioavailability and absorption of non-heme dietary iron, the most important&#xD;
      source of iron in developing countries. Numerous reports suggest that iron malabsorption&#xD;
      secondary to low gastric acid output is a problem in developing world countries. It has been&#xD;
      further observed that iron deficiency anemia is resistant to iron therapy particularly in&#xD;
      these countries. In a recently completed study we observed an association of anaemia with H.&#xD;
      pylori infection. We hypothesize that the poor bioavailability of iron in these countries&#xD;
      could be related to H. pylori -induced low gastric acid output and we propose to investigate&#xD;
      the role of H. pylori infection as a cause of anemia and treatment failure of iron&#xD;
      supplementation in Bangladesh. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      field trial is proposed among four groups ( 65 each) of H. Pylori infected children of 2-5&#xD;
      years of age with iron deficiency anemia. The children will be assigned to one of the four&#xD;
      therapies: antibiotics alone (for H. Pylori eradication), antibiotic plus iron therapy, iron&#xD;
      therapy alone, or placebo. Hemoglobin concentration, serum ferritin concentration, and&#xD;
      transferrin receptor will be measured before and at 1 and 3 month after the intervention. We&#xD;
      also propose a complementary study in an additional 20 children with H. Pylori infection and&#xD;
      iron deficiency anemia to assess iron absorption with application of double stable isotopes.&#xD;
      The change in hematological parameters will also be compared among the groups before and&#xD;
      after the therapy. The results of this study are expected to have implications in the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia in developing countries.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We propose to complementary study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled field trial in two hundred sixty&#xD;
           children of a peri-urban community near Dhaka City is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The assessment of iron absorption before and after anti-infective therapy in 20 children&#xD;
           with H. Pylori infection and iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Field trial&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Description of the study population Children will be recruited from Nandipara, a&#xD;
           peri-urban community situated 7 miles northeast of Dhaka City. This community has a&#xD;
           population of 3,500 in an area of approximately 2.5 square miles. Among the residents,&#xD;
           70% of males are classified as day laborers, 20% are rickshaw pullers, and 5% are&#xD;
           carpenters or service holders. Fifteen percent of women are day laborers and 85% are&#xD;
           housewives. The average family size is 4.5 members. The slum has a municipal water&#xD;
           supply for drinking and cooking and most families live in poorly constructed houses. The&#xD;
           great majority of houses are mud walled with thatched dry leaves and bamboo or tin&#xD;
           roofs. The population less than five years of age is about 700. The prevelance of H.&#xD;
           pylori infection in less than five children in this community is 50%.44 A weekly clinic&#xD;
           has been run by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh&#xD;
           (ICDDR,B) for minor case of illness in the population since 1986.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All children in the community will initially be screened for iron deficiency anemia and&#xD;
           H. pylori infection. After explanation of the study and the tests, informed consent will&#xD;
           be obtained from the parents or legal guardians. Demographic information including name,&#xD;
           date of birth, sex, weight, height, economic status of the parents, nature of feeding,&#xD;
           and previous medication in the past 1 month will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening for iron deficiency anemia 50 Âµl capillary blood samples obtained by&#xD;
           fingerstick will be assessed for hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration. Measurement of&#xD;
           hemoglobin concentration is the most useful test in screening iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
           since it directly reflects the quantity of most abundant essential iron compound in the&#xD;
           body. Children with hemoglobin concentration below 110g/l will be considered as anemic.&#xD;
           In children with low Hgb identified through the initial screening, the diagnosis of iron&#xD;
           deficiency anemia will be confirmed by venepuncture Hgb, serum ferritin concentration,&#xD;
           and serum transferrin receptor concentration. Haemoglobin concentration can be&#xD;
           transiently depressed due to inflammation or infection, and in such a situation does not&#xD;
           indicate pathological anemia. Of all the biochemical tests for assessing iron status, a&#xD;
           low SF is the most specific test for iron deficiency. The major disadvantage of SF is&#xD;
           that it is readily elevated in response to any infector inflammatory condition. One&#xD;
           major advantage of sTfR is that unlike SF, sTfR is not significantly effected by&#xD;
           infection or the inflammatory process. However, sTfR levels are increased in situations&#xD;
           of increased RBC turnover such as hemolytic anemia, i.e. thalassemia, etc. A uniform&#xD;
           cutoff value of &gt;8.5 mg/l indicates an elevated sTfR and therefore iron deficiency or&#xD;
           hemolytic anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurement of serum transferrin receptors also becomes a promising new test for the&#xD;
           evaluation of iron status particularly in epidemiological assessment of anemia.&#xD;
           Performed in conjunction with serum ferritin measurements, the serum transferrin&#xD;
           receptor serves to distinguish true iron deficiency from the anemia from the anemia of&#xD;
           chronic diseases or inflammatory diseases and, therefore, offers a major advantage in&#xD;
           establishing the true prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in population studies. The&#xD;
           combination of low hemoglobin, a low serum ferritin, and an elevated serum transferrin&#xD;
           receptor are diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia. The diagnosis of iron deficiency will&#xD;
           be made when the following criteria are met: transferrin receptor &gt; 8.3 mg/l, serum&#xD;
           ferritin concentration &lt;12ng/ml, and hemoglobin concentration(&lt;11 gm/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening of H. Pylori infected children The anemic children will be screened for H.&#xD;
           Pylori infection using a urea breath test (UBT) which is considered by many of the&#xD;
           reference diagnostic test for H. pylori infection. We have recently established the test&#xD;
           at ICDDR,B.44 In brief the procedures are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Urea Breath Test A breath sample will be collected for base line 13 CO2 in a vacutainer&#xD;
           following a fasting period of 2 hr. A volume of 100 ml of whole milk will then be&#xD;
           allowed to be consumed by the children. Ten min later 40 mg of 13 C urea (99% 13C,&#xD;
           Tracer Technologies, Boston, Massachusetts) will be given after dissolving in 25 ml of&#xD;
           water. After administration of the substrate, breath samples will again be collected in&#xD;
           duplicates after 30 min. Samples will be collected through two-way pediatric mask with&#xD;
           an attached non-return valve into a vacutainer and will be stored for shipment to the&#xD;
           University of Alabama, to measure the 13C concentration of a respiratory CO2 mass&#xD;
           spectrometer. The excess over the baseline will be expressed as parts per thousand(delta&#xD;
           0/00). A breath test in which the excess over a baseline is 5.00/00 at 30 min will be&#xD;
           regarded as positive for H. pylori infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Selection of Study children Iron deficiency anemic children with weight for age &gt;60%&#xD;
           of National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), with no evidence of deficiency diseases&#xD;
           or systemic infection and whose parents give informed consent will be enrolled in this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria The children with following problems will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute infection or apparent inflammatory process&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Signs of vitamins deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe anemia (Hemoglobin &lt;70 G/l)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe malnutrition (marasmus, marasmic kwasiorkar or kwasiorkar)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Presence of hook worms and /or Giardia lamblia (cyst or vegetative form) in a stool&#xD;
                microscopic examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Presence of fat in a stool microscopic examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Presence of occult blood in a stool as demonstrated by Guaiac test&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of taking antibiotics or any drugs for any cause in the preceding month&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Procedure A detailed medical history will be recorded. Body weight and height will&#xD;
           be measured upon enrolment into the study. Naked weights will be obtained to the nearest&#xD;
           10 g using a balance scale (GebrÃ¼der Soehnle, Murrhardt, Germany) and the mean of three&#xD;
           consecutive measurements recorded. Recumbent length will be measured in children less&#xD;
           than two years of age using a slideboard infantometer (Harpenden, St. Albans, England).&#xD;
           In older children, standing height is to be determined using a locally constructed&#xD;
           instrument in which a metal tape measure is extended between a footplate and head bar&#xD;
           that has an attached fluid level to ensure a horizontal position. The mean of two&#xD;
           consecutive height measurements to the nearest 0.1 cm is recorded as the observed value.&#xD;
           Measurements are compared to the standards according to the National Center for Health&#xD;
           Statistic data and the nutritional status assessed by Z-score. , Percent of median&#xD;
           equivalents of standard deviation units will be determined and categorized according to&#xD;
           the scheme of Waterlow.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All children will be subjected to physical examination by one of the investigators. The&#xD;
           children will be assigned to one of the four groups according to randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anti Hp group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fe group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anti -Hp group + Fe group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to compare the overall prevalence of resistance to iron therapy among iron&#xD;
           deficient children, there will be a fifth group comprising children with iron deficiency&#xD;
           anemia but without H. pylori infection. This group will be treated with iron therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anti Hp therapy: Clarithromycin 15 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days plus&#xD;
           omeprazole 20 mg single dose for 14 days. ,&#xD;
&#xD;
           Iron therapy: An iron dose of 3 mg/kg/day (or about 30 mg/day) as ferrous sulphate as&#xD;
           advocated by Dallman41 will be fed in a single dose in the morning in one half hour&#xD;
           before food. The iron therapy will be given for 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Placebo Glucose syrup&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.1 Supplementation The intervention syrup(s) will be fed daily in a single dose in&#xD;
           morning in an empty stomach (Half an hour before food). The children in the placebo&#xD;
           group will receive same amounts of glucose syrup. All therapies will be kept in&#xD;
           identical dark brown containers and will be fed by a health worker who will be kept&#xD;
           unaware about the nature of the study and of the contents inside the bottle. Twenty&#xD;
           four-hour food intakes will be recorded on a precoded form by dietary recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The children will be followed for three months after the end of supplementation. Urea&#xD;
           breath test will be repeated at the end and at 1 and 3 months after the supplementation.&#xD;
           Venous blood (500 Âµl) will be taken for determination of serum ferritin, transferrin&#xD;
           receptor and hemoglobin concentration at the end and after 1 and 3 months of&#xD;
           supplementation. Children in the placebo group will be given a three month course of&#xD;
           supervised iron supplementation at the end of study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 Sample size calculation The sample size is calculated on the basis of (i) prevalence&#xD;
           of H. Pylori infection, (ii) prevalence of non response to iron therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation based on the prevalence on H. Pylori infection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Considering the prevalence of H. Pylori infection 50% and iron deficiency anemia 70%,44&#xD;
           we anticipate H. Pylori related anemia in 50% of infants and children in this community.&#xD;
           We expect a reduction in prevalence of H. Pylori related iron deficiency anemia after&#xD;
           therapy with antibiotic plus iron therapies 25%. To detect a difference of this&#xD;
           magnitude at 5% level and at 80% power the sample size is calculated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           N =[P1(100-P1) +P2(100-P2)]*8/(P1-P2)2&#xD;
&#xD;
           Where P1= prevalence of H. Pylori related anemia P2= prevalence of H. Pylori related&#xD;
           anemia after therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           =[50(50) +25(75)] * 8 / (25)2&#xD;
&#xD;
           =56 in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on a previous study in this community we anticipate a drop out rate of&#xD;
           approximately 15%. With a (Akramuzzaman SM, personal communication), the necessary&#xD;
           sample size will be 65 children in each group and the total sample of children will be&#xD;
           260.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Calculation based on prevalence of non-responder to iron therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           Observation from an ongoing study with an oral iron supplementation programme in anaemic&#xD;
           patients being conducted in Dinajpur (a northern district of Bangladesh) suggests that&#xD;
           70% of the iron supplemented group do not respond ( S. Rahman, personal communication).&#xD;
           The prevalence of H. Pylori infection in the proposed study population is approximately&#xD;
           50%,35 and we expect that after oral iron supplementation the non responders will be 40%&#xD;
           less among the H. pylori negative group, compared to the H. pylori positive group. To&#xD;
           detect a difference of this magnitude at 5% level and at 80% power the sample size is&#xD;
           calculated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           N = [P1(100-P1) +P2(100-P2)]*8/(P1-P2)2&#xD;
&#xD;
           Where P1= prevalence of anemia after iron supplementation in H. pylori infected children&#xD;
           P2= prevalence of anemia after iron supplementation in H. pylori non-infected children&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  [(70)(30) +(42)(58)] * 8 / (35)2 =46 in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
           With 15% drop out rate, the number of children will be 53 in each group i.e. total&#xD;
           sample of 212 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will take the larger sample size, i.e. 260 children for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5 Randomization A master randomization chart will be prepared by an appropriately&#xD;
           trained person who is not connected with the study using random permuted block numbers&#xD;
           taking a size of three. Bottles containing anti-Hp therapy, iron therapy or placebo will&#xD;
           be identical in appearance and will be arranged in sequence that corresponds to the&#xD;
           randomization chart and will be serially numbered. The serial number of the bottles will&#xD;
           correspond to the serial number of the patients enrolled in the study. As one group of&#xD;
           children would receive anti-Hp therapy and iron therapy simultaneously, there will be&#xD;
           two bottles (bottles A or B) for each group of children to make the study double blind.&#xD;
           For children belonging to anti-Hp plus Iron therapy, there will be one bottle containing&#xD;
           anti-Hp therapy or and the other containing iron therapy. Children belonging to iron&#xD;
           therapy or anti-Hp therapy alone, will be getting one bottle containing the medication,&#xD;
           while the other will contain glucose syrup. As the duration of anti-Hp therapy is 14&#xD;
           days, the children belonging to this group will be provided glucose syrup for the rest&#xD;
           of the month in order to make the duration of therapy equal among the four groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.6 Laboratory test Hb concentration will be determined by the cyanmethemoglobin method,&#xD;
           serum ferritin will be determined by a radio immunometric assay. Serum transferrin&#xD;
           receptor will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Stool will be&#xD;
           tested for the presence of occult blood by the guaiac reaction (Occultotest, Ames&#xD;
           Co.,Elkhart, Inc.,. USA). Serum pepsinogen and gastrin will be measured by&#xD;
           radioimmunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.7 Withdrawal from the study - The noncompliance of subject, either because the leaves&#xD;
           the study area for other place before the end of the study or&#xD;
&#xD;
           - because the child requires unscheduled treatment for serious interim infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment of withdrawal during analysis Results of all randomized children will be&#xD;
           included in the analysis of the study. Data from the patients withdrawn will be included&#xD;
           up to the time of withdrawal. A supplemental analysis in which such patients are&#xD;
           excluded will also be made&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.8 Outcome variables&#xD;
&#xD;
           Major&#xD;
&#xD;
           - The incidence of H. Pylori infection following the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Rise of serum hemoglobin, serum ferritin concentration or reduction of level of serum&#xD;
           transferrin receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - The number of children in each group with IDA as primarily defined before and after&#xD;
           the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           Minor&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Change of anthropometric indices&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Iron absorption study Twenty additional children with a positive Urea breath test and iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia will be selected for the Iron absorption study. The purpose of the study&#xD;
      and all procedures related to iron absorption study will be explained to the parents and&#xD;
      consents will be obtained. Before commencing the iron absorption study, all children will be&#xD;
      given a commercial whey adjusted cows' milk formula with 8 mg Fe/l (Nidina 1; Nestle, Paris,&#xD;
      France) for a period of at least three weeks. After 21 days of formula feedings they will be&#xD;
      admitted to the Metabolic Ward of Clinical Research and Service Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythrocyte incorporation of labeled iron (radio stable) has been used successfully to&#xD;
      examine absorption from the gut. , The erythrocyte incorporation method involves oral&#xD;
      administration of an isotope of iron followed by measurement of the isotope ratio of iron in&#xD;
      erythrocytes at a selected time after administration. We will follow the technique for&#xD;
      measuring iron absorption in children by a double stable isotope technique, developed&#xD;
      recently by Kastenmayer et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Method for Iron absorption study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of labeled iron sulfate solutions Enriched 57Fe and 58Fe-ferric oxide (Fe2O3)&#xD;
      will be purchased from Oak ridge National Laboratory (Oak Ridge, TN, USA). The isotope&#xD;
      compositions of iron in the 58Fe preparation (as provided by Oak ridge National Laboratories)&#xD;
      are (mg): (weight%) 54 Fe (0.65), 56 Fe (35.6)57 Fe (3.47), and 58 Fe(60.28). The isotope&#xD;
      compositions of iron in the 57Fe (weight%) are; 54 Fe(0.65), 56Fe(35.60), 57Fe (3.47), and&#xD;
      58Fe (60.28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ferric oxide will be dissolved in concentrated H2SO4 by bubbling carbon monoxide through the&#xD;
      solution over heat for approximately four hours. The solution will then be derated by passing&#xD;
      purified nitrogen through it for several minutes. The volume will then be adjusted using&#xD;
      derated water. Two ml aliquot of the resultants 57 FeSO4 and 58 FeSO4 solutions will be&#xD;
      transferred into opaque ampules. Each ampule will be purged with nitrogen and sealed. Ampules&#xD;
      will contain either 200 Âµg/ml of total iron (as ferrous sulphate) and 150 Âµg/ml of 57Fe or&#xD;
      700 Âµg/ml of total iron (as ferrous sulphate) and 420 Âµg/ml of 58Fe. Aliquot from an&#xD;
      individual ampule will be used to prepare 57Fe and 58Fe-spiked working solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stability and safety of parenteral 57 Fe solutions Prior to i.v. administration to the&#xD;
      infants the 57FeSO4 solution will be tested for pyrogenicity, sterility, and stability.&#xD;
      Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) testing and repeated culture for bacterial and fungal growth&#xD;
      to confirm that the 57FeSO4 solutions are pyrogen-free and sterile at the concentrations to&#xD;
      be used in the study. The nutrient content of the parenteral solutions has been previously&#xD;
      described. The total iron content of the 57FeSO4 -nutrient solution will be determined by&#xD;
      atomic absorption spectrometry before and after filtration (0.22 Âµ filters), and over time at&#xD;
      room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Study design of iron absorption study Infants enrolled in the study will receive a&#xD;
      combination of parenteral and enteral feeds. The 57FeSO4 solution will be provided&#xD;
      parenterally while the 58FeSO4 will be given via the enteral route. Erythrocyte incorporation&#xD;
      of 57Fe and 58Fe will then be measured from blood samples taken two weeks after initial&#xD;
      infusions. The percentage of the I.V administered dose presents in the circulating&#xD;
      erythrocytes will be used as a reference for the percentage of absorbed iron (from the orally&#xD;
      administered dose) present in the circulating erythrocytes. The &quot;corrected&quot; percent&#xD;
      erythrocyte 58Fe and 57Fe incorporation (58 Fe inc-cor/ 57Fe inc-cor) will be calculated&#xD;
      mathematically as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to iv administration to the children, 0.7-0.8 ml of the 57FeSO4 solution(0.2mg/ml) will&#xD;
      be added to a burytrol containing 30 ml of the nutrient solution used for parenteral feeding,&#xD;
      using sterile techniques. The iron-nutrient mixture, which has been used safely previously,&#xD;
      will be infused slowly into a peripheral vein of the children over a 12-24 hour period with&#xD;
      the aid of an infusion pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soon after the start of the parenteral infusion of the 57FeSO4 solution, the enteral 58FeSO4&#xD;
      will be given to the children. During this time, parenteral infusion of 57FeSO4 will be&#xD;
      continued. After checking to ensure that the nasogastric feeding tube is properly located in&#xD;
      the stomach, the tube will be aspirated to check stomach contents. If the stomach is empty,&#xD;
      1.5 ml of the 58 FeSO4 will be delivered directly via a syringe into the feeding tube. The&#xD;
      tube will then be flushed with 0.5 ml of sterile water. The dosage of parenteral 57FeSO4 will&#xD;
      be 0.15mg/kg (57Fe-enriched ferrous sulfate solution), which would provide 0.12 mg/kg of&#xD;
      57Fe. The dosage of enteral will be 1.5mg/kg (58Fe-enriched ferrous sulfate solution), which&#xD;
      will provide 0.8mg/kg of 58Fe. The children will be discharged with therapy for Helicobacter&#xD;
      pylori infection (Klarithromycin plus omeprazole) for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one month of therapy the mothers will be requested to bring their children at the CRSC.&#xD;
      A repeat UBT and iron absorption study will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Blood sampling Blood samples will be taken before administration of the stable isotopes&#xD;
      (baseline) and 14 days later in both occasions. Blood sample size will be 200-300 Âµl up per&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Calculation of Erythrocyte Iron Incorporation The quantity administered 58Fe and 57Fe&#xD;
      (mg) incorporated into erythrocytes at specified time 't' after administration of the dose of&#xD;
      labeled iron will be calculated in a manner similar to that used by Zlotkin et al 1995.&#xD;
&#xD;
      58 Fe inc. =Rt58/54 -Ro58/54 xFe circ x 0.00322 Ro58/54&#xD;
&#xD;
      57Feinc =R157/54-Ro57/54 x Fe circ x 0.0218 Ro57/54&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this equation, 58 Feinc and 57Feinc will be expressed in mg. R158/54, R157/54 and R057/ 54&#xD;
      are the isotope ratios expressed on weight basis for 58Fe/54Fe and 57Fe/54Fe, which will be&#xD;
      determined on digested blood samples at time &quot;t&quot; after dosing and at a baseline (pre 58Fe and&#xD;
      pre 57Fe doses) respectively; Fe circ is the quantity of the circulating iron. Fe circ at the&#xD;
      time &quot;t&quot;; 0.0032 and 0.0218 are the natural abundances (weight fractions) of 58 Fe and 57 Fe.&#xD;
      The quantity of total circulating iron, Fe circ, expressed in mg, will be estimated as&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fe circ. =BV x Hb X 3.47&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where BV is the blood volume in liters, assumed to be 0.085l/kg of the body weight; Hb is the&#xD;
      hemoglobin concentration in g/l; 3.47 is the concentration of iron in Hb (mg/g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantity of administered 58Fe or 57Fe incorporated into erythrocytes, % Fe inc, will be&#xD;
      expressed as a percentage of the administered doses of 58Fe or 57Fe. Feinc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  58 Fe inc = 58Fe inc x 100 or Fe inc&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  57 Fe inc = 57 Fe inc x 100 57 Fe inc&#xD;
&#xD;
      The corrected percent erythrocyte for analysis of the stable isotope ratios in erythrocytes&#xD;
      will be calculated using the percentage of erythrocyte incorporation of i.v infused 57 Fe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  58Fe inc-cor = % 58Fe inc X 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  57 Feinc&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mass spectrometric analysis Preparation of blood samples for mass spectrometric analysis and&#xD;
      preparation of enriched standards will be followed as per the procedures described by&#xD;
      Kastenmayer et al. Samples of heparinized whole blood will wet ashed with concentrated HNO3&#xD;
      at a ratio of 1:3 (blood: acid)(vol/vol) on a hot plate over low heat for 20-30 min. Digested&#xD;
      solutions will be adjusted with deionized water to yield an iron concentration of 10 Âµg/ml.&#xD;
      Isotope-spiked standards for an instrument calibration will be prepared in the same manner as&#xD;
      with the unknown samples. Isotope ratios for 58Fe/54Fe and 57Fe/54Fe in blood before and&#xD;
      after concurrent enteral (58Fe) and parenteral (57Fe) administration of isotopes will be&#xD;
      determined by a computer-controlled thermal ionization mass spectrometer using an Elan Model&#xD;
      250 ICP/MS system, (SCIEX, Inc., Thornhill, Ontario, Canada), operated in the isotope ratio&#xD;
      mode, as followed by Zlotkin et al. in the Department of Pediatric and Nutritional Science,&#xD;
      University of Tronoto, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation test A standard intubation test as described earlier14 will be performed in this&#xD;
      subset of children after completion of iron absorption study. In brief, as soft gastric tube&#xD;
      (18G) will be placed in most dependent part of stomach. Gastric acid samples will be&#xD;
      collected from children lying in the left recumbent position using manual suction. The&#xD;
      position of the tube will be confirmed by auscultation, aspiration of gastric juice, and&#xD;
      nearly complete recovery of water injected in the tube. Samples of gastric juice will be&#xD;
      discarded during the first 10 min after intubation. Thereafter, samples will be collected and&#xD;
      saved in 15- min aliquot for 90 min. After 90 min of collection (basal sample), pentagastrin&#xD;
      (peptavlon, ICI) will be injected subcutaneously at a dose of 0.6 ug/kg. The sample following&#xD;
      pentagastrin stimulation for 60 min will be termed as &quot;stimulated sample&quot;. The volime of&#xD;
      gastric secretion in each of the 15 min collections will be rcorded and expressed as&#xD;
      mililitre per hour. The concentrations of acid in each will be measured by titration of 1 mL&#xD;
      gastric juice with 0.01N sodium hydroxide to pH 7.4, using an automated titrator (Metrohm,&#xD;
      Herisau, Switzerland). Total acid output was calculated for each time pint by multiplying&#xD;
      volume of gastric juice and acid concentration. Basal (BAO) and stimulated acid output (SAO)&#xD;
      were calculated based on 2 samples collected for baseline measurement and the 4 samples&#xD;
      collected after administration of pentagastrin respectively, and were expressed as mMol/h.&#xD;
