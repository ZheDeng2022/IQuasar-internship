      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib works in treating patients with&#xD;
      recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the relationship between response rate and number of CA repeats in intron 1 of&#xD;
           the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with metastatic and/or locally&#xD;
           recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with the EGFR&#xD;
           inhibitor erlotinib hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the relationship between the number of CA repeats in intron 1 of the EGFR gene&#xD;
           and time to disease progression and survival in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine cutaneous and other toxicities of erlotinib hydrochloride in patients with&#xD;
           different numbers of CA repeats in intron 1 of the EGFR gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the degree of p27 upregulation and EGFR phosphorylation in skin biopsy samples&#xD;
           in patients with different numbers of CA repeats in intron 1 of the EGFR genes treated&#xD;
           with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the relationship between erlotinib hydrochloride exposure (utilizing total and&#xD;
           unbound erlotinib hydrochloride concentrations) and outcome, toxicity, and&#xD;
           pharmacodynamic effects (upregulation of p27) in patients with different numbers of CA&#xD;
           repeats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to genotype of intron&#xD;
      1 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (16/16 vs 16/20 or 20/20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
