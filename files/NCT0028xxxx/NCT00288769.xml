      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is a common phenomenon in Primary Medicine.Frequency of the&#xD;
      phenomenon can be as high as 25% of the general population and the recurrence of the problem&#xD;
      can be up to 50%.Different approaches for treatment are described: treatment with various&#xD;
      natural vitamins , local ointments , disinfectant agents for local treatment , local&#xD;
      antibiotic ointments , NSAID, local cortisone-steroids , and even medication on the basis of&#xD;
      immune-depressants of the immune system and systematic steroids .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double-blind study of daily administration of sublingual Vitamin B12 tablets manufactured&#xD;
      by Solgar (each tablet containing 1000 mcg. of Vitamin B12) opposed to placebo tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effect of Vitamin B12 on the frequency of recurrent canker sores of the&#xD;
      mouth (RAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with vitamin B12 will reduce the recurrence rate and will diminish the&#xD;
      symptomatology of RAS episodes.&#xD;

      Scientific Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent painful canker sores within the mouth (Recurrent aphthous stomatitis, RAS) are a&#xD;
      common phenomenon in Primary Medicine (1,2). The term &quot;aphthai&quot; in Greek means a condition&#xD;
      within the mouth and is attributed to Hippocrates. (1) RAS is characterized by small,&#xD;
      recurrent, painful canker sores in the mouth. These sores have characteristic round or&#xD;
      elliptical ulcerations with sharp edges. The sores have a red halo surrounding them and a&#xD;
      base with a yellowish or grey color (1,3). Frequency of the phenomenon can be as high as 25%&#xD;
      of the general population and the recurrence of the problem can be up to 50% (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAS is idiopathic in most cases. A possible cause is frequently a local injury or stress.&#xD;
      Other possible causes include systemic illness, nutritional deficiency, sensitivity or&#xD;
      allergy to certain foods, illness that effect the immune system and medication. Even though&#xD;
      RAS can be associated with celiac disease or Behcet's disease, most of the cases patients are&#xD;
      presented with this problem there is no other complaint or symptom and the patient is&#xD;
      considered healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the cause of the condition is unknown, Diagnosis is based on the patient's history and&#xD;
      on a physical examination. There is no laboratory test that can substantiate or negate the&#xD;
      condition (4-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In medical literature different approaches for treatment are described: treatment with&#xD;
      various natural vitamins (8), local ointments (9), disinfectant agents for local treatment&#xD;
      (10), local antibiotic ointments (11), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ointments (NSAID)(12),&#xD;
      local cortisone-steroids (13), and even medication on the basis of immune-depressants of the&#xD;
      immune system and systematic steroids (14-16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of these approaches that have been tried up to now have given temporary relief and only&#xD;
      some have controlled the pain and healed the sores (16, 9-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past we have reported successfully treating three patients suffering from RAS with&#xD;
      Vitamin B12 (17). We also have data regarding the treatment of 15 RAS patients. (This data&#xD;
      has not yet been published.) The frequency of sores in this group had been an average of 1.5&#xD;
      episodes per month before treatment with Vitamin B12. During treatment the frequency&#xD;
      decreased to 0.1 episode per month. As far as we know, there is no research using a&#xD;
      double-blind design that investigated Vitamin B12 treatment of patients suffering from RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effect of Vitamin B12 on the frequency of recurrent canker sores of the&#xD;
      mouth (RAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double-blind study of daily administration of sublingual Vitamin B12 tablets manufactured&#xD;
      by Solgar (each tablet containing 1000 mcg. of Vitamin B12, mannitol, stearic acid, Magnesium&#xD;
      stearat , natural cherry flavor; weight of each tablet is 100 mcg.) opposed to placebo&#xD;
      tablets (containing the same ingredients, except the Vitamin B12). The two types of tablets&#xD;
      will be the same shape, size, color and have the same flavor. The tablets will be purchased&#xD;
      from the Solgar Company in identical boxes, 30 tablets per box. The boxes will be numbered (1&#xD;
      or 2) - according to the type of treatment. The patient will receive instructions about daily&#xD;
      treatment for a period of six (6) months, one tablet before going to sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a retrospective study which we have done (to be published), we found that 73% of the&#xD;
      patients who received Vitamin B12 there were no recurrent incidents of canker sores in the&#xD;
      mouth. Assuming that among the patients that do not receive the Vitamin B12 treatment the&#xD;
      frequency of the disease will be at least 90%, and that in the study group we expect that not&#xD;
      more than 60% of the patients will continue to suffer from recurrent canker sores, in order&#xD;
      to achieve a confidence level of 95% and a power of 80%, we need to recruit about 38 patients&#xD;
      in the study group and 38 patients in the placebo group. With the assumption that the&#xD;
      drop-out rate will be 30%, we need to recruit about 50 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates suffering from RAS who agree to participated in the study will sign a informed&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suffering from RAS as least for one year with a frequency of at least one sore per&#xD;
           month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known systemic diseases concurrent with lesions in the mouth (Behcet's disease,&#xD;
           Rheumatoid arthritis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does not speak Hebrew, Russian, or English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have received in the last year Vit. B12 in any form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who receive other treatment for RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant or nursing mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient known as suffering from Leber's optic atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients suffering from psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement for treatment effectiveness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principle measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of RAS occurrences during treatment (number of episodes per month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of sores per RAS occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Score of severity level according to a pain scale (Visual analog scale, VAS), average at&#xD;
           time of RAS occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain Register&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving permission from the Helsinki Committee and before beginning the process of&#xD;
      subject selection, we will register our research study with the International Clinical&#xD;
      Registration System (/http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov). Then we will recruit 20 primary&#xD;
      physicians who will volunteer to ask 200 patients each concerning recurrent canker sores in&#xD;
      the mouth. (These patients will be those who come to the physician for other reasons.) Out of&#xD;
      these 4000 patients according to the literature, 800 patients suffer from RAS. We expect that&#xD;
      half of these (about 400 patients) will report that the problem exists and half of those will&#xD;
      agree to participate in the research study. According to our estimate, about 200 patients&#xD;
      will adhere to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients who are ready to participate in the study will receive from their physician&#xD;
      the cell phone number of the Nose Throat and Ear physician (G.Z.) and the physician will ask&#xD;
      the patient to contact G.Z. when they have a canker sore. In addition the patient's physician&#xD;
      will also give the patient a written health synopsis, which will include any chronic&#xD;
      diseases, sensitivity to medication and medical treatment. The patient will give this&#xD;
      synopsis to one of the investigators ((IV, YP, RP, IR,) when they meet with him. The patient&#xD;
      will then contact G.Z. and will be examined by him within 48 hours after the canker sore(s)&#xD;
      appear to ascertain that the condition is actually recurrent aphthous stomatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient actually suffers from aphthous stomatitis, G.Z. will hand over the patient's&#xD;
      information to one of the investigators. One of the investigators will contact the patient&#xD;
      and make an appointment with him the next week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meetings with the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred (100) of the first patients who are found to suffer from aphthous stomatitis and&#xD;
      who answer the inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive a detailed explanation in one of the&#xD;
      languages, Hebrew, Russian, English about the purposes of the study, the research design, the&#xD;
      risks involved in the research, and possible side effects. Those patients who sign the&#xD;
      informed consent form will then be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this meeting the investigator will then fill out a form including socio-demographic data,&#xD;
      a detailed anamnesis concerning the RAS (including number of years the patient has suffered&#xD;
      from RAS, frequency of the problem in the past year, treatment that the patient has received&#xD;
      for RAS in the past). The physician will also take measurements of height, weight and blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will also have a blood test to measure the level of Vit. B12. (The sample will&#xD;
      undergo centrifuge within the next few hours and the serum will be kept frozen until the test&#xD;
      is done.) Since in our retrospective study (to be published) we did not find any difference&#xD;
      in the result of treatment between people with patients having high and low levels of Vit.&#xD;
      B12 in their blood, the level of Vit. B12 was not included as a criterion for inclusion or&#xD;
      exclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive instructions concerning filling out the &quot;Canker Sore Diary&quot; and the&#xD;
      use of VAS. The patients will be given an appointment in another month. They will also&#xD;
      receive the cell phone number for on of the investigators in order to contact him if and when&#xD;
      an unexpected side effect occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects included in the study will be divided randomly into two groups (study group and&#xD;
      control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meetings with Research Assistant 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a month from the time they met with the investigator, each patient will meet with&#xD;
      Research Assistant 1 (physician), who will collect the &quot;Canker Sore Diary&quot; and will give the&#xD;
      patient a bottle with 30 tablets of active ingredients or of placebo, according to which&#xD;
      group he belongs (Control or Study). The patient will receive six (6) more appointments (once&#xD;
      every month). The whole series of appointments will be decided in advance. A few days before&#xD;
      each appointment the Research Assistant 1 will telephone the patient and remind him when and&#xD;
      where the appointment will be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each of the six meetings the patient will give the Research Assistant 1 the &quot;Canker&#xD;
      Sore Diary&quot;, he will report on the new tablets that he has begun to take the last month, and&#xD;
      the Research Assistant will count how many tablets are left in the bottle and will list the&#xD;
      side effects, if any. At the end of the meeting the patient will receive the bottle of&#xD;
      tablets for the next month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to check the fact that the investigators did not know which patient was given which&#xD;
      treatment, each investigator will be asked to &quot;guess&quot; which type of treatment each patient&#xD;
      received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was done by Research Assistant 2. Upon assigning a serial number for each&#xD;
      subject, the Research Assistant will flip a coin according to which he will determine to&#xD;
      which group the subject will belong. This number for the group will then be recorded on the&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assurance of &quot;double blind&quot; design: In order that the investigators will not know to which&#xD;
      group the subject belongs, the code of the randomization will be saved in the computer in a&#xD;
      protected by user name and the password will be know only to Research Assistant 2&#xD;
      (responsible for randomization, who will be the only one who knows in which box, No. 1 or No.&#xD;
      2, has the active ingredient, Vit. B12. The code which were assigned to the boxes for the&#xD;
      investigators will be revealed only after the data has been processed. The research&#xD;
      assistants will not take part in data processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Assistant 2 (responsible for randomization and knowing the code on the bottles) will&#xD;
      not meet with the subjects and will not know any information about the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be entered and processed by Research Assistant 3 in Epi-Info-Data 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis will be done by the investigators with the aide of another research&#xD;
      assistant (statistician) using SPSS. For statistical analysis the t-test and 2 will be used&#xD;
      with a confidence level of P&lt; 0.05.&#xD;
