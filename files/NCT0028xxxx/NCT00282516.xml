      OBJECTIVE: Determine whether home asthma telemonitoring using store-and-forward technology&#xD;
      improves outcomes when compared to in-person, office-based visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: 120 patients 6-17 yrs with persistent asthma were randomized into two groups: office&#xD;
      or virtual. Both groups followed the same ambulatory clinical pathway for 12 months. Office&#xD;
      patients received traditional in-person education and case management. Virtual patients&#xD;
      received computers, Internet connection, and in-home Web-based case management and received&#xD;
      education via the study web site. They also recorded and forwarded a video of peak flow and&#xD;
      inhaler use to their case manager two times a week for 6 weeks then once a week thereafter&#xD;
      and submitted daily asthma diaries electronically via the web site. Virtual patients were&#xD;
      seen in-person only 3 times. Regimen adherence was assessed by monitoring therapeutic&#xD;
      (controller medication use, video medication use) and diagnostic (asthma symptom diary and&#xD;
      peak flow submitted electronically) outcomes. Disease control outcome measures included&#xD;
      quality of life, utilization of services, and symptom control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESULTS: 120 volunteers (45 females) were enrolled. The groups were clinically comparable:&#xD;
      office 22 females, 38 males 9.0 + 3.0 yrs (mean + SD) virtual 23 females, 37 males, 10.2 +&#xD;
      3.1 yrs. Virtual patients had higher metered-dose inhaler/valved holding chamber score than&#xD;
      the office group at 52 weeks (94% vs 89%, p &lt; 0.05), a higher adherence to daily asthma&#xD;
      symptom diary submission (35.4% vs 20.8 %, p &lt; 0.01), less participant time (636 vs 713&#xD;
      patient months, p &lt; 0.05), and were older (10.2 + 3.1 years virtual, 9.0 + 3.0 office, p &lt;&#xD;
      0.05). Caregivers in both groups perceived an increase in quality of life (p&lt;0.05) and an&#xD;
      increase in asthma knowledge scores from baseline (p &lt; 0.01). There were no other outcome&#xD;
      differences in therapeutic or disease control or outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSION: Virtual patients achieved excellent asthma therapeutic and disease control&#xD;
      outcomes. When compared to idealized office-based care they were more adherent to diary&#xD;
      submission and had better inhaler scores at 52 weeks than office-based patients.&#xD;
      Store-and-forward telemedicine technology and case management provides an additional tool to&#xD;
      assist in the management of children with persistent asthma.&#xD;
