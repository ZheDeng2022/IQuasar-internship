  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of oral&#xD;
      topiramate for the preventative management of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. It is believed that&#xD;
      topiramate will decrease the frequency, duration and severity of attacks experienced by&#xD;
      children and adolescents with Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is very little controlled data on the preventative treatment for Cyclic Vomiting&#xD;
      Syndrome. The existing evidence consists of small, retrospective clinical series that&#xD;
      evaluate symptomatic responses to five medications including cyproheptadine, propranolol,&#xD;
      amitriptyline, phenobarbital and pizotifen (n &gt;10). These published data consist of&#xD;
      uncontrolled or retrospective reports. In addition, varying inclusion criteria and outcomes&#xD;
      (i.e. obtained by family recall) were used in these studies limiting the basis upon which to&#xD;
      compare relative effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the prospective baseline period, the subject will maintain cyclical vomiting records&#xD;
      in which all headache occurrences will be recorded and characterized. (Cyclical vomiting&#xD;
      records will be maintained throughout the study). The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness, tolerability and safety of oral topiramate for the preventative management of&#xD;
      Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome using a prospective design, established diagnostic criteria (ICHD&#xD;
      2004), and defined, objective primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
