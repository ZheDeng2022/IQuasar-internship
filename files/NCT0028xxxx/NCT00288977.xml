    <textblock>
      Study hypothesis is that we can reproduce results of islet transplantation in type one&#xD;
      diabetics in patients with a kidney transplant.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to replicate the protocol currently being tested by the Immune&#xD;
      Tolerance Network (ITN) in a population of patients that have been previously transplanted&#xD;
      (recipients of functioning renal allografts) and are therefore immunosuppressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be generated using substantially identical techniques for islet preparation, re&#xD;
      transplantation with additional islets to meet the minimum islet cell mass, and an identical&#xD;
      steroid-free post-transplant regimen utilizing sirolimus, low dose tacrolimus, and&#xD;
      daclizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Primary and secondary endpoints and additional measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study efficacy endpoints and additional measures are described in the following subsections.&#xD;
      Measures relating to the islet preparation quality (Section 3.1.3) and other variables&#xD;
      relating to key cellular and genetic markers (Section 3.1.4) followed during the study are&#xD;
      not considered clinical outcome variables. Details describing requirements for efficacy&#xD;
      testing are found in Section 6.1. Safety measures are described in Section 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.1. Primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this study is independence from insulin injections with adequate&#xD;
      control of blood glucose in subjects with Type 1 diabetes at one year post final transplant.&#xD;
      Subjects will be considered as a success when at the one year assessment they are not using&#xD;
      insulin, they have a HbA1c &lt;6.5% and they achieve fasting glucose levels not exceeding 7.8&#xD;
      mmol/L (140 mg/dL) more than three times in a week (using the morning fasting glucose level),&#xD;
      and not exceeding two hour post-prandial (using any post meal glucose level) values of 10&#xD;
      mmol/L (180 mg/dL) more than four times in a week. A subject will still be considered a&#xD;
      success if an intercurrent illness or other event (e.g., high tacrolimus level) causes a&#xD;
      participant to require insulin use for a period not exceeding a total of 14 days, and&#xD;
      assessment after this event demonstrates insulin independence and adequate glucose control as&#xD;
      defined above. This assessment must be completed no later than two weeks after the scheduled&#xD;
      one year assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.2. Secondary parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary parameters that support the primary goal of the investigation will be assessed at&#xD;
      generally the same intervals as the primary endpoint, with some taken more or less frequently&#xD;
      as indicated in detail in Sections 5.2 and 6.1. Additional clinical measurements are also&#xD;
      taken during the study that are not considered endpoints for formal analyses, but are to be&#xD;
      carefully followed as a part of the study. The schedule for these additional elements is&#xD;
      listed in Sections 5.2, 6.2 and 7.2. The secondary variables include the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basal C-peptide levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HbA1C levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Glucose tolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. C-peptide response to arginine&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. MAGE improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Mixed Meal Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Durability of insulin independence and adequate blood glucose control&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.3. Islet quality endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Islet cell preparations for each transplant will be assessed using the following elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Islet yield per isolation used for clinical transplantation, expressed as i) total islet&#xD;
           equivalents and ii) islet equivalents per kg recipient body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Islet viability, as assessed by a fluorescent dye inclusion/exclusion assay to assess&#xD;
           metabolic activity and membrane integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In vitro islet responsiveness to glucose challenge, as measured by 2-hour static&#xD;
           incubation following 12-24 hour culture at 37ยบ C in CMRL 1066 (10% FCS, 25 mmol HEPES).&#xD;
           A stimulation index, a ratio of insulin secretion during high glucose over insulin&#xD;
           secretion during low basal secretion is calculated as an index of islet function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Islet cell immunohistochemical composition and purity assessment, (as determined by JDRF&#xD;
           Center for Islet Transplantation at Harvard Medical School - Islet Morphology Core&#xD;
           Laboratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evidence of no microbial contamination, as documented by a negative Gram stain of the&#xD;
           islet preparation immediately pre-transplant, and by negative microbial cultures&#xD;
           reported after at least 5 days incubation for aerobes, anaerobes, fungi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evidence of a low endotoxin content of the final islet preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.4. Cellular and genetic markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected before and after transplant for immunologic studies to be processed&#xD;
      in the laboratories of Dr. Terry Strom at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Dr.&#xD;
      Mohamed Sayegh at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Alteration in autoimmune markers for GAD65, ICA512, and mIAA, comparing blood samples&#xD;
           drawn pre-transplant and 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 36 months after final transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in autoantibody and other immune markers comparing blood samples drawn&#xD;
           pre-transplant and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after final transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Samples will also be taken for future laboratory and genetic studies comparing blood&#xD;
           samples drawn pre-transplant and usually 3, 6, and 12 months after final transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Description of trial design and schematic diagram of procedures and stages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this is an open-label, single-arm study, a schematic diagram of the design is omitted&#xD;
      for simplicity. For a general description of the trial design, please refer to Section 2. A&#xD;
      tabular listing of visit schedules and tests is found in Appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Measures to minimize bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label feasibility study with definitive clinical endpoints of insulin&#xD;
      independence, blood glucose and C peptide production as measures of procedural success. As&#xD;
      donor islets become available the appropriate ABO compatible blood types will be matched to&#xD;
      eligible participants. Clinical investigators are not masked to treatment assignment or&#xD;
      follow up assessment information for this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4. Description of trial treatments and dosage regimen &amp; labeling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each islet cell transplantation procedure under this protocol is derived from an individual&#xD;
      donor pancreas, processed for immediate transplantation. All containers and components are&#xD;
      appropriately labeled during preparation. Each final islet preparation released for use is&#xD;
      labeled to indicate its identity and date of preparation. Records regarding donor identity&#xD;
      will be kept in a coded manner for quality control purposes and will be kept absolutely&#xD;
      confidential in accordance with standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.1. Islet Infusion(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A target total of &gt; 10,000 IE/kg recipient body weight will be infused via a percutaneous&#xD;
      transhepatic catheter inserted into the portal vein (see Section 1.4.2). This will in all&#xD;
      likelihood require more than one islet infusion to achieve this goal. The first infusion must&#xD;
      contain at least 5,000 IE/kg recipient body weight. In the event that a subject does not&#xD;
      achieve insulin-independence with normoglycemia after two fresh islet infusions, a third&#xD;
      transplant may be considered as described in Section 5.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.2. Immunosuppressive Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning with the initial transplant, a immunosuppressive regimen will be administered to&#xD;
      all subjects. Subjects will receive initial doses of daclizumab, sirolimus, and low dose&#xD;
      tacrolimus according to the following schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.2.1. Daclizumab regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daclizumab will be administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg peripheral IV given immediately&#xD;
      pre-transplant, and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after transplant, for a total of 5 doses (over 8&#xD;
      weeks). If a subsequent islet infusion is required beyond this induction period, then a&#xD;
      further 5 dose course of daclizumab will be given according to the same schedule. If the&#xD;
      second (or third) transplant occurs and no daclizumab was given in the preceding 7 days, then&#xD;
      the dosing regimen will begin at the time of transplant. If daclizumab has been administered&#xD;
      within the past 7 days, then the dose at transplant is omitted, and the first dose given 2&#xD;
      weeks post transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.2.2. Sirolimus regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in this trial will already be on Sirolimus therapy. If needed, the dose&#xD;
      will be increased to 0.1 mg/kg/day PO and adjusted to the target range of 12-15 ng/ml for the&#xD;
      3 months following the most recent islet infusion. After three months following last&#xD;
      transplant, the target whole blood level will be lowered to 7-10ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.2.3. Tacrolimus regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in this trial will already be on Tacrolimus therapy. As soon as trough&#xD;
      levels are available, the dose will be adjusted to the target range of 3-6 ng/ml throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
