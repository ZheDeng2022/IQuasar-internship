  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with paclitaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma. Bortezomib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may&#xD;
      help paclitaxel and carboplatin kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to&#xD;
      these drugs&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the confirmed tumor response rate and adverse event profile of bortezomib,&#xD;
      carboplatin, and paclitaxel as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate time to tumor progression, overall survival, and duration of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, and 8 and&#xD;
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>If at most 3 of the first 19 eligible patients enrolled achieved a partial or complete response by the RECIST criteria, then enrollment would be terminated and the regimen would be considered inactive in this patient population.
