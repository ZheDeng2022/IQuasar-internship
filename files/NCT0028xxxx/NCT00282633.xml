      A Comparison of Skin Closure Techniques after Primary Cesarean Delivery. Traci N. Gray, M.D.&#xD;
      and Peter F. Schnatz, D.O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, observer blinded, randomized, and controlled trial comparing Dermabond closure&#xD;
      technique to suture closure of skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants: All women age 18years or older who provide informed consent prior to&#xD;
      primary Cesarean delivery at Hartford Hospital. Women with vertical skin incisions and or who&#xD;
      are febrile preop or intraop will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Qualified participants will then be randomized to skin closure with either Dermabond&#xD;
      or suture. Surgeon preference will dictate usage of 4-0 monocryl or 4-0 vicryl for skin&#xD;
      closure for patients randomized to the suture arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The circulating nurse will time all skin closures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The surgeon will complete a 3 question survey immediately postop.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the 6 week post partum visit, patients and the health care professional will complete&#xD;
           a brief query regarding cosmetic appeal and pain. A disposable camera will be supplied&#xD;
           to each provider office and a photo will be taken of the incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All photos will be evaluated for cosmesis by physicians who will be blinded to the&#xD;
           methods of skin closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes: To compare the time needed to close skin. To compare cosmetic outcome after&#xD;
      healing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: Patient Pain scores. Provider and patient satisfaction. Responses to&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the practice of surgical wound closure and subsequent care is based upon tradition&#xD;
      and individual preference rather than science. Most patients undergoing cesarean deliveries&#xD;
      at Hartford Hospital have a subcuticular running closure. Occasionally, patients have a&#xD;
      staple closure, at the discretion of the operating surgeon. With newly introduced wound&#xD;
      closure techniques, we intend to compare an approved closure technique (Dermabond) with the&#xD;
      more traditional suture closure via a prospective, observer blinded, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will include all women who provide informed consent prior to undergoing&#xD;
      cesarean section at Hartford Hospital. Patients will be excluded from the study if they will&#xD;
      require a vertical skin incision; are allergic to Dermabond; or have a temperature &gt; 100.2 F&#xD;
      preop or intraop. Qualified patients will then be randomized to skin closure with either the&#xD;
      Dermabond wound closure technique or suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closure method randomization will be performed prospectively by placing closure modality&#xD;
      options in opaque sealed envelopes prior to the initiation of the study. The envelopes will&#xD;
      be available in the operating room. The circulating nurse will open the envelope to reveal&#xD;
      the randomization arm prior to skin closure and the surgeon will utilize the indicated&#xD;
      technique. The circulating nurse will record the length of time needed to close the skin&#xD;
      incision. The surgeon will complete a short survey immediately post operatively regarding&#xD;
      ease of use of the closure modality as well as expected cosmetic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is randomized to suture, surgeon preference will dictate whether 4-0 vicryl or&#xD;
      4-0 monocryl will be used as well as whether Keith or curved needle will be utilized. Patient&#xD;
      demographics and contact information will be obtained prior to initiation of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to initiation of surgery, the operative field will be prepared by dry shaving the site&#xD;
      with a disposable razor then cleansing the abdomen with Betadine using sterile technique.&#xD;
      Hibiclens soap will be substituted for patients who are sensitive or allergic to iodine. A&#xD;
      first generation Cephalosporin will be administered ~ 30 minutes preop for patients&#xD;
      undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery. If the procedure is unscheduled, a first generation&#xD;
      Cephalosporin will be administered after cord clamp if the patient has not already received&#xD;
      antibiotics preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' post operative pain medicine requirements and pain self assessment scores will&#xD;
      be monitored during their post operative hospital course as documented in the medication logs&#xD;
      on their charts. Most patients will be discharged on postoperative day three or four unless&#xD;
      complications arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be seen in the office for a 6-week post partum follow up. A medical&#xD;
      professional will assess their wounds. The patient and the medical professional will be&#xD;
      queried regarding their satisfaction with cosmetic outcome of the wound. The patient will&#xD;
      also be queried regarding continued pain medicine requirements. If the patient does not show&#xD;
      up for their post partum visit, they will be called to obtain this information and to arrange&#xD;
      a time for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each medical professional will be provided with a disposable camera. The camera will be used&#xD;
      to take pictures of each patient's wound at the 6-week follow up visit. Specific guidelines&#xD;
      will be provided regarding the distance and angle at which the pictures should be taken to&#xD;
      ensure optimal and uniform photo clarity. The pictures will be reviewed at a later time by a&#xD;
      panel of observers who will be blinded to the type of wound closure that the patient&#xD;
      received. The observer will assess each picture for wound cosmesis and healing to provide&#xD;
      standardized objective evaluation of wound closure outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will be surgical time (wound closure only), patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      blinded observer-rated cosmesis. Using a 1:3 randomization scheme, group sample sizes of 25&#xD;
      (test/Dermabond) and 75 (control/suture) would achieve 80% power to detect a difference of&#xD;
      1.0 between the null hypothesis that both group means for satisfaction and cosmesis are 3.0&#xD;
      (&quot;average&quot;) and the alternative hypothesis that the mean of the Dermabond group is 2.0&#xD;
      (&quot;above average&quot;) with estimated group standard deviations of 1.5 and with a significance&#xD;
      level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided, two-sample t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming the average closure time for the suture group is 6 minutes (SD +/-1), and&#xD;
      hypothesizing an average closure time in the Dermabond group of 1.5 minutes (SD +/- 0.5&#xD;
      minutes), these sample sizes would afford better than 99% power to detect differences in&#xD;
      surgical (closure) time between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Women's Health Department at Hartford Hospital performs an average of 12 procedures per&#xD;
      week (range 10-15). If 70% of the eligible women consent to participate, it should take&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks to accrue the minimum number of subjects. However, if the&#xD;
      participation rate is 80%-85%, only 10-11 weeks should be required for accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis / Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics on continuous variables (e.g., height, weight, maternal age,&#xD;
      gestational age, surgical (closure) time) will consist of means, standard deviations and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals. Frequencies of race and ethnicity also will be run. To evaluate the&#xD;
      primary outcomes between treatment arms, differences in closure time, patient satisfaction&#xD;
      and observed healing, t-tests will be utilized. Subgroup comparisons (e.g., within the suture&#xD;
      group between curved and Keith needles) also will be performed with t-tests. Secondary&#xD;
      analyses of dichotomous (yes/no) variables, including surgeon responses to &quot;Did you find this&#xD;
      method effective?&quot; and &quot;Did you find this method burdensome?&quot; will be evaluated with a c2&#xD;
      test. Although infections may occur and will be noted, the rate is anticipated to be so low&#xD;
      that statistical assessment will not be necessary. Statistically significant differences will&#xD;
      be considered as analyses resulting in p&lt;0.05. All analyses will be performed with SPSS v.&#xD;
      11.5 (Chicago, IL, 2003).&#xD;
