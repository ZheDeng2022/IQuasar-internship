  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of DA-8159, an&#xD;
      orally administered, potent and selective inhibitor of PDE5, versus placebo for the treatment&#xD;
      of subjects with erectile dysfunction (ED).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      study in 300 erectile dysfunction patients. Patients will complete a screening visit (V1) to&#xD;
      determine eligibility for the study based on the International Index of Erectile Function&#xD;
      (IIEF) erectile function (EF) domain scores, patient history and safety measures. Patients&#xD;
      that meet the entrance criteria for this study will enter a 4 week, drug-free run-in period&#xD;
      to establish a baseline for the erectile function domain score and to meet the criteria for&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients successfully completing screen will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment&#xD;
      groups at Visit 2 (V2): placebo or one of 3 active drug doses of DA-8159 tablets. Patients&#xD;
      will be given medication for at-home use and will also be given diaries for recording&#xD;
      information regarding sexual encounters, quality of erections and adverse events. At 4-week&#xD;
      intervals for 3 months (V3, V4, V5), patients will return to the clinic to review and collect&#xD;
      SEP diaries, safety data, 12-lead ECG and medication reconciliation. In addition, at each&#xD;
      4-week interval patients will complete an IIEF, and at Visit 5 will have blood drawn for&#xD;
      safety evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy end points are: a) the change in score (baseline to Visit 5) for the&#xD;
      Erectile Function domain score of the IIEF, b) change in response, relative to baseline, for&#xD;
      sexual encounter profile (SEP) question 2, and c) change in response, relative to baseline,&#xD;
      for SEP question 3. For DA-8159 tablets to be judged efficacious, the DA-8159 tablet groups&#xD;
      must be shown superior to the placebo group on all three measures.&#xD;
