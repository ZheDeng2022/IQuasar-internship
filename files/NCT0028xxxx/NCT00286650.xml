  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paracetamol is commonly used to reduce pain after operations. Recently anaesthetists have&#xD;
      been using bigger doses of paracetamol because it has been suggested that bigger doses will&#xD;
      work better. However these bigger doses have never been assessed scientifically in adult&#xD;
      patients to see if they work better, and it has not been determined at which dose the maximum&#xD;
      effect in reducing pain occurs. We We will investigate whether a 90 mg per kg body weight&#xD;
      dose works better than a 60 mg per kilogram dose, in reducing pain after wisdom tooth&#xD;
      extraction. We will also examine the pharmacokinetics (the way the body removes the drug) of&#xD;
      paracetamol, and whether paracetamol changes the way blood clots at these doses. We will also&#xD;
      examine whether these doses are safe, by monitoring liver enzymes, and making sure the blood&#xD;
      level of paracetamol is not greater than that previously recognised to cause liver disease.&#xD;
      The patients will be healthy volunteers scheduled to have wisdom tooth extraction. They will&#xD;
      have blood taken at intervals for four hours after having the paracetamol. They will fill in&#xD;
      pain scores at the same times they have blood taken.&#xD;

      A randomised, crossover dose-effect trial of paracetamol 60 and 90 mg/kg in third molar&#xD;
      surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Paracetamol is the most widely used analgesic in New Zealand but relatively little&#xD;
      is known about its dose effect and concentration effect relationships. It appears that there&#xD;
      is greater effect above the currently recommended dose, but the maximal effect has not as yet&#xD;
      been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol is toxic in overdose but the dose at which toxicity becomes apparent is disputed.&#xD;
      In the past, the dose at which toxicity may become apparent has been 125 mg/kg/day, but more&#xD;
      recently this has been revised upwards to 150 mg/kg/day in children (1). In children it has&#xD;
      been proposed that toxicity does not develop following single ingestions of up to 200&#xD;
      mg/kg/day (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol is metabolised by multiple pathways: urinary excretion of an oral dose is 55% as&#xD;
      glucuronide conjugates, 30% as cysteine conjugates, 4% as mercapturic acid and cysteine&#xD;
      conjugates (3). The mercapturic and cysteine conjugates are derived from a toxic intermediary&#xD;
      metabolite, produced by oxidative metabolism by CYP2E1, and to a lesser degree CYP3A4 and&#xD;
      CYP1A2 (4). At doses of up to 1500 mg the metabolism appears to be unchanged but there is no&#xD;
      data for doses at or above 90 mg/kg (5). It has been proposed that paracetamol metabolism&#xD;
      becomes saturated at higher doses and saturation of sulfation has been observed in rats (6).&#xD;
      However saturation of either sulfation or glucuronidation has not been observed in cultured&#xD;
      human hepatocytes (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In overdose, paracetamol has been observed to inhibit the activity of vitamin-K dependent&#xD;
      clotting factors, in particular functional factor VII (7). This may explain the interaction&#xD;
      between paracetamol and warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the dose and effect relationship for paracetamol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the concentration and effect relationship for paracetamol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the changes in metabolism of paracetamol with escalating doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effect of paracetamol on functional factor VII (effect on coagulation&#xD;
           mechanism) with increasing dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighteen healthy adults, male or female, aged 18 to 50 years scheduled for removal of&#xD;
      bilateral, impacted, lower wisdom teeth will be recruited for the trial in the dental school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intolerance to oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taking paracetamol and unable to abstain prior to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypersensitivity to paracetamol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver or renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poor nutritional status, eating disorder, or Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight greater than 87 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anticonvulsant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic ethanol abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H/o bleeding disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to avoid all non-essential medications, paracetamol, alcohol,&#xD;
      herbal medicines and recreational drugs for 72 hours prior to the study and are required to&#xD;
      fast for three hours prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data Demographic data including height, weight and age will be recorded for each&#xD;
      patient. Medications pre-, peri- and post-operatively will be recorded. Regular use of&#xD;
      alcohol, caffeinated beverages and smoking will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be fasted for three hours prior to the procedure. An intravenous line will&#xD;
      be inserted and intravenous midazolam administered, with the dose titrated to sedative&#xD;
      effect; use of sedation, oral or intravenous, for third molar extractions is a common&#xD;
      practice in dentistry. Local anaesthetic (2% Lignocaine with adrenaline 1/80000) will be&#xD;
      administered at the commencement of the procedure. The paracetamol will be administered as&#xD;
      capsules, made by the Pharmacy Dept of the University of Otago 30 minutes prior to the&#xD;
      procedure. Dosing will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rndomised, double blind, cross over design will be used for each side for the surgery. Both&#xD;
      the side of extraction and the treatment will be randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure the patients will be observed by using pulse oximetry and blood&#xD;
      pressure. The patients will be requested to stay at the dental school for 4 hours after the&#xD;
      paracetamol dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient should require additional pain relief, they will be given codeine 30 mg or&#xD;
      diclofenac 50 mg. The patients will be instructed to avoid additional doses of paracetamol&#xD;
      for 48 hours. Further analgesia on subsequent days will be provided with NSAIDs (diclofenac)&#xD;
      and/ or codeine phosphate In appropriate doses Prophylactic antibiotics will be used where&#xD;
      necessary according to usual treatment practice.-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected at times: 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 480 minutes through the&#xD;
      cannula already in place in the standard manner. (Note time 0 is the time of paracetamol&#xD;
      dosing). 3-6 mL of blood is collected on each occasion and then transferred into a 6 mL&#xD;
      heparinised saline vacutainer®. These will be spun in an Eppendorf® Centrifuge 5810R at 4000&#xD;
      g for 5 minutes. Plasma will be removed and transferred into a 2 mL microtube (Eppendorf®&#xD;
      safe lock) prior to freezing at -20°C. The catheter line and extension will be kept patent&#xD;
      using heparinised saline (10 IU/ mL) flushes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine collected from: (pass urine at time 0 and discard), 0 to 120, 120 to 240 and 240 to 480&#xD;
      minutes. Urine volume will be measured and recorded. An aliquot of urine from each time&#xD;
      interval will be stored at -200C prior to assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will also be collected at 0 and 24 hours for ALT, AST, PT and clotting factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional sample of blood will be collected at four hours after administration of&#xD;
      paracetamol forserum paracetamol level estimation. . If this level is greater than the&#xD;
      treatment threshold on the New Zealand Poisons Centre Substance Database, the patient will be&#xD;
      treated with n-acetylcysteine by the standard treatment protocol as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain score:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual analogue pain score (0-100 mm scale) will be recorded at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180,&#xD;
      210, 240, 480 minutes and at 24 hours after the end of surgery. Mouth opening (trismus) will&#xD;
      be assessed at 0 and 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine&#xD;
      the concentrations of paracetamol and its metabolites, paracetamol glucuronide, paracetamol&#xD;
      cysteine, paracetamol sulphate and paracetamol mercapturate. Urine samples were prepared for&#xD;
      HPLC by centrifuging at 2000rpm and then diluting the supernatent 1 in 10 with mobile phase.&#xD;
      This was injected directly onto an Aqua C18 reversed phase column, 250mm x 4.6mm i.d. with a&#xD;
      5 micron pore size (Phenomenex) via a C18, 5 micron guard column. The mobile phase used was&#xD;
      7% acetonitrile - 93% orthophosphoric acid (20mM pH 6.7) at a flow rate of 1ml/min using a&#xD;
      Shimadzu LC10-AT pump and a Shimadzu SPD-10AV ultraviolet absorbance detector operating at&#xD;
      254nm. Calibration curves were constructed for each of the metabolites and paracetamol in&#xD;
      blank urine using the peak area and were linear over the range 0.05 - 5mM. The method was&#xD;
      found to be reproducible with a coefficient of variation of 2.6%. The metabolites of&#xD;
      paracetamol; glucuronide, cysteine, sulphate, mercapturate and paracetamol itself eluted in&#xD;
      3.9, 8, 10.2, 12.2 and 13.4 minutes respectively. Reference samples of paracetamol cysteine,&#xD;
      sulphate and mercapturate were kindly supplied by Dr Anthony R. Temple MD, McNeil Consumer&#xD;
      Healthcare, Camp Hill Road, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies of dental pain have indicated a maximum intensity of pain at around 8 hours&#xD;
      following third molar extractions. On a 100 mm visual analogue scale the mean (S.D.) pain&#xD;
      score was 40.9 (24.4). At a pain score of 27.3 the S.D. was 17.2. We estimate that 17&#xD;
      patients are required for a power of 80% and a 50% decrease in pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues The fee for surgery will be waived for the participants. There will be no&#xD;
      other financial inducement. Paracetamol is known to cause hepatotoxicity and fatality in&#xD;
      overdosage. These effects have not been reported with single ingestions of less than 150&#xD;
      mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be undergoing a dental procedure and there will be the normal risks&#xD;
      associated with such procedures.&#xD;
