        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with a tumorous lesion in the liver observed in diagnostic imaging such as&#xD;
             ultrasonography, etc., conducted between 1 and 35 days before administration of the&#xD;
             investigational agent, who are scheduled to undergo a dynamic CT examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients between 20 and 80 years old at the time informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients weighing &gt;= 55.6 and &lt; 105.0 kg at the time consent is obtained and when the&#xD;
             investigational agent is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:Issues affecting the safety evaluation of the investigational agent:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who will have undergone or are scheduled to undergo an examination using&#xD;
             another contrast agent from 7 days before administration of the investigational agent&#xD;
             up to the time follow-up examinations are performed on day 8 after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients for whom there is a strong possibility that a follow-up period, which extends&#xD;
             up until examinations are performed on day 8 after administration, would not be&#xD;
             possible, (i.e., when it will not be possible to evaluate delayed adverse drug&#xD;
             reactions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have undergone or are scheduled to undergo surgical treatment or a&#xD;
             therapy such as percutaneous ethanol injection therapy, percutaneous microwave&#xD;
             coagulation therapy, radiofrequency ablation, or transcatheter arterial embolization,&#xD;
             etc., from the time diagnostic imaging such as abdominal ultrasonography is performed&#xD;
             up until follow-up examinations are conducted on day 8 after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are unable to discontinue taking analgesics during the period from the&#xD;
             morning when the investigational agent is administered until CT examinations are&#xD;
             completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who cannot stop taking biguanide antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin&#xD;
             hydrochloride and buformin hydrochloride, for three days after study agent&#xD;
             administration (including administration day).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who are currently participating in another clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who participated in another clinical study within the 6 months prior to&#xD;
             providing informed consent to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        General concerns relating to the safety of the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients in the acute stage of illness with unstable symptoms, or patients in a&#xD;
             life-threatening condition (when it is expected that emergency treatment may be&#xD;
             required between the time of registration and the conclusion of the follow-up period,&#xD;
             or when the patient is not expected to survive for 3 months following administration&#xD;
             of the investigational agent, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to iodine or iodinated contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with serious thyroid disease (goiter, hyperthyroidism, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with serious cardiopathy (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class&#xD;
             IV heart failure, shock, cyanosis, peripheral circulatory insufficiency, ventricular&#xD;
             tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or complete atrioventricular block)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with serious hepatopathy [symptoms of liver failure (fulminant hepatitis)&#xD;
             such as a disturbance of consciousness corresponding to grade 3 in the Criteria for&#xD;
             Grading Adverse Drug Reactions of Medicinal Products.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with moderate serious nephropathy (acute kidney failure, chronic kidney&#xD;
             failure, hydronephrosis, nephrotic syndrome, or uremia with serum creatinine levels of&#xD;
             2.0 mg/dL or more, corresponding to grade 2 or above in the Criteria for Grading&#xD;
             Adverse Drug Reactions of Medicinal Products.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with bronchial asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with acute pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with macroglobulinemia&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with multiple myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with tetany&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with pheochromocytoma or who are suspected of having pheochromocytoma&#xD;
