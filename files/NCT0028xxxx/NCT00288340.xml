      The goal of the project is to characterize abnormalities in brain structure and function&#xD;
      related to schizophrenia. The investigators will use advanced magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) techniques to measure the degree and distribution of neuronal activity during specific&#xD;
      cognitive tasks, alterations in neuronal connectivity, and how these are related to disease&#xD;
      symptoms and treatment.&#xD;

      The goal of the project is to characterize abnormalities in brain structure and function&#xD;
      related to schizophrenia. We will use advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to&#xD;
      measure the degree and distribution of neuronal activity during specific cognitive tasks,&#xD;
      alterations in neuronal connectivity, and how these are related to disease symptoms and&#xD;
      treatment. We will focus on changes in brain structure and function associated with frequent&#xD;
      auditory hallucinations, one of the most disabling manifestations of schizophrenia, and with&#xD;
      neuroleptic treatment. In order to address these aims, we will study four groups of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients who have frequent auditory hallucinations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients who are beginning a regimen of anti-psychotic medication,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. patients who do not have frequent hallucinations and are not changing medication&#xD;
           strategies, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. age-matched normal controls. Each group will contain 15 subjects for a total of 60.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Meet diagnostic criteria for any psychiatric disorder with auditory hallucinations (at&#xD;
             least one every 20 minutes) including schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder OR&#xD;
             schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder without auditory hallucinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been treated with an antipsychotic drug for hallucinations at least three months&#xD;
             or are unmedicated&#xD;
