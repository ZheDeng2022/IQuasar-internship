  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) have repetitive episodes of partial or complete&#xD;
      upper airway obstruction during sleep. This leads to sleep fragmentation and symptoms like&#xD;
      excessive daytime sleepiness and impaired psychosocial well-being. More evidence now&#xD;
      suggested OSA is associated with cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, pulmonary hypertension and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The upper airway structure and function are altered in OSA. Some studies suggested that an&#xD;
      increase in the levels of systemic biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in&#xD;
      patients with OSA. So far, there is only very limited data on non-invasive monitoring of&#xD;
      inflammation involved in the upper airway of OSA patients. The inflammatory mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in the upper airway may give some insights to the systemic effect, like&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications, of OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of the constituents of exhaled breath and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a&#xD;
      non-invasive method to assess the degree of inflammation of the airway. Exhaled nitric oxide&#xD;
      (eNO) can be measured with the subject exhaling to a mouthpiece connected to a machine&#xD;
      measuring real-time eNO level. With the subject exhaling to a cooling unit, EBC can be&#xD;
      collected as liquid is formed as a result of condensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the eNO in exhaled breath, oxidative stress marker (8-isoprostane) and&#xD;
      cellular inflammatory markers (eotaxin, monocyted derived chemokine, growth related oncogene-&#xD;
      alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) in the EBC and blood of OSA patients before and&#xD;
      after 1 night and 3 months of continuous positive airway pressure treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of exhaled Nitric Oxide and collection of exhaled breath condensate and&#xD;
      peripheral blood. This will be done 2 to 4 times(on admission,the morning after sleep&#xD;
      study,immediately after CPAP titration, after CPAP use for 3 months). Each time eNO will be&#xD;
      measured first, followed by EBC collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the tests in the morning, patients will be asked to postpone his/her breakfast until&#xD;
      after the test which will take less than half an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSA is defined as patients having a respiratory disturbance index of â‰¥5/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Exhaled Nitric Oxide:&#xD;
&#xD;
      eNO will be measured using a Sievers 280i chemiluminescence analyser (Sievers Instruments,&#xD;
      Boulder, CO, USA) sensitive to NO from 1 ppb to 200 ppm and with a resolution of 1 ppb and&#xD;
      accuracy of 1 ppb designed for online recording. The eNO measurement will be performed&#xD;
      according to ATS standards. Briefly, subjects should remain seated without nose clip during&#xD;
      the procedure, with 2-minute rest between eNO measurements. The eNO will be measured online&#xD;
      at an expiratory flow rate of 50 ml/sec, a dead space of 10 ml and 2-second plateau duration.&#xD;
      Repeated exhalations are performed until three NO plateau values agree at the 10% level or&#xD;
      two agree at the 5% level. The mean NO value will then be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Exhaled Breath Condensate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBC will be collected using the ECoscreen (Jaeger, Germany) according to manufacturer&#xD;
      instructions. After rinsing their mouth, the recruited subjects will breathe tidally through&#xD;
      a mouthpiece that is connected through a unique one-way valve into a cooled collection tube&#xD;
      where vapours, aerosols and moisture in the breath condense along the walls of the tube. The&#xD;
      one-way valve is then used as a plunger that collects droplets stuck to the inside wall and&#xD;
      holds the sample near the top of the tube. The device inherently prevents salivary&#xD;
      contamination as shown by the absence of salivary amylase in EBC. On average, this device&#xD;
      will be able to collect 300 microL per minute of EBC for an adult. Each subject will be asked&#xD;
      to breathe through the collection kit for 5 minutes, which should be sufficiently long to&#xD;
      yield 1 ml of condensate for inflammatory marker analysis. EBC will be stored immediately at&#xD;
      -70oC until analysis for inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of 8 isoprostane, GRO alpha, MCP1, eotaxin and MDC levels in exhaled breath&#xD;
      condensate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBC stored at -70oC will be analysed for 8-isoprostane, GROalpha, MCP1, eotaxin and MDC&#xD;
      levels concentrations in batches. We will use 96-well polystyrene microplates coated with&#xD;
      murine monoclonal antibodies against human 8 isoprostane, GRO alpha, MCP1, eotaxin and MDC&#xD;
      levels. The levels of these markers in EBC will be measured in duplicates by sandwich enzyme&#xD;
      immunoassay (R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to instructions provided by the&#xD;
      manufacturer.&#xD;
