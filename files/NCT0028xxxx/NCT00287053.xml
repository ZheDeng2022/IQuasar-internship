      The purpose of the proposed study is to identify the mechanisms responsible for the weight&#xD;
      gain associated with Depakote treatment, and to identify methods to prevent and treat weight&#xD;
      gain in people taking Depakote. Both sides of the energy balance equation will be measured in&#xD;
      a sample of healthy lean and overweight adults. Energy intake will be measured in the&#xD;
      Pennington Center's Eating Laboratory, and total daily energy expenditure (TEE) and posture&#xD;
      allocation will be measured with the IDEEA™. Questionnaires that assess food cravings and&#xD;
      eating attitudes and behaviors will be used to determine if a behavioral phenotype is&#xD;
      associated with weight gain in response to Depakote treatment. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      Depakote treatment will result in increased food intake. It is also hypothesized that the&#xD;
      time spent engaging in sedentary behavior will increase in response to Depakote treatment.&#xD;
      Time spent engaging in, and the energy expended during, physical activity is expected to&#xD;
      decrease significantly. Therefore, it is hypothesized that TEE is expected to decrease&#xD;
      significantly. The results will be used to identify specific behavioral targets to prevent&#xD;
      weight gain during treatment with Depakote. Potential targets include interventions to modify&#xD;
      food intake and physical activity. The degree to which each behavior (food intake or physical&#xD;
      activity) will be targeted is dependent on the results of this study. For instance, if the&#xD;
      majority of the weight gain associated with Depakote treatment is due to changes in food&#xD;
      intake, stronger dietary interventions will be suggested. Additionally, changes in endocrine&#xD;
      factors (hormones and peptides) will be evaluated during the study to determine if Depakote&#xD;
      is associated with an altered endocrine response that affects satiety, food intake, or energy&#xD;
      expenditure. If an altered endocrine response is found, these results will be used to&#xD;
      identify adjunctive medications or compounds to correct the endocrine response and reduce&#xD;
      weight gain. Genomic studies will also be possible, since gene sequencing and gene expression&#xD;
      can be analyzed from archived buffy coat samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depakote (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) is an anti-convulsant medication used to&#xD;
      treat epilepsy [1] and mania associated with bipolar disorder [2, 3]. Depakote also is used&#xD;
      as a prophylaxis for migraine headache [4]. One side effect of Depakote that negatively&#xD;
      influences its appeal to health care professionals and consumers is weight gain. It is&#xD;
      unknown if changes in energy intake, energy expenditure, or a combination of both are&#xD;
      responsible for this side effect. The purpose of the proposed study is to: 1) test if&#xD;
      Depakote increases body weight by increasing food intake or decreasing energy expenditure,&#xD;
      possibly through changes in posture allocation, and 2) identify methods to prevent and treat&#xD;
      weight gain in people taking Depakote. This randomized placebo-controlled trial will measure&#xD;
      both sides of the energy balance equation (energy intake and expenditure), and posture&#xD;
      allocation (the time spent in active and sedentary behaviors, and the energy cost of these&#xD;
      behaviors). Measurement of both total daily energy expenditure (TEE) and posture allocation&#xD;
      provides a powerful tool to determine if Depakote decreases energy expenditure by increasing&#xD;
      the time spent in sedentary behavior. These data, along with the food intake data, provide a&#xD;
      test of the mechanisms responsible for weight gain associated with Depakote, and these data&#xD;
      can identify methods to prevent or treat this weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Divalproex sodium is a co-ordination compound consisting of sodium valproate and valproic&#xD;
      acid. The exact mechanism of action of Depakote is unknown, but it is believed to increase&#xD;
      brain concentrations of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Similarly, the mechanism by which&#xD;
      Depakote increases body weight is not understood. The balance between energy intake and&#xD;
      expenditure influences body weight; therefore, Depakote likely alters energy intake, energy&#xD;
      expenditure, or both. Alterations in energy intake or expenditure can result from, or be&#xD;
      associated with, changes in biological mechanisms, including hormone and peptide levels. To&#xD;
      our knowledge, only one study has tested the effects of a compound containing valproic acid&#xD;
      on energy intake and expenditure, but this study was small (n = 8), uncontrolled, and used&#xD;
      methods to measure energy intake (food records and recall) that were unlikely to detect&#xD;
      changes in such a small sample [5]. The study proposed herein is the first study to test the&#xD;
      effects of Depakote on eating behavior, measured in the laboratory, and energy expenditure&#xD;
      and posture allocation, measured with the Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and&#xD;
      Activity (IDEEA™; MiniSun LLC, Fresno, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro, leptin secretion and mRNA levels in adipocytes decrease in response to valproic&#xD;
      acid, and it is believed that altered leptin levels might influence weight gain in people&#xD;
      taking compounds containing valproic acid [6]. Other researchers have reported that&#xD;
      postprandial insulin and proinsulin levels increase in people taking valproic acid, and BMI&#xD;
      is positively related to two-hour postprandial levels of insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide&#xD;
      [7]. Luef and colleagues indicate that treatment with valproic acid might increase glucose&#xD;
      stimulated pancreatic section, which could be related to higher body weight due to two&#xD;
      factors that are related to pancreatic beta-cell regulation and insulin secretion. First,&#xD;
      valproic acid is a free-fatty acid (FFA) derivative that competes with FFAs for albumin&#xD;
      binding, and, second, valproic acid is a GABA agonist. Thus, valproic acid treatment might&#xD;
      increase glucose stimulated pancreatic secretion and contribute to weight gain. Evidence from&#xD;
      other laboratories suggests that valproic acid treatment in children increases insulin levels&#xD;
      and decreases glucose levels, which might stimulate appetite [8]. Importantly, Demir and&#xD;
      Aysun note that carnitine levels did not correlate with weight gain, suggesting that valproic&#xD;
      acid induced weight gain is not due to impairments in beta-oxidation of fatty acids.&#xD;
      Carnitine is involved in the transfer of fatty acids into the mitochondria for&#xD;
      beta-oxidation. Due to the potential role of FFA and valproic acid in influencing pancreatic&#xD;
      beta-cell regulation and insulin secretion, FFA will be measured in the present study at&#xD;
      baseline (day 0) and day 21, ½ hour before and one hour after the food intake tests at lunch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the likelihood that hormones and peptides influence the weight gain associated with&#xD;
      Depakote, blood samples will be archived for later analysis, pending availability of funds.&#xD;
      Specifically, a portion of the archives will be used to measure gastric inhibitory&#xD;
      polypeptide (GIP) and oxyntomodulin. Oxyntomodulin and GIP will not be assayed immediately&#xD;
      because commercially available assay kits are not yet available. Oxyntomodulin has been&#xD;
      implicated in the control of food intake and satiety in both humans and animals [9], and GIP&#xD;
      modulates insulin secretion and might provide new treatments for diabetes [10]. Additionally,&#xD;
      levels of PYY3-36, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), leptin, and ghrelin will be measured.&#xD;
      PYY3-36 and GLP-1 are distal gut hormones that have been found to reduce food intake [9, 11].&#xD;
      PYY3-36 decreases food intake by 30% when infused into humans [11], and obese humans and&#xD;
      rodents have attenuated fasting and post-prandial PYY3-36 levels that are likely associated&#xD;
      with their obesity [12]. GLP-1 also decreases food intake in rodents and man, and it works&#xD;
      synergistically with PYY3-36 [13]. Leptin reduces food intake [14] and increases energy&#xD;
      expenditure in humans [15], while ghrelin increases food intake and is likely an important&#xD;
      regulator of food intake [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aforementioned hormones will be sampled ½ hour before and one hour after the start of the&#xD;
      food intake tests at lunch on days 0 and 21. The timing of these samples is based on the&#xD;
      finding that PYY3-36 and GLP-1 peak one hour after a meal [17, 18]. Therefore, we will&#xD;
      compare levels prior to meals and the change after the meals between the Depakote and placebo&#xD;
      groups. Different pre-meal levels of these hormones and peptides can be correlated with food&#xD;
      intake between the groups, and differential change in these hormones in response to the meal&#xD;
      will be evaluated between the groups and correlated with food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two factors that likely affect the amount of weight gain with Depakote treatment are gene&#xD;
      sequencing and gene expression. Although these analyses can be costly, DNA material,&#xD;
      including RNA, can be archived from whole blood samples and stored for later analysis. This&#xD;
      method allows cost to be controlled since analyses can be conducted on a sub-sample of the&#xD;
      participants who displayed specific reactions to treatment during the study. For example,&#xD;
      genomic studies can be conducted on participants who fall within the lower and upper&#xD;
      quartiles of weight gain, or a sub-sample of participants from the placebo and treatment&#xD;
      groups. This provides empirical tests of a priori stated hypothesis without the need to&#xD;
      endure the costs of running genomic analyses on the entire sample of participants. In the&#xD;
      present study, both gene sequencing and gene expression studies will be made possible by&#xD;
      archiving blood samples, as outlined in the Methods section. These analyses will depend on&#xD;
      the availability of funds and the development of specific testable hypotheses (e.g., weight&#xD;
      gain in the Depakote group will be associated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated&#xD;
      receptor-gamma gene).&#xD;
