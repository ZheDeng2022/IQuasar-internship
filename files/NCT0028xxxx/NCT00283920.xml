      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      to measure peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in the brain. PBRs were initially found&#xD;
      in peripheral organs such as kidneys, endocrine glands and lungs, but later studies&#xD;
      identified PBRs in the CNS. PBRs can be a marker to detect nervous system inflammation.&#xD;
      Development of a test to image PBRs may improve the management of brain disorders such as&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and others in which&#xD;
      inflammation is involved in progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers from 18 to 40 years old may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with tests that may include some or all of the following: diagnostic interview;&#xD;
      ratings of mood, anxiety, functioning, and other parameters; neuropsychological testing;&#xD;
      physical examination; electrocardiogram; blood and urine tests; and personal, social and&#xD;
      family histories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation: Subjects provide a medical history, including detailed questions about their&#xD;
           psychological health, and have a physical examination and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET scanning: PET uses small amounts of a radioactive chemical called a tracer that&#xD;
           &quot;labels&quot; active areas of the brain. The tracer used in this study is [11C]PBR28. For the&#xD;
           procedure, the subject lies on the scanner bed. A special mask is fitted to the head and&#xD;
           attached to the bed to help keep the head still during the scan so the images will be&#xD;
           clear. A brief scan is done just before the radioactive tracer is injected to provide&#xD;
           measures of the brain that will help to precisely calculate information from subsequent&#xD;
           scans. After the tracer is injected through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in the arm,&#xD;
           pictures are taken for 2 to 3 hours, during which the subject lies still on the scanner&#xD;
           bed. Subjects return to the clinic the following day for more blood and urine sample&#xD;
           collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI: The MRI scan is done within 1 year of the PET scan (either before or after the&#xD;
           PET). MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce images of the brain. The&#xD;
           patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing&#xD;
           earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning&#xD;
           process. He or she can communicate with the staff at all times during the procedure.&#xD;

      The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is distinct from central benzodiazepine&#xD;
      receptors associated with GABA(A) receptors. Although PBR was initially identified in&#xD;
      peripheral organs such as kidneys, endocrine glands and lungs, later studies identified PBR&#xD;
      in the central nervous system. In normal conditions, PBR is expressed in low levels in some&#xD;
      neurons and glial cells. PBR can be a clinically useful marker to detect neuroinflammation&#xD;
      because activated microglial cells in inflammatory areas express much greater levels of PBR&#xD;
      than in microglial cells in resting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBR has been imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) using&#xD;
      [(11)C]1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195). However, this&#xD;
      classical ligand provides only low levels of specific signals and is not sensitive to detect&#xD;
      changes occurred in vivo. Recently we developed a new ligand,&#xD;
      N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine [(11)C]PBR28, which showed much greater&#xD;
      specific signals than [(11)C]PK11195 in non-human primates. In the present protocol, we plan&#xD;
      to perform a kinetic brain imaging study in healthy human subjects to measure PBR in brain&#xD;
      regions with [(11)C]PBR28. Successful development of a PET ligand to image PBR will have a&#xD;
      strong impact on clinical management of brain disorders with inflammation such as multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis and ischemia and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease where inflammation is involved in the disease progression.&#xD;
