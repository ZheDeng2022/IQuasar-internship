  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that people with cancer are using antioxidant vitamins at high rates. It is not&#xD;
      known if these vitamins are safe to use during cancer treatment. It is not known if common&#xD;
      vitamins and minerals used by many cancer patients will interfere with cancer treatments by&#xD;
      reducing the effectiveness of the cancer therapy. Preliminary studies that look at the&#xD;
      addition of antioxidants during cancer therapy show us that antioxidants could play a&#xD;
      significant role in the management of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antioxidants are vitamins and other nutrients that help to decrease inflammation in the body&#xD;
      by stopping free radicals or oxidants. Common antioxidants include vitamins E, C, and A,&#xD;
      beta-carotene, and glutathione. Some doctors who treat cancer are now using antioxidants with&#xD;
      chemotherapy while others believe they should not be used with cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to try and understand if it is safe efficacious to add&#xD;
      antioxidant nutritional supplements to traditional chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy&#xD;
      during the treatment of cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that cancer patients use antioxidants at greater rates than their healthy peers&#xD;
      and these patients generally do not tell their physicians. This use has not been adequately&#xD;
      evaluated. This pilot trial is a Phase II study designed to assess safety of high-dose&#xD;
      antioxidants in gynecologic malignancies. Secondarily, we will evaluate efficacy of&#xD;
      antioxidant use. These goals will be accomplished by monitoring adverse events by clinical&#xD;
      evaluation, metabolic functions such as but not limited to tumor markers, blood counts,&#xD;
      hepatic, and renal enzymes, and tumor response rates secondarily. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Oversight partnership is established with the&#xD;
      FDA-CDER, Kansas Masonic Cancer Research Institute, and the University of Kansas Medical&#xD;
      Center - IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an open label prospective investigational study in 50 gynecologic cancer&#xD;
      patients with a Primary Hypothesis: To assess safety of adding high-dose antioxidants to&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies (uterine, cervical, or epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian). Qualitative and quantitative toxicities will be assessed by monitoring clinical&#xD;
      status by National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria version 3.0, quality of life&#xD;
      measures (FACT-G), and evaluating metabolic functions including but not limited to hepatic&#xD;
      and renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: To assess efficacy by tumor response rates in patients with gynecologic&#xD;
      malignancies treated with antioxidants to include intravenous and oral ascorbic acid,&#xD;
      intravenous glutathione, oral mixed carotenoids, mixed tocopherols, and vitamin A. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be time to progression and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent gynecologic cancer will be invited to participate&#xD;
      and these subjects will be limited to those who present with cervical, uterine, or ovarian of&#xD;
      epithelial origin. Fifty patients will be enrolled. The study subjects will be treated with&#xD;
      antioxidants added to their usual oncologic care for 12 months. This population was chosen&#xD;
      because of anecdotal and case report evidence for benefit when high-dose antioxidants are&#xD;
      added to their care.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically diagnosed adenocarcinoma and/or&#xD;
             sarcoma or squamous cell carcinoma of gynecologic origin (uterine, ovary, cervical)&#xD;
             that is newly diagnosed or relapsed. Tumors of the ovary are restricted to epithelial&#xD;
             origin. There must be evidence for advanced stage neoplasms and/or patients in need of&#xD;
             chemotherapy for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must screened for eligibility and have care approved by treating&#xD;
             oncologist; the oncology care is to be dictated by the oncology team.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be of ambulatory status without evidence of active brain metastasis or&#xD;
             spinal cord compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-2. (Grade 0 = Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease&#xD;
             activities without restriction Grade 1= Restricted in physical strenuous activity but&#xD;
             ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature e.g. light&#xD;
             housework, office work Grade 2 = Ambulatory and capable of all self care but unable to&#xD;
             carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory: ANC =1,500/mm3, Hemoglobin &gt; 8g/dL, platelet = 1000,000/mm3, total&#xD;
             bilirubin = 1.5 mg/dL, creatinine =2.0 mg/dL, transaminase (AST/ALT) =2.5X upper&#xD;
             limit, urine uric acid &lt; 1,000mg/d, urine pH &lt;6, urine oxalate &lt;60 mg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to take oral nutrients and answer FACT-G QOL questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have no language barrier, are cooperative, and can give informed consent&#xD;
             before entering the study after being informed of the medications and procedures to be&#xD;
             used in this study may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  G-6PD deficient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ovarian tumors: sarcomas, germ cell, or any atypical cell line other than epithelial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of oxalate renal calculi; urine oxalate level &gt; 60 mg/d at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bleeding disorder or hemochromatosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients enrolled in other trials currently or in the preceding 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of a significant psychiatric disorder by history/examination&#xD;
             that would prevent completion of the study will not be allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status of 3-4. (Grade 3 = Capable of only limited self care, confined&#xD;
             to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours. Grade 4 = Completely disabled. Cannot&#xD;
             carry on any self care. Totally confined to bed or chair.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-morbid condition that would affect survival: end stage congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 6 weeks of study, uncontrolled blood&#xD;
             sugars = 300 mg/dL, patients with known chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who consume an excess of alcohol or abuse drugs (an excess of alcohol is&#xD;
             defined as more than four of any one of the following per day: 30mL distilled spirits,&#xD;
             340mL beer, or 120mL wine) will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who smoke tobacco products will not be allowed to participate. Of note,&#xD;
             patients who continue or begin to smoke are not allowed to continue with the protocol&#xD;
             because we are unable to achieve elevation of the plasma vitamin C level to the&#xD;
             desired 400 mg/dL. (Unless 400 mg/dL plasma level is achieved, there is no (presumed)&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic action of the high-dose intravenous ascorbate). The inability to&#xD;
             achieve the desired plasma level of ascorbate is presumably related to increased&#xD;
             oxidative stress from the smoking itself. Patients will be clearly made aware of the&#xD;
             possibility of coming off of protocol if they smoke. We will monitor cotinine levels&#xD;
             (nicotine metabolite) in suspected smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unwilling to take the oral antioxidants will not be allowed to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
