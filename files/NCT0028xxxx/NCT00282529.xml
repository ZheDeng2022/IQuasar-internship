      The proposed research is designed to establish lymphedema incidence rates for a varied&#xD;
      population of breast cancer patients. Patients with breast preservation, mastectomy, sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node biopsy, axillary dissection and radiation therapy will be included with the goal&#xD;
      of determining the impact that each of these treatments has on development of lymphedema.&#xD;
      Establishing incidence in these populations is crucial to the remainder of the study. We&#xD;
      conduct a two phase study. The first phase will use arm measurements, a symptom survey (The&#xD;
      Lymphedema and Breast Questionnaire), a functional survey (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder,&#xD;
      and Hand Questionnaire), and operative and pathology information to create a simple screening&#xD;
      tool to predict the development of lymphedema. Currently, lymphedema is only diagnosed after&#xD;
      arm swelling develops. The goal of the screening tool is to identify those patients at&#xD;
      significantly increased risk for development of lymphedema as compared to the general&#xD;
      population of breast cancer survivors. Phase 2 of the study will test a lymphedema prevention&#xD;
      strategy in a high risk population. The goal of this phase is to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      lymphedema in those patients that have undergone an axillary node dissection with radiation&#xD;
      therapy by using a combination of education, a compression sleeve and decongestive exercises.&#xD;
      If prevention is successful, the development of a screening tool becomes even more important&#xD;
      to identify those patients that should undergo a prevention regimen.&#xD;

      Background: Lymphedema has varied definitions, all based on limb volume changes. None&#xD;
      incorporates limb volume changes, symptoms, and functional deficits. We will determine the&#xD;
      incidence of lymphedema in breast cancer patients and the impact of breast conserving&#xD;
      therapy, radiation therapy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and axillary node dissection. The&#xD;
      impact of lymphedema can be evaluated in a number of ways; 1) The Lymphedema and Breast&#xD;
      Cancer Questionnaire (LBCQ) identifies symptoms that are unique to patients with lymphedema&#xD;
      and 2) The Disability of the Arm, Hand, and Shoulder (DASH) survey will be used to determine&#xD;
      the functional impact of lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Hypothesis: Our hypotheses are: 1) Local therapies for breast cancer result in&#xD;
      different lymphedema rates depending on the combination of therapies used. 2) A simple&#xD;
      screening tool that incorporates symptoms, limb volume measurements, and tumor staging and&#xD;
      treatment modalities can predict those patients that will develop lymphedema. 3) Functional&#xD;
      impairment of the arm is severe in patients with lymphedema. 4) Prevention of lymphedema in a&#xD;
      high risk population is possible with education, a compression sleeve, and decongestive&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: 1) Evaluate patients both pre-operatively and at specific time intervals&#xD;
      post-operatively to establish the incidence of lymphedema in sentinel lymph node biopsy and&#xD;
      axillary dissection groups. 2) Create a simple screening tool using arm measurements,&#xD;
      symptoms identified by the LBCQ, and treatment and staging information to identify patients&#xD;
      that should go on to further testing and treatment. 3) Utilize the DASH survey to measure the&#xD;
      extent of disability from lymphedema and surgical treatment. 4) Conduct a randomized trial of&#xD;
      lymphedema prevention in a high-risk breast cancer population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This proposal will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will accomplish Specific&#xD;
      Aim 1, 2, and 3. Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer awaiting definitive surgery,&#xD;
      will be enrolled pre-operatively and undergo arm measurements and complete the LBCQ and the&#xD;
      DASH surveys. These same study procedures will be completed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months&#xD;
      postoperative. Documentation collected during the study will include: demographic&#xD;
      information; co-morbid conditions; operative and pathology reports; and use of adjuvant&#xD;
      therapies such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiation therapy. Incidence rates of&#xD;
      lymphedema and the impact of extent of surgery and radiation therapy will be determined. We&#xD;
      will also use this information to develop a simple screening tool to identify patients that&#xD;
      will develop lymphedema prior to the development of significant limb volume changes. Specific&#xD;
      Aim 4 is Phase 2 of the proposal. A high risk population (those that have an axillary node&#xD;
      dissection and radiation therapy) will be randomized to standard education versus standard&#xD;
      education, compression sleeve, and exercise. The effectiveness of prevention to reduce&#xD;
      incidence and severity of lymphedema and the impact on symptoms and functional impairment&#xD;
      will be determined. This work will move toward a new paradigm of lymphedema management with a&#xD;
      simple screening tool to identify high risk patients before significant swelling occurs and&#xD;
      investigate prevention strategies to decrease the incidence of lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer Relevance: Lymphedema is a feared complication of breast cancer treatment. Currently&#xD;
      it is recognized and treated only after development of significant limb volume changes when&#xD;
      it is symptomatic and difficult to treat. Documentation of the impact of local therapies on&#xD;
      the development of lymphedema will allow clinicians to make more informed decisions regarding&#xD;
      risk benefit ratios of each of our local therapies. Development of a screening tool will&#xD;
      allow us to identify high risk populations. Ideally, the high risk population will be&#xD;
      identified and an effective prevention strategy implemented. Phase one of this study will&#xD;
      help to answer the questions regarding incidence and create a screening tool and phase two&#xD;
      will allow the evaluation of a prevention strategy.&#xD;
