  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan is an effective&#xD;
      and safe treatment of thermal burns and non-injured skin where skin grafts are harvested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan will through its immunomodulating activities improve&#xD;
      wound healing of thermal burns and non-injured skin where skin grafts are harvested.&#xD;

      In severe cases, burn patients commonly exhibit a clinical picture of systemic inflammation&#xD;
      with a variety of manifestations ranging from the presence of tachycardia, tachypnea, fever&#xD;
      and leukocytosis, and may progress to refractory hypotension. Shock and multiple organ system&#xD;
      dysfunction may subsequently occur. Sepsis, caused by infection or bacteremia, is also a&#xD;
      common occurrence and a major complication in burn patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After cooling the burned area, pain control is important. Local burn wound care starts with&#xD;
      cleansing the wound followed by application of topical agents to prevent infection. Such&#xD;
      agents may have adverse local or systemic effects and may impede on the wound healing process&#xD;
      itself. The use of synthetic or biologic materials for wound covering is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly popular, but most of the clinical information about efficacy of such products&#xD;
      are anecdotal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A primary objective in burn care is to have all wounds healed within 1 month. With longer&#xD;
      healing periods, there is an increasing likelihood of developing hypertropic scaring and&#xD;
      alterations in pigmentation. The development of an effective wound healing agent would&#xD;
      therefore be highly beneficial for the suffering patient in terms of decreased healing time&#xD;
      and improved cosmetic results.&#xD;
