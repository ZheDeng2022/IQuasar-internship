      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a serious chronic condition affecting over 14 million Americans, but the prevalence&#xD;
      rates are higher in certain populations (e.g. 10 percent in inner-cities and 30 percent among&#xD;
      the homeless vs. 5 percent in a general population of whites). African Americans and&#xD;
      Hispanics from the Northeast are twice as likely to die from asthma as whites. African&#xD;
      Americans are four times as likely to be hospitalized for asthma and are five times more&#xD;
      likely than whites to seek care for asthma at an emergency department. Reasons for these&#xD;
      higher rates are not certain, and most likely result from an interaction of risk factors such&#xD;
      as environmental exposures, genetic predisposition, access to appropriate medical care,&#xD;
      socioeconomic status, and cultural health practices. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
      Institute supports a variety of activities to address the pressing public health problems&#xD;
      posed by asthma. However, progress in reducing disparities has been disappointingly slow.&#xD;
      Separate, independent research projects have generated important clues for understanding the&#xD;
      nature and scope of the problem. A more coordinated, interdisciplinary and comprehensive&#xD;
      approach to research is needed to take advantage of these clues, move the science further and&#xD;
      faster, and increase our capacity to improve health outcomes among minority and economically&#xD;
      disadvantaged populations. Cooperative centers of research that foster partnerships among&#xD;
      minority medical centers, research intensive institutions, and the communities in which&#xD;
      asthma patients live will promote such advancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Request for Applications for the Centers for Reducing Asthma Disparities was released in&#xD;
      October, 2001. The objective of the program is to promote partnerships (called Centers)&#xD;
      between a minority serving institution (MSI) that may not have a strong research program and&#xD;
      a research intensive institution (RII) that has a track record of NIH-supported research and&#xD;
      patient care. The purpose of the partnership is to conduct collaborative research on asthma&#xD;
      disparities (i.e. greater prevalence of asthma, higher rates of morbidity due to asthma, and&#xD;
      lesser access or use of quality medical care among minorities and poor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities involves partnership between researchers at&#xD;
      Harvard University (Channing Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and the Harvard School&#xD;
      of Public Health) and a network of Boston-area Community Health Centers (CHCs) affiliated&#xD;
      with the non-profit community-based organization CCHERS (Center for Community Health&#xD;
      Education, Research and Service). Broad specific aims are: 1. Conduct a community needs&#xD;
      assessment to assess differences in perceptions about asthma etiology, disparities, and&#xD;
      effective treatment between community representatives, Community Health Center patients, and&#xD;
      Community Health Center providers. 2. Determine the role of socio/environmental exposures&#xD;
      (psychosocial stress, indoor allergens, cigarette smoking and diesel-related air pollutants)&#xD;
      on asthma onset through study of a prenatally enrolled birth cohort. 3. Determine the role of&#xD;
      genetics in modifying the risk of the social/physical environment by concurrent assessment of&#xD;
      the following genetic factors thought to influence immune development and airway inflammation&#xD;
      in early life: stress (corticosteroid regulatory genes, adrenergic system regulatory genes),&#xD;
      diesel exhaust and smoking (biotransformation genes), indoor allergens (cytokine pathway&#xD;
      genes). 4. Use a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of the research,&#xD;
      training, and outreach components of the project in leading to significant changes in the&#xD;
      ability of particular stakeholders to design and implement sound asthma intervention&#xD;
      strategies. 5. Develop training programs at Harvard that provide masters and predoctoral&#xD;
      students as well as postdoctoral fellows with experience and expertise in Community-Based&#xD;
      Participatory Research (CBPR) focused on reducing asthma disparities. 6. Develop training and&#xD;
      information dissemination materials for health center staff and community members (especially&#xD;
      caregivers of children with asthma). The Center for Community Health Education, Research and&#xD;
      Service will take the lead in implementing Specific Aims 1, 4 and 6, while the Harvard group&#xD;
      will take the lead on Aims 2, 3 and 5. In addition to building needed infrastructure to&#xD;
      support partnership-based research and interventions aimed at reducing health disparities,&#xD;
      this proposal has the potential to make significant contributions to the scientific&#xD;
      literature with respect to health disparities and asthma.&#xD;
