  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the protective effect and safety of soluble&#xD;
      beta-1,3/1,6-glucan compared to placebo in oral mucositis in head and neck patients receiving&#xD;
      radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan will through its immunomodulating activities prevent&#xD;
      oral mucositis&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis is defined as inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes of the&#xD;
      mouth. The condition is very painful and might put the patient at risk of serious systemic&#xD;
      infections and is a common dose-limiting toxicity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      present treatment of mucositis is primarily supportive; strong analgesics in addition to oral&#xD;
      hygiene. Prophylactic antibiotics have been used and many topical agents are available to&#xD;
      palliate mucositis, but no standard therapy has been accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: Methyl cellulose has been chosen as placebo due to its close resemblance to&#xD;
      soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan in terms of general appearance and viscosity. Methyl cellulose is&#xD;
      a viscous solution which might form a mucosal barrier. Physical barriers are considered&#xD;
      having a protective function in oral mucositis, and methyl cellulose might be considered as&#xD;
      an active control.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of radiosensitizers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or clinical evidence of active significant acute or chronic diseases that may&#xD;
             compromise the ability to evaluate or interpret the effects of the study treatment on&#xD;
             mucositis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of distant metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;

             study procedures, or is unlikely to complete the study due to different reasons like&#xD;
             e.g. language barriers or mental incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical trial in the last 30 days Receipt of any investigational&#xD;
