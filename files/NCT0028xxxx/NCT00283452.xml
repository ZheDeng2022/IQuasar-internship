  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new phone and mail based coaching/support&#xD;
      program that has been developed is more effective in helping people stay physically active&#xD;
      than existing programs that are currently available to all HealthPartners members. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the intervention program will lead to a greater likelihood of physical&#xD;
      activity maintenance among moderately active older adults than a usual care condition.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of physical activity for adults are well established, but less than one-third of&#xD;
      older adults in the U.S. have achieved recommended levels of physical activity despite&#xD;
      widespread clinical recommendations to increase physical activity in recent years.&#xD;
      Clinic-based approaches to increasing physical activity are expensive, difficult to implement&#xD;
      in busy practice settings, and have limited reach. Moreover, evidence of the efficacy of such&#xD;
      approaches is equivocal. A population based approach may be a more effective and less costly&#xD;
      strategy to increase levels of physical activity in older adults. Population studies of&#xD;
      physical activity have demonstrated that each year, many sedentary older adults initiate&#xD;
      physical activity, but a nearly equal number of those who were active become sedentary. Among&#xD;
      older adults initiating physical activity, only half continue to be active 3 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a population based approach that emphasizes physical activity maintenance&#xD;
      can substantially increase physical activity levels in a defined populations of older adults.&#xD;
      This hypothesis is tested in a 24-month randomized trial evaluating an innovative,&#xD;
      theory-based behavioral intervention to maintain physical activity in a random sample of&#xD;
      50-70 year old adults who have recently become at least moderately active. One thousand&#xD;
      (1000) subjects will be randomized to one of two experimental groups: 1) a &quot;usual care&quot;&#xD;
      control group, and 2) an interactive phone- and mail-based intervention program tailored to&#xD;
      maintaining physical activity in older adults. The primary outcome measures are: 1) physical&#xD;
      activity, assessed as kcals/wk expenditure; and 2) physical activity maintenance, assessed as&#xD;
      follow-up kcals/wk expenditure relative to baseline. Careful measurement of the penetration&#xD;
      of the intervention into a well characterized older adult population, and the costs of the&#xD;
      intervention, will be assessed. Psychosocial and behavioral mediators of physical activity&#xD;
      maintenance will also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study results will be relevant to policy makers, health promotion practitioners and health&#xD;
      plans, and will provide practical information on the effectiveness, population penetration,&#xD;
      and costs of an intervention designed to maximize population levels of physical activity&#xD;
      among older adults.&#xD;
