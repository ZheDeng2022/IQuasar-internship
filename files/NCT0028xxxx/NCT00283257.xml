  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site randomized control trial taking place at six cancer centers. UC Davis is&#xD;
      the lead site. Additional performance sites include the City of Hope Medical Center, Fred&#xD;
      Hutchinson Cancer Center at the Univ. of Washington, USC Norris Cancer Center, UCSD Cancer&#xD;
      Center, and Johns Hopkins Cancer Center. Clinical trial patients and their caregivers who are&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention arm of the study are scheduled for three educational sessions.&#xD;
      The sessions focus on teaching problem solving skills based on the COPE problem solving&#xD;
      model.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project introduces and evaluates the effects of a Simultaneous Care Education&#xD;
      Intervention, using the COPE model (Creativity, Optimism, Planning and Expert Information)&#xD;
      developed by D'Zurilla and Nezu, as one of its key components for cancer patients in Phase I,&#xD;
      II and III clinical trials. The SCEI team will use the COPE problem solving educational model&#xD;
      to instruct patients on how to problem solve and manage challenges associated not only with&#xD;
      the investigational therapy, but also the psychosocial issues that arise from cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis, disease progression, treatment, and disease or treatment related symptoms. The&#xD;
      educational intervention also sets up a system for regularly contacting the patient and&#xD;
      caregiver in order to reinforce what is taught. Patients and caregivers randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm will receive three education sessions. Patients and designated caregiver&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the set of measurement tools approximately every 30 days while&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
