    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess short and long term outcomes after radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation (RFA) of pulmonary malignancies in patients who are not candidates for surgical&#xD;
      resection. This study will evaluate the efficacy of RFA for the treatment of lung tumors by&#xD;
      assessing its impact on local tumor control, progression free survival, overall survival,&#xD;
      dyspnea score and quality of life (QOL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of RF ablation in pulmonary tissue is not new. However previous reports have&#xD;
      primarily been descriptions of technique and early procedural outcomes. Follow-up studies&#xD;
      have been lacking. This study will provide information on outcomes such as rates of clinical&#xD;
      response, overall survival, progression-free survival, dyspnea and QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The determination of the efficacy of this technique with this study could make an important&#xD;
      contribution to the management of patients with pulmonary malignancies with high operative&#xD;
      risk for resection. A minimally invasive alternative for tumor destruction could potentially&#xD;
      improve quality of life by controlling local tumor progression and could provide longer&#xD;
      survival when compared to current non-surgical options. This pilot study will determine the&#xD;
      potential utility and effectiveness of RFA treatment of lung tumors, and whether to further&#xD;
      evaluate this therapy in prospective randomized clinical trials compared to other&#xD;
      conventional modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cancer is currently the most common cause of cancer-related death in the USA and&#xD;
      represents the second most common malignancy in both men and women with 171,400 new cases in&#xD;
      the year 1999. Unfortunately, the majority of patients present with advanced disease. Despite&#xD;
      advances in the management of this disease, the best 5-year survival for stage I remains&#xD;
      around 70% for patients who have undergone surgical resection. Complete resection provides&#xD;
      the best chance for cure and remains the gold standard of therapy for patients with&#xD;
      acceptable surgical risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of surgical resection of pulmonary metastasis in selected patients is widely&#xD;
      accepted, and a survival advantage of aggressive surgical therapy has been demonstrated.&#xD;
      Surgical series have demonstrated 5-year survival of 25-42% in the surgical treatment of&#xD;
      pulmonary metastasis from different primaries including colorectal cancer osteogenic sarcoma,&#xD;
      melanoma, and others. In a prospective study of 5,206 cases of lung metastasectomy, the&#xD;
      International Registry of Lung Metastases reported an actuarial survival of 36% at 5 years&#xD;
      and 26% at 10 years. These results compared favorably with those who had an incomplete&#xD;
      resection achieving a survival of 13% at 5 years and 7% at 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard resections for primary lung cancer include lobectomy or pneumonectomy depending&#xD;
      on the size and location of the tumor. Limited resections, including segmentectomy or wedge&#xD;
      resection of the lung, are the standard treatment for limited metastases and are good&#xD;
      alternatives for patients with primary lung cancer and poor lung function who cannot tolerate&#xD;
      a larger resection. However, a prospective randomized trial to address the role of limited&#xD;
      resection for primary lung cancer was performed by the Lung Cancer Study Group in 276&#xD;
      patients with T1N0 NSCLC. Patients in the limited resection group suffered a 50-75% increase&#xD;
      in local recurrence rate, but no survival difference was seen between the two groups. Limited&#xD;
      resection however should continue to be viewed as a good option for metastasectomy but a&#xD;
      compromising operation for primary lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment options for patients with pulmonary malignancies who have severe comorbidities&#xD;
      or poor pulmonary function are limited. These patients are many times not considered for&#xD;
      surgical resection because of the excessive risk of undergoing an invasive operation and are&#xD;
      often treated with external beam radiation and/or chemotherapy. In the case of pulmonary&#xD;
      metastases occurring after previous pulmonary resection, further resection is sometimes not&#xD;
      feasible due to limited residual pulmonary parenchyma or dense adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the widespread application of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the destruction of&#xD;
      unresectable liver tumors, this technique has been considered as an alternative therapy for&#xD;
      the ablation of other solid tumors. The initial experience in the treatment of lung tumors&#xD;
      with RFA indicates that the technique appears to be safe and feasible for ablation of&#xD;
      peripheral lung nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved RFA for coagulation necrosis of soft tissue&#xD;
      tumors. In addition, RFA has been widely used for treatment of pulmonary nodules in France,&#xD;
      Germany, Japan, Korea, and the People's Republic of China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency ablation systems are comprised of three components: a radiofrequency&#xD;
      generator, an active electrode, and dispersive electrodes. The RF energy is introduced into&#xD;
      the tissue via the active electrode. As the RF energy (alternating current) moves from the&#xD;
      active electrode to the dispersive electrode (i.e., the electrosurgical return pad) and then&#xD;
      back to the active electrode, the ions within the tissue oscillate in an attempt to follow&#xD;
      the change in the direction of the alternating current. This movement results in frictional&#xD;
      heating of the tissue, and as the temperature within the tissue becomes elevated beyond 60Â°C,&#xD;
      cells begin to die. It is this phenomenon that causes the region of necrosis surrounding the&#xD;
      electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of such a thermal intervention system is the capacity to heat tissue to a&#xD;
      lethal temperature in a specific anatomic location. The advantages of such a procedure in the&#xD;
      treatment of non-resectable hepatic and renal lesions are reduced surgical trauma, shorter&#xD;
      procedure time, shorter hospitalization, and a faster recovery time. In the treatment of lung&#xD;
      nodules, this allows for destruction of lung tumors with minimal damage to surrounding normal&#xD;
      lung tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coagulation necrosis of soft tissue due to RF ablation has been reported in liver, kidney,&#xD;
      breast, and lung tissues. Radiofrequency ablation of primary and metastatic hepatic lesions&#xD;
      has been reported to result in necrosis encompassing 70% to 98% of tumors treated. To date,&#xD;
      little has been reported on the use of RF ablation to address pulmonary nodules. In a&#xD;
      presentation of three case studies, follow-up CT imaging noted that cells within the region&#xD;
      of the thermal lesions were fibrotic and in only one of the three patients was residual&#xD;
      disease detected. Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the lung, a series of&#xD;
      ten patients noted that within the boundaries of the thermal lesions there was no evidence of&#xD;
      metabolic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-clinical study was undertaken in a porcine model in order to determine the capacity of&#xD;
      RF energy to induce necrosis of lung tissue. Using differing power settings and length of&#xD;
      application times, it was determined that the thermal lesions produced in the porcine lung&#xD;
      tissue were complete and entire, with no procedure-related complications. Animals survived to&#xD;
      3, 7 and 28 days post-RF ablation were active and showed no evidence of detrimental effects&#xD;
      of the RF-induced necrosis on respiratory capacity or function. The regions of necrosis were&#xD;
      affected by conductive heat loss via air and blood flow and the presence of bronchi, which&#xD;
      resulted in invagination of the thermal lesion boundary; however, all cells within the&#xD;
      boundaries were nonviable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the effectiveness of the RF ablation usually involves follow-up computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans. CT imaging provides an assessment of tissue changes following an&#xD;
      ablation, which can manifest as central cavitation of the lesion with decreased tissue&#xD;
      density measured by a decrease in Hounsfield units (Hu). As complementary modality, positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) can be used to determine tissue viability within the lesion, which&#xD;
      can be useful in the follow-up of these patients. In particular, patients with questionable&#xD;
      response to RFA as determined by CT scan can benefit from PET scanning, by determining the&#xD;
      presence of residual disease. The patient is injected with a radio-labeled sugar (typically&#xD;
      18 Fluoro-deoxyglucose or FDG) prior to the PET scan and viability is determined based upon&#xD;
      the uptake of the FDG by cells, since FDG is taken up by cells with high metabolic activity,&#xD;
      such as tumors, infection, or inflammation. In a small pilot study, monitoring with PET noted&#xD;
      no viable tissue within the boundaries of the thermal lesions induced in pulmonary nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators' initial experience at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, they&#xD;
      treated 18 patients with RFA and included primary and metastatic lung tumors. Selected&#xD;
      patients were not candidates for complete surgical resection based on surgical risk, multiple&#xD;
      lesions, poor pulmonary reserve or refusal of further surgery. Twenty-eight lung nodules were&#xD;
      treated with RFA in 18 patients (12 male, 6 female). Tumors included metastatic carcinoma&#xD;
      (9), sarcoma (6) or lung cancer (3). Mean age was 52 years (range, 27-95). Thoracic surgeons&#xD;
      performed RFA by mini-thoracotomy (5) or CT-guided percutaneously (13) under general&#xD;
      anesthesia in the operating room. In both approaches, the patient was positioned in the&#xD;
      lateral decubitus position. In the CT-guided procedures we employ the services of a CT&#xD;
      technician and the thoracic surgeon places a small finder needle into the center of the lung&#xD;
      nodule. The surgeon confirms successful central placement of the finder needle during CT&#xD;
      imaging, and the LeVeenâ¢ needle electrode size is chosen according to the diameter of the&#xD;
      target lesion. The needle electrode has a diameter of 14 gauge with a 15 cm shaft length and&#xD;
      is introduced in the center of the lesion under CT guidance. Several applications in&#xD;
      different locations within the lesion may be required for larger masses, with the therapy&#xD;
      beginning at the most distal area and progressing proximally. Chest tubes were required in&#xD;
      46% (n=13) of percutaneous procedures. Mean length of stay was 3 days (range, 1-7 days).&#xD;
      Complications included recurrent pneumothorax (1/18), pneumonitis (6/18), small pleural&#xD;
      effusion (7/18) and transient renal failure (1/18). One death occurred from hemoptysis 19&#xD;
      days post-RFA of a central nodule. This patient had also received recent brachytherapy. After&#xD;
      a mean follow-up of 4 months (range, 1-11 months), computed tomography revealed resolution&#xD;
      with decreased density of treated sites less than 4 cm. Six patients (33%) died of&#xD;
      progressive metastatic disease during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though RFA has been used to treat lung tumors in over 300 patients worldwide, there is&#xD;
      still a need to further define the role of RFA for pulmonary malignancies. In particular the&#xD;
      effects of RFA on dyspnea and quality of life as well as follow-up studies are lacking.&#xD;
