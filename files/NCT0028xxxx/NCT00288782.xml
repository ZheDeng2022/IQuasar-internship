  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies show that 25 - 30% of depressed patients never fully recover, resulting in a&#xD;
      treatment-resistant condition. Thus, depression is a major cause of human suffering. We are&#xD;
      interested in finding new ways of identifying and alleviating treatment-resistant depression,&#xD;
      and we believe that recent advances in brain imaging can contribute to achieving that goal.&#xD;
      In this project, we will use a novel compound ([N-methyl-11C]mirtazapine) that we invented&#xD;
      for examining the neurochemistry of brain receptors involved in antidepressant actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our compound, [N-methyl-11C]mirtazapine, is closely related to the clinically effective&#xD;
      antidepressant drug mirtazapine (RemeronÂ®). It labels several types of noradrenergic&#xD;
      receptors that have often been implicated in &quot;stress reactions&quot; as well as depressive&#xD;
      disorders. We believe that our compound can identify specific molecular brain dysfunctions&#xD;
      that are causally related to treatment-resistant depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a reliable relationship between&#xD;
      the level of mirtazapine in the bloodstream and the occupancy of neuroreceptors by&#xD;
      mirtazapine in the brain. We will apply our standard procedures of PET brain scanning and&#xD;
      region-of-interest data analysis, using healthy volunteers who will receive a daily dose of&#xD;
      mirtazapine (double-blind design with placebo, 7.5 mg or 15 mg daily for 5 days). We believe&#xD;
      that this project could provide a procedure for assessing brain function in&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression, with the aim of improving the guidelines for successful,&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment of depression.&#xD;

      This project uses a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design to determine&#xD;
      whether there is a reliable relationship between the level of the antidepressant drug&#xD;
      mirtazapine in the bloodstream and the degree of occupancy of neuroreceptors in the brain of&#xD;
      healthy human volunteers. The primary data endpoints of the study will be the binding&#xD;
      potential of C-11 labelled racemic mirtazapine in the brain under baseline conditions and&#xD;
      after 5 days of ingestion of either a placebo tablet or a table containing 7.5 mg or 15 mg of&#xD;
      mirtazapine. The degree of receptor occupancy obtained during each experimental condition&#xD;
      will be calculated on the basis of the binding potentials in brain regions using data&#xD;
      obtained by positron emission tomography (PET scanning). Blood samples will be obtained at&#xD;
      the time of PET scanning in order to determine whether there is a reliable correlation&#xD;
      between the concentration of mirtazapine in the bloodstream and the degree of receptor&#xD;
      occupancy achieved in brain. The study plans to include 24 healthy volunteers with 8 subjects&#xD;
      in each of the three groups (placebo, 7.5 mg mirtazapine, and 15 mg mirtazapine). Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized into groups in such a way that each of the three treatments will be used&#xD;
      for each of three consecutive subjects that enter the study. This procedure will reduce the&#xD;
      possibility that differences in procedures that might occur over time will introduce bias&#xD;
      into the results. Radiosynthesis of (C-11)mirtazapine will occur by the authorized and&#xD;
      documented procedures currently established at the PET Center of Aarhus University Hospital.&#xD;
