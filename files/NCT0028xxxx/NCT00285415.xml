      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the combination of the two&#xD;
      drugs, docetaxel (Taxotere®) and carboplatin (Paraplatin®) followed by radiation directed at&#xD;
      the tumor in treating your endometrial cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial carcinoma is the most common malignancy in the female reproductive tract. For the&#xD;
      percentage of patients with advanced stage (III - IV) optimum adjuvant therapy status-post&#xD;
      surgical staging and/or optimal cytoreductive surgery is not well defined and limited in the&#xD;
      rates of response. Survival rates range from 18 - 49% with high levels of toxicity with the&#xD;
      current treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) explored the use of chemotherapy in protocol #107&#xD;
      comparing adriamycin with a combination of adriamycin and cisplatin. This trial boasted a 45%&#xD;
      response rate for the combination arm compared to a 27% response rate in the adriamycin only&#xD;
      arm. Although no difference was seen in overall survival, the combination arm showed an&#xD;
      improvement in progression free survival from 3.8 to 5.7 months. Subsequently, GOG protocol&#xD;
      #122 randomized patients to this chemotherapeutic regimen versus whole abdominal radiation&#xD;
      therapy. This trial is now closed to accrual and results are pending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ball et. al. reported on a phase II trial of paclitaxel in advanced or recurrent endometrial&#xD;
      cancer done through the GOG.(3) At 250 mg/m2 (200mg/m2 for patients with previous radiation&#xD;
      therapy) over 24 hours, every 21 days, 10/28 patients responded. There were 4 complete&#xD;
      responders and 6 partial responders with an overall response rate of 35.7%. Toxicity was&#xD;
      remarkably high with grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and neurotoxicity seen in 62% and 10.7%,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dimpoulos et. al. reported the use of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours and cisplatin 75mg/m2&#xD;
      every 21 days in advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma.(4) A 67% objective response&#xD;
      rate was seen with 29% showing a complete response and 38% partial response. Toxicities&#xD;
      included a 9% grade 3 and 4 peripheral neuropathy rate. These response rates changed the&#xD;
      standard of care in the community setting from the more toxic regimen of adriamycin and&#xD;
      cisplatin to paclitaxel and carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hoskins et. al. substituted carboplatin for cisplatin in an effort to reduce the peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy seen in the Dimpoulos trial. This phase II combination of paclitaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin with radiation therapy in advanced endometrial cancer resulted in a 75% response&#xD;
      rate. The median failure-free survival time was 23 months, with a 62% 3-year overall survival&#xD;
      rate. Toxicities were primarily hematologic and reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ongoing GOG protocol, #184, is exploring the combination of tumor directed radiation&#xD;
      followed by a randomization to adriamycin and cisplatin versus adriamycin, cisplatin and&#xD;
      paclitaxel with G-CSF support. Increased toxicity will be expected in the three-drug regimen.&#xD;
      With a significant response rates to a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin along with&#xD;
      radiation therapy in the phase II setting it is hard to justify the added toxicity of this&#xD;
      three-drug regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCOTROC phase III trial comparing docetaxel (75 mg/m2) over 1 hour plus carboplatin (AUC&#xD;
      6) vs. paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) over 3 hours plus carboplatin (AUC 6) yielded equivalent&#xD;
      overall response rates in 1,077 patients with ovarian cancer. The docetaxel arm resulted in&#xD;
      significantly less overall grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor neurotoxicity. Only 4 patients&#xD;
      withdrew from the trial due to neurotoxicity on the docetaxel arm vs. 32 patients on the&#xD;
      paclitaxel arm. However, the docetaxel arm resulted in a higher incidence of neutropenia and&#xD;
      associated complications without compromising treatment delivery of overall safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the information to date, it seems prudent to explore a phase II trial of docetaxel&#xD;
      plus carboplatin every 3 weeks for 6 cycles followed by radiation therapy in the management&#xD;
      of patients with advanced endometrial cancer. The proposed protocol design requires that&#xD;
      chemotherapy be administered prior to radiation therapy in order to control distant&#xD;
      metastatic disease before attempting to control for local-regional recurrences with&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
