  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotavirus disease is the most common cause of gastroenteritis and dehydration in young&#xD;
      children worldwide. The global public health burden has prompted the development of a human&#xD;
      rotavirus vaccine against rotavirus disease by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. This&#xD;
      pre-registration study is undertaken to provide immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety&#xD;
      data for the vaccine when used in Indian infants aged approximately 8 weeks at the time of&#xD;
      the first dose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two groups of children to be recruited in different centers in India.&#xD;
      One group will receive the HRV vaccine and one group will receive the placebo. The vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo will be administered starting at 8-12 weeks of age, according to a two dose schedule&#xD;
      (0, 1 months schedule). The study will consist of three visits. A 8-day (Day 0 - 7) follow-up&#xD;
      period will be observed for general symptoms solicited in the study. A 31-day (Day 0 - 30)&#xD;
      follow-up will be observed for other unsolicited symptoms. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will&#xD;
      be followed-up throughout the study. A stool sample will be collected from the child at any&#xD;
      point during the study if he/ she develops any GE.&#xD;

             examination before entering into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subjects should have been administered the first dose of DTP/ OPV/ hepatitis B&#xD;
             vaccines as per the local universal immunization program at 6 weeks of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the&#xD;
             study vaccine or the routine UIP vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of&#xD;
             study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other&#xD;
             immune-modifying drugs since birth. (For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone,&#xD;
             or equivalent, &gt;= 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any chronic drug therapy to be continued during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 6 weeks of the&#xD;
             first dose of vaccine or planned administration during the study of a vaccine not&#xD;
             foreseen by the study protocol, with the exception of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis,&#xD;
             hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), OPV and vaccination against&#xD;
             tuberculosis, which can be given with at least two weeks separation from the first and&#xD;
             subsequent dose of the study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior administration of experimental rotavirus vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of confirmed rotavirus gastroenteritis.&#xD;

             uncorrected congenital malformation of the GI tract or other serious medical condition&#xD;
             as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including&#xD;
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection based on physical examination (no&#xD;
             laboratory testing is required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of&#xD;
