  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO) will be randomized to standard&#xD;
      or locking screw fixation of the osteotomy plate. Tantalum beads will be implanted around the&#xD;
      osteotomy site in all subjects to facilitate RSA imaging which will then allow micromotion at&#xD;
      the osteotomy site to be quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives and Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a)to determine fixation stability of the Puddu opening wedge osteotomy plate secured&#xD;
           with non-locking compared to locking screws. We hypothesize that plate fixation with&#xD;
           locking screws will result in a significant reduction of micromotion between tibial&#xD;
           segments prior to bony healing compared to the non-locking screw fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b)To determine the progress of bony healing. We hypothesize that increased fixation&#xD;
           stability in patients with locking screws will facilitate early bone healing reflected&#xD;
           by smaller micromotion over time compared to the non-locking screw patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a)If there is improved stability with the use of locking screws, rehabilitation&#xD;
           protocols following opening wedge HTO will be modified accordingly. We hypothesize that&#xD;
           decreasing micromotion will reach the detection limit of the RSA setup (0.4 mm) earlier&#xD;
           in the locking screw group than in the non-locking screw group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b)To evaluate the effect of the osteotomy on proximal tibial anatomy. We hypothesize&#xD;
           that an open-wedge procedure might increase rather than decrease the tibial slope.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For this pilot study, a total of 24 patients scheduled for opening wedge HTO who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, have read the study letter of information and signed the informed consent&#xD;
      will be randomized to osteotomy plate fixation with either non-locking screws (12 subjects)&#xD;
      or locking screws (12 subjects). See flow chart 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo routine pre-operative assessment for opening wedge high tibial&#xD;
      osteotomy which includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of demographic data and medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective assessment of knee function using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome&#xD;
           Score (KOOS)(11)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard physical evaluation of the lower limb assessing range of motion, alignment,&#xD;
           knee-related signs and symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographs: standing anteroposterior hip-to-ankle;(2) lateral view; skyline patellar&#xD;
           view at 30° of knee flexion; bilateral weight-bearing posteroanterior (PA) tunnel view&#xD;
           at 45° of knee flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic classification of arthrosis using the Kellgren scale(4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of mechanical and anatomical axes of the lower limb and calculation of&#xD;
           proposed correction angles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery In the operating room all subjects will undergo the following steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction of general anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percutaenous insertion into the proximal tibia surrounding the proposed osteotomy site&#xD;
           under fluoroscopic guidance of 6 to 9 radio-opaque 0.8mm tantalum beads using a&#xD;
           specifically designed gun. A standardized pattern of widespread tantalum bead&#xD;
           distribution will be used. To avoid bead loosening caused by postoperative bone&#xD;
           resorption, they will be placed a distance of at least 0.5 cm from the osteotomy line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RSA imaging to evaluate bead position&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard opening wedge HTO with the only variable being locking or non-locking screw&#xD;
           fixation of the Puddu plate according to the randomization schedule. This procedure is&#xD;
           routinely carried out under fluoroscopic and or radiographic control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second RSA imaging to obtain a reference film to assess stability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard wound closure and application of hinged brace&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Treatment All subjects will undergo the routine opening wedge HTO&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits The times, number and content of follow-up visits for study subjects will&#xD;
      not differ from the standard post-operative visits scheduled for all patients who have&#xD;
      undergone HTO. However, because RSA imaging is specialized, this will be done at LHSC&#xD;
      University Campus rather than at the Fowler Kennedy Sport Medicine Clinic (FKSMC). This will&#xD;
      be communicated to patients in the letter of information. Study follow-up visits are at 2,&#xD;
      6,12 weeks, and 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study follow-up visit subjects will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A subjective assessment of knee function using the KOOS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A standard physical evaluation of the lower limb assessing range of motion, alignment,&#xD;
           knee-related signs and symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographs: standing anteroposterior hip-to-ankle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RSA imaging in the AP and lateral planes simultaneously&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs from each follow-up visit will be evaluated for classification of arthrosis using&#xD;
      the Kellgren scale(4) and for measurements of mechanical and anatomical axes of the lower&#xD;
      limb and calculation of the correction angle obtained with HTO. Translations between tibial&#xD;
      segments will be calculated as previously described on the RSA images&#xD;
