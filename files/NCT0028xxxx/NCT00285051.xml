    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated for 2 consecutive chemo cycles with the study drug for one and&#xD;
      placebo for the other. In addition, patients will receive an injection before the chemo,&#xD;
      either ondansetron (if receiving placebo inhalation) or normal saline) if receiving active&#xD;
      study drug. They will take study medication for 3 days, 4 times daily and fill out VAS scores&#xD;
      before and after doses. Patients will be given rescue medication with each dose.&#xD;

      The study is comparing the use of inhaled delata-8-THC in the prevention of nausea and&#xD;
      vomitting in patients being treated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, and the patients&#xD;
      will continue use for 3 days afterward. Patients will be given rescue medication and will&#xD;
      fill out VAS scales for nausea, pain, appetite and dizziness. Patients will be treated for 2&#xD;
      cycles, one cycle receiving active drug (one of 2 doses) and the other placebo. Patients&#xD;
      receiving placebo will receive ondansetron injection before chemo and patients receiving&#xD;
      active drug will receive a normal saline injection. Patients will take the drug 4 times daily&#xD;
      for 3 days. The patients will return to clinic for a visit after 24-48 hours and 4 days.&#xD;
      Patients will bring a urine sample to measure metabolite. Patients will be given a diary to&#xD;
      monitor dosing and side effects as well as concomitant medication. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 2 - 3 centers. There will be 108 patients enrolled with 27 in each of 4 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 cycle 1 - Placebo cycle 2 - 300 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose Group 2 cycle 1 - Placebo&#xD;
      cycle 2 - 600 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose Group 3 cycle 1 - 300 mcg of delta-8-THC per&#xD;
      doseGroup cycle 2 - Placebo Group 4 cycle 1 - 600 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose cycle 2 -&#xD;
