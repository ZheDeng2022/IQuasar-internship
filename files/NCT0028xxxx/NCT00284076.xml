      To assess the effects of L-arginine upon functional status (treadmill exercise testing;&#xD;
      quality of life) and limb blood (by mercury strain gauge plethysmography) in peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral arterial disease is a common disorder effecting up to 15% of men over age 55 and&#xD;
      women over age 65. Patients with peripheral arterial disease are at increased risk for&#xD;
      stroke, myocardial infarction or other adverse vascular outcomes. Therapy for this disorder&#xD;
      is currently limited with only 2 FDA approved drugs (Pentoxifylline, cilostazol). These&#xD;
      agents improve walking distance by 10 to 40 percent. Other agents such as verapamil and&#xD;
      prostacyclin analogs have significant side effects. Although therapy with angiogenesis&#xD;
      inducers, including injections of plasmid constructs for vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) or VEGF protein, is beneficial, the widespread applicability of this therapy is&#xD;
      questionable. The study used an alternative approach, which may be safer and more effective.&#xD;
      The basis for this approach is the ability of L-arginine to enhance endogenous vascular&#xD;
      nitric oxide production, improving blood flow acutely. Furthermore, since several angiogenic&#xD;
      growth factors may act at least partially through the production of nitric oxide, this&#xD;
      therapy could produce a sustained benefit by the induction of an increase in skeletal muscle&#xD;
      capillary density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects of L-arginine on functional&#xD;
      status was performed in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Blood flow was assessed by&#xD;
      Doppler and plethysmography and measures of nitric oxide synthesis (plasma and urinary&#xD;
      nitrogen oxides) were performed. The effect of L-arginine on treadmill walking distance was&#xD;
      determined. The potential for L-arginine induced angiogenesis was assessed using magnetic&#xD;
      resonance angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were two separate studies of oral L-arginine. The first was a dose ranging study&#xD;
      involving 80 patients receiving four different doses of L-arginine (9 grams, 6 grams, 3&#xD;
      grams, or 0 grams). The dosing of L-arginine was performed in a randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      fashion. Patients receive six weeks of therapy. Patients with diabetic retinopathy, active&#xD;
      malignancy or previous malignancy in a state of remission, or autoimmune disorders were&#xD;
      excluded. Ophthalmological exams were performed to screen for pathological angiogenesis in&#xD;
      the retina. After the completion of the dose response study, the investigators studied the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of prolonged (12 months) L-arginine therapy. The primary end point was&#xD;
      absolute claudication distance (ACD) and a statistical analysis was performed of the&#xD;
      logarithm ACDT / ACDB. A treadmill was performed at one month after cessation of therapy to&#xD;
      determine if there was a structural alteration of the indices of limb hemodynamics including&#xD;
      the ankle brachial index (ABI) and plethysmography was performed at 6 and 12 months of&#xD;
      therapy and at 1 month after sensation of therapy. The study correlated measures of limb&#xD;
      blood flow with evidence of increased nitric oxide synthesis by measuring urinary nitrogen&#xD;
      oxide. Flow mediated vasodilation (FMVD) of the brachial artery was measured. The choice of&#xD;
      monitoring flow mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery, while appropriate for showing a&#xD;
      systemic enhancement of nitric oxide synthesis, would not directly support an improvement of&#xD;
      endothelial function in the vascular bed of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) was measured with the prediction that patients with&#xD;
      elevated ADMA levels, depressed urinary nitrogen oxides and reduced FMVD might be more&#xD;
      responsive to L-arginine therapy. A second aim of the protocol was to determine if the&#xD;
      chronic enhancement of nitric oxide synthesis by L-arginine supplementation had an enduring&#xD;
      effect on conduit vessel structure. The ankle brachial index, plethysmography, and MR&#xD;
      perfusion imaging were performed at 0, 6 and 12 months on therapy, and at 1 month after&#xD;
      cessation of therapy.&#xD;
