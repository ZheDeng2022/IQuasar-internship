    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the genetic changes and immunologic&#xD;
      changes that are involved in the development and progression of lung cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multistage theory of carcinogenesis includes the development of multiple activating&#xD;
      genetic changes due to exposure to carcinogens, either primarily, or superimposed upon&#xD;
      pre-existing mutations in the genome. These changes result in activation of protooncogenes,&#xD;
      lack of expression of tumor suppressor genes, or combinations of the above, the sum of which&#xD;
      results in malignant transformation. Detailed analyses of chromosomal lesions in bronchogenic&#xD;
      lung cancer reveal several recurring abnormalities, including deletions, duplications or&#xD;
      polysomy of chromosomes 1, 3, 7 and 20. Aberrations in the short arm of chromosome 3, in&#xD;
      particular, are found in many small cell and non-small cell lung cancers, and polysomy 7 is a&#xD;
      frequent finding in non-small cell lung cancers. Many of these abnormalities have no&#xD;
      identified significance, however the application of current and evolving techniques of&#xD;
      molecular biology have revealed specific genomic changes leading to malignant phenotypes in&#xD;
      several tumors, for example, the application of polymerase chain reaction amplification&#xD;
      techniques has revealed a striking incidence of mutations in the h- and k-ras protooncogenes&#xD;
      have been discovered, associated with over-expression of growth factors or receptors, for&#xD;
      example epidermal growth factor receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As all epithelial cells are exposed to similar environmental conditions, it seems likely that&#xD;
      many cells undergo mutagenesis simultaneously. Clinically, this is frequently apparent, as&#xD;
      10-20% of patients with lung cancer have another epithelial cancer arise, either&#xD;
      concurrently, or at some later time in their course. The predisposition for development of&#xD;
      second malignancies also affects other epithelial surfaces, for example, there is a strong&#xD;
      tendency for patients with cancer of the head and neck to develop a second malignancy&#xD;
      (bronchogenic lung cancer) in the aerodigestive tract. Despite decreases in the smoking rate&#xD;
      overall in the United States, projections through 2025 indicate that there will still be&#xD;
      100,000 deaths annually from lung cancer and other smoking-associated cancers. Therefore, it&#xD;
      would be of great benefit to patients at risk of developing lung cancer to identify these&#xD;
      changes prior to the development of invasive malignant lesions. This is particularly true of&#xD;
      patients who have already developed a cancer, or in patients with a strong family history who&#xD;
      may have occupational (eg., asbestos) or habitual (eg., cigarette smoke) exposure to&#xD;
      carcinogens. Identification of cancers in the pre-clinical stage has been attempted&#xD;
      previously, for example with screening chest x-rays or sputum cytologies, however, these&#xD;
      approaches have not proven to be beneficial, as current detection methods are not sensitive&#xD;
      enough to identify early, non-phenotypic changes. The proposal outlined herein is designed to&#xD;
      clarify this issue by examining bronchial tissue from patients at risk for development of a&#xD;
      second cancer (patients undergoing primary resection for cure of bronchogenic lung cancer)&#xD;
      and assessing the biopsy tissue for the presence of chromosomal abnormalities and mutations&#xD;
      in the h- and k-ras protooncogenes. These changes may be present for long periods of time in&#xD;
      airway epithelial cells prior to the development of overt pathologic changes, and methods to&#xD;
      recognize these changes would be useful to assess and follow patients at risk for developing&#xD;
      malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of lymph node status in lung cancer: In patients with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC), tumor stage is the strongest determinant of prognosis. Stratification of patients&#xD;
      into stages facilitates individual treatment decisions based on the survival statistics of a&#xD;
      population. Within these staged populations however, subsets of patients with apparent early&#xD;
      disease will still suffer cancer recurrence. This is due to the inability of current staging&#xD;
      methods to detect small numbers of disseminated tumor cells (micrometastases) in these&#xD;
      patients. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for cancer related messenger RNA's has been&#xD;
      shown to detect the presence of micrometastases in histologically negative lymph node&#xD;
      specimens, and these findings correlate with poor outcome. Unfortunately, routine clinical&#xD;
      application of this technique has been limited by &quot;false positive&quot; results in control tissues&#xD;
      and a low specificity for predicting disease recurrence. We have recently shown that&#xD;
      quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) can discriminate between true and false positives, and that&#xD;
      this results in an improved ability to predict recurrence. In this proposal we intend to&#xD;
      analyze lymph nodes from patients undergoing surgical resection for NSCLC using quantitative&#xD;
      RT-PCR. These patients will then be followed for five years to determine tumor recurrence.&#xD;
      The goal is to use QRT-PCR to try and identify which patients are at highest risk for disease&#xD;
      recurrence and who may therefore benefit from more aggressive therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To obtain and maintain in cell culture 'normal' bronchial epithelial cells (NBECs) and&#xD;
           tumors from patients undergoing resection for treatment of lung carcinoma and&#xD;
           mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To harvest NBEC and lung tumors for evaluation of genetic abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To perform molecular analysis including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification,&#xD;
           flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and gene analysis of material from NBECs, tumors,&#xD;
           adjacent and normal lung and blood for evaluation such as mutations in the K-ras and p53&#xD;
           protooncogenes, as well as other candidate genes and pathways such as those involved in&#xD;
           epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, we will look for mutations and&#xD;
           alterations of expression of Fas, Fas ligand, and FADD, three molecules which mediate&#xD;
           programmed cell death and have recently been shown to be expressed on multiple tumor&#xD;
           cells including lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To analyze cytokines present in lavage fluid, tumors, and lung tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To produce T cell cultures from cells present in tumor-draining lymph nodes and in tumor&#xD;
           tissue. To isolate, numerically expand as well as phenotypically and functionally&#xD;
           characterize human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor cells for the&#xD;
           potential development of future cell therapy clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To analyze intra-pulmonary and mediastinal lymph nodes for expression of tumor related&#xD;
           mRNA's (such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin-19, hepatocyte growth&#xD;
           factor, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor, and the neuromedin-B (NMB) receptor)&#xD;
           as potential evidence of micrometastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To detect metastatic tumor in bone marrow extracted from discarded rib resection&#xD;
           material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To analyze biomarkers and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in biological samples and&#xD;
           correlate with imaging analysis, and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To conduct genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, microbiome, and immunologic research studies&#xD;
           on samples collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several researchers have already established that chromosomal changes occur in a non-random&#xD;
      pattern in non-small cell lung cancer. It appears that these changes correlate with specific&#xD;
      genetic changes, resulting in the malignant phenotype. Furthermore, a great deal of&#xD;
      experimental evidence supports the multistage theory of carcinogenesis, whereby incremental&#xD;
      changes in the genome accumulate, resulting in the malignant phenotype. The final product of&#xD;
      the accumulated changes is determined by the cell of origin and the number and severity of&#xD;
      changes occurring. We hope to establish that early changes (as expressed by karyotypic&#xD;
      changes or by particular point mutations) can be identified which would indicate the&#xD;
      likelihood of particular patient developing another malignancy. This information could then&#xD;
      be applied to clinical situations, for example, to determine the frequency of clinical&#xD;
      follow-up by chest x-ray, screening bronchoscopy, or sputum cytology. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      information gathered could help identify one or a few genetic changes necessary for&#xD;
      transformation, which could then be explored to further define the transformation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of malignant cells in lymph nodes is a critical parameter in the staging of lung&#xD;
      cancer patients. Assessment of lymph nodes is currently done by histopathology alone. The&#xD;
      long-term survival of lung cancer patients who have Stage IB disease (no known lymph node&#xD;
      involvement with a tumor greater than 2 cm) is lower than patients who are Stage IA (no known&#xD;
      lymph node involvement with a tumor less than 2 cm). Likewise, the survival rates of patients&#xD;
      who are judged to be Stage II based on histologically positive level one lymph nodes is often&#xD;
      no better than that of higher stage patients who have level two lymph node involvement. These&#xD;
      observations suggest that micrometastases are often present in lymph nodes that are not&#xD;
      detectable by histological assessment. This proposal will supplement the histopathological&#xD;
      examination of lymph nodes with methods that detect occult metastatic cells to determine&#xD;
      whether assigning patients to a higher stage more accurately reflects their disease burden.&#xD;
      This could affect subsequent treatment and patient outcomes.&#xD;
