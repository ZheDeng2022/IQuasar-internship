  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively evaluate in de novo kidney transplant recipients, hepatitis C positive, the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of an immunosuppressive regimen of EC-MPS free of steroids in comparison&#xD;
      with a regimen of EC-MPS with standard steroids, as measured by the hepatic function tests&#xD;
      (ALT/AST) after 12 months treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients hepatitis C positive (serology test within the last 12 months and determined&#xD;
             by third-generation assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recipients of heart-beating cadaveric, living unrelated or living related non-HLA&#xD;
             identical donor kidney transplant, treated with basiliximab and CsA-ME as primary&#xD;
             immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Multi-organ recipients (e.g. double kidney, kidney and pancreas or kidney and liver)&#xD;
             or previous transplant with any other organ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Kidneys from non-heart beating donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ABO incompatibility against the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with panel reactive antibodies of &gt;50% at most recent assessment prior to&#xD;
             transplantation and /or prior graft lost due to immunological reasons in the first six&#xD;
             months post-transplantation or patients who are considered to be at increased risk of&#xD;
             acute rejection by the principal investigator Additional protocol defined&#xD;
             inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.&#xD;
