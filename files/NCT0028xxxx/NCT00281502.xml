      The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase A will evaluate the contribution of&#xD;
      bacterial overgrowth and colonic inertia to development of Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)in 50&#xD;
      ambulatory subjects with HE and hepatitis C cirrhosis. This phase will include a Screening&#xD;
      and Evaluation Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase B will evaluate the effect of rifaximin on bacterial outgrowth and severity of HE in 20&#xD;
      of the subjects enrolled in Phase A who have a somewhat greater degree of encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the relationship between bacterial overgrowth and the presence and severity of HE in&#xD;
           patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the effectiveness and tolerability of rifaximin relative to placebo in treatment of HE&#xD;
           associated with hepatitis C cirrhosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the relationship between bacterial overgrowth and the presence and severity of HE before&#xD;
           and after rifaximin treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic encephalopathy is a frequent and occasionally refractory complication of cirrhosis&#xD;
      and is associated with impaired quality of life. Its severity may not correlate with other&#xD;
      parameters of liver dysfunction. Although multiple pathogenic mechanisms for the condition&#xD;
      have been proposed, most include the participation of bacterial toxins, especially ammonia,&#xD;
      produced in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment options for hepatic encephalopathy at this&#xD;
      time are limited to lactulose and neomycin. Lactulose is frequently poorly tolerated, and&#xD;
      many patients are non-compliant with its use. In patients with renal insufficiency in whom&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy is frequently problematic, use of neomycin is contraindicated due to&#xD;
      ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic dysfunction is common in patients with cirrhosis and could contribute to the&#xD;
      development of hepatic encephalopathy by impairment of intestinal motility, leading to&#xD;
      bacterial overgrowth and colonic inertia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questions will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Is impaired intestinal transit and bacterial overgrowth associated with the presence and&#xD;
      severity of hepatic encephalopathy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients will undergo a detailed clinical evaluation for severity of liver disease,&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy and assessment of intestinal transit and bacterial overgrowth with&#xD;
      radiographic marker study and breath test analysis. Multivariate analysis will then be&#xD;
      performed to determine the relationship of intestinal transit and evidence of bacterial&#xD;
      overgrowth with the presence and severity of hepatic encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Does treatment with rifaximin improve bacterial overgrowth and hepatic encephalopathy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients from the above population with significant encephalopathy will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either rifaximin or placebo. Post-treatment evaluation for severity of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy and breath test analysis for bacterial overgrowth will then be performed. The&#xD;
      effect of treatment on changes in hepatic encephalopathy and bacterial overgrowth and the&#xD;
      relationship between changes in bacterial overgrowth and severity of hepatic encephalopathy&#xD;
      will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase A Endpoints: Degree of bacterial overgrowth and its correlation with the grade of&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy (if present).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase B Endpoints: To demonstrate improvement in degree of HE with treatment of Rifaximin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Endpoints The primary efficacy endpoint for Phase B of the study will be the change&#xD;
      from baseline in the proportion of patients with no HE, minimal HE (no symptoms, abnormal&#xD;
      psychometric testing), mild persistent HE (mild symptoms), and persistent Stage II HE&#xD;
      (presence of asterixis, history of hospitalization for spontaneous Stage III or IV HE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy endpoints for Phase B will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate improvement in intestinal transit time for patients (based on Lactulose&#xD;
      Hydrogen Breath Test) To demonstrate improvement in bacterial overgrowth, improved insomnia,&#xD;
      flatulence, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that rifaximin improved patients' symptoms of insomnia, flatulence, and&#xD;
      quality of life measure with the degree of bacterial overload and the impaired intestinal&#xD;
      transit time.&#xD;
