    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if interleukin-2, a drug that stimulates the immune&#xD;
      system, can be used after chemotherapy to slow the progression of your disease. We also want&#xD;
      to test what the best dose of interleukin-2 is that can be used safely at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-2, abbreviated as IL2, is a naturally produced growth hormone for the immune&#xD;
      cells in our body. It stimulates the growth of the immune cells and enhances their ability to&#xD;
      fight infections and cancers. In people with cancer, the immune cells are typically&#xD;
      suppressed and became even more so after irradiation and chemotherapy treatment. By giving&#xD;
      you more IL2 we hope to enhance the immune system so that it can fight the cancer better,&#xD;
      control cancer growth and shrink the cancer.&#xD;

      There are two treatment phases in this study. But before you begin in the study, we will need&#xD;
      to find out whether you are eligible for the study. You will undergo the following&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history review and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for hematology, chemistries, PSA, and immune assays (approximately 4&#xD;
           tablespoons of blood)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and a bone scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a pain questionnaire, quality of life questionnaire, pain medication diary, and&#xD;
           symptom diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial treatment phase of this study consists of chemotherapy drug given weekly. You&#xD;
      will receive 3 weekly chemotherapy treatments followed by 1 week with no treatment. Three&#xD;
      weeks of treatment followed by one week of no treatment is considered 1 cycle, and you will&#xD;
      receive a total of 4 cycles of chemotherapy over a 16-week period. Taxotere is given&#xD;
      intravenously in the clinic on the 1st day of each weekly treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with taxotere is a currently accepted treatment for this stage prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Your doctor may recommend you receive taxotere even if you do not participate in this study.&#xD;
      During this phase of treatment, you will have blood draws on treatment weeks prior to having&#xD;
      the chemotherapy. You will have a PSA drawn every month (weeks 5, 9, and 13). We will ask you&#xD;
      to complete a pain questionnaire, quality of life questionnaire, pain medication diary, and&#xD;
      symptom diary at weeks 5, 9, and 13. Some of the questions may be personal, such as &quot;I am&#xD;
      satisfied with my sex life&quot; and &quot;I worry about dying&quot;. You do not have to answer these&#xD;
      questions if you do not want to. You will also have a physical exam at the beginning of your&#xD;
      3rd cycle of treatment (week 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of the treatment program is the experimental part: immunotherapy with IL2.&#xD;
      You will be assigned to receive one of 4 doses of IL2. This is because we are testing what is&#xD;
      the highest dose of IL2 that a subject can receive without having unacceptable side affects&#xD;
      from the IL2. You will give yourself shots of IL2 under the skin twice a day for 5 days per&#xD;
      week for 3 weeks. During the 3rd week of treatment there are 2 days when you have to give a&#xD;
      higher dose of IL2 for boosting the immune cells (see below diagram). The 4th week will be a&#xD;
      rest week where you do not receive treatment. One 4-week period of IL2 treatment is called a&#xD;
      cycle. You will continue to receive cycles of IL2 treatment as long as your cancer shows no&#xD;
      further growth. We will teach you how to administer the IL2 at home.&#xD;
