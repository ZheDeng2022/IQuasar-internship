  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a statistical association between&#xD;
      changes in sputum serial levels of two cytokines, interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-6, during the&#xD;
      treatment course of a severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (AE-COPD) and during the clinical course itself (i.e., rate of recovery or potential&#xD;
      complicated course). AE-COPD is defined as an episode requiring emergency room (ER)&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD is one of the most pressing healthcare problems facing our nation. AE-COPD is&#xD;
      responsible for the bulk of healthcare costs, and much of the morbidity and decline in health&#xD;
      status among individuals with this common disease. The lack of accepted animal models of&#xD;
      AE-COPD necessitates novel approaches using human samples. Advances in the understanding of&#xD;
      the pathogenesis have been slowed, in part, due to controversy as to how exacerbations should&#xD;
      be defined. The prevailing paradigm has defined AE-COPD as event-based. Such definitions&#xD;
      clearly identify groups of patients with accelerated loss of pulmonary function and increased&#xD;
      mortality. However, limited data show that symptom-based definitions of AE-COPD also capture&#xD;
      episodes inducing significant morbidity and functional decline, and hence of concern to&#xD;
      patients. Fundamental mechanisms are lacking to explain AE-COPD defined by either means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controversy also surrounds triggers of AE-COPD. Bacteria and viruses are involved in some&#xD;
      episodes, but the relative importance of each is intertwined with disputes over the&#xD;
      definition of AE-COPD. Progress at linking specific pathogens to molecular pathogenesis has&#xD;
      been slow, both due to their diversity, and to the high rates of bacterial colonization of&#xD;
      patients with COPD, even in the stable state. Moreover, in many AE-COPD cases, no pathogen&#xD;
      can be identified. Without negating the value of analyzing infections with specific species&#xD;
      of pathogens, it appears that progress in molecular pathogenesis could be accelerated by&#xD;
      focusing on unifying features of the pulmonary immune response during AE-COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research protocol will involve a prospective, observational analysis. Participants will&#xD;
      include acutely ill COPD patients having an AE-COPD who are enrolled during an ER evaluation&#xD;
      or hospitalization at Ann Arbor VA Hospital or the University of Michigan Health Systems ER,&#xD;
      clinic, or wards. All non-study diagnostic testing, decisions to discharge from the ER or&#xD;
      admit to hospital, prescription of medications, and non-study follow-up will be left to the&#xD;
      discretion of the primary caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are either being or anticipate being discharged to their usual residence&#xD;
      from the ER will be enrolled while still in the ER. Participants who were discharged to their&#xD;
      usual residence may be contacted by telephone and enrolled up to 24 hours later, if willing&#xD;
      to return to the Medical Center for study initiation. Hospitalized patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      within the first 48 hours. Study physicians and coordinators will be on call to capture&#xD;
      people at presentation, prior to steroids and antibiotics, if possible. However, clinically&#xD;
      indicated treatment will not be delayed to permit enrollment or collection of research&#xD;
      samples. Participants will be questioned about the status of five respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      (dyspnea, cough, sputum production, sputum viscosity, sputum purulence) using a published&#xD;
      Respiratory Symptom score instrument. Each symptom will be scored for severity using the&#xD;
      following three-point scale: 1) Usual level; 2) Somewhat worse than usual; 3) Much worse than&#xD;
      usual. An acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) will be defined symptomatically as&#xD;
      a minor worsening (score of 2) for two or more symptoms, or a major worsening (score of 3)&#xD;
      for one or more symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical score will be generated using a previously used system (Chest 2000; 118:1557-1565)&#xD;
      in which 10 clinical parameters will be assessed (overall feeling of well-being, dyspnea,&#xD;
      cough, sputum production, sputum viscosity, sputum purulence, overall appearance, respiratory&#xD;
      rate, wheezing, and rales); severity of each parameter will be scored using the same&#xD;
      three-point scale. Thus the scores will range from 10 to 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following additional data will be obtained: vital signs (blood pressure, pulse,&#xD;
      temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation level); dyspnea assessment (MMRC &amp;&#xD;
      University of California San Diego SOBQ); estimate of daily sputum production over last 72&#xD;
      hours; sputum color (using a standardized color &quot;paint-chip&quot; scale); changes in medication&#xD;
      usage, with special attention to elicit any history of increased use of potent inhaled&#xD;
      steroids, or patient-initiated use of oral steroids or antibiotics. If there is fever or&#xD;
      focal findings on chest examination, a chest X-ray will be obtained as part of usual clinical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum and blood samples will be collected for measurement of IL-6 and IL-17 levels at time 0&#xD;
      in the ER or hospital, and then 5-7 days, 10-12 days, 33-35 days, and 56-58 days later.&#xD;
      Specimens may be obtained from participants requiring mechanical ventilation during the first&#xD;
      24 hours of intubation only, and only if they are not suspected to have pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are reimbursed $25 per scheduled return visit following hospital discharge to help&#xD;
      defray travel expenses.&#xD;
