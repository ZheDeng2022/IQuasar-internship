      Investigation of Psychomotor and Cognitive Residual Effects of Single Oral Doses of Zolpidem&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a crossover study, with 4 different treatments (Ambien, Lunesta, placebo, and&#xD;
      flurazepam). The flurazepam arm always comes last due to the long washout period associated&#xD;
      with it. The other 3 arms are randomized.&#xD;
