      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Dehydroepiandrosterone&#xD;
      (DHEA) 50mg daily, for 12 months in naturally menopausal women with low libido who are not&#xD;
      receiving systemic oestrogen or oestrogen- progestin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy measures for the present study are effects on sexual function, wellbeing and&#xD;
      menopausal symptoms. Safety measures will include endometrial assessment by transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound (TVU), vital signs, lipid profiles, general electrolytes, effects on glucose&#xD;
      metabolism and reports of adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate (DHEAS) are the most abundant sex steroids in&#xD;
      women. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), a unique secretory product of the adrenal&#xD;
      gland, and DHEA are converted at various sites in the body, such as the brain, bone and&#xD;
      adipose tissue to estrogen or testosterone and their various by-products. DHEAS and DHEA&#xD;
      levels decline with age and there has been considerable conjecture that this results in a&#xD;
      loss of well-being and libido. DHEA is available as an over-the-counter nutritional&#xD;
      supplement in the United States, and is being increasingly prescribed and formulated by&#xD;
      compounding pharmacies across Australia. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the&#xD;
      effects of oral DHEA on the well-being, sexual function and safety in women. Previous studies&#xD;
      evaluating the effects of DHEA on either postmenopausal women or women with adrenal&#xD;
      deficiency (Addison's disease) have produced conflicting results, with some studies finding&#xD;
      benefit in terms of sexual function and well-being while other studies have found no benefit.&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need for an appropriately powered randomized controlled trial of the&#xD;
      effects of DHEA therapy on sexual function and well-being in postmenopausal women. In&#xD;
      addition, as DHEA may be metabolized to estrogens, whether DHEA will alleviate vasomotor&#xD;
      symptoms merits evaluation. The effects of DHEA on the endometrial (uterine) lining requires&#xD;
      assessment, given its potential to be converted to estrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the current study will be to assess the effects of DHEA therapy in&#xD;
      naturally menopausal women on sexual function using the Sabbatsberg Self-Rating Scale (SSS)&#xD;
      over 12 months in a randomized placebo controlled trial. In addition the effects on&#xD;
      well-being will be assessed by the Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) Index and&#xD;
      menopausal symptoms will be evaluated by the Menopause Quality of Life (MENQOL) Intervention&#xD;
      Questionnaire. A diary record will also be employed to assess the effects on sexual function.&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed over the entire study. Participants will also undergo a transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound (TVU) at the beginning and end of the study, to determine whether DHEA affects the&#xD;
      endometrial lining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be conducted in 240 women over a&#xD;
      52-week period. Women will be randomized to receive either placebo or DHEA (50 mg/day) for a&#xD;
      52-week period. It is anticipated that the study will require a 6-month recruitment period.&#xD;
      The study duration will be approximately 56 weeks, with a 4-week screening period and&#xD;
      treatment period of 52 weeks. The study will be conducted over approximately 13 months. This&#xD;
      is a single-centre study and will be conducted at the Alfred Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be generally healthy women aged 40 - 65 years who have undergone&#xD;
      a natural menopause and are in a stable monogamous sexual relationship and not using hormone&#xD;
      therapy (HT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are required to attend 6 clinic visits over a blinded treatment period of 52&#xD;
      weeks. Informed consent will be obtained from the participant prior to the commencement of&#xD;
      any study procedure at the first clinic visit. If participants are eligible, they will be&#xD;
      asked to return at the end of the screening period to be randomized and commence treatment.&#xD;
      During the treatment period, participants will take one capsule daily (placebo or DHEA 50&#xD;
      mg). All participants will return to the clinic 5 more times, at weeks 0, 12, 26, 38 and 52&#xD;
      for assessments of efficacy and safety. Blood tests will be collected at Weeks -4, 0, 12, 26&#xD;
      and 52 to assess safety and hormone levels. Prior to commencing the study, participants will&#xD;
      require a mammogram if this has not been done within 12 months of study entry. A transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound will be performed to assess endometrial thickness prior to commencement of the&#xD;
      trial. A Papanicolaou smear will also be performed if the cervix is still present, in those&#xD;
      women where a Pap smear has not been done within 12 months of screening. These&#xD;
      investigations, except the mammogram and Pap smear, will be repeated at the completion of the&#xD;
      study. All participants will have a complete physical examination which will include an&#xD;
      assessment of vital signs, breast examination, and internal and external pelvic examination&#xD;
      to assess for clitoromegaly (clitoral enlargement). Skin evaluations for scalp hair loss,&#xD;
      hirsutism and acne, and assessment for voice changes will be made throughout the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be required to complete various questionnaires to assess sexual function&#xD;
      (SSS), menopausal symptoms (MENQUOL Intervention) and general well-being (PGWB) at Weeks 0,&#xD;
      12, 26 and 52. Participants will also record satisfactory sexual events in a 28 day diary&#xD;
      which will be done in the 4 weeks prior to Weeks 0, 12, 26 and 52.&#xD;
