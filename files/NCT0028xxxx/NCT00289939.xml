  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this work is to reduce the prevalence of HIV and domestic violence&#xD;
      among women at risk by encouraging self-protective behaviors. To obtain this goal, Multnomah&#xD;
      County Health Department and Oregon Department of Human Services have conducted a randomized&#xD;
      trial of an intervention to prevent HIV and domestic violence among women who have recent&#xD;
      criminal justice involvement and who are at risk for HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women enrolled in the study were randomly assigned to one of three study conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: these women received information on local resources addressing HIV prevention,&#xD;
           domestic violence, and life stability issues; they did not receive any counseling&#xD;
           sessions as part of the study itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: these women received up to ten supportive counseling sessions based on the&#xD;
           techniques of motivational interviewing. These sessions aimed to reduce HIV risk and to&#xD;
           improve life stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: these women received up to ten supportive counseling sessions based on&#xD;
           motivational interviewing. These sessions aimed to reduce risk for HIV and domestic&#xD;
           violence and to improve life stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses of this study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1. Supportive counseling (motivational interviewing) addressing HIV prevention and&#xD;
           increased life stability will lead to reductions of HIV risk behavior among women&#xD;
           enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2. Supportive counseling (motivational interviewing) addressing domestic violence&#xD;
           prevention, HIV prevention, and increased life stability, will bring about reductions in&#xD;
           experiences of domestic violence and a reduction of HIV risk among these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3. The supportive counseling received in this study will enhance these women's&#xD;
           self-efficacy, self-esteem, and psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in all three experimental groups were interviewed at the beginning of the study and&#xD;
      again after 4, 7, and 10 months. These assessment interviews asked questions about: HIV risk;&#xD;
      experiences of domestic violence; and life stability issues such as education, employment,&#xD;
      and housing; and included biological testing for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. Women&#xD;
      in Group 2 and Group 3 participated in up to 10 sessions of supportive counseling&#xD;
      (motivational interviewing) between the time of enrollment and the 4-month interviews.&#xD;
