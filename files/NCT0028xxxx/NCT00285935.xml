  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are conducting an eight week longitudinal study to learn if blood levels of certain&#xD;
      naturally occurring compounds and genetic markers differ between patients with depression and&#xD;
      healthy adults who are not depressed, and if any such differences relate to memory&#xD;
      performance, mood, and neurobiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will do this by comparing the unmedicated depressed patients with matched healthy controls&#xD;
      at baseline and then following the depressed patients over the course of eight weeks of&#xD;
      standardized antidepressant treatment to gauge which baseline abnormalities normalize over&#xD;
      the course of treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following an initial telephone screen to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      evaluation will continue with an in-person evaluation to assess the presence or absence of&#xD;
      active medical history and history of major psychiatric illness, as well as review of the&#xD;
      consent document. If found to be eligible, participants would then be admitted to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next step for eligible, consenting depressed subjects and healthy controls is a baseline&#xD;
      hospital visit and baseline MRI. The baseline hospital visit will last about 4 hours. We will&#xD;
      begin the baseline visit by collecting a urine sample for a drug (and, for women, pregnancy)&#xD;
      test. As long as that is negative, we will then collect a blood sample of about 155cc. After&#xD;
      the blood draw, participants will complete cognitive tests and meet again with the study&#xD;
      psychiatrist. Participants will also complete a baseline Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) of their brain at the Veteran's Affairs (VA) Hospital&#xD;
      in San Francisco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline hospital visit and MRI, depressed subjects (but not healthy controls) will&#xD;
      begin taking an FDA approved antidepressant, as prescribed by the study psychiatrist, for the&#xD;
      next 8 weeks while they are enrolled in the study. The specific drug will be decided upon&#xD;
      between the participant and the study psychiatrist at the in-person screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 weeks, depressed participants will return to UCSF to meet again with the psychiatrist&#xD;
      to discuss symptoms and how to continue treatment; at that visit, they will have another&#xD;
      blood draw of 155cc (the same blood draw as at baseline). Healthy controls will return at&#xD;
      week 4 only for the blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 weeks later (after 8 weeks in total), we will bring both depressed and healthy participants&#xD;
      back for an additional visit that will include the same blood draw, testing, and MRI as the&#xD;
      baseline visit. A physician-investigator will meet with the depressed subjects to review&#xD;
      their clinical responses to treatment and to make further treatment suggestions, which the&#xD;
      subjects may use in discussions of their future treatment options with their personal&#xD;
      physicians. If a decision is made to discontinue antidepressant treatment, the subjects will&#xD;
      be given instructions on how to withdraw from the medication, and will be given up to a 4&#xD;
      week supply of the drug to facilitate this withdrawal.&#xD;
