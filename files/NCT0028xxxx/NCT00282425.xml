  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scleroderma is disease believed to be due to immune cells, cells which normally protect the&#xD;
      body but are now causing damage to the body. There has not been any treatment that has been&#xD;
      effective in treating this disease. The likelihood of progression of the disease to severe&#xD;
      disability and death is high. This study is designed to examine whether treating patients&#xD;
      with high dose Cyclophosphamide and Fludarabine (drugs which reduce the function of your&#xD;
      immune system) and CAMPATH-1H (a protein that kills the immune cells that are thought to be&#xD;
      causing the disease), followed by return of blood stem cells that have been previously&#xD;
      collected from patients brother or sister will stop or reverse the disease. The purpose of&#xD;
      the Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine and CAMPATH-1H is to decrease immune system. The purpose of&#xD;
      the stem cell infusion is to restore blood production, which will be severely impaired by the&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine and CAMPATH-1H, and to produce a normal immune system that will&#xD;
      no longer attack the body.&#xD;

&#xD;
        And one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. DLCO &lt; 80% of predicted or decrease in lung function (TLC, DLCO or FEV1) of 10% or&#xD;
             more over 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active alveolitis on bronchoalveolar lavage&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pulmonary fibrosis or alveolitis on CT scan or CXR&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Elevated ESR greater than or equal to 25mm/hour confirmed on a second occasion at&#xD;
             least two weeks apart without evidence of active infectious process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Abnormal EKG (low QRS voltage, or ventricular hypertrophy) or left ventricle (LV)&#xD;
             diastolic dysfunction (expressed by an inverted E/A ratio which represents early and&#xD;
             late filling of the LV during atrial contraction) or LV wall thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Since pulmonary disease independent of skin score (NEJM, 2006, 345:25 2655-2709)&#xD;
             carries a poor prognosis, patient may be enroled for only lung involvement defined as&#xD;
             active alveolitis on BAL or ground-glass opacity on CT, a DLCO &lt; 80% predicted or&#xD;
             decrease in lung function (TLC), DLCO, FVC) of 10% or more in last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Poor performance status (ECOG &gt; or =2) at the time of entry, unless due to disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Significant end organ damage such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. LVEF &lt;40% or deterioration of LVEF during exercise test on MUGA or echocardiogram&#xD;

&#xD;
               6. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Liver cirrhosis, transaminases &gt;3x of normal limits or bilirubin &gt;2.0 unless due&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. HIV positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or any other illness that in the opinion of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Positive pregnancy test, inability or unable to pursue effective means of birth&#xD;
             control, failure to willingly accept or comprehend irreversible sterility as a side&#xD;
             effect of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Psychiatric illness or mental deficiency making compliance with treatment or informed&#xD;
