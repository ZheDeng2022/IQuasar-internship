  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the skeletal deficits and risk factors for&#xD;
      impaired skeletal development in children requiring glucocorticoid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the bone health of children treated with prednisone for nephrotic syndrome&#xD;
      (NS with those treated with prednisone for Crohn's Disease (CD). Childhood NS usually&#xD;
      responds to prednisone and is not characterized by pathologies that can impact on bone. In&#xD;
      contrast, CD is treated with prednisone, but is independently associated with poor growth and&#xD;
      maturation, nutritional deficiencies and inflammation. Due to the differences in the&#xD;
      diseases, this comparison will allow us to distinguish between the prednisone-related and&#xD;
      disease-related effects on bone in the two disease states.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prednisone, a glucocorticoid medication, is widely used for many pediatric disorders. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that this drug decreases bone formation, decreasing bone density and bone&#xD;
      thickness in children. Prednisone induced osteopenia, or low bone density, can be worsened by&#xD;
      the effects of the underlying disease, such as delayed growth and maturation, malnutrition,&#xD;
      and increased bone resorption (removal) by inflammatory compounds. The combined effects of&#xD;
      decreased bone formation and increased resorption may be particularly detrimental to the&#xD;
      growing skeleton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will include 15 newly diagnosed NS patients, 60 patients with pre-existing NS, 90&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed CD, 45 patients diagnosed within the last two years and 200&#xD;
      healthy controls of similar age, gender and ethnicity. Participants will visit the Children's&#xD;
      Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) three times over a 12-month period for assessment of bone&#xD;
      mineralization and turnover, fracture history, dietary calcium intake, physical activity,&#xD;
      growth, body composition, muscle strength and glucocorticoid exposure.&#xD;
