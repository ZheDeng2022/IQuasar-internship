  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study being performed in women completing front-line treatment&#xD;
      for breast or ovarian cancer. It is being done to evaluate whether or not an herbal&#xD;
      combination known as Essiac (ESIAK) can improve the overall quality of life in these women as&#xD;
      they transition from active treatment to follow-up, also known as the quality of life in&#xD;
      transition. This information will be used to design a larger randomized trial.&#xD;

      Complementary and Alternative medical (CAM) practices are &quot;healthcare practices outside the&#xD;
      realm of conventional medicine, which are yet to be validated using scientific methods&quot;. It&#xD;
      encompasses a wide variety of behavioral (meditation, and spiritual practices) and clinical&#xD;
      (herbal, acupuncture, and massage) techniques. Patients with chronic diseases including&#xD;
      cancer tend to be very interested in these treatments and research involving CAM and their&#xD;
      ability to improve quality of life are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women transitioning from active treatment for breast or ovarian cancer to surveillance&#xD;
      (QOL-T) can experience physical and psychological distress, related to both treatment&#xD;
      (fatigue, alopecia, and menopausal symptoms), and the diagnosis itself. Intervention during&#xD;
      the critical time of transition from active therapy to follow-up may help patients to adjust&#xD;
      to life after cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essiac has been documented to be a popular form of herbal treatment in patients with cancer.&#xD;
      Given its lack of reported side effects, we are interested in pursuing a formal evaluation of&#xD;
      a Essiac in capsule formulation (ESIAK) in women surviving breast or ovarian cancers to&#xD;
      evaluate its role in improving the overall quality of life following chemotherapy that often&#xD;
      accompanies the end of adjuvant therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  histologically documented diagnosis of infiltrating carcinoma of the breast or&#xD;
             epithelial ovarian cancer. Given the similar clinical course of patients with&#xD;
             fallopian tube and primary peritoneal carcinoma these patients will also be included&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure&#xD;
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn&#xD;
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an&#xD;
             acceptable method of birth control (ie, a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine&#xD;
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. If patients&#xD;
             become pregnant during the course of the study, they will not be allowed to continue&#xD;
             on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  age ≥ 18 year-old&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematopoietic function defined as: ANC ≥ 1500/mm3; Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3;&#xD;
             Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL.&#xD;

             (EOC/FT/PPC): patients must have completed front-line treatment within 3 months of&#xD;
             study entry and in a complete remission; Patients treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
             platinum-based chemotherapy prior to definitive surgery will be eligible; If serum&#xD;
             CA-125 was elevated at diagnosis, it must also have normalized by end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with breast cancer: patients must have completed adjuvant treatment with&#xD;
             chemotherapy and radiation therapy (if recommended) within three months of study entry&#xD;

             and radiation if recommended; Patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy will be eligible&#xD;

             hormonal therapy following chemotherapy will be eligible to participate. However,&#xD;
             patients placed on Tamoxifen or other hormonal agents in lieu of chemotherapy will not&#xD;
             be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
