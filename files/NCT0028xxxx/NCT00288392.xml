  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan compared&#xD;
      to placebo on the healing of chronic leg ulcers in diabetes patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Through its ability to activate tissue macrophages and counteract&#xD;
      diabetes-associated defects in macrophages, the soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan will promote the&#xD;
      healing of leg ulcers in diabetic patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes predisposes to ulceration of the foot through a variety of processes, including&#xD;
      neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease. Once the skin is broken, healing is frequently&#xD;
      delayed and the ulcer develops the biology of a chronic wound. The factors underlaying&#xD;
      delayed healing in chronic wounds are not well understood but include the effects of repeated&#xD;
      trauma, tissue ischemia, infection, defective white cell function, altered immune processes,&#xD;
      and altered expression of tissue cytokines and enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management is based on regular cleansing and debridement, off-loading and treatment of&#xD;
      intercurrent infection with antibiotics. There are no interventions in routine use, which&#xD;
      target aspects of chronic wound biology directly.&#xD;
