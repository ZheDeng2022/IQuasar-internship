      The purpose of this continuation project is to use MRI to evaluate gapping of the&#xD;
      zygapophysial (Z) joints following side-posture positioning and side-posture spinal adjusting&#xD;
      in subjects with acute low back pain (LBP). A fundamental hypothesis of one of the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of chiropractic spinal adjusting is that adhesions, developing in the Z joints&#xD;
      following hypomobility of these structures, are thought to be alleviated by separation&#xD;
      (gapping) of the Z joints through spinal adjusting. In the previous study, side-posture&#xD;
      adjusting was found to gap the Z joints in healthy subjects. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if differences can be measured in the L4/L5 and L5/S1 Z joint spaces during&#xD;
      side-posture positioning and after lumbar side-posture spinal adjusting of 112 subjects with&#xD;
      acute LBP, and to determine if the amount of gapping is related to pain relief and improved&#xD;
      function. Before any treatment begins, the subjects will be temporarily randomized into one&#xD;
      of 4 MRI groups: 1) neutral positioning, followed by side-posture positioning (most painful&#xD;
      side up); 2) neutral positioning, followed by side-posture adjusting (most painful side up),&#xD;
      followed by neutral positioning; 3) neutral positioning, followed by side-posture adjusting&#xD;
      (most painful side up) and remaining in side-posture; and 4) (pure control group) neutral&#xD;
      positioning, followed by very brief side-posture positioning, followed by neutral&#xD;
      positioning. MRI scans will be taken with the subjects in the original neutral position and&#xD;
      in the final position. Both MRI scans will be conducted consecutively over approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes (12:19 minutes per scan). All spinal adjustments given during this appointment will&#xD;
      be performed directly on the MRI gantry table after the first scan. A second MRI appointment&#xD;
      will occur 2 weeks later, after 2 weeks of treatment. At the second MRI appointment, subjects&#xD;
      will be assigned to the MRI group opposite to the one to which they were randomized during&#xD;
      the first MRI appointment. Three observers, blinded to each other and to subject grouping,&#xD;
      will make anterior-to-posterior measurements (A-P gap) of the Z joints directly from the MRI&#xD;
      scans. The gapping difference between the second and first scans of each MRI appointment will&#xD;
      be analyzed to determine if differences exist between the 4 groups. Results of the first and&#xD;
      second MRI appointments will also be evaluated to determine if the amount of gapping is&#xD;
      related to pain (at first MRI appointment), relief of pain (at the second MRI appointment -&#xD;
      difference in Visual Analog Scale from initial exam to MRI appointment) and current (first&#xD;
      MRI appointment) and change in disability (second MRI appointment - difference in Bournemouth&#xD;
      Questionnaire scores). The results of this study will be used to increase understanding of&#xD;
      the mechanism of action of lumbar side posture adjusting and side-posture positioning in&#xD;
      acute LBP patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Twenty-one to 69 years of age (21 years to ensure fully developed Z joints and &lt;70&#xD;
             years to tolerate side posture MRI scans)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females equal to or less than 160 pounds; males equal to or less than 200 pounds. Hip&#xD;
             width measurement that is equal to or less than 36cm.(to ensure optimum MR image&#xD;
             quality)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pain related to the low back (lower lumbar region, L4/L5 and/or L5/S1 region -this&#xD;
             criterion will be determined by the examining physician through subjective complaint&#xD;
             and description, as well as objectively, using inspection, palpation, motion&#xD;
             assessment, and standard orthopedic and neurologic tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of LBP lasting for more than two weeks, or no more than 3 episodes of brief&#xD;
             back pain (1 - 2 weeks) in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of lumbar scoliosis of greater than 5 degrees (Cobb's angle) (due to&#xD;
             difficulty in imaging the Z joints)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of radiculopathy (This criterion will be evaluated by the examining physician&#xD;
             by using patient history, standard screening tests, and the results of a detailed&#xD;
             orthopedic/neurologic evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No pain related to L4/L5 and/or L5/S1 region (This criterion will be determined by the&#xD;
             examining physician through subjective complaint and description, as well as&#xD;
             objectively using inspection, palpation, motion assessment, and standard orthopedic&#xD;
             tests such as, Kemp's, Milgram's, Yeoman's, straight leg raise, and Valsalva&#xD;
             maneuver.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or currently breast feeding (for MRI, even though no known risk, and in the&#xD;
             event an x-ray is needed to screen for contraindications to manipulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intolerance to MRI procedures (including claustrophobia and inability to lie on one's&#xD;
             side for 15 minutes). This criterion can also be evaluated at any time throughout the&#xD;
             first two weeks of a subject's care. Claustrophobia will also be evaluated before and&#xD;
             during the first and second MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant pathology discovered on MRI scans. This criterion will be evaluated during&#xD;
             the first MRI visit, immediately after the first MRI scan is taken. (Such pathologies&#xD;
             constitute contraindications to chiropractic adjusting.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of acute low back pain&#xD;
