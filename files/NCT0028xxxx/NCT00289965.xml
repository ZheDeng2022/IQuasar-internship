    <textblock>
      This project is designed to compare college drinking interventions on outcomes and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. We plan to recruit 700 students with residence hall alcohol violations to&#xD;
      participate in a randomized study to evaluate 3 brief interventions: in-person brief&#xD;
      motivational intervention, Alcohol 101plus (an interactive CD-ROM program), and AlcoholEdu (a&#xD;
      Web-based tutorial). Participants will be followed over 12 months to determine changes in&#xD;
      alcohol consumption and related problems. We will also explore which participants might&#xD;
      respond better to one intervention vs the others.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Many college students engage in heavy episodic drinking, a pattern that increases risks of&#xD;
      undesired academic, social, health, and legal consequences. Fortunately, brief motivational&#xD;
      interventions - when administered during face-to-face sessions by a trained counselor - can&#xD;
      help students to reduce their heavy drinking and related consequences. However, use of such&#xD;
      counselor-administered interventions on college campuses remains infrequent; instead,&#xD;
      administrators rely on computerized brief interventions because they can be administered with&#xD;
      fewer staff at lower cost. Two computer-administered interventions (AlcoholEdu and Alcohol&#xD;
      101 Plus) are used by more than 1,000 colleges and universities nationwide, even though these&#xD;
      interventions have not been evaluated in controlled studies. Despite the magnitude of the&#xD;
      college-drinking problem, no data have addressed the differential efficacy (or&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness) of the computer-administered versus counselor-administered brief&#xD;
      motivational interventions. Thus, the primary purpose of the proposed research is to address&#xD;
      gaps in the scientific literature by evaluating outcomes of three types of brief motivational&#xD;
      interventions: a theoretically-based and empirically-tested counselor-administered&#xD;
      intervention and the two most popular computerized interventions. A secondary purpose of the&#xD;
      proposed research is to identify predictors of outcomes, and moderators associated with&#xD;
      differential intervention response. A tertiary purpose is to assess the cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      three types of brief motivational interventions. The proposed research will be a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with four treatment conditions and four assessment occasions. We will&#xD;
      recruit at-risk student drinkers who have been sanctioned to receive an alcohol education&#xD;
      intervention because they violated a residence hall policy. These referred students will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the three interventions, or to a delayed intervention control; and&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and again 1, 6, and 12 months later on key drinking and drinking&#xD;
      consequences outcomes.&#xD;
