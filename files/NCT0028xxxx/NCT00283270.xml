      The aim of the study is to test whether screening followed by brief problem-solving&#xD;
      counselling in primary care could improve the quality of life of elderly patients with&#xD;
      undiagnosed psychological problems. We hypothesize that undiagnosed psychological problems&#xD;
      detectable by screening are common in the elderly and brief counselling could improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of these patients.&#xD;

      Objectives: The aim of the study is to test if screening followed by brief problem-solving&#xD;
      counselling by primary care doctors can improve the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of&#xD;
      elderly patients with previously undiagnosed psychological problems. It will also find out&#xD;
      the effects of undiagnosed psychological problems on HRQOL and consultation rates of elderly&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, Setting &amp; Subjects: This is a prospective single-blinded randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      on 450 patients aged 60 or above attending a Government General Outpatient Clinic in Hong&#xD;
      Kong, who have been screened for psychological problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Elderly patients attending the General Outpatient Department of the Ap Lei Chau&#xD;
      Clinic who are not known to have the diagnosis of psychological problems with the Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale (HADS) were screened in order to recruit 300 subjects who are&#xD;
      screened positive for undiagnosed psychological problems will be randomised into the&#xD;
      counselling or no-counselling groups, and 150 subjects who are screened negative for&#xD;
      psychological problems will be selected as normal controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: The counselling group will receive brief problem-solving counselling from a&#xD;
      trained primary care doctor in addition to their usual medical care; the no-counselling group&#xD;
      will receive general health education and their usual medical care; and the normal control&#xD;
      group will continue with their usual care only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: Health-related quality of life measured by the SF-36, the HADS scores&#xD;
      and consultation rates. The baseline and changes in outcomes of the three groups will be&#xD;
      compared at 0, 6, 12, 36 and 52 weeks after screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: The results will provide evidence on whether screening followed by brief&#xD;
      problem-solving counselling in primary care is effective in improving quality of life and&#xD;
      reducing consultation rates for the elderly with undiagnosed psychological problems.&#xD;
