      This research study is done to find out if genetic make up of a person plays a role in&#xD;
      complications and recovery after the Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As you may be aware, the DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is a chemical in our body that carries&#xD;
      the genetic information. There are common but very small variations (polymorphisms) that&#xD;
      occur in DNA. We would like to find out if these common variations put a person at increased&#xD;
      risk for developing complications- especially rapid irregular heart beat after the CABG&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;

      Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation has been shown to increase the length of hospital stay;&#xD;
      markedly increase cost and potentially increases the incidence of post-operative stroke.&#xD;
      Nationally, postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of cardiac&#xD;
      surgery, occurring in 25% to 40% of patients and total costs of billions of dollars per year&#xD;
      to treat At University of Pittsburgh Presbyterian University Hospital, over the past few&#xD;
      years, our patients experience AF in the postoperative period at an average rate of 30% -40%.&#xD;
      The incidence of postoperative AF increases with the age of the patient. The average age of&#xD;
      the patient that undergoes CABG surgery has been on the increase due to the improved&#xD;
      longevity of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery bypass grafting is associated with systemic inflammatory response. There have&#xD;
      been studies performed to assess the relationship of genetic polymorphisms that could affect&#xD;
      the expression of cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). Interleukin 6 is a pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine and major mediator of acute phase response. The correlation between the -174 G/C&#xD;
      polymorphism and the high production of IL-6 has enabled some investigators to anticipate and&#xD;
      treat the patients prophylactically to reduce the IL-6 levels. 8&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that inflammation can have a role in the development of atrial&#xD;
      arrhythmias after cardiac surgery and that genetic predisposition to develop postoperative&#xD;
      complications exists. There have been studies performed in Europe to ascertain this&#xD;
      association and it has been found that the -174G/C Interleukin-6 promoter gene variant&#xD;
      appears to modulate the inflammatory response to surgery and to influence the development of&#xD;
      postoperative AF. These data suggest an inflammatory component of postoperative atrial&#xD;
      arrhythmias and a genetic predisposition to this complication , this polymorphism has also&#xD;
      been correlated with the development of postoperative renal and pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will have a single blood sample of 6 ml drawn prior to their CABG surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any personal identifiers on the blood sample tube will be removed and code numbers specific&#xD;
      for this research study will be affixed on to the samples by the research coordinator before&#xD;
      the samples are sent to the Genomics laboratory for analyses.&#xD;
