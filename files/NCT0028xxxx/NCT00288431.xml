      This study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      Oral AP23573 in combination with Doxorubicin&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AP23573 in&#xD;
      combination with doxorubicin, to characterize the safety profile of AP23573 in combination&#xD;
      with doxorubicin, and to examine the pharmacokinetics of AP23573 and doxorubicin when given&#xD;
      in combination to patients with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
