      Patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma will undergo transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolisation (TACE) as clinically indicated and will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      bevacizumab or placebo every 2 weeks up to 1 year. Tumor response will be assessed using MR&#xD;
      of the liver and PET-scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be tested whether the addition of bevacizumab as angiogenic inhibitor will slow down&#xD;
      tumor progression, reduce the need for re-embolisation and will improve patient survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TACE is an established therapy for patients with advanced stage HCC not amenable to liver&#xD;
      transplantation or resection and has been shown to significantly improve survival in these&#xD;
      patients compared to no treatment (8). TACE takes advantage of the predominantly arterial&#xD;
      blood supply of malignant liver tumors contrary to the surrounding normal liver tissue, which&#xD;
      receives more blood supply through the portal venous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TACE leads to predictable tumor necrosis until new blood vessels grow into the tumor margins&#xD;
      to support tumor growth. Quite often after cutting off the blood supply through the hepatic&#xD;
      artery, the tumor induces active angiogenesis to promote collateral blood vessel growth from&#xD;
      liver capsule arteries or collaterals from the gastroduodenal artery. VEGF seems to be an&#xD;
      important player in inducing this angiogenetic activity and tumor control and survival of&#xD;
      patients after TACE have been linked to serum VEGF-levels with higher levels showing reduced&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibition of these neoangiogenetic activity could lead to significantly improved in tumor&#xD;
      control and survival in patients with advanced stage HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. STUDY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the effectiveness of bevacizumab in combination with TACE as measured by&#xD;
           patients without tumor progression on MRT after 3 cycles of TACE as well as the number&#xD;
           of TACE cycles applied for recurrent tumor after a maximum of one year treatment with&#xD;
           bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess collateral tumor vessel growth on MRT / CT&#xD;
