  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently there has been an increased awareness in the need for adequate sedation and pain&#xD;
      control for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Fentanyl is an opioid commonly used&#xD;
      in Pediatric ICU patients to decrease pain and increase sedation. Although opioids (e.g.&#xD;
      morphine and fentanyl) provide excellent pain relief, they have many side effects including&#xD;
      dependence, tolerance and withdrawal. These side effects lead to increased doses in order to&#xD;
      maintain pain control and/or sedation. There have been a few adult studies pointing to some&#xD;
      possible treatments. For example, giving low dose naloxone along with opioids. Adult studies&#xD;
      show that this combination not only decreases the frequency of opioid side effects, but also&#xD;
      improves pain control and prevents the development of tolerance. We propose that children who&#xD;
      receive low dose naloxone infusions along with fentanyl infusions will demonstrate: 1)&#xD;
      decreased total daily doses of Fentanyl, 2) decreased frequency of withdrawal and 3)&#xD;
      increased pain and sedation control. In this randomized, blinded prospective trial we will&#xD;
      enroll 168 Pediatric ICU patients. Patients will receive either low dose naloxone or placebo&#xD;
      simultaneously with their fentanyl infusion. Pain and sedation will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Modified Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MMAAS). The fentanyl infusion will be increased to&#xD;
      provide adequate pain control and/or sedation. Naloxone infusion will not be adjusted.&#xD;
      Approximately 48 hours prior to removal from the ventilator, patients will have their&#xD;
      fentanyl infusions decreased while being monitored for withdrawal. Patients showing signs of&#xD;
      withdrawal will receive methadone, an opioid taken by mouth. Once off fentanyl, naloxone will&#xD;
      be stopped. Patients will continue to be monitored for withdrawal for 4 days or until ICU&#xD;
      discharge. If this study works, patients who receive low dose naloxone along with opioid&#xD;
      infusions will have less tolerance and dependence and demonstrate less withdrawal. This may&#xD;
      cause shorter Intensive Care Unit stays.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if Naloxone administration to pediatric ICU patients on Fentanyl infusions&#xD;
      require less Fentanyl compared to control patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recent years there has been an increased awareness of the need for adequate sedation&#xD;
      and analgesia of critically ill pediatric patients. The choices of the treatment of pain are&#xD;
      numerous, but in the Pediatric ICU parenteral opioids are most commonly used. At equipotent&#xD;
      doses, all mu agonist opioids (Morphine, Fentanyl, Meperidine and Codeine) produce similar&#xD;
      physiologic effects and side effects. Opioids can cause hypoventilation, hypotension,&#xD;
      constipation and cause urinary retention. Patients receiving continuous opioid infusions&#xD;
      experience not only these physiologic side effects, but also the side effects of dependence,&#xD;
      tolerance and withdrawal. These last side effects complicate medical issues and contribute to&#xD;
      longer ICU admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anand wrote a review article addressing the problems of drug dependence and withdrawal in the&#xD;
      PICU. In his article he discussed the mechanisms, pharmacology and presentation of opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal. He also discussed prevention of opioid withdrawal including such therapies as the&#xD;
      concomitant infusion of opioid agonists and low dose Naloxone. Tobias also wrote a review&#xD;
      article describing the consequences of the prolonged use of sedative and analgesic agents in&#xD;
      the Pediatric ICU. Among the problems of note are tolerance, dependence and withdrawal in the&#xD;
      Pediatric ICU. He discussed several possible therapies for the treatment and prevention of&#xD;
      opioid withdrawal. Among these was the concomitant infusion of opioid agonist and low dose&#xD;
      Naloxone, an opioid agonist. Naloxone selectively blocks those opioid receptors that are&#xD;
      coupled with stimulatory G proteins, thus blocking mechanisms for super-activation of the&#xD;
      cAMP pathway. This improves the efficacy of analgesia and prevents the development of acute&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent preclinical and clinical studies (Crain, Gan, Levine, Joshi) have shown that&#xD;
      co-treatments with extremely low doses of opioid receptor antagonists can markedly enhance&#xD;
      the efficacy specific to Morphine and related analgesics. Crain did studies using Naloxone,&#xD;
      in-vitro and in-vivo, that show direct competitive antagonism of Gs coupled excitatory opioid&#xD;
      receptor functions. This markedly enhances Morphine's antinociceptive potency and&#xD;
      simultaneously attenuates opioid tolerance and dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies by Gan and Levine with adult post-op hysterectomy patients in one study and adult&#xD;
      patients following tooth extraction in a separate study show that low dose Naloxone could&#xD;
      enhance the analgesic potency of opioid agonists. The striking consistency of these studies&#xD;
      provides evidence that clinical treatment of pain can be improved by administering opioid&#xD;
      analgesics together with low doses of excitatory opioid receptor antagonists. The possibility&#xD;
      of these same effects occurring in Pediatric ICU patients has not been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children admitted to the Pediatric ICU requiring continuous infusions of opioids who receive&#xD;
      low dose Naloxone infusions will have a 30% decrease in the maximum total daily dose of&#xD;
      Fentanyl and a decreased need for escalating doses of continuous infusions during ICU&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled study. Patients&#xD;
      admitted to the ICU and consented for the study will be started on either Naloxone continuous&#xD;
      infusion of 0.25micrograms/kilogram/hour (mcg/kg/hr) or normal saline continuous infusion at&#xD;
      equal rate and volume to be determined by the pharmacy. The dose or rate of Naloxone infusion&#xD;
      will not be manipulated throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first four hours of ICU admission the patients will be assessed hourly via the&#xD;
      Modified Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MMAAS, see appendix 1). Adjustments will be made to&#xD;
      Fentanyl and Midazolam infusions according to protocol for patients not achieving a sedation&#xD;
      score of -1 to +1 (see figure 1). Patients with score of greater than +1 and associated&#xD;
      tachycardia/hypertension will receive a bolus of Fentanyl and repeat MMAAS in 30 minutes. The&#xD;
      Fentanyl bolus will be equal to one hour total dose of Fentanyl infusion with considerations&#xD;
      for weight. Dosage will be adjusted for weight accordingly: 1mcg/kg for children less than&#xD;
      50kg and 0.5mcg/kg for children greater than 50kg. If repeat MMAAS score is again greater&#xD;
      than +1 with hypertension/tachycardia the patient will receive another bolus of Fentanyl&#xD;
      (dose as denoted above) and will have increase of Fentanyl infusion by 1mcg/kg/hr. The&#xD;
      patient will have repeat MMAAS 30 minutes after change. If repeat MMAAS score still greater&#xD;
      than +1 a physician will be called for assessment and intervention. If the first repeat MMAAS&#xD;
      score is greater than +1 with no hypertension/tachycardia the patient will receive a bolus of&#xD;
      Midazolam. The Midazolam bolus will be either equal to one hour total dose of Midazolam&#xD;
      infusion or 0.1mg/kg with considerations for weight. Dosage will be adjusted according for&#xD;
      weight: 0.1mg/kg for children less than 20kg or 0.05mg/kg for children greater than 20kg. The&#xD;
      patient will have repeat MMAAS in 30 minutes. If second MMAAS score still greater than +1 a&#xD;
      physician will be called for assessment and intervention. If MMAAS score at any time between&#xD;
      +1 and -1 then repeat MMAAS will be repeated at next scheduled time per protocol (see figure&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients require an increase of more than 2 mcg/kg/hr within 3 hours, then the patient&#xD;
      will have Midazolam either started or increased. Dosage will be 0.1 mg/kg/hr for children&#xD;
      less than 20kg and 0.05 mg/kg/hr for children over 20kg for starting Midazolam. Dosage for&#xD;
      increase in current infusion will be 0.1mg/kg/hr for children less than 20kg and 0.05mg/kg/hr&#xD;
      for children over 20kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed hourly, using the MMAAS, for the first four hours of admission to&#xD;
      the study and then every 2 hours for the subsequent 8 hours. After this initial time period&#xD;
      patients will be assessed every 4 hours until completion of the study. Each assessment will&#xD;
      consist of recording the sedation score, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      ventilator set rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, infusion rate of Fentanyl and/or&#xD;
      Midazolam and the need for any intervention and what that intervention included. Patients&#xD;
      with signs of increased pain/discomfort will be assessed using the sedation scale as needed&#xD;
      between scheduled assessments. Interventions will be made per protocol as needed between&#xD;
      scheduled assessments. Once pt MMAAS score between +1 and -1 the patient will resume&#xD;
      scheduled MMAAS evaluations according to protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has a sedation score of &lt;-1 on MMAAS, among any of the scheduled or&#xD;
      intermittent assessments, the Midazolam infusion will be decreased by 0.05 mg/kg/hr and the&#xD;
      patient will be reassessed in two hours. If there is no Midazolam infusion then, the Fentanyl&#xD;
      infusion will be decreased by 0.5mcg/kg/hr and the patient will be reassessed in two hours.&#xD;
      If the patient continues to have pain score of &lt;-1 on repeat MMAAS then the Fentanyl or&#xD;
      Midazolam continuous infusion will again be decreased as denoted above. The patient will&#xD;
      again be reassessed in two hours. If the patient continues to have MMAAS score of &lt;-1 a&#xD;
      physician will be notified for assessment and intervention. If repeat MMAAS score &gt;+1 then&#xD;
      Fentanyl infusion will be increased and noted above and the patient will be reassessed in 30&#xD;
      min. If second repeat MMAAS not between +1 and -1 then a physician will be notified for&#xD;
      assessment and intervention. If at any time MMAAS score between +1 and -1 then MMAAS will be&#xD;
      repeated per protocol. If following first decrease in infusion and repeat MMAAS score &gt;+1&#xD;
      then infusion previous adjusted will be increased to prior dose. The patient will be&#xD;
      reassessed in 30 minutes. If repeat MMAAS score &gt;+1 with hypertension/tachycardia then&#xD;
      Fentanyl infusion will be increased as noted above. If MMAAS score &gt;+1 and not&#xD;
      hypertension/tachycardia then Midazolam infusion will be increases as noted above. After&#xD;
      intervention MMAAS will be repeated in 30 minutes. If repeat MMAAS score remains &gt;+1 then a&#xD;
      physician will be notified for assessment and intervention (see figure 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the patients approach 48-72 hours near the end of the need for continuous infusion or&#xD;
      opioid, per decision by the medical staff, they will be weaned from infusions. The Naloxone&#xD;
      infusion will remain unchanged. The Naloxone infusion or normal saline infusion will be&#xD;
      discontinued when the Fentanyl infusion is discontinued. The Fentanyl infusions will be&#xD;
      decreased by 25% of original dose every 12 hours until off. Once patients start the Fentanyl&#xD;
      wean they will have withdrawal assessed every six hours and as needed using the Modified&#xD;
      Narcotic Withdrawal Scale (MNAS, see appendix 2). Patients receiving two successive scores of&#xD;
      8 or above will be determined to have withdrawal. These patients will be started on Methadone&#xD;
      as directed by the primary team and Fentanyl infusion will continue to be decreased by 25%&#xD;
      every 12 hours until off. As patients are weaned from continuous infusions they will continue&#xD;
      to have assessments every 6 hours using MNAS until infusions are discontinued. Once the&#xD;
      continuous infusion of Fentanyl is discontinued the patient information will continue to be&#xD;
      monitored using MNAS and vital signs stated earlier for 4 days or until ICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any need for reinstitution of continuous infusion of Fentanyl and the medical reason for such&#xD;
      action will be noted. Increases in oral agents after receiving the first four doses will be&#xD;
      noted. The need for intermittent boluses of IV analgesia or sedation during the weaning and&#xD;
      associated medical reasons will be noted. These things will be monitored for the duration of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may receive bolus of any medication as ordered by physicians for procedures without&#xD;
      interfering with the study. Notation of such action will be made with next assessment. If at&#xD;
      any time a physician deems it necessary to begin a medication not classified as an opioid or&#xD;
      benzodiazepine the patient will be removed from the study. If at any time a physician begins&#xD;
      a scheduled dose of an additional opioid or benzodiazepine to total more than one of each&#xD;
      class the patient will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (nausea, vomiting, sweating, tachycardia, increased blood pressure,&#xD;
      tremulousness, seizures and cardiac arrest) will be noted in the medical record. If medical&#xD;
      reasons for such events are ruled out then the patient will be unblinded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis An SPSS software random number generator was used to create a permuted&#xD;
      block randomization schedule. Patient assignment was unknown to all investigators and medical&#xD;
      team members, with the exception of the PICU pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis was based upon an assumed power of 80%, an effect size of 30% reduction in&#xD;
      maximum cumulative daily dose of fentanyl, and historical data for maximum daily fentanyl&#xD;
      dosing in the PICU at Children's Medical Center Dallas (Between January and August 2002, the&#xD;
      cumulative maximum daily fentanyl dose of 428 PICU patients was 79 mcg/kg with a standard&#xD;
      deviation of ± 47 mcg/kg). Thus, the sample size was determined to be 62 per group (total&#xD;
      N=124). The alpha criterion for significance was considered 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parametric and nonparametric data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows and Microsoft&#xD;
      Excel software packages. Interim monitoring at the midpoint of the study was performed by an&#xD;
      independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which consisted of both internal and&#xD;
      external reviewers. O'Brien-Fleming stopping boundaries and Lan-DeMets spending functions&#xD;
      were employed in the analysis.&#xD;
