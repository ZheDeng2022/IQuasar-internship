      The purpose of this study is to find out how, why, and when Rift Valley Fever (RVF) spreads.&#xD;
      Participants will be 250 adults and children, aged 1 year and older, from the Ijara District,&#xD;
      Kenya. They will be given a questionnaire, undergo a medical examination that includes an eye&#xD;
      exam, and have a 1-teaspoon sample of blood taken from a vein. Participation will take about&#xD;
      3 hours.&#xD;

      The objective of this research is to better define the extent and timing of Rift Valley Fever&#xD;
      (RVF) virus transmission and its related chronic disease/infection attack rate, during an&#xD;
      interepidemic period in a high-risk region that has seen repeated RVF outbreaks. The results&#xD;
      will be used to develop and refine predictive algorithms for RVF Virus transmission, based on&#xD;
      epidemiological, environmental, and remote sensing data, with the ultimate goal of providing&#xD;
      improved early detection of significant RVF outbreaks. It is expected that the analysis of&#xD;
      test-performance characteristics will determine the best use of serologic assays in Kenya's&#xD;
      next RVF epizootic/epidemic. The primary outcome measure will be the current RVF-specific&#xD;
      seropositivity profile for a cross-sectional survey population in Ijara District in northeast&#xD;
      Kenya. The secondary outcome measures to be studied will be: 1) an assessment of the&#xD;
      behavioral factors associated with risk of seropositivity (previous infection) in the study&#xD;
      population; and 2) the association of selected long-term ophthalmological and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes with seropositivity. The study design for this protocol involves questionnaire&#xD;
      administration to consenting participants of Ijara District, followed by performance of&#xD;
      medical exams, ophthalmologic exams, and phlebotomy on all participants. ELISA testing for&#xD;
      RVF will then be performed on the blood samples obtained, and all ELISA screen-positive&#xD;
      samples will have confirmatory testing by plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody testing.&#xD;
