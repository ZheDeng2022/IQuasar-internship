      RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Giving imatinib mesylate together with gemcitabine may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate together with gemcitabine and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate and gemcitabine hydrochloride&#xD;
           in patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the 6-month and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate response with expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PDGF&#xD;
           receptor in tumor tissue from patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-14 and gemcitabine&#xD;
           hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8*. Treatment repeats every 21 days for&#xD;
           up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the&#xD;
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 5 or 3 of 5 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *The first cohort receives gemcitabine hydrochloride on days 1, 8, and 15&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients receive imatinib mesylate and gemcitabine hydrochloride at the MTD&#xD;
           determined in phase I in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
