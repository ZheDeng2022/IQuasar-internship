  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to test the safety and efficacy of up to 3 pancreatic alloislet&#xD;
      transplants in type 1 diabetic patients with hypoglycemia unawareness. 6 subjects were&#xD;
      transplanted under this protocol using anti-thymocyte globulin induction immunosuppression&#xD;
      and everolimus with cyclosporine maintenance immunosuppression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of sequential islet&#xD;
      allotransplantation for the reestablishment of stable glycemic control in type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      recipients. A total of 6 patients with type 1 diabetes have received up to three transplants&#xD;
      of islets from different donor pancreases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential candidates for islet allotransplantation included patients age 18 and older with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. Induction immunotherapy for the first transplant consisted of anti-thymocyte&#xD;
      globulin; basiliximab was used for any subsequent transplants. Peritransplant&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory treatment with etanercept was given for each islet transplant. Maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppression is with cyclosporine and RAD. It is felt that those patients in whom&#xD;
      metabolic lability/instability, reduced awareness of hypoglycemia, poor glycemic control, and&#xD;
      progressive secondary complications persist despite continued and intensive efforts made in&#xD;
      close cooperation with their diabetes care team are particularly likely to have a favorable&#xD;
      benefit/risk ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events, irrespective of their presumed relationship to the transplantation of&#xD;
      allogeneic islets and/or protocol-regulated treatment products (concomitant therapy), are&#xD;
      being monitored and recorded throughout the first year after the final islet transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of single and sequential donor islet allograft recipients with full (insulin&#xD;
      independence and HbA1c &lt;7%) and partial (insulin dependence, basal or arginine-stimulated&#xD;
      C-peptide levels of greater or equal to 0.5 ng/mL and HbA1c &lt;7%) islet graft function at one&#xD;
      year after the final islet transplant will be assessed. The impact of islet transplantation&#xD;
      on quality of life will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predictive value for posttransplant insulin independence of factors such as insulin&#xD;
      resistance before and at intervals after pancreatectomy, cellular composition of the&#xD;
      transplant, number of beta cells transplanted; and viability and insulin secretory response&#xD;
      of isolated islets are being assessed.&#xD;
