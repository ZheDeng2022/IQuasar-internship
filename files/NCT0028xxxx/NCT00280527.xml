  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that a vast majority of patients seeking a bariatric surgery weight reduction&#xD;
      procedure have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), while a smaller subset of patients&#xD;
      within this group have a more serious liver problem known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis&#xD;
      (NASH). NASH is a serious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and&#xD;
      ultimately liver transplantation. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery on the progression of NASH. The investigators also hope to gain insight&#xD;
      into which genes may be responsible for the development of NAFLD and NASH. The knowledge&#xD;
      gained from this study will advance the field of fatty liver disease and help design rational&#xD;
      treatments to prevent disease progression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of abnormal liver tests in&#xD;
      the United States. NAFLD is often found in association with obesity and diabetes and it is&#xD;
      expected to become increasingly prevalent as the incidence of diabetes and obesity continues&#xD;
      to increase. NAFLD represents a range of diseases from simple fatty deposition in the liver&#xD;
      to more aggressive inflammation and fibrosis, termed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The&#xD;
      distinction of NASH as an entity within NAFLD is an important one, as the natural history of&#xD;
      this disease is different. Ultimately, NASH may progress to cirrhosis in up to 25% of&#xD;
      patients, compared to simple steatosis which is a benign condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAFLD has been estimated at 10-24% in various populations and is significantly higher in&#xD;
      obese populations (57.5-74%). NASH is a subset of NAFLD characterized by fatty change with&#xD;
      lobular inflammation, hepatocellular injury, progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. The&#xD;
      bariatric surgery population is an ideal cohort to study a large subset of NASH; those with&#xD;
      morbid obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine variability of hepatic histology as well as&#xD;
      expression of key metabolic genes in NAFLD/NASH patients undergoing bariatric surgery.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo pre-operative laboratory testing, followed by intra-operative liver and&#xD;
      fat biopsies. A 12-month follow up will consist of repeat liver biopsy and laboratory&#xD;
      testing. We predict that histologic variability of inflammation and fibrosis in NASH is&#xD;
      accompanied by differential gene expression. Furthermore, if this variability is pronounced,&#xD;
      this will temper the reliance on percutaneous liver biopsy in NASH as the &quot;gold standard&quot; and&#xD;
      further emphasize the need for global markers of disease progression.&#xD;

        This will be a prospective trial of obese patients with presumed NAFLD undergoing bariatric&#xD;
        surgery. Patients will be enrolled at Northwestern Memorial Hospital through the bariatric&#xD;
        surgery clinic.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patient shows understanding of the risks and benefits of surgery and understands&#xD;
             lifestyle changes subsequent to the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Acceptable operative risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
