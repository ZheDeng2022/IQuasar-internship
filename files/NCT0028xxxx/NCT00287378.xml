  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ozone can cause acute airway inflammation in both asthmatics and normal volunteers. However,&#xD;
      in asthmatics ozone can cause episodes of worsening of asthma. We want to learn if chronic&#xD;
      allergic response, known as &quot;IgE-induced airway inflammation&quot; is what causes the increased&#xD;
      inflammation in response to ozone. To do this we will examine the response to ozone in a&#xD;
      group of asthmatics treated with omalizumab, a medicine available and approved for use in&#xD;
      people with asthma, or a placebo control. The placebo for this study is inert physiologic&#xD;
      saline (&quot;salt water&quot;) which contains no omalizumab. Both the omalizumab and the placebo will&#xD;
      be administered as an injection under the skin. Omalizumab, also called Xolair, is a&#xD;
      humanized monoclonal antibody, which means that it originally was produced in mice, then&#xD;
      genetically engineered to look more like human than mouse antibody. Omalizumab inactivates&#xD;
      IgE, a protein our own immune systems make as part of allergic reactions. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to test the hypothesis that omalizumab, by blocking this aspect of allergic&#xD;
      reactions, will decrease the number of inflammatory cells in the airway after ozone&#xD;
      challenge. We also hypothesize that omalizumab will decrease the effects of ozone on changes&#xD;
      in lung function, mucociliary clearance (a measure of how quickly mucus clears form the&#xD;
      airway) and airway reactivity. Airway reactivity is a measure of how sensitive the airways&#xD;
      are to a medication used to diagnose asthma, called methacholine. We will examine these as&#xD;
      additional information we can learn during the course of the study. This is a blinded study,&#xD;
      meaning that neither you nor the researchers know if you get the active drug or placebo, but&#xD;
      that information can be obtained if needed. The placebo is an injection of inert&#xD;
      physiological saline (&quot;salt water&quot;) which contains no omalizumab.&#xD;

      Dosages of ozone and omalizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ozone:The 0.4 ppm ozone exposures will be conducted in an ozone exposure chamber. Each&#xD;
      subject will be exposed to ozone for 2 hours. During exposures, subjects will perform four 15&#xD;
      minute bouts of moderate exercise (minute ventilation or VE = 30 40 L/min) on a treadmill,&#xD;
      each separated by 15 minutes of seated rest. Minute ventilation is measured for 2-3 minutes&#xD;
      after about 4 minutes of exercise during the first exercise period, and again at about 12&#xD;
      minutes of exercise. It is then measured at about 12 minutes into each exercise period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omalizumab: Dosing for omalizumab will be consistent with doses approved for use in moderate&#xD;
      or severe allergic asthma. The only exception to its indicated use is that we will be&#xD;
      examining its effect in mild (rather than moderate or severe) allergic asthmatics, a group we&#xD;
      have recruited for ozone challenge. IgE within the following ranges and body weights for&#xD;
      subcutaneous omalizumab dosing:&#xD;
