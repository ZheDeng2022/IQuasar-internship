      The specific aims for this study are -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of GH on height, height velocity, body weight and lean body&#xD;
           mass. This specific aim tests the hypothesis that GH significantly improves height,&#xD;
           height velocity, weight, weight velocity and lean body mass in chronically ill children&#xD;
           who have grown poorly despite adequate nutritional rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of GH on whole body protein turnover (WBPT), IGF-1 levels and on&#xD;
           cytokines. This specific aim tests the hypothesis that chronically ill children have&#xD;
           increased catabolism, caused by high levels of circulating cytokines and low levels of&#xD;
           IGF-1, and that these abnormalities improve with GH treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of bone mineral density and bone turnover. This specific aim tests the&#xD;
           hypothesis that bone density is low in chronically ill children secondary to increased&#xD;
           osteoclast activity correlating with elevated cytokine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the anabolic effects of growth hormone (GH) will improve the height and&#xD;
      weight of chronically ill children who have failed to grow despite receiving adequate&#xD;
      nutrition via gastrostomy tube or oral supplementation.&#xD;

      We will test our hypotheses by using a pilot study, in which we will recruit 18 chronically&#xD;
      ill children from our clinical practice. We will obtain medical records for each patient 12&#xD;
      months prior to starting the study. Those patients without pre-study medical records will be&#xD;
      studied for 12 months prior to starting GH. If we can obtain 6 months of prior medical&#xD;
      records, then the patients will be studied for 6 months before starting GH. Anything less&#xD;
      than 6 months will be studied for the full 12 months prior to starting GH. Patients will&#xD;
      receive treatment with GH (0.3 mg/kg/wk) for 12 months and their growth will be compared to&#xD;
      the year before treatment. All subjects will be followed every three months for the entire&#xD;
      study. We will measure height and weight using a standardized stadiometer and scale,&#xD;
      respectively, every three months during the study. From these measurements we will calculate&#xD;
      height and weight velocity and height and weight Z score. Lean body mass (LBM) will be&#xD;
      measured by DEXA every six months. Utilizing the stable isotope 1-[13C] leucine, we will&#xD;
      measure whole body protein turnover (WBPT). Measurements of WBPT will be correlated with LBM&#xD;
      and changes in height and weight velocity. This data will be compared to that from age&#xD;
      matched normal children (archival data maintained by the PI). We will measure IGF-1 and the&#xD;
      cytokines TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL 10 at baseline and very six months. We will evaluate GH effects&#xD;
      on these levels.&#xD;
