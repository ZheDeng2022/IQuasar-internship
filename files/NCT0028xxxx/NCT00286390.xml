  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to conduct a scientifically rigorous investigation of the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, quality of life, and cost associated with the delivery of acupuncture in&#xD;
      the treatment of acute and chronic pain in patients at Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews&#xD;
      Air Force Base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gather outcomes and patient satisfaction data on patients receiving acupuncture&#xD;
           treatment for acute and chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform an analysis of costs, including any system cost savings, associated with&#xD;
           providing acupuncture services to pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serve as a model to expand the project to Scott AFB and Travis AFB as per the request of&#xD;
           the Air Mobility Command Surgeon General. (AMC/SG).&#xD;

      Adult patients referred to the MGMC Acupuncture Clinic for this study must have an&#xD;
      established Western medical diagnosis, have exhausted all standards of care for the reduction&#xD;
      and/or resolution of pain, meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and be clinically&#xD;
      evaluated prior to entry in the study. 1000 patients will be entered into the study; no male&#xD;
      and female patient ratios will be required. Patients under 18 years of age will be excluded.&#xD;
      There are no upper age limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture point(s) selection and acupuncture techniques will be individualized for each&#xD;
      patient. All treatments will be approved by the physician principal investigator. Treatment&#xD;
      will generally be administered with the patient either prone, supine, or seated position.&#xD;
      Standards of reporting interventions in controlled trials of acupuncture, based on STRICTA&#xD;
      requirements, will be followed. The following acupuncture data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acupuncture point locations (palpation or electronic detection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Techniques employed: (e.g. dry needling, acupuncture, electro-acupuncture ,&#xD;
           auriculotherapy, electro-auriculotherapy, laser, piezo-electrical stimulation&#xD;
           micro-current techniques, E-field)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Types of needles employed (e.g. ASP gold/stainless steel, needle tacks, Seirin needles,&#xD;
           etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline demographic data and information on pain levels (using the Numerical Rating Scale),&#xD;
      patient satisfaction (using the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire), functional health status&#xD;
      (using the SF-8), and concomitant medical care (including medication use) will be collected&#xD;
      prior to treatment. Follow-up data on pain levels and concomitant medical care will be&#xD;
      collected via telephone 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post-therapy. Patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and functional health status data will be collecetd again at 4 weeks&#xD;
      post-treatment. Relapses of pain will be noted and appropriately evaluated. In addition, the&#xD;
      following clinical data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Treatment(SOAP) parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Range of motion&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cost analysis will be performed by comparing patients who seek acupuncture treatment to&#xD;
      those who receive only conventional medical care during the same time period, by matching&#xD;
      cohorts based on ICD-9 diagnostic codes and basic demographic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of appropriate parametric and nonparametric tests will be performed to look for&#xD;
      pre-post differences in patient outcomes on a number of relevant baseline variables;&#xD;
      including demographic information, intensity and duration of pain, SF-8 scores, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, and utilization of concomitant medical services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ancillary study will be conducted to investigate personality factors and pretreatment&#xD;
      expectations as predictors of treatment outcome of medical acupuncture. Specific Aims of this&#xD;
      ancillary study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess perceived health outcomes after acupuncture treatment by military medical&#xD;
           acupuncturists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify psychosocial and demographic predictors of perceived health outcomes from&#xD;
           acupuncture treatment by military medical acupuncturists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To help clarify which patients are more likely to respond to acupuncture and hence more&#xD;
           likely to benefit from a referral to a trained medical acupuncturist.&#xD;
