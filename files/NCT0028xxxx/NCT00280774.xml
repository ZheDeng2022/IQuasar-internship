  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if patients on corticosteroids who are given&#xD;
      memantine will show improvement in memory compared to those receiving placebo (an inactive&#xD;
      substance). This research also seeks to determine if such patients, when given memantine,&#xD;
      will experience improvement in manic/hypomanic symptoms (feelings of agitation,&#xD;
      overexcitement, or hyperactivity) and/or depressive symptoms. Subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      a crossover trial of memantine and placebo for 8 weeks, followed by a 4 week washout and then&#xD;
      8 more weeks of the study medication. Memantine and placebo will start at 5 mg/day for one&#xD;
      week, increased to 5 mg twice a day in the second week. During the third week patients will&#xD;
      take 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the evening. At weeks 4-8, patients will take 10 mg&#xD;
      twice a day. One 8 week course of study medication will be memantine and the other 8 week&#xD;
      course of study medication will be placebo, both assigned in a random fashion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty (20) outpatients with pulmonary (e.g. asthma), rheumatic (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      dermatomyositis) illnesses or renal transplants (all populations we have used in prior&#xD;
      clinical trials) receiving a course of prednisone or other corticosteroid for at least 12&#xD;
      weeks will be enrolled. To participate, patients must be between the ages of 18 and 70 and&#xD;
      taking at least 5 mg/day of prednisone, or a prednisone equivalent, for at least 3 months and&#xD;
      with the expectation that they will be continuing such treatment at the same dose for at&#xD;
      least 20 additional weeks. At baseline, the research assistant or study doctor will ask&#xD;
      patients about their health, any prior corticosteroid therapy and other medications patients&#xD;
      may take for any health problems, medication allergies, and any surgical procedures or&#xD;
      cognitive impairments they may have. Patients will have memory tests and answer questions&#xD;
      about their mood, sleep, appetite, and daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomized to a crossover trial of memantine and placebo for 8 weeks&#xD;
      followed by a 4 week washout and then 8 more weeks of study drug. Memantine will be started&#xD;
      at 5 mg/day for 1 week, increased to 5 mg BID in the second week, 10 mg QAM and 5 mg QHS the&#xD;
      next week and to 10 mg BID in weeks 4-8 as directed in the package insert. One 8 week course&#xD;
      will be memantine and the other placebo assigned in a random fashion. Measures of memory will&#xD;
      be compared within subjects at baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12 (beginning of second course&#xD;
      of study drug), week 16 and week 20 (exit). At weeks 2 and 14, participants will be given 3&#xD;
      questionnaires that will measure mood; medication management will be conducted during these&#xD;
      assessments. Each visit, including baseline, should take approximately one and a half hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Experimental: Baseline measures of mood will be assessed with the Activation&#xD;
      subscale of the Internal State Scale (ISS) (primary measure), Hamilton Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale (17-item version), and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Cognition will be assessed with&#xD;
      the HVLT-R (primary measure), and STROOP color word task. The subjects will be given&#xD;
      memantine or identical appearing placebo as described above. Reductions in dosage will be&#xD;
      allowed should clinically significant side effects emerge based on the judgment of a blinded&#xD;
      psychiatrist. The above cognitive measures will be administered at each assessment visit (8&#xD;
      total); during the assessments at week 2 and week 14 patients will also be given 3 mood&#xD;
      questionnaires. Each visit will be approximately an hour and half in length. The RA doing&#xD;
      assessments will be blinded at all times. Alternative but equivalent versions of the HVLT-R&#xD;
      will be given to minimize practice or learning effects. Current and cumulative corticosteroid&#xD;
      dose (mg each day X number of days) will be determined and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of missing data we will use the last observation carried forward. In our&#xD;
      lamotrigine study in a similar population, we found a change in the total words recalled on a&#xD;
      word list and on the Stroop. Assuming a similar change with memantine and using double-sided,&#xD;
      paired t-tests, we could detect a difference with a change in the placebo group with&#xD;
      participants on the HVLT-R and with participants on the STROOP. Thus, although this is&#xD;
      primarily a pilot study to obtain effect sizes for future, larger trials funded by NIH, it&#xD;
      should have power to detect clinically meaningful differences between medication and placebo.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with baseline RAVLT total words recalled normative score &gt; 55 will be&#xD;
