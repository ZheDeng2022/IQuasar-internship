      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a disease in which cancer cells are found in the tissues under&#xD;
           the skin or mucous membranes that line the mouth, nose, and anus. KS causes red or&#xD;
           purple patches (lesions) on the skin or mucous membranes and spreads to other organs in&#xD;
           the body, such as the lungs, liver, or intestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BAY 43-9006 inhibits the activity of several proteins or protein receptors in cells that&#xD;
           are thought to be important to the progression of KS. Blocking these mechanisms may&#xD;
           cause KS to get better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn about the toxicity and blood levels of BAY 43-9006 in people with KS who are&#xD;
           and are not taking the anti-retroviral drug ritonavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To look for evidence of a beneficial treatment effect of BAY 43-9006&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults with confirmed KS, both HIV-positive and HIV-negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have either 1) at least five measurable KS lesions with no previous local&#xD;
           therapy, or 2) other measurable non-skin disease that permits evaluation of a response&#xD;
           to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are randomly assigned to a specific dose of BAY 43-9006. They take the drug by&#xD;
           mouth either once or twice daily, depending on their dose group, for up to 54 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug blood levels are determined after patients have been taking BAY 43-9006 for 1 to 2&#xD;
           weeks by blood collections immediately before the dose and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24&#xD;
           hours after the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are evaluated every 3 weeks with review of a medication diary, interview about&#xD;
           drug side effects, physical examination, and assessment of KS lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KS lesions are photographed on entering the study and at other time points during the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load are tested every 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsies are done at the start of the study, on day 15, and if it appears that all of&#xD;
           the lesions have resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other procedures, such as CT or MRI scans, may be done if medically indicated.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: This study is designed to test the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of different&#xD;
      doses of BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) in patients with Kaposi s sarcoma (KS). It will also assess,&#xD;
      in a preliminary manner, the activity of BAY 43-9006 in this disease and its effect on&#xD;
      biological markers. BAY 43-9006 is a potent inhibitor of wild-type and mutant c-Raf kinase&#xD;
      isoforms. In addition, this agent also inhibits p38, c-kit, vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor receptor 2(VEGFR2), VEGF-R3, and platelet derived growth factor receptor beta&#xD;
      (PDGFR-B). There is evidence that several of these receptors, and especially VEGF-R2,&#xD;
      VEGF-R3, and PDGF-RB, are important in KS pathogenesis. The principle tumor cells of KS&#xD;
      lesions are spindle cells, which are derived from endothelial cells. Spindle cells&#xD;
      proliferate in response to VEGF, VEGF-C (a ligand for VEGF-R3), and PDGF, and the stimulation&#xD;
      of spindle cells by these factors appears to be an important component in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      KS. There is also evidence that c-kit is important in KS. Because BAY 43-9006 can inhibit the&#xD;
      function of these receptors and c-kit, it may have specific activity against this tumor. BAY&#xD;
      43-9006 is metabolized at least in part by CYP 3A4, and ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor&#xD;
      commonly used in AIDS patients, is an inhibitor of CYP 3A4. Also, AIDS patients are often&#xD;
      quite sensitive to drug toxicities. Thus, patients with AIDS-KS on ritonavir may be&#xD;
      particularly sensitive to BAY 43-9006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the toxicity profile and pharmacokinetics of BAY 43-9006 at oral dose&#xD;
      regimens of 200 mg once daily, 200mg twice daily, or 400 mg twice daily, up to the toxic&#xD;
      dose, in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi s sarcoma (KS) who are receiving ritonavir.&#xD;
      Also, to assess in a preliminary manner the pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile of BAY&#xD;
      43-9006 in patients who are not receiving ritonavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY: Key eligibility criteria are as follows: patients 18 years of age or older, with&#xD;
      or without HIV infection, and with KS and at least 5 cutaneous lesions untreated by local&#xD;
      therapy; patients with HIV infection must have KS that is progressing or stable on highly&#xD;
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); patients with extensive active, visceral, or&#xD;
      symptomatic KS are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Patients with AIDS-KS who are receiving ritonavir will be administered BAY 43-9006.&#xD;
      An initial group of patients will be administered 200 mg BAY 43-9006 once daily, and&#xD;
      subsequent groups will receive 200 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily respectively. Also&#xD;
      two groups of patients with KS and not on ritonavir will be administered 200 mg and 400 mg&#xD;
      BAY 43-9006 twice daily respectively. Patients will be studied for toxicity,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, KS response, the effect on biological markers such as target receptor&#xD;
      kinase phosphorylation and signaling molecules in KS tissue. Other parameters that will be&#xD;
      assessed will include VEGF levels, the viral load of KSHV, and KS lesion blood flow by&#xD;
      non-invasive techniques. If patients tolerate BAY 43-9006, they will receive it for up to 24&#xD;
      weeks. If they have evidence of stable KS or a tumor response, they may receive the drug for&#xD;
      up to 54 weeks total.&#xD;
