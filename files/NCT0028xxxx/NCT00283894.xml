      This study will measure energy expenditure (the rate at which the body burns calories),&#xD;
      physical activity and caloric intake in people with narcolepsy to learn more about how the&#xD;
      risk of becoming overweight or diabetic may be affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy control subjects and people with narcolepsy between 18 and 55 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Participants are withdrawn from their narcolepsy medication and&#xD;
      undergo the following tests and procedures over 5 weeks before resuming medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for genetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of a cerebrospinal fluid sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diet to keep subjects' weight constant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity watch, using a device worn on the wrist to measure amount of movement, and an&#xD;
           activity monitor worn at the waist to measure physical activity and caloric expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about sleepiness, symptoms, food intake, exercise and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour urine collection and 24-hour blood draw to measure hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose tolerance test. The subject drinks a sugar solution and blood samples are&#xD;
           collected through a catheter before drinking the solution and 30 minutes, 1, 2 and 3&#xD;
           hours after drinking it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Startle reflex test. Subjects hear a loud noise through headphones and are asked to look&#xD;
           at pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep study to evaluate sleep-related breathing disturbances and record information&#xD;
           about sleep stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indirect calorimetry test to measure how fast the body uses calories. A plastic canopy&#xD;
           is placed over the face for several minutes to capture the air exhaled to analyze oxygen&#xD;
           use. To measure the energy associated with meals, the same measurements are taken after&#xD;
           the subject eats lunch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan of the abdomen to see how much fat is deposited in the abdomen, and DEXA scan of&#xD;
           the whole body to see the percentage of fat and muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plethysmography. Participants sit in an enclosed chamber while the mass and volume of&#xD;
           the body are measured by changes in air pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing to assess thought processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous 24-hour heart rate measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic chamber. Subjects spend 24 hours in a small room to measure the amount of&#xD;
           oxygen inhaled and carbon dioxide exhaled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Walking/running test to assess level of physical conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) suppression test and CRH stimulation&#xD;
           test. Subjects receive eight doses of 0.5 mg dexamethasone every 6 hours for a day and a&#xD;
           half. After the last dose, two blood samples are drawn, then a dose of CRH is injected,&#xD;
           and then six more blood samples are drawn over the next 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) stimulation test. Subjects are given TRH through a&#xD;
           vein, and several blood samples are then drawn over the next 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doubly labeled water test. Subjects drink a dose of &quot;heavy&quot; water. Urine samples are&#xD;
           collected at 2, 3 and 5 hours after drinking and again for two 4-hour collections a week&#xD;
           later.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Several cross-sectional studies have suggested that subjects with narcolepsy have&#xD;
      increased body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance. These subjects exhibit a decrease in&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin levels, which has been causally linked to the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of this disease. Orexins are peptides expressed in a brain region, the lateral&#xD;
      hypothalamic area, which stimulate appetite and modulate sleep. Low CSF orexin levels provoke&#xD;
      narcolepsy-like behavior, such as excessive daytime sleepiness and a sudden loss of muscle&#xD;
      tone known as cataplexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to determine whether subjects with&#xD;
      narcolepsy have lower energy expenditure compared to healthy matched controls. In addition,&#xD;
      we will assess food intake, physical activity, and other relevant parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: 18 to 55 year old men and premenopausal women with narcolepsy and healthy&#xD;
      matched controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional, case-controlled study of subjects with narcolepsy matched&#xD;
      on a one-to-one basis with healthy, non-narcoleptic control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME PARAMETERS: We will assess metabolic, hormonal, and energy expenditure parameters in&#xD;
      subjects with narcolepsy. Outcomes: energy expenditure by various methods (indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry, metabolic chamber, doubly-labeled water method); leptin circadian levels&#xD;
      (frequent 24h sampling); physical activity, characterization of the main endocrine axes, and&#xD;
      other relevant parameters.&#xD;
