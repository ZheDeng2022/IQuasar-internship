  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients developing kidney failure after open heart surgery experience an abrupt decrease in&#xD;
      blood flow to the kidney. The investigators hypothesize that administration of fenoldopam&#xD;
      mesylate (a drug that increases blood flow to the kidney) to patients early in the course of&#xD;
      their disease could reduce progression to dialysis-dependent acute renal failure. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that restoring blood flow could induce additional injury to&#xD;
      the kidney through the release of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, patients in this&#xD;
      protocol will be randomized to receive a fenoldopam or the anti-oxidant MESNA. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that combination treatment with Fenoldopam and MESNA will decrease&#xD;
      the incidence of death or dialysis at 21 days in patients with early post-operative acute&#xD;
      renal failure.&#xD;

      Primary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination therapy with intravenous fenoldopam mesylate and MESNA will reduce the&#xD;
           incidence of dialysis and all cause mortality at 21 days in patients with established&#xD;
           acute tubular necrosis (ATN).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The combination of fenoldopam mesylate and Intravenous MESNA reduces the level of&#xD;
           reactive oxygen species released following restoration of renal blood flow in patients&#xD;
           with ischemic ATN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a multicenter, double blind, trial comparing the efficacy of a 72-hour&#xD;
           infusion of fenoldopam mesylate or combination of fenoldopam plus intravenous MESNA to&#xD;
           reduce the incidence of dialysis or all-cause mortality at 21 days in patients with&#xD;
           ischemic ATN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effects of fenoldopam mesylate alone or in combination with MESNA on&#xD;
           reperfusion injury as evidenced by changes in the level of urinary 15-F2t-isoprostanes&#xD;
           The rational is that failure of parenteral vasodilators to reduce the incidence of death&#xD;
           or dialysis among patients with ATN may involve the extension of tubular injury through&#xD;
           normalization of renal blood flow and subsequent reperfusion injury. Moreover, the&#xD;
           generation of reactive oxidative species in areas of hypoxia could blunt impair regional&#xD;
           blood flow in the kidney through inhibition of nitric oxide production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To serially measure the urinary content of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, KIM-1, P-selectin,&#xD;
           E-selectin, MCP-1and Cyr-61 and determine the ability of specific markers to identify&#xD;
           patients progressing to dialysis dependent ATN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational is that ICAM-1 is expressed by ischemic endothelium and facilitates neutrophile&#xD;
      migration into areas of necrotic epithelium. We will determine whether rising urinary ICAM-1&#xD;
      will identify patients with progressive dialysis-dependent ATN. Specific aim #3 will also&#xD;
      examine whether a reduction in dialysis or all cause mortality by fenoldopam mesylate&#xD;
      correlates with reduced urinary expression of ICAM-1 or other cell adhesion molecules. The&#xD;
      serum, plasma, urine supernatant and urinary casts obtained from patients enrolled in this&#xD;
      trial will be made available to other investigators involved in the study of early ATN.&#xD;
