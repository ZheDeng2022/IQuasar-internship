      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a statistical association between&#xD;
      the changes from baseline in the levels of two cytokines interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-6 in the&#xD;
      sputum of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the severity of&#xD;
      acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD). These sputum cytokine levels are taken as measures of&#xD;
      the adaptive immune response (IL-17A) and the innate immune response (IL-6), respectively.&#xD;
      Sputum will be collected either spontaneously or will be obtained by induction; cytokine&#xD;
      levels will be measured by ELISA. The primary analysis, comparisons of sputum cytokine levels&#xD;
      between clinical states, will be done using random effects modeling.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD is one of the most pressing healthcare problems facing our nation. AE-COPD is&#xD;
      responsible for the bulk of healthcare costs and much of the morbidity and decline in health&#xD;
      status among individuals with this common disease. The lack of accepted animal models of&#xD;
      AE-COPD necessitates novel approaches using human samples. Advances in the understanding of&#xD;
      the pathogenesis have been slowed, in part, due to controversy as to how exacerbations should&#xD;
      be defined. The prevailing paradigm has defined AE-COPD as event-based. Such definitions&#xD;
      clearly identify groups of patients with accelerated loss of pulmonary function and increased&#xD;
      mortality. However, limited data show that symptom-based definitions of AE-COPD also capture&#xD;
      episodes inducing significant morbidity and functional decline, and hence of concern to&#xD;
      patients. Fundamental mechanisms are lacking to explain AE-COPD defined by either means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controversy also surrounds triggers of AE-COPD. Bacteria and viruses are involved in some&#xD;
      episodes, but the relative importance of each is intertwined with disputes over the&#xD;
      definition of AE-COPD. Progress at linking specific pathogens to molecular pathogenesis has&#xD;
      been slow, both due to their diversity, and to the high rates of bacterial colonization of&#xD;
      patients with COPD, even in the stable state. Moreover, in many AE-COPD cases, no pathogen&#xD;
      can be identified. Without negating the value of analyzing infections with specific species&#xD;
      of pathogens, it appears that progress in molecular pathogenesis could be accelerated by&#xD;
      focusing on unifying features of the pulmonary immune response during AE-COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective patient cohort will be studied extensively physiologically, functionally, and&#xD;
      immunologically upon enrollment while in the stable state. As part of the study, participants&#xD;
      will be trained in the use of peak flow meters, so that they can record daily first morning&#xD;
      peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR). To confirm the range of fluctuations in their basal state,&#xD;
      participants will be then be followed at three-month intervals for face-to-face interviews&#xD;
      and more limited physiological and functional testing described below. Participants will also&#xD;
      be reminded at each scheduled visit to contact the study coordinator when they feel that an&#xD;
      AE-COPD may be present. If they do contact the study coordinator, they will be evaluated at&#xD;
      one of the study sites within 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnosis of AE-COPD will incorporate a modification of the definition used by the COPD&#xD;
      Clinical Research Network (CCRN). The diagnosis will be made in one of two ways: severe&#xD;
      AE-COPD will be defined as a change in respiratory symptoms above the participant's baseline&#xD;
      measurements plus evaluation in the emergency room (ER) or requiring hospitalization; or&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate AE-COPD will be defined as a change in respiratory symptoms above the&#xD;
      participant's baseline measurements and requiring a change in therapy (addition of either&#xD;
      antibiotics, oral steroids, or both), but without evaluation in the ER or hospitalization. In&#xD;
      the latter case, therapy could be changed either at the advice of the patient's own&#xD;
      caregivers or a study physician based on clinical judgment, or could be self-initiated in the&#xD;
      case of participants authorized to do so by their caregiver. A concerted effort will be made&#xD;
      to capture these milder AE-COPD during both winter and non-winter seasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrolling participants, the following will be performed: review of medical history;&#xD;
      review of demographic and smoking history; physical examination, blood and sputum collection;&#xD;
      six-minute walk test; and questionnaires to assess shortness of breath (MMRC and University&#xD;
      of California San Diego SOBQ), sputum production (modified Chronic Bronchitis Symptom&#xD;
      Questionnaire), health status (SF-36 and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire), and&#xD;
      psychological traits (Hospital Anxiety/Depression Score, Illness Perception Questionnaire,&#xD;
      Coping Index, and an individualized 30-minute clinical interview via telephone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend study visits every 3 months to review symptoms. During an AE-COPD&#xD;
      (episode of acute bronchitis), sputum and blood will be collected, and a five-symptom&#xD;
      questionnaire will be filled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are reimbursed $25 per scheduled visit and $50 per unscheduled visit (at the time of&#xD;
      perceived exacerbation) to help defray travel expenses.&#xD;
