      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of increasing the amount of time spent in&#xD;
      recess (outside playtime) on overall daily physical activity in Hispanic preschool age&#xD;
      children attending full-day and half-day preschool programs. We hypothesize that increasing&#xD;
      recess (outside playtime) by 60 minutes in participants attending full-day and 30 minutes in&#xD;
      participants attending half-day of preschool will increase average daily physical activity&#xD;
      during the intervention days. We also hypothesize that children will not compensate for the&#xD;
      increased recess (outside playtime) by decreasing physical activity outside of school during&#xD;
      the intervention days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity has dramatically increased in the past two decades. The increased&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity in Hispanic children is even more alarming. Obesity is a known risk&#xD;
      factor for the development of a wide range of chronic diseases in both children and adults,&#xD;
      and overweight status tends to track from childhood into adulthood. Therefore, many experts&#xD;
      have recommended that obesity prevention should be initiated during early childhood,&#xD;
      particularly in preschool-aged children, to prevent the excess co-morbidities associated with&#xD;
      obesity throughout the lifespan. However, less is known about the prevention of obesity in&#xD;
      young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One factor associated with the increased prevalence of overweight and obesity in children is&#xD;
      a decrease in physical activity level and an increase in sedentary lifestyle. Even though&#xD;
      approximately 61% of children ages 3 - 5 years of age spend a part of their day in some form&#xD;
      of early child care program (day care centers, nursery schools, Head Start, and&#xD;
      pre-kindergarten programs) only a few studies have been conducted to examine their daily&#xD;
      physical activity level while they are attending preschool. Since the majority of young&#xD;
      children spend a part of their day in a preschool setting, this setting could potential play&#xD;
      an integral role in increasing their daily physical activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experts have recommended that in order to meet the current guidelines for daily physical&#xD;
      activity (at least 120 minutes/day), planned and/or free playtime should be incorporated into&#xD;
      a preschooler's daily schedule. Direct observation indicates that preschoolers spend 27 - 40%&#xD;
      of their recess time engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. By increasing&#xD;
      children's time in recess it is possible to increase their daily physical activity level.&#xD;
      Therefore the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of increasing the amount of&#xD;
      time spent in recess on overall daily physical activity in preschool age children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following preliminary screening, participants selected to participant in this study will&#xD;
      undergo baseline assessment. All participants will complete two days of baseline conditioning&#xD;
      prior to the initiation of the experimental intervention. The experimental intervention will&#xD;
      consist of adding an additional recess period for two consecutive school days. Participants'&#xD;
      physical activity will be monitored during the baseline conditioning and intervention days.&#xD;
      The experimental intervention will last for one week.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Hispanic children between 3 - 5 years of age on the date of randomization. A child is&#xD;
        defined as Hispanic if their parent/guardian identifies the child's ethnicity as &quot;Hispanic&quot;&#xD;
        or &quot;Latino&quot;, regardless of race.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will not be eligible if they have a condition limiting their participation in the&#xD;
        intervention (unable to participate in routine outdoor play time at school, requiring&#xD;
        oxygen supplementation for exertion, developmental or physical disability preventing&#xD;
        participations in the interventions, participants who can not increase their physical&#xD;
        activity for any reason); if they have a condition limiting participation in the assessment&#xD;
        (parent/guardian is not able to read surveys in English or Spanish, if child is unable to&#xD;
        wear the activity monitor); or if parent/guardian is unable to read, understand or complete&#xD;
        informed consent in English or Spanish.&#xD;
