  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's first aim is to widen the knowledge of the characteristics of delayed sleep&#xD;
      phase disorder (DSPS) by focusing on the circadian rhythms of appetite regulation factors and&#xD;
      their phase relations to the cycles of sleep-wake, melatonin, cortisol and body temperature.&#xD;
      This study's second aim is to assess the influence of forced morning awakening, as a daily&#xD;
      struggle faced by DSPS patients, upon the synchronization of these variables in DSPS&#xD;
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that the chronic incompatibility between the&#xD;
      endogenous sleep-wake rhythm of the DSPS patients and the morning wakefulness, as a social&#xD;
      demand, may impair the synchronization between the different rhythms, as findings indicate in&#xD;
      normal subjects under jet lag. And finally, the third aim of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      influence of successful treatment with melatonin upon the phase locations of circadian&#xD;
      rhythms of studied measures and the synchronization between them. These measures will be&#xD;
      assessed in a controlled study, for 36 hours (sampled every 2 hours) under three distinct&#xD;
      experimental conditions: first, under free sleep-wake conditions (ad-libitum bedtime and&#xD;
      arousal); second, under restricted sleep-wake conditions (enforced morning wake-up); and&#xD;
      finally, after 12 weeks of melatonin treatment.&#xD;

      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 subjects, 10 diagnosed as DSPS patients and 10 matched healthy controls with a&#xD;
      proven normal sleep-wake cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for the recruitment would be body mass index (BMI) higher than 28 or lower&#xD;
      than 22, shift-work, or chronic disease and chronic medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1- A comparison between 10 normal rhythm and 10 DSPS subjects under restricted&#xD;
      sleep-wake schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: 10 day actigraphic monitoring under restricted sleep schedule (using alarm clocks):&#xD;
      DSPS patients will be awakened at 7:00 a.m., and control subjects will be awakened at 3:00&#xD;
      a.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: A 36 hour monitoring of the following measures: body temperature, melatonin,&#xD;
      cortisol, Ghrelin, subjective hunger sensation and eating behavior. The subjects will be&#xD;
      provided with ad-libitum food and will be instructed to eat whatever they like, whenever they&#xD;
      feel hungry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2- A comparison between 10 normal rhythm and 10 DSPS subjects under ad-libitum&#xD;
      sleep conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: A 10 day actigraphic monitoring under ad-libitum sleep schedule. Patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to go to sleep whenever they feel tired and avoid any means of unnatural&#xD;
      awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: similar to experiment 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 3- Examination of DSPS patients under melatonin administration and ad libitum&#xD;
      sleep, after 12 weeks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: A 10 day actigraphic monitoring under ad-libitum sleep schedule. Patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to go to sleep whenever they feel tired and avoid any means of unnatural&#xD;
      awakening. Melatonin will be taken according to the medical instruction (usually at 22:00).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: similar to experiment 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective hunger sensation will be measured with Visual Analogue Scale ratings for appetite&#xD;
      assessment (Flint et al. 2000; Oh et al. 2002; Parker et al. 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing of meals and eating behavior will be recorded by the experimenter during the 36-hr&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep-wake rhythm (normal or DSPS) will be determined using the Actiwatch wrist activity&#xD;
      monitoring system (Actiwatch, Cambridge Neurotechnology LTD.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma levels of Ghrelin: will be sampled every 2 hours for 36 hours. An intravenous catheter&#xD;
      will be placed on the subject's arm 30 minutes prior to the first blood sampling. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected with chilled Vacutainer EDTA tubes and immediately centrifuged.&#xD;
      Plasma Ghrelin will be measured using commercial radioimmunoassay (RIA- Phoenix&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salivary levels of Melatonin and Cortisol: Saliva will be collected by placing wool swab of&#xD;
      plain Salivettes (Sarstedt, Disposable Products, Regency Park, Adelaide) into the mouths of&#xD;
      the subjects with chewing for 5 min. Saliva samples will be taken at a total of 18 time&#xD;
      points over a 36-h period for each subject. The samples will be kept in Salivette tubes in&#xD;
      the refrigerator at ±4 ºC until the end of each 24-h period. The Salivette tubes will be&#xD;
      centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 ´g and the samples frozen at -20 ºC until assayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin treatment: Subjects with DSPS in the treatment group will be treated with melatonin&#xD;
      according to a standard protocol for 3 months before the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral temperature: will be measured using standard medical mercury thermometer, placed under&#xD;
      the tongue for 3 minutes at a total of 18 time points over a 36-h period right after the&#xD;
      saliva sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Assays of Melatonin and cortisol: Melatonin in saliva was measured by a direct&#xD;
      radioimmunoassay (RIA). The kit is manufactured by LDN GmbH &amp; Co, KG, Nordhorn Germany&#xD;
      (Cat-No: DSL-BA-1200) and is specially made for the quantitative determination of melatonin&#xD;
      in saliva. The cross-reactivity of the assay for N-acetylserotonin, 5-methoxytryptophol, and&#xD;
      5-methoxytryptamine is 0.80%, 0.70%, and 0.08%. Serotonin, 5-methoxyindole-3-acetic acid is &lt;&#xD;
      0.01%, respectively. The sensitivity of the assay is 1 ng/L. The intra- and inter-variations&#xD;
      are 11.3% and 12%, respectively. Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured with a&#xD;
      competitive solid-stage radioimmunoassay [Coat-A-Count, Diagnostic Products Corp (DPC)]. The&#xD;
      protocol followed the instructions of Coat-Count Free Cortisol in Saliva kit from DPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ghrelin assay: Plasma immunoreactive ghrelin levels will be measured in duplicate using a&#xD;
      commercial radioimmunoassay (RIA) that uses 125I-labeled bioactive ghrelin as a tracer and a&#xD;
      rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against full-length octanoylated human ghrelin (Phoenix&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiments will take place at the Institute for Sleep and Fatigue medicine, the Chaim&#xD;
      Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer.&#xD;
