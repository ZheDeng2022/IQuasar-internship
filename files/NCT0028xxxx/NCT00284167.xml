  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the benefit of using online, tailored&#xD;
      behavioral weight management materials (Balance), in combination with nutritional materials&#xD;
      (Balance and Nourish), in conjunction with a goal setting tool (Balance and Achieve), or a&#xD;
      combination of all three (Balance, Nourish and Achieve). This objective will be evaluated by&#xD;
      measuring weight loss rates as reported by study participants at 3, 12, and 18 months&#xD;
      post-enrollment. The hypothesis is that adding additional materials will increase the effect&#xD;
      of the intervention over just using Balance alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized control, web-based trial for weight management with four treatment&#xD;
      arms. Participants will be assigned to receive tailored materials from either: 1) the Balance&#xD;
      program, 2) the Balance and Nourish programs, 3) the Balance and Achieve programs, or 4) the&#xD;
      Balance, Nourish and Achieve programs. Participants will be recruited directly through their&#xD;
      health care organization. In order to participate, participants must visit the website to&#xD;
      confirm their eligibility, e.g. valid e-mail address. Those who wish to participate will&#xD;
      provide consent on the Web, and then will be presented with an online questionnaire. These&#xD;
      questions will provide baseline data for each participant and will be the basis for the&#xD;
      tailoring of the Balance materials each participant will receive. Within 24 hours of&#xD;
      submitting the completed questionnaire, participants will be informed by e-mail that their&#xD;
      tailored Balance plan is available on the website. They will receive follow-up materials by&#xD;
      e-mail during the six-week period after they enroll. Participants who have been assigned to&#xD;
      additional programs will be sent e-mails with links to the relevant programs. At 3, 12 and 18&#xD;
      months, all participants will be assessed via an online survey. The assessment will include&#xD;
      weight management parameters, psychosocial outcomes, and program utilization. This data will&#xD;
      be self-reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION The study sample will be drawn from members of three integrated delivery&#xD;
      systems: Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO), Kaiser Permanente Ohio (KPOH), and Group Health&#xD;
      Cooperative (GHC) of Puget Sound. In order to participate, participants must access and&#xD;
      enroll in the study on the Web. A total of 1,848 participants will be enrolled within a&#xD;
      six-month period, with approximately 450 participants in each treatment arm. By 18-month&#xD;
      follow-up, we assume successful data collection from at least 65 percent of the enrollees, or&#xD;
      1200 participants, 300 in each treatment group. The study is open to those who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
