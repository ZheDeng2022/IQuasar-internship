  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit patients have multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism leads to significant morbidity and can be fatal. Unfractionated heparin and&#xD;
      low molecular weight heparin are commonly used to prevent venous thromboembolism. Heparin&#xD;
      induced thrombocytopenia, an untoward consequence of exposure to heparin, is an immune&#xD;
      disorder that may develop in patients treated with heparin products. Determining the&#xD;
      prevalence of heparin induced thrombocytopenia and its relationship to preventive and&#xD;
      therapeutic heparin and low molecular weight heparin will help clinicians more appropriately&#xD;
      choose methods of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment in the critically ill, ICU&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of heparin-induced antibodies on&#xD;
      admission to the ICU and the development of new heparin-antibodies during the first week of&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) is common in the intensive care unit (ICU); VTE leads to&#xD;
      significant morbidity and is fatal in 30% of undiagnosed pulmonary emboli and 8% when PE is&#xD;
      appropriately treated. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients have multiple risk factors for VTE&#xD;
      and tend to be at higher risk than non-ICU patients. Risk factors specific to ICU patients&#xD;
      include immobility, central venous catheters, sepsis or infection, need for vasopressors,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, surgery, trauma, and increasing age. Guidelines exist for the&#xD;
      prevention of VTE, and VTE prophylaxis is strongly recommended. Given the high rate of VTE&#xD;
      and the attendant morbidity and mortality, most ICU's routinely provide VTE prophylaxis which&#xD;
      is individualized according to risk-benefit analysis with respect to thrombosis and bleeding&#xD;
      risk. Prophylaxis for patients at risk of bleeding is accomplished by using mechanical&#xD;
      compression devices while those without bleeding risk are administered medical prophylaxis&#xD;
      which is felt to be more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has become apparent that medical prophylaxis is not without risk and that the&#xD;
      risk-benefit analysis should also include the risk of developing heparin induced&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are commonly used to&#xD;
      prevent VTE in ICU and non-ICU patients. HIT, an untoward consequence of exposure to heparin&#xD;
      is an immune disorder that may develop in patients treated with heparin products. HIT is&#xD;
      antibody mediated, usually due to IgG antibodies directed against epitopes on the platelet&#xD;
      surface comprised of the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex. HIT is generally characterized by&#xD;
      a decrease in platelet count to less than 100 X 109/L, or a 50% decrease from baseline, after&#xD;
      exposure to heparin. HIT is typically observed after 5 to 10 days of treatment.&#xD;
      Alternatively, patients with previous exposure to heparin can develop HIT in two days while&#xD;
      heparin naive patients may develop HIT in about 10 days. The platelet count usually returns&#xD;
      to normal several days after discontinuing heparin with or without therapy, though the risk&#xD;
      for thrombosis persists for up to 3 months due to the persistence of antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using an ELISA assay heparin-induced antibody formation is found in up to 50% of patients&#xD;
      exposed to UFH. However, the serotonin release assay (SRA) which is believed to be more&#xD;
      specific for HIT detects antibody formation in about 20% of patients. Five percent of&#xD;
      patients receiving UFH develop thrombocytopenia (HIT) and half of these patients go on to&#xD;
      develop heparin induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT) which results in venous and&#xD;
      arterial complications which can be life threatening, or result in loss of extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of HIT varies widely between clinical populations and is dependent on the type&#xD;
      of heparin used, i.e. UFH vs. LMWH. The highest incidence reported to date has been in the&#xD;
      cardiac and orthopedic populations and is unknown in the ICU population. Warkentin, et al&#xD;
      found in a study of 655 hip surgery patients that 2.7% randomized to UFH developed HIT while&#xD;
      none receiving enoxaparin (LMWH) developed HIT. This variability in development of antibodies&#xD;
      and the HIT syndrome makes it critically important to understand heparin induced antibody&#xD;
      formation as a precursor to HIT and HITT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the prevalence of HIT and its relationship to preventive and therapeutic UFH and&#xD;
      LMWH will help clinicians more appropriately choose methods of VTE prophylaxis and treatment&#xD;
      in the critically ill, ICU population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To determine the prevalence of heparin-induced antibodies on admission to the ICU&#xD;
      and the development of new heparin-antibodies during the first 7 +/- 2 days of&#xD;
      hospitalization. Secondary objectives include: determining the incidence of heparin antibody&#xD;
      formation in patients treated with UFH, LMWH and mechanical prophylaxis (MPX); and to compare&#xD;
      the incidence of heparin antibodies between different ICU populations.&#xD;
