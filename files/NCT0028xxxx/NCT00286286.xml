  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of aerosolized pain medication&#xD;
      (.5% bupivicaine) delivered into the peritoneal cavity after laparoscopic gastric bypass&#xD;
      surgery. This double blind study will include 50 patients. 25 will receive the aerosolized&#xD;
      pain medication and 25 will receive a placebo (normal saline). All 50 patients will receive&#xD;
      routine/typical methods of post-operative pain management. Post operative pain scores of the&#xD;
      patients will be examined to determine the effect of aerosolization.&#xD;

      Surgical Technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 30 mls of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine standard dose will be distributed into the&#xD;
           trocar site wounds after desufflation of the peritoneal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All the patients will be under a consistent intra-abdominal pressure using CO2 and the&#xD;
           laparoscopy will be carried out using the same, routine / typical surgical instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Control Group (n=25): Aerosolized normal saline will be introduced at the end of the&#xD;
      procedure, using a specially designed sterile catheter. The catheter will be inserted via&#xD;
      trocar port under direct vision. The other end of the catheter will be connected to a 72&quot;&#xD;
      Edwards Lifesciences pressure tubing (Ref: 50P172), which will be connected to a B&amp;D 20cc&#xD;
      syringe filled with 15 ml of normal saline and inserted into a specially designed syringe&#xD;
      pump and pressurizing system designed to aerosolize the specified agent. The total dose of&#xD;
      patient delivered normal saline will be 10 ml, with 5 ml remaining contained and undelivered&#xD;
      within the catheter and 72&quot; pressure tubing. Routine/Typical methods of post-operative pain&#xD;
      management will be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Aerosolized anesthetic (n=25): at the end of the procedure, the aerosolized local&#xD;
      anesthetic will be introduced using a specially designed sterile catheter. The catheter will&#xD;
      be inserted via trocar port under direct vision. The other end of the catheter will be&#xD;
      connected to a 72&quot; Edwards Lifesciences pressure tubing (Ref: 50P172), which will be&#xD;
      connected to a B&amp;D 20cc syringe filled with 15 ml of anesthetic agent and inserted into a&#xD;
      specially designed syringe pump and pressurizing system designed to aerosolize the specified&#xD;
      agent. The total dose of patient delivered anesthetic will be 10 ml, with 5 ml remaining&#xD;
      contained and undelivered within the catheter and 72&quot; pressure tubing. Routine/Typical&#xD;
      methods of post-operative pain management will be employed.&#xD;
