  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite undeniable progress in the reduction of morbidity and mortality of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) prevention is a mainstay for medical intervention. The importance of elevated&#xD;
      serum cholesterol for the formation and progress of CHD can be regarded as proved after the&#xD;
      results of the major intervention studies became available. These studies have provided key&#xD;
      evidence for a positive correlation of lipid lowering and decreased mortality. Other studies&#xD;
      in patients with established CHD have shown that stabilization and regression of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic lesions is possible with lowering of cholesterol using a variety of agents.&#xD;
      Different studies have also investigated the long-term effects of lipid lowering strategies&#xD;
      on atherosclerosis by means of coronary angiography and have demonstrated that lipid&#xD;
      reduction reduces progression of atherosclerosis and can promote atherosclerosis regression.&#xD;
      Thus, it has been demonstrated that cholesterol lowering therapy reduces the risk of CHD and&#xD;
      diminishes cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Policosanol is a drug that presumably possesses both hypocholesterolemic and antiplatelet&#xD;
      effects. Furthermore there are hints to even more positive effects that influence the&#xD;
      development of atherosclerosis, i.e. inhibition of LDL peroxidation and smooth muscle cell&#xD;
      proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed efficacy in dose ranges of mostly 5 to 20 mg Policosanol per day. As&#xD;
      nearly all previous studies have been performed in Latin America it cannot be excluded that&#xD;
      either ethnic or nutritional factors contribute to the dose found to be optimal in this&#xD;
      region. This circumstance as well as the requirement to meet the ICH Guideline &quot;Ethnic&#xD;
      Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data&quot; make further studies, i.e. a&#xD;
      dose-finding clinical trial, an efficacy clinical trial in European patients and a long-term&#xD;
      tolerability clinical trial in Caucasian patients necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known from more than 60 clinical studies performed so far that Policosanol has an&#xD;
      excellent safety profile. A placebo-controlled design was considered appropriate as patients&#xD;
      with two or more risk factors for the development of cardiovascular events and a LDL of&#xD;
      greater than 190 mg/dl were excluded; the chance of getting an active lipid-lowering agent&#xD;
      during the treatment phase was 80 %.&#xD;
