      This study of healthy normal volunteers will examine the brain networks involved in people's&#xD;
      sense that they control their own movements (sense of agency). Although almost everyone has a&#xD;
      sense of agency, some patients (for example, patients with schizophrenia, alien limb&#xD;
      phenomena, and others) have movements they think are not under their control. This study will&#xD;
      use electroencephalography (EEG) to determine how the normal brain produces the sense of&#xD;
      agency. This information will provide a first step in understanding patients with an impaired&#xD;
      sense of agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, right-handed men and women 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history and neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are fitted with a cyberglove device (a lightweight glove with flexible sensors&#xD;
      that measure the position and movement of the fingers and wrist) on their right hand. The&#xD;
      glove is used to transform the subject's hand and finger motions into real-time digital&#xD;
      joint-angle information. Subjects slowly open and close their hand while watching an&#xD;
      artificial hand projected on a monitor. They continue practicing the exercise until they are&#xD;
      comfortable with the cyberglove and have the sense that the artificial hand is a mirror&#xD;
      representation of their own hand, accurately reflecting their hand's movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After practicing with the cyberglove, subjects have a functional EEG. For this test,&#xD;
      electrodes are placed on the scalp, and brain waves are recorded while the subject opens and&#xD;
      closes his or her hand or just watches the computer monitor. The EEG recording takes about 60&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate spatiotemporal patterns of brain networks&#xD;
      involved in the sense of agency using high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to use 20 right-hand dominant, adult healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sense of agency (SA) will be modulated using a visual task-based stimulus asking subjects&#xD;
      to manipulate the position of an artificial hand projected onto a display. Subjects will use&#xD;
      their own right hand to make slow opening/closing movements randomly which will be&#xD;
      represented visually with the aid of a Cyberglove. During a behavioral training phase,&#xD;
      subjects will practice using the apparatus. The level of control will be randomly changed to&#xD;
      one of five states: 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 0% control. For secondary analysis, subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to report the percentage of control they subjectively feel over the displayed hand.&#xD;
      After subjects are comfortable with the apparatus and endorse SA over the displayed hand,&#xD;
      they will undergo EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental phase will have five sets of 10 minute recording sessions where the subject&#xD;
      is instructed to slowly open and close their hand randomly. The level of control will be&#xD;
      changed pseudo-randomly throughout the recording sessions. A control contrast consisting of&#xD;
      the subject observing a moving hand will also be integrated into the blocks. An additional&#xD;
      control contrast involving the subject moving their hand without visual feedback will also be&#xD;
      included. These contrasts will serve in the analysis phase to help eliminate&#xD;
      electrophysiological activity related to visual-motor feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of brain will be performed to co-register this EEG&#xD;
      data with the anatomical structure. We will integrate physiological (EEG) and anatomical&#xD;
      (MRI) data to characterize the regionalization of the task-related brain EEG activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the effective connectivity of brain in response to a&#xD;
      loss of SA. For this purpose, we will measure the difference of EEG power spectral analysis&#xD;
      as well as coherence between 0% and 100 % control. In a secondary analysis, we will&#xD;
      investigate the correlation of the EEG measurements with the percent of actual control, and&#xD;
      also utilize the individual subject perceptions of percent control during the behavioral&#xD;
      training phase as the regressors for activation rather than the objective control settings.&#xD;
