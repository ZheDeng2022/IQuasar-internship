      This study will determine if stimulation of the stroke-injured side of the brain combined&#xD;
      with stimulation to the paralyzed hand can temporarily improve the sense of touch in stroke&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people who have had a single stroke within 3 months of entering&#xD;
      the study that affected one side of the brain may be eligible for this study. All&#xD;
      participants must be between 18 and 90 years old and must be right-handed. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) of the brain if one has not been done within 1 year of entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures during four 2-day sessions over about&#xD;
      6 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral high-frequency stimulation: Small loudspeakers are taped to the fingertips&#xD;
           and simple tactile pulses are passed through the skin. Stimulation may be sham or real.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial direct current stimulation: Two small rubber electrodes are taped to the&#xD;
           head - one above the eye and the other on the back of the head. A current is passed&#xD;
           between the two electrodes. Stimulation may be sham or real.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI: The subject lies in the scanner, a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field,&#xD;
           for about 40 minutes, lying still for up to 40 minutes at a time. An electrical&#xD;
           stimulation is applied to the fingers of the right and left hand in separate sessions.&#xD;
           Earplugs are worn to muffle the loud noises during the scanning. Functional MRI measures&#xD;
           blood flow changes in the brain during the performance of specific tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grating orientation task: The subject responds as quickly as possible to a touch&#xD;
                stimulus to the finger by saying whether the direction of the stimulus is vertical&#xD;
                or horizontal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Haptic object recognition task: The subject is given five categories of unfamiliar&#xD;
                objects in the shape of cubes. During the task, identical objects are hidden in a&#xD;
                sack. With eyes closed, the subject is asked to identify and find the objects from&#xD;
                the sack as quickly as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pegboard test: The subject is asked to place several pegs into a corresponding hole&#xD;
                of a pegboard as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tapping task: The subject is asked to tap a metal stick on a metal plate as quickly&#xD;
                as possible for 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation: This test measures changes in brain&#xD;
           activity. A wire coil is held on the scalp and a brief electrical current is passed&#xD;
           through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears&#xD;
           a click and may fee a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil, and there may be a&#xD;
           twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg. Subjects may be asked to tense certain&#xD;
           muscles slightly or perform other simple actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paired-pulse somatosensory evoked potential mapping: This test measures brain activity&#xD;
           in another brain area. The subject is seated in a chair with eyes closed. One electrode&#xD;
           is placed above the eye and two others are placed on the back of the head. A short&#xD;
           electrical stimulus is applied to a nerve in the wrist and brain activity is recorded&#xD;
           while the stimulus is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surface electromyography: This test measures the electrical activity of muscles.&#xD;
           Electrodes are filed with a conductive gel and taped to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual analog and mood scale: Subjects complete questionnaires about their attention,&#xD;
           fatigue and mood.&#xD;

      Chronic stroke is often accompanied by tactile impairments that contribute to long-term&#xD;
      disability in activities of daily living. While new rehabilitative interventions recently&#xD;
      became available in the motor domain by using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),&#xD;
      there is no generally accepted treatment for tactile impairments after chronic stroke.&#xD;
      Previous studies in healthy volunteers demonstrated that tactile acuity and haptic skills can&#xD;
      be improved by applying a passive learning protocol to the fingertip (peripheral&#xD;
      high-frequency stimulation, pHFS). Based on these findings, the purpose of this protocol is&#xD;
      to enhance the beneficial effect of pHFS on implicit tactile and haptic learning in chronic&#xD;
      stroke patients by a combined application of pHFS with tDCS (pHFS+tDCS) applied to the&#xD;
      somatosensory cortex of the affected hemisphere. This approach might identify novel&#xD;
      strategies to enhance functional recovery after stroke and might provide deeper insight into&#xD;
      mechanistic information on the neural substrates involved in these behavioral gains. Primary&#xD;
      outcome measures will be performance in a tactile grating orientation discrimination task&#xD;
      (GOT) and in a haptic object recognition task. In order to obtain descriptive preliminary&#xD;
      information on the relation between sensory improvements and motor deficits in chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients, secondary outcome measures will be fine motor tasks such as a tapping task and a&#xD;
      pegboard test (PBT) that require manual dexterity, handeye coordination, steadiness, and&#xD;
      perceptual motor skills. To identify the operating mechanisms underlying hypothesized&#xD;
      performance improvements after pHFS+tDCS, we will use paired-pulse protocols to evaluate&#xD;
      changes in cortical excitability as well as fMRI in a subset of patients to identify cortical&#xD;
      map reorganization in primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory cortex as well as in&#xD;
      primary motor cortex (MI). Healthy volunteers will be tested (a) since there are no data&#xD;
      available on performance of the haptic task in healthy subjects, (b) to obtain descriptive&#xD;
      information on the influence of our interventions on this task for hypothesis generation&#xD;
      purposes in our future investigations, and (c) because sensorimotor performance in the&#xD;
      non-paretic hand of stroke patients is often not normal and therefore a poor sole control for&#xD;
      performance of the paretic hand. Studies in chronic stroke patients will help address the&#xD;
      main experimental hypothesis.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will include left- and right-handed stroke patients, aged 18-90 years, with&#xD;
        thromboembolic or hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions at least 3 months after the stroke. We&#xD;
        will choose patients who initially had a severe motor paresis (below MRC grade 2), and&#xD;
        subsequently recovered to the point that they have a residual motor deficit but can perform&#xD;
        the required tasks. Moreover, only chronic stroke patients with moderate tactile deficits&#xD;
        (defined by absolute touch thresholds below 4 N using von Frey filaments) who are able to&#xD;
        differentiate the alignment of a grating dome (either orthogonal or parallel to the index&#xD;
        finger) of at least 5 mm grooves that is applied on the fingertip will be included in the&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Assessment of the initial functional state will be taken either from patient reports or&#xD;
        medical records. Right-handed healthy volunteers, aged 18-90 years, should be able to&#xD;
        concentrate on the required tasks. Handedness will be assessed by the Edinburgh inventory&#xD;
        scale as well as the hand dominance test (HDT). We will additionally perform a pregnancy&#xD;
        test for women of child-bearing potential. All experimental sessions will be on outpatient&#xD;
        basis.&#xD;
