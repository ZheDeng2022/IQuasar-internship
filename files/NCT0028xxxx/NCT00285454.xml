  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people in the UK have ischaemic heart disease. Insufficient blood supply to the heart&#xD;
      muscle means that it functions inefficiently, and leads to symptoms of shortness of breath,&#xD;
      chest pain and excess fluid in the body. Recently it has been shown that cells from the&#xD;
      inside of bone are able to produce many different cell types. We are investigating a new&#xD;
      treatment in which a patient's bone marrow cells are taken, and injected into the heart in an&#xD;
      attempt to produce new blood vessels and heart muscle cells. This may lead to a new treatment&#xD;
      for ischaemic heart disease.&#xD;

      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the safety of a single administration of bone marrow mononuclear cells by&#xD;
           retrograde coronary venous delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the bioactivity of bone marrow mononuclear cells in mediating increased&#xD;
           perfusion in viable underperfused areas of myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the ability of bone marrow mononuclear cells to improve myocardial function&#xD;
           specifically regional wall motion and cardiac synchronisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the use of potential bioactivity assays and clinical outcomes for assessing&#xD;
           bone marrow mononuclear cell- induced myocardial changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I/II, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, single-centre study of bone&#xD;
      marrow mononuclear cells by percutaneous retrograde coronary venous delivery to patients with&#xD;
      ischaemic heart failure and no standard revascularisation options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with symptomatic ischaemic heart failure, not amenable to conventional&#xD;
      revascularisation strategies (PCI, CABG, LVAD) or transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the screening procedures will be compiled and submitted to an independent&#xD;
      interventional cardiologist and cardiac surgeon who are not associated with the study for&#xD;
      consideration for enrolment. It will be the independent reviewer's responsibility to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility prior to a patient participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous bone marrow mononuclear, the first 6 safety and feasibility patients&#xD;
      (open-labelled) will receive a sub-population of Indium-111 labelled cells to assess&#xD;
      feasibility of delivery. The remaining patients will either receive Active: Bone marrow&#xD;
      mononuclear cells and 5 % HSA Placebo: 5% HSA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Route:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrograde coronary venous delivery The total dose of bone marrow mononuclear cells or&#xD;
      placebo will be divided into two, each administered as a 10ml bolus into a selective coronary&#xD;
      veins. There will be significant patient heterogeneity regarding size of ischaemic viable&#xD;
      territory present and anatomy of venous system. We aim to treat two veins, individual SPECT&#xD;
      and venogram results will be used to direct the venous anatomy to be targeted. An attempt&#xD;
      will be made to cover as large an area as possible of a patient's ischaemic viable territory.&#xD;
      The total dose of cells will remain constant between patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 6 patients will receive cells as an adjunct to Cardiac resynchronization Therapy&#xD;
      and ICD. An external Data Safety and Monitoring Board has also been appointed to oversee this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
