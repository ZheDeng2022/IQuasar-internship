    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine wether a modified propofol preparation shows any&#xD;
      effect on the incidence of injection pain in children undergoing elective surgery under&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: The use of a modified propofol preparation will reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      injection pain in the study group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain on injection is the most frequently reported side effect associated with the use of&#xD;
      propofol for induction of anesthesia. Various measures have been taken to reduce the pain on&#xD;
      injection, e.g. administration of lidocaine or fentanyl prior to propofol administration,&#xD;
      mixture of lidocaine and propofol as well as cooling of the emulsion. Although pain on&#xD;
      injection had been reduced with some of the above mentioned methods, they may not be regarded&#xD;
      as a satisfactory solution of the problem.&#xD;
