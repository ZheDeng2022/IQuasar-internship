    <textblock>
      Early identification of refractory lymphoma patients provides a basis for stratification&#xD;
      between responders to standard approaches and non-responders who may benefit from an early&#xD;
      change to an alternative treatment strategy.Metabolic or molecular imaging with fluorine-18&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) has emerged as a powerful&#xD;
      imaging modality for diagnosis, staging, and therapy monitoring of a variety of cancers. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis of the present study is that early response can be pinpointed by PET&#xD;
      reflecting both tumor burden and activity, as a surrogate for final outcome. An increasing&#xD;
      number of studies have suggested the potential role of 18F-FDG PET in the staging and&#xD;
      monitoring of lymphomas. The optimal timing of PET scans and the potential role of&#xD;
      quantitative PET using SUV to assess response to chemotherapy remain to be defined.&#xD;
      Confirmation of very early 18F-FDG-PET as a significant predictor of treatment response in a&#xD;
      homogenous group of aggressive lymphoma patients would potentially change the prognosis of&#xD;
      the patient by allowing earlier use of alternative therapies and discontinuation of therapy&#xD;
      that will not lead to a significant tumour response.&#xD;

      Title: Evaluation of response to treatment using 18F-FDG positron emission tomography imaging&#xD;
      (PET) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma stage IIB-IV with special emphasize on the prognostic&#xD;
      significance of early on-therapy PET at first-line treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multicenter trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned sample size: 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers: Denmark 2; Sweden 1; Norway 1; Finland 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: 1. To evaluate the prognostic significance of PET early after treatment&#xD;
      initiation. 2. To compare early PET with standard response criteria for NHL and the&#xD;
      International Prognostic Index (IPI) in the prediction of response and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: The prognostic significance of FDG-PET after 1 cycle of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-points: Progression-free survival (PFS). Overall survival (OS). Response to treatment&#xD;
      (standardized response criteria) at mid-treatment and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age ≥ 18 years. Newly diagnosed consecutive patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (DLBCL) according to the WHO classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ann Arbor stage IIB-IV. Written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Previously treated with chemotherapy or irradiation. Previous malignant&#xD;
      diagnosis except basal cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy. Lactation. Diabetes mellitus. Extreme adipositas. Claustrophobia. Active&#xD;
      inflammatory disease or infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET-CT evaluation: PET and CT at primary staging before initiation of therapy and PET after&#xD;
      one cycle of intravenous chemotherapy (day 10-20) are mandatory. The results of the PET scans&#xD;
      are blinded and will not be available for the local physicians. If the PET result is opened,&#xD;
      the patient will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only post-treatment PET scans are allowed outside the protocol. The local physician may use&#xD;
      post-treatment PET in diagnostic or therapeutic considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only dedicated full-ring PET scanners are allowed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Therapy with a CHOP-like backbone according to local standards of the individual&#xD;
      centers. Treatment according to other protocols allowed.&#xD;
