      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may&#xD;
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to&#xD;
      cancer. It may also help doctors understand how patients respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying biomarkers in patients with rectal cancer undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe whether NF-kappa B is activated in response to treatment with external beam&#xD;
           radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate NF-kappa B pathway activation (presumed to be anti-apoptotic in nature) with&#xD;
           therapeutic outcomes (as measured by rate of pathologic complete response or downstaging&#xD;
           by endoscopic ultrasound [EUS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study downstream events induced by NF-kappa B activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine global gene expression profiles at baseline and during chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate changes in gene expression (compared with the baseline gene expression&#xD;
           pattern) induced by a single dose of external beam radiotherapy with patient outcomes&#xD;
           (as measured by pathologic response rate or downstaging by EUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study downstream events related to activation of p53 in response to treatment with&#xD;
           radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate p53 pathway-mediated events with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorouracil or capecitabine and undergo radiotherapy and surgery&#xD;
      per standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo tumor pinch biopsies at baseline and on days 1 and 2 of chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
      At the time of final surgical resection, a portion of the remaining rectal tumor will be&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen banked. Patients not deemed surgical candidates are evaluated by transrectal&#xD;
      ultrasound 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy to assess ultrasound response&#xD;
      (downstaging versus no downstaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue samples are analyzed for NF-kappa B pathway activation; downstream events&#xD;
      induced by NF-kappa B activation; changes in global gene expression; p53 function; apoptosis;&#xD;
      and mRNA expression. Laboratory techniques used include tissue microarray, ELISA, RNase&#xD;
      protection assay, fluorescence semi-quantitative PCR, TUNEL, IHC, and cDNA microarray&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If normal tissue from biopsies is not available, whole blood may be collected at any point&#xD;
      while patient remains on study for correlative analysis or research related to rectal cancer.&#xD;
