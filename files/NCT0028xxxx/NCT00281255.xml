      This study will determine whether an acute infusion of intravenous allopurinol improves the&#xD;
      inotropic response to dobutamine in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as&#xD;
      measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCM is a poorly understood cause of systolic heart failure and is the most common indication&#xD;
      for heart transplantation in the United States. Despite advances in medical and device&#xD;
      therapy, the 5-year mortality of patients with DCM remains near 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the formation and degradation of free radicals within&#xD;
      the myocardium, contributes to metabolic derangements in patients with DCM. The enzyme&#xD;
      xanthine oxidase (XO), a potent source of oxidative stress, is expressed in the failing&#xD;
      heart, and it uncouples cardiac energy consumption from cardiac contraction in the setting of&#xD;
      chronic heart failure. These effects can be reversed by inhibiting XO with the XO inhibitor&#xD;
      allopurinol, resulting in a marked increase in cardiac efficiency. These findings provide a&#xD;
      rationale for using allopurinol to enhance cardiac function in DCM. However, there is little&#xD;
      data on the effects of allopurinol therapy on cardiac function. Therefore, the primary aim of&#xD;
      this study is to determine whether an acute infusion of intravenous allopurinol improves the&#xD;
      inotropic response to beta-adrenergic stimulation in patients with idiopathic DCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness is a characteristic feature of DCM that is&#xD;
      attributable in part to decreased expression of the beta 1-receptor in chronic heart failure,&#xD;
      as well as dysregulation of down-stream signaling pathways. Improvement in beta-adrenergic&#xD;
      responsiveness is a useful surrogate marker for long-term improvement in cardiac structure,&#xD;
      function, and decreased cardiac events. Traditionally, invasive hemodynamic monitoring using&#xD;
      pressure and pressure/volume catheters has been the method of choice to quantify the&#xD;
      inotropic response in heart failure. However, newly developed magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) techniques now allow precise assessment of the inotropic response non-invasively.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that tagged CMR is a reproducible, noninvasive method to quantify the&#xD;
      inotropic response to the beta 1 agonist dobutamine in individuals with structurally normal&#xD;
      hearts. Specifically, radial strain (E1) and circumferential strain (E2) are measured at&#xD;
      increasing doses of dobutamine using tagged CMR. Changes in these strain parameters, now&#xD;
      referred to as delta E1 and delta E2, are precise measurements of the beta-inotropic&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 20 patients with DCM will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio fashion to receive&#xD;
      allopurinol or placebo. The primary aim of this investigation is to determine whether an&#xD;
      acute infusion of intravenous allopurinol improves the inotropic response to dobutamine in&#xD;
      patients with idiopathic DCM as measured by CMR. Specifically, the study will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that a single dose of intravenous allopurinol, compared to placebo, enhances delta&#xD;
      E1 and delta E2. Secondary aims of this study are as follows: 1) to determine whether the&#xD;
      response to allopurinol is associated with baseline XO activity and levels of natriuretic&#xD;
      peptides (investigators predict that augmentation in delta E1 and delta E2 will correlate&#xD;
      positively with baseline plasma uric acid and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]); and&#xD;
      2) to demonstrate that tagged dobutamine CMR is a useful non-invasive technique to assess&#xD;
      pharmacologic responses in patients with heart failure.&#xD;
