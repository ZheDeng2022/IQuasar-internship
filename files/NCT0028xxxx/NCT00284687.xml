  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has remained a major cause of morbidity and mortality following&#xD;
      allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (SCT). The most reliable&#xD;
      virological predictive marker for disease development is the presence of HCMV viremia. It has&#xD;
      been further recognized that viral load, and viral load kinetics are important determinants&#xD;
      of pathogenesis. Prior to the preventive use of antiviral agents, CMV disease occurred in&#xD;
      15-45% of at-risk patients and carried a high mortality rate. In the last decade, major&#xD;
      advances in the prevention of CMV disease have occurred with the application of pp65&#xD;
      antigenemia and qualitative/quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the rapid&#xD;
      and sensitive diagnosis of HCMV infection, combined with preemptive antiviral treatment&#xD;
      targeted to patients with viremia. The prevalence of early CMV disease has declined to 3% to&#xD;
      6% with intense antiviral drug use. All antiviral drugs currently used for the treatment of&#xD;
      systemic HCMV infection, including ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir, target the HCMV DNA&#xD;
      polymerase. Ganciclovir is the most widely used drug for preemptive treatment. However,&#xD;
      ganciclovir treatment is often complicated by bone marrow toxicity with the occasional&#xD;
      development of potentially life-threatening thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, and graft&#xD;
      failure, associated with secondary bacterial and fungal infection. Another limitation of&#xD;
      preemptive ganciclovir therapy is the requirement for intravenous administration. The&#xD;
      currently available oral valganciclovir is not yet approved for preemptive therapy in SCT&#xD;
      recipients, and is associated with high treatment cost. Additionally, prolonged or repeated&#xD;
      ganciclovir treatment may lead to the development of drug resistance. The use of foscarnet&#xD;
      and cidofovir is limited by considerable nephrotoxicity, low oral bioavailability, and high&#xD;
      cost. Thus, there is an increasing need for new effective non-toxic, low-cost anti-HCMV drugs&#xD;
      with high oral bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the anti-malaria drug artesunate, which is widely used in the treatment of severe&#xD;
      malaria, has been shown to be a highly effective inhibitor of HCMV in vitro. Artesunate&#xD;
      exhibited similar antiviral activity (same micromolar range) to that of ganciclovir, while&#xD;
      demonstrating no cytotoxicity. Importantly, its antiviral activity has been further&#xD;
      demonstrated in vivo in a rat CMV model. No significant side effects were demonstrated in a&#xD;
      number of pre-clinical and clinical studies, and artemisinin and its derivatives have been&#xD;
      shown to be well-tolerated and safe in adults and children. Several million people have taken&#xD;
      artemisinins to date, with no significant adverse or treatment-limiting effects being&#xD;
      reported. Although neurotoxicity has been reported with supraphysiological doses in animals,&#xD;
      it has not been documented in humans. Meta-analyses of malaria patients treated with&#xD;
      artemisinins demonstrated that this drug class is safe. In rare cases, however, slight&#xD;
      changes to haematology values have been seen, including a reduction in the number of&#xD;
      reticulocytes as well as a slight increase in transaminase levels. These signs, however, do&#xD;
      not generally give rise to any noticeable clinical manifestations. In rare cases, a slight&#xD;
      but transient reduction in sinus heart rate has been observed. Abdominal cramps and mild&#xD;
      diarrhoea have been reported at elevated doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, one might expect a similarly high degree of safety for the potential use of artesunate&#xD;
      as an antiviral drug for HCMV infection. Thus, oral therapy with artesunate could be a&#xD;
      beneficial option to the current therapies for the preemptive treatment of HCMV disease in&#xD;
      SCT recipients.&#xD;
