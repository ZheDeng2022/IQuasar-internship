      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a serious chronic condition affecting over 14 million Americans, but the prevalence&#xD;
      rates are higher in certain populations (e.g. 10 percent in inner-cities and 30 percent among&#xD;
      the homeless vs. 5 percent in a general population of whites). African Americans and&#xD;
      Hispanics from the Northeast are twice as likely to die from asthma as whites. African&#xD;
      Americans are four times as likely to be hospitalized for asthma and are five times more&#xD;
      likely than whites to seek care for asthma at an emergency department. Reasons for these&#xD;
      higher rates are not certain, and most likely result from an interaction of risk factors such&#xD;
      as environmental exposures, genetic predisposition, access to appropriate medical care,&#xD;
      socioeconomic status, and cultural health practices. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
      Institute supports a variety of activities to address the pressing public health problems&#xD;
      posed by asthma. However, progress in reducing disparities has been disappointingly slow.&#xD;
      Separate, independent research projects have generated important clues for understanding the&#xD;
      nature and scope of the problem. A more coordinated, interdisciplinary and comprehensive&#xD;
      approach to research is needed to take advantage of these clues, move the science further and&#xD;
      faster, and increase our capacity to improve health outcomes among minority and economically&#xD;
      disadvantaged populations. Cooperative centers of research that foster partnerships among&#xD;
      minority medical centers, research intensive institutions, and the communities in which&#xD;
      asthma patients live will promote such advancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Request for Applications for the Centers for Reducing Asthma Disparities was released in&#xD;
      October, 2001. The objective of the program is to promote partnerships (called Centers)&#xD;
      between a minority serving institution (MSI) that may not have a strong research program and&#xD;
      a research intensive institution (RII) that has a track record of NIH-supported research and&#xD;
      patient care. The purpose of the partnership is to conduct collaborative research on asthma&#xD;
      disparities (i.e. greater prevalence of asthma, higher rates of morbidity due to asthma, and&#xD;
      lesser access or use of quality medical care among minorities and poor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The center has four research projects designed to collaboratively investigate factors&#xD;
      associated with the disproportionate burden of asthma experienced by inner-city,&#xD;
      African-American children and adults. This includes studies that will evaluate both the&#xD;
      underlying genetic factors that may contribute to the observed excess risk in&#xD;
      African-American communities, as well as studies of provider-patient communication designed&#xD;
      to assess intervention strategies for remediating this risk. In addition, an essential goal&#xD;
      of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities will be to create a culturally&#xD;
      sensitive training environment that is truly reciprocal, and designed to both enrich and&#xD;
      enhance the research potential and asthma management capabilities of both participating&#xD;
      institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research project 1 will create and validate a culturally sensitive and simple to administer&#xD;
      Asthma Communication Instrument for use in describing asthma symptoms. Research project 2&#xD;
      will develop a tripartite communication mechanism between the patient, the patient care&#xD;
      provider, and an asthma counselor. Research project 3 deals with the genetics of cockroach&#xD;
      allergy. Research project 4 will develop a complementary mouse model to address the role of&#xD;
      the genetics of cockroach sensitization as it pertains to asthma disparities.&#xD;
