  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nightly administration of a unique, sublingual (under the tongue) formulation of tizanidine,&#xD;
      a known anti-spasticity medication, has been shown in a previous study to improve sleep and&#xD;
      next-day functioning in CP (cerebral palsy) patients. It is hypothesized that this&#xD;
      improvement in sleep efficiency (i.e.,fewer wake episodes, longer time asleep, etc.) with&#xD;
      resulting improvement in quality-of-life (i.e.,improvements in next-day functioning,&#xD;
      cognition and movement) may also be seen in a similar patient population, i.e., children with&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sublingual tizanidine, a novel test formulation of the known effective antispasticity agent,&#xD;
      has been shown to have a unique pharmacokinetic profile [(i.e., nearly twice the&#xD;
      bioavailability/AUC), but with little or no increase in peak plasma levels (Cmax), as&#xD;
      compared to oral tizanidine (Zanaflex)]. When administered nightly to CP (Cerebral Palsy)&#xD;
      patients to more effectively reduce the muscle spasms that disrupt sleep, it was shown to&#xD;
      improve sleep efficiency, decrease sleep fragmentation and improve the sleep cycle. This&#xD;
      improvement in night-time sleep was translated into a potential improvement in next-day&#xD;
      functioning (improvement in next-day measures of spasticity and movement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that a similar type of improvement in sleep with consequent positive&#xD;
      impact on next day improvement in spasticity, cognition and function, may also be manifest in&#xD;
      a similar patient population, children with traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
