  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of weight-bearing physical activity in the development of diabetic foot ulcers&#xD;
      remains poorly understood. Regular participation in moderately intense physical activity&#xD;
      (e.g. brisk walking ) reduces 8-year cardiovascular mortality in those with diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      by over 30%. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends at least 30 minutes of daily&#xD;
      moderate intensity activity for people with diabetes. However, the ADA recommends that people&#xD;
      with diabetes and insensate feet, which affects up to 40% of those with diabetes, should&#xD;
      limit their walking because of concerns that walking could increase the risk of foot ulcers&#xD;
      and amputation. Firm evidence is lacking to support these concerns; in fact, while a research&#xD;
      fellow I conducted an observational study that showed daily weight-bearing activity may&#xD;
      reduce the risk of foot ulceration among people with diabetic foot problems. A controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial is needed to study these issues further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a randomized controlled trial in 100 older adults with diabetes and&#xD;
      insensate feet, 50 of whom will participate in an individually-tailored behavior-change&#xD;
      intervention called &quot;Feet First&quot;, and 50 of whom will be controls. The intervention is based&#xD;
      on the extensively-tested CHAMPS model used by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Active&#xD;
      for Life Program. Feet First extends the target population beyond older adults generally to&#xD;
      people with insensate feet due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether Feet First intervention subjects achieve a greater increase in&#xD;
           weight-bearing activity than control subjects, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain preliminary evidence on intervention subjects' foot outcomes (foot function,&#xD;
           foot-related self-care, and risk of foot ulcers), compared to control subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Physical activity is a vital component of self-management for patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, yet there are special problems in patients whose disease is complicated by&#xD;
      insensate feet (i.e. loss of protective sensation caused by diabetic distal symmetric sensory&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy). Foot ulcers develop in 15% of the 17 million people in the United&#xD;
      States with diabetes mellitus, and contribute to 84% of foot or toe amputations. Foot ulcer&#xD;
      risk is very high among those with insensate feet. Although the roles of neuropathy, plantar&#xD;
      foot pressure, and footwear in foot ulcers have been extensively studied, the independent&#xD;
      role of physical activity has not. The overall goal of this study is to determine whether a&#xD;
      &quot;lifestyle&quot; physical activity intervention, based on the Second Community Healthy Activities&#xD;
      Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS II), which we call FEET FIRST, can be used to safely&#xD;
      increase moderate-intensity physical activity (achieving at least 40% of maximal oxygen&#xD;
      consumption, as in walking briskly) among people with diabetes and insensate feet.&#xD;
      &quot;Lifestyle&quot; physical activity interventions help participants to accumulate at least 30&#xD;
      minutes of self-selected activities in short bouts during the day. CHAMPS II effectively and&#xD;
      safely increased physical activity in sedentary older adults with multiple chronic illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substantial research has also found that people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy are also&#xD;
      at increased risk of falls. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy also leads to postural&#xD;
      instability, i.e. impairment in measures of functional dynamic balance. Moreover, this&#xD;
      instability worsens with age. People with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in particular tend&#xD;
      to have ankle instability due to decreased proprioception, making them less able to rapidly&#xD;
      recover balance during sudden ankle dorsiflexion, inversion or eversion when walking on&#xD;
      uneven surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is ample evidence that promotion of an active lifestyle and specific exercises&#xD;
      targeting endurance, strength and balance improves reduces functional decline in the elderly,&#xD;
      and that home-based exercise programs effectively decrease fall risk in the elderly as well.&#xD;
      One small, non-randomized trial found preliminary evidence that a 3-week intervention that&#xD;
      focused on ankle strength improved balance measures in those with diabetic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy. However, no randomized studies have investigated the effect of a physical&#xD;
      activity intervention on fall risk in community-dwelling people with diabetic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, who may also be at increased risk of cutaneous injuries (i.e. foot lesions)&#xD;
      during weight-bearing activity. Before we unequivocally recommend to people with diabetic&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy that they engage in exercise, we need to determine that this will be&#xD;
      safe for their feet, and not increase fall risk.&#xD;
