      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide more insight on the modulation of inflammation and matrix degrading factors&#xD;
           in serum and urine by leflunomide in early , active patients with RA and to validate the&#xD;
           sensitivity of DEMRI (Dynamic Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in detecting&#xD;
           inflammatory changes in active RA in response to treatment with leflunomide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect of leflunomide therapy on physical function improvement and Quality of life&#xD;
