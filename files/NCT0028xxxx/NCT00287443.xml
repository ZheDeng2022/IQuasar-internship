      Our specific aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AIM 1. Characterization of glucose tolerance, nutritional and clinical status,&#xD;
           socioeconomic status, family history of diabetes and genotype in Hispanic CF children&#xD;
           compared to Caucasian CF children. Each child will undergo a two-hour oral glucose&#xD;
           tolerance test and will be categorized by glucose tolerance according to standards set&#xD;
           forth by the 1998 CF Consensus Conference on Diabetes. Nutritional status will be&#xD;
           determined by three-day food journals and intake will be compared to energy needs&#xD;
           measured by indirect calorimetry. Socio-economic status will be calculated from reported&#xD;
           family income and medical insurance coverage. Genotyping will be done at the laboratory&#xD;
           of Dr. Arthur Beaudet at Baylor College of Medicine. Clinical status will be measured&#xD;
           using modified NIH scores. Family history for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes will be&#xD;
           obtained in Spanish by Dr.Vanderwel. This specific aim tests the hypothesis that glucose&#xD;
           intolerance /frank CF related diabetes occurs at a younger age in Hispanics than in&#xD;
           Caucasians with CF, and is correlated to family history of diabetes and clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AIM 2. Characterization of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Previous studies&#xD;
           in adults have described peripheral insulin resistance as a major cause of CF related&#xD;
           diabetes, yet studies have not been conducted in children. Studies in adults and&#xD;
           children without CF suggest that insulin resistance occurs more frequently in Hispanics.&#xD;
           We will measure insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity using the frequently sampled&#xD;
           intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and the minimal model analysis of Bergman, as&#xD;
           modified for children. This specific aim tests the hypothesis that Hispanic children&#xD;
           with CF have worse peripheral insulin resistance, but similar insulin secretion when&#xD;
           compared to Caucasian children with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. AIM 3. Quantification of post-absorptive gluconeogenesis and whole body protein&#xD;
           turnover. Total hepatic glucose production (HGP) will be measured using&#xD;
           [6,6-2H2]glucose. We will quantify gluconeogenesis by measurement of the incorporation&#xD;
           of 2H into the 2nd, 5th and 6th carbons of glucose following 2H20 administration method&#xD;
           of Landau). We will determine whole body protein turnover using the stable isotopes&#xD;
           [1-13C]leucine and will measure serum amino acid levels. This specific aim tests the&#xD;
           hypothesis that gluconeogenesis and whole body protein turnover are disproportionately&#xD;
           higher in Hispanic children and adolescents with CF than in Caucasian CF children.&#xD;

      We will recruit 12 Hispanic prepubertal children with CF (ages 7-12, Tanner I) and 12&#xD;
      Hispanic adolescents (ages 15-17, Tanner 3 or 4) from the CF Centers at University of Texas&#xD;
      Southwestern and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Information obtained from these&#xD;
      subjects will be compared to 12 prepubertal and 12 adolescent Caucasian children with CF&#xD;
      recruited from the same CF centers. We will categorize the subjects according to glucose&#xD;
      tolerance (OGTT), as well as insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity using the IVGTT and&#xD;
      the Minimal Model, as modified for children. We will also compare the historical information&#xD;
      of socio-economic status and family history. Clinical status will be characterized by&#xD;
      measuring pulmonary function and modified NIH scores, in addition to measuring levels of&#xD;
      circulating cytokines. Gluconeogenesis (GNG) will be quantified by measuring the&#xD;
      incorporation 2H into the 2nd, 5th and 6th carbons of glucose. Whole body protein turnover&#xD;
      (WBPT) will be measured using [1-13C]leucine. Nutritional status will be determined by&#xD;
      three-day food journals, and intake will be compared to energy needs, utilizing indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry to measure resting energy expenditure. Subjects will be recruited from the CF&#xD;
      centers at the University of Texas- Southwestern and the South Central CF Consortium.&#xD;
