  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, crossover trial of allopurinol&#xD;
      for the treatment of children with newly diagnosed essential hypertension.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a double-blinded crossover trial. We will recruit 40 children between the&#xD;
      ages of 12 and 18 years, from the pediatric renal and hypertension programs at Texas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital. The study consists of four phases, a screening phase a treatment phase,&#xD;
      an interim washout phase and a crossover phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening phase will last between 1 and 2 weeks. Patients will be provided with a digital&#xD;
      blood pressure monitor with an appropriately sized cuff and be instructed to perform daily&#xD;
      blood pressure measurements and keep a blood pressure log. This will detect severe&#xD;
      hypertension that needs immediate attention and identify patients or families in which&#xD;
      compliance problems likely to compromise data collection. Blood tests will be done to&#xD;
      determine eligibility based on clinical laboratory parameters and 10ml of blood will be sent&#xD;
      to the research laboratory for measurement of erythropoetin, ADMA, MCP-1 and possibly other&#xD;
      modulators of vascular tone. Girls who are post-menarche will have a urine or serum pregnancy&#xD;
      test. Prior to the initiation of any study procedures, informed consent and child assent (if&#xD;
      appropriate) will be obtained from the participant and parents. Immediately prior to the&#xD;
      initiation of the treatment or placebo phase 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
      (ABPM #1) will be performed. Urinary nitrates and protein to creatinine ratio will be&#xD;
      measured as surrogates for NOS activation and ongoing renal damage. At the end of the&#xD;
      screening phase, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either placebo or allopurinol&#xD;
      for the active phase. Children will receive the other during the crossover phase. The purpose&#xD;
      of this blinding is to remove either participant or investigator bias from the acquisition of&#xD;
      the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Phase: The active phase will last six weeks and include a clinic visit on the first&#xD;
      day of the phase, laboratory testing between day 4 and 7, and telephone contact halfway&#xD;
      through the phase. At the clinic visit, patients will receive their study medication&#xD;
      (allopurinol or placebo) in a bottle prepared by the investigational pharmacy. Subjects on&#xD;
      allopurinol will receive 10 mg/kg divided bid (maximum of 400mg). Laboratory tests will be&#xD;
      performed 4 to 7 days after starting the medication to screen for hepatic or bone marrow&#xD;
      toxicity (AST, ALT, CBC) and serum uric acid. Evidence for toxicity will cause un-blinding&#xD;
      and withdrawal from the study. The families will also be instructed to continue the daily&#xD;
      blood pressure log started in the screening phase. Twenty-four-hour ABPM and end of phase&#xD;
      laboratory tests including, hemoglobin, serum uric acid, erythropoetin, ADMA, MCP-1 and&#xD;
      urinary nitrates will be performed at the conclusion of the active phase, prior to&#xD;
      discontinuing the study medication for the washout phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washout Phase: Upon completion of the ABPM at the end of the active phase, the study&#xD;
      medication will be discontinued. The families will continue the home BP logs. The washout&#xD;
      phase will end when either the child meets criteria for hypertension or two weeks have&#xD;
      elapsed since completion of the previous phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossover Phase: The crossover phase will identical in procedures to the active phase except&#xD;
      that the medication will be that which was not previously received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit: Upon completion of both arms the subjects will have a final clinic visit.&#xD;
      The laboratory tests will be repeated and if the third ABPM is not complete it will be&#xD;
      initiated. Conventional antihypertensive therapy will be discussed and initiated if&#xD;
      appropriate. Routine follow up will be established for management of the child's hypertension&#xD;
      and other medical problems.&#xD;
