  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center study designed to compare differences&#xD;
      in rates of myonecrosis (measured as an elevation of CK-MB ratio ≥ 2 times ULN) within 24&#xD;
      hours following low-medium risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in aspirin or&#xD;
      clopidogrel non-responsive patients who are randomized to heparin with or without&#xD;
      eptifibatide therapy during PCI. The primary objective of this study is to determine if the&#xD;
      use of eptifibatide is associated with a significant difference in post-PCI myonecrosis&#xD;
      (measured as an elevation of CK-MB ratio ≥ 2 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) within 24&#xD;
      hours of low-medium risk PCI in patients who are aspirin or non-responsive as determined by&#xD;
      VerifyNow Aspirin and P2Y12 testing.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the use of eptifibatide is associated&#xD;
      with a significant difference in post-PCI myonecrosis (measured as an elevation of CK-MB&#xD;
      ratio ≥ 2 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) within 24 hours of low-medium risk PCI in&#xD;
      patients who are aspirin or clopidogrel non-responsive as determined by VerifyNow Aspirin and&#xD;
      P2Y12 testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study objectives will include an assessment of safety. These safety determinations&#xD;
      will be determined by monitoring the rates of MACE (defined as death, MI, ischemic&#xD;
      [non-hemorrhagic] stroke and urgent revascularization by repeat PCI or CABG), bleeding&#xD;
      events, rate of bailout procedures performed, elevations of CK-MB ratio (in the range of 3 to&#xD;
      5 times ULN and greater than 5 times ULN) and elevations of troponin I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center study designed to compare differences&#xD;
      in rates of myonecrosis (measured as an elevation of CK-MB ratio ≥ 2 times ULN) within 24&#xD;
      hours following low-medium risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in aspirin or&#xD;
      clopidogrel non-responsive patients who are randomized to heparin with or without&#xD;
      eptifibatide therapy during PCI. All subjects must also be pretreated with clopidogrel&#xD;
      (300-600 mg) at least 2 hours before PCI. Study subjects will be randomized to either&#xD;
      eptifibatide and unfractionated heparin or unfractionated heparin and placebo. Study subject&#xD;
      randomization in aspirin non-responsive patients will be stratified based upon clopidogrel&#xD;
      responsiveness.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with coronary artery disease will be eligible for the study. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
        are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is 21 years or older. Patient is scheduled to undergo low-medium risk percutaneous&#xD;
        coronary intervention in native coronary vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient self-reports that he/she has received aspirin ≥ 81 mg at least 4 hours prior to&#xD;
        study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is defined as aspirin non-responsive based upon results of the VerifyNow™ Aspirin&#xD;
        test, defined as an aspirin reaction units (ARU) &gt; 475.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is defined as clopidogrel non-responsive based upon the results of the VerifyNow&#xD;
        P2Y12 test, defined as less than 20% inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient will be treated with 300- 600 mg of clopidogrel at least two hours before the&#xD;
        intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients will provide written informed consent, and the study protocol will be approved&#xD;
        by the IRB of the participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is male, or is a non-pregnant female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

        abnormal ECG that is believed to be non-acute (i.e., STTW abnormalities secondary to LVH,&#xD;
        digoxin, or prior remote infarction), a second electrocardiogram 30 min apart is required&#xD;

&#xD;
        The target lesion(s) is located in a venous bypass graft. The patient has a chronic&#xD;
        occlusion (present for longer than 3 months). The target lesion(s) has visible thrombus (by&#xD;
        angiography). The patient has had a suspected aortic dissection. Patient has left&#xD;
        ventricular ejection (LVEF) &lt; 30%. Patient was receiving oral anticoagulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient received any of the following drugs during 7 days prior to enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  any GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;

        bleeding or bleeding diathesis. Patient has experienced trauma or major surgery in the&#xD;
        preceding month. Patient has severe, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure of&#xD;
        more than 180 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient's creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl prior to PCI. Patient has a hemoglobin level of less than&#xD;
        10.0 g per deciliter or a hematocrit below 30 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient has a platelet count of less than 100,000 per cubic millimeter or more than 600,000&#xD;
        per cubic millimeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Of note, patients on chronic clopidogrel will only be eligible for VerifyNow P2Y12 testing.&#xD;
        Clopidogrel non-responsiveness in this group will be defined as &lt; 20% inhibition&#xD;
