  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that in fluoxetine (Prozac)-resistant adolescents&#xD;
      with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Lamotrigine plus fluoxetine will be safe and as&#xD;
      effective as sertraline (Zoloft).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Primary Aim is to determine the efficacy and safety of Lamotrigine-augmentation of&#xD;
      fluoxetine for treatment-resistant depression in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Secondary Aims are to characterize the factors associated with treatment-resistance for&#xD;
      adolescents with major depression. Also to assess the relationships in the families of&#xD;
      adolescents with major depression as they enter treatment, and to track the differences in&#xD;
      family relationships for adolescents who respond or do not respond. We postulate that tense,&#xD;
      frustrated, irritable, and over-involved relationships constitute a risk factor for&#xD;
      attenuated improvement or relapse.&#xD;

      Mood disorders in youth, which include Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder&#xD;
      (BPD), are highly prevalent, and are associated with significant mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      Many youths with major depression fail first-line treatments with psychotherapy and&#xD;
      psychotropic medications. Lamotrigine (LamictalÂ®) recently gained approval by the FDA for&#xD;
      maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder in adults. A few pilot studies have also shown&#xD;
      promising results for lamotrigine (LTG) in treatment refractory mood disorders in both youth&#xD;
      and adults, especially for depressive symptoms (Carandang et al., 2003; Frye et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this proposed study, the modified design begins with adolescents with major depressive&#xD;
      disorder who have not responded to a trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor&#xD;
      antidepressant (SSRI), fluoxetine, of adequate dose and duration, and randomizes them either&#xD;
      to a second SSRI or to fluoxetine augmented by lamotrigine. Non-responders to 8 weeks of&#xD;
      fluoxetine, on at least 40 mg/day, who have not had to discontinue fluoxetine because of&#xD;
      adverse effects, would be randomized to: (A) continue fluoxetine with lamotrigine&#xD;
      augmentation, for 8 weeks, as in the active arm of the original Stage 2, or (B) discontinue&#xD;
      fluoxetine and begin a second SSRI, for 8 weeks. We will use sertraline as the second SSRI,&#xD;
      because of the data supporting efficacy from the randomized placebo-controlled trial by&#xD;
      Wagner, et.al. (JAMA, '03). Citalopram is also a possibility (Wagner et.al, Am J. Psychiatry&#xD;
      '04), but it has been in use for a shorter period of time than sertraline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain the blind, the B group will receive placebo augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments and outcome measures would be the same as in the original study. We will&#xD;
      consult with primary care offices to coach them through doing the initial, Stage 1,&#xD;
      fluoxetine trial in their offices, and we will monitor the progress of adolescents started on&#xD;
      fluoxetine in our clinic. Consent will be discussed only with those who are not responding,&#xD;
      and treatment in the study will involve only the post-randomization treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mood disorders in youth are common and debilitating. Early-onset of mood disorders often&#xD;
      indicates a severe illness, with high likelihood of recurrence into adulthood. For&#xD;
      prepubertal children, point prevalence of MDD is 2%, and 6% in adolescents, while the&#xD;
      lifetime prevalence for MDD in adolescents is 20% (Birmaher et al., 2002). The duration of a&#xD;
      Major Depressive Episode in youth ranges from 3 to 9 months, with 10% lasting more than 2&#xD;
      years, 60-70% recurring in adulthood, and 20-40% developing Bipolar Disorder within 5 years&#xD;
      (Weller and Weller, 2000). The prevalence of prepubertal bipolar disorder is estimated at&#xD;
      0.5%. Prevalence of bipolar disorder in adolescents is 1% (Lewinshon et al., 1995). Suicide&#xD;
      is the third leading cause of death in the 15 - 24 year old age group (10.1 per 100,000) and&#xD;
      the fifth leading cause in the 5 - 14 year old group (0.7 per 100,00), and is highly&#xD;
      correlated with MDD and BPD (Pfeffer, 2002). In addition, mood disorders in youth can impair&#xD;
      functioning, often characterized by poor school performance, impaired relationships,&#xD;
      delinquent behavior, and substance abuse.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adolescents (13-17) diagnosed with a major depressive episode (MDE) (DSM-IV criteria)&#xD;
             from either major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BPD). BPD can present&#xD;
             as a major depressive episode, with previous or subsequent cycling into a hypomanic,&#xD;
             manic, or mixed episode. By definition, major depressive disorder MDD requires the&#xD;
             presence of a major depressive episode, without cycling into a hypomanic, manic, or&#xD;
             mixed episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. CDRS (Children's Depression Rating Scale) &gt; 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. CGAS (Children's Global Assessment Scale) &lt; 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adolescents who meet the following criteria will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior medically serious suicide attempt, within 3 months of enrollment into study or a&#xD;
             score of 3 on suicide questions within KSADS at initial visit or the side effect&#xD;
             checklist on follow up visits regarding current state.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known or suspected mental retardation. For patients with known mental retardation,&#xD;
             full scale IQ below 70 should be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current significant physical illnesses (e.g. diabetes mellitus, asthma, cystic&#xD;
             fibrosis, congenital heart defects, genetic disorders). Patients with seizure&#xD;
             disorders taking anticonvulsants will be excluded (no concomitant anticonvulsants).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current drug or alcohol abuse. No active abuse will be permitted within two weeks of&#xD;
             beginning the study trial (confirmed by urine testing in all cases of suspected&#xD;
             abuse).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females who are sexually active and are unwilling or considered unable to use&#xD;
             appropriate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of benzodiazepines and other anxiolytics, antipsychotic medications, other&#xD;
             antidepressants, stimulant medication, other mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium,&#xD;
             valproate), and other sedative-hypnotics will not be permitted&#xD;
