      The purpose of this study is to characterize the relationship of social stress, coping, and&#xD;
      self-regulatory health behaviors in the context of asthma disparities among African American&#xD;
      and low income populations.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a serious chronic condition affecting over 14 million Americans, but the prevalence&#xD;
      rates are higher in certain populations (e.g. 10% in inner-cities and 30% among the homeless&#xD;
      versus 5% in a general population of whites). African Americans and Hispanics from the&#xD;
      Northeast are twice as likely to die from asthma as whites. African Americans are four times&#xD;
      as likely to be hospitalized for asthma and are five times more likely than whites to seek&#xD;
      care for asthma at an emergency department. Reasons for these higher rates are not certain,&#xD;
      and most likely result from an interaction of risk factors, such as environmental exposures,&#xD;
      genetic predisposition, access to appropriate medical care, socioeconomic status, and&#xD;
      cultural health practices. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute supports a variety&#xD;
      of activities to address the pressing public health problems posed by asthma. However,&#xD;
      progress in reducing disparities has been disappointingly slow. Separate, independent&#xD;
      research projects have generated important clues for understanding the nature and scope of&#xD;
      the problem. A more coordinated, interdisciplinary and comprehensive approach to research is&#xD;
      needed to take advantage of these clues, move the science further and faster, and increase&#xD;
      our capacity to improve health outcomes among minority and economically disadvantaged&#xD;
      populations. Cooperative centers of research that foster partnerships among minority medical&#xD;
      centers, research intensive institutions, and the communities in which asthma patients live&#xD;
      will promote such advancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Request for Applications for the Centers for Reducing Asthma Disparities was released in&#xD;
      October 2001. The objective of the program is to promote partnerships (called centers)&#xD;
      between a minority serving institution (MSI) that may not have a strong research program and&#xD;
      a research intensive institution (RII) that has a track record of NIH-supported research and&#xD;
      patient care. The purpose of the partnership is to conduct collaborative research on asthma&#xD;
      disparities (i.e., greater prevalence of asthma, higher rates of morbidity due to asthma, and&#xD;
      lesser access or use of quality medical care among minorities and poor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will develop a collaborative research program between Northwestern University&#xD;
      Feinberg School of Medicine and Cook County Hospital to fully characterize the relationship&#xD;
      of social stress, coping, and self-regulatory health behaviors in the context of asthma&#xD;
      disparities among African American and low income populations. Once characterized, the&#xD;
      project will then develop and test an intervention strategy to reduce asthma disparities in&#xD;
      high-risk populations based on evidence-based models that have demonstrated success in social&#xD;
      work, nursing, and community interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four research aims for the center: (1) To develop and validate culturally&#xD;
      appropriate psychosocial instruments related to the underlying causes of disparity in asthma&#xD;
      morbidity; (2) To identify the structural relationships of psychosocial factors to other&#xD;
      known influential factors related to disparities in asthma outcomes; (3) To study the changes&#xD;
      in structural relationship among influential factors in asthma disparity over time, as&#xD;
      related to changes in health status; (4) To develop, pilot test, and field test a&#xD;
      community-based asthma team (peer coach, asthma nurse, and social worker) intervention to&#xD;
      enhance individuals ability to cope with chronic illness and improve asthma-related&#xD;
      behaviors. A second major goal of the Center will be to train and mentor new clinical&#xD;
      investigators and social scientists to be able to conduct research in this field of interest.&#xD;
