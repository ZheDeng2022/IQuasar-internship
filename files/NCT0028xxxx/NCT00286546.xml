      Context - As men age, testosterone levels decline leading to symptoms that overlap with the&#xD;
      symptoms of major depression. Little is known about the potential role of testosterone in the&#xD;
      treatment of major depression.Objective - To assess the levels of bioavailable testosterone&#xD;
      and total levels of testosterone in men diagnosed with major depressive disorder between the&#xD;
      ages of 40 and 65.Design, Setting and Participants - 50 men between the ages of 40 and 65 and&#xD;
      who suffer from major depressive disorder will be compared with 50 age matched healthy&#xD;
      controls in an outpatient hospital setting. Main Outcome Measures - Bioavailable testosterone&#xD;
      and total testosterone levels will be measured as well as blood pressure, pulse rate, height,&#xD;
      weight, waist and hip measurements. Medical and psychiatric history will be assessed by the&#xD;
      study physician. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be used to&#xD;
      administered by the physician to ensure that the patient meets the DSM-IV criteria for Major&#xD;
      Depression. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) will be used to assess depression&#xD;
      symptom severity. A Symptom/Side Effect Rating Scale will also be administered to measure the&#xD;
      presence and severity of side effects that each patient may be experiencing. In addition, the&#xD;
      SEX FX questionnaire will be administered. Each patient will be asked to complete a series of&#xD;
      self-report measures including the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale Questionnaire&#xD;
      (SASS), the Androgen Deficiency in Aging Males (ADAM) and the Beck Depression Inventory&#xD;
      (BDI-II).&#xD;

      This study will be carried our at the Mood Disorders Psychopharmacology Unit (MDPU),&#xD;
      University Health Network (UHN), University of Toronto, with the approval of the Research&#xD;
      Ethics Board (REB). Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects prior to study&#xD;
      enrollment.50 male subjects between the age of 40 and 65 will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      psychiatrist to assess whether each patient meets DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression using&#xD;
      the MINI and to obtain their medical and psychiatric history. In addition, the SEX FX&#xD;
      questionnaire (an instrument measuring sexual dysfunction) will be administered. Once each&#xD;
      patient has signed the informed consent document, the research staff will assess the severity&#xD;
      of depressive symptoms by administering the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17). A&#xD;
      Symptom/Side Effect Rating Scale will also be administered to measure the presence and&#xD;
      severity of side effects that each patient may be experiencing. Each patient will then have&#xD;
      pulse, blood pressure, weight, height, waist and hip measurements taken to evaluate their&#xD;
      health. Patients will be asked to provide blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine (about 1/4 cup)&#xD;
      samples for laboratory tests (bioavailable testosterone, LH, thyroid and prolactin). The&#xD;
      blood samples will be obtained in the morning between 0800 and 1100 hr. Each patient will&#xD;
      then be asked to complete a series of self-report measures including the SASS, the ADAM, and&#xD;
      the Beck Depression Inventory.The 50 healthy controls will have a structured diagnostic&#xD;
      interview (MINI) administered by the coordinator to obtain their psychiatric and medical&#xD;
      history. They will undergo all laboratory tests required of the depressed population and all&#xD;
      rating scales mentioned above will be completed with this population as well. Each patient is&#xD;
      free to withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
