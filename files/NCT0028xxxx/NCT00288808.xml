  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last few decades there has been an increased use of Warfarin in the pediatric&#xD;
      population stemming from the use of mechanical heart valves and palliative surgical&#xD;
      procedures requiring anticoagulation therapy. Other patients with enzymatic deficiency within&#xD;
      the coagulation cascade may develop thrombosis treated with anticoagulation, i.e. factor V&#xD;
      Leiden deficiency. Prevention of poor outcome from thrombosis has required closer monitoring&#xD;
      in the pediatric patient. In addition, absorption of Warfarin in the pediatric population is&#xD;
      highly variable and depends on the child's age, weight, diet, and concurrent use of other&#xD;
      medications (Desai, 2000). This makes achieving anticoagulation very difficult. &quot;Because of&#xD;
      the intrinsic differences in the coagulation systems in children and adults, guidelines for&#xD;
      antithrombotic therapy in adults cannot be extrapolated to pediatrics&quot; (Desai, 2000).&#xD;
      Therefore, pediatric patients on anticoagulation therapy require frequent lab work to monitor&#xD;
      their prothrombin time and international ratios (PT/INR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of barriers to care when discussing anticoagulation therapy for pediatric&#xD;
      patients. Frequent venous blood draws represent a painful procedure that elicit anxiety and&#xD;
      fear which leads to noncompliance. In addition, children are more difficult to obtain blood&#xD;
      samples because of smaller vessels, patient movement during procedure, and the volume of&#xD;
      blood that is required for the test. Other barriers include the time delay from when the&#xD;
      patient has the lab work drawn, to when the result get to the provider for any patient care&#xD;
      decisions to be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of Point of Care devices available for near-patient testing of the&#xD;
      PT/InR's that requires only a finger stick. These monitors have been validated against&#xD;
      standardized laboratory testing, in order for the monitor to be certified by the FDA. Similar&#xD;
      studies to validate finger stick methods in pediatric patients have not been completed. The&#xD;
      aim of this project is to validate the accuracy of Hemosense, a point of care device, to&#xD;
      venous blood PT/InR level in the pediatric population.&#xD;
