      Based on these recent observations and findings in this new animal model of pigmentary&#xD;
      glaucoma in the DBA/2J mouse, we propose that immune system abnormalities in the anterior&#xD;
      chamber may play a possible role in the development of pigmentary glaucoma and possibly&#xD;
      primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in humans.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to establish, through tissue and aqueous analysis of patients with pigmentary&#xD;
      glaucoma, POAG and normal controls, that markers for anterior chamber autoimmune dysfunction&#xD;
      occur in significantly different amounts in patients with these conditions when compared to&#xD;
      normal controls. We also will attempt to establish, through proven methodologies of tissue&#xD;
      gene expression, that the source of these differences in markers, notably PEDF and IL-18, is&#xD;
      from the uveal tissues of the anterior chamber, most importantly the iris and possibly the&#xD;
      trabecular meshwork as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual etiology at the cellular level of elevated intraocular pressure and the&#xD;
      development of pigmentary glaucoma is not well understood in humans. If anterior chamber&#xD;
      immune dysfunction were shown to be an important factor in the development of this disease in&#xD;
      humans, which apparently is demonstrated by the DBA/2J mouse, it would lead to an important&#xD;
      area of further investigation and possible novel approaches in treating or preventing this&#xD;
      disease in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that in patients with pigmentary glaucoma, the amount of PEDF in the aqueous&#xD;
      is significantly reduced while IL-18 is significantly elevated when compared to the aqueous&#xD;
      of normal controls. In patients with POAG, we hypothesize similar results for PEDF, although&#xD;
      significantly less reduction of PEDF when compared to the pigmentary glaucoma patients may be&#xD;
      an interesting finding as well. With regard to IL-18, it is possible that amounts would be&#xD;
      significantly elevated in the pigmentary glaucoma patients when compared to both normal&#xD;
      controls and POAG patients. In view of the results from the DBA/2J mouse model, we hope to&#xD;
      determine whether expression of PEDF could be down regulated in the iris and/or trabecular&#xD;
      meshwork of pigmentary glaucoma patients when compared to POAG patients and whether IL-18&#xD;
      expression in these tissues could be up regulated in pigmentary glaucoma patients when&#xD;
      compared to POAG patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such findings would strongly suggest that anterior chamber immune abnormalities play a role&#xD;
      in the etiology of pigmentary glaucoma in humans. It already has been suggested that&#xD;
      decreased amounts and expression of PEDF are found in patients with glaucoma and other&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases of the eye. However, the source of the decreased expression has&#xD;
      not been identified. If IL-18 production is elevated in pigmentary glaucoma and is up&#xD;
      regulated in the anterior chamber structures of the eye in human patients with the disease,&#xD;
      this also would be highly suggestive that localized anterior chamber immune dysfunction plays&#xD;
      a role in the development of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on our findings, additional investigations of autoimmune dysregulation in&#xD;
      pigmentary glaucoma (and perhaps other secondary glaucomas) may help determine the predictive&#xD;
      value of such markers in identifying whether or not patients with pigment dispersion syndrome&#xD;
      develop glaucomatous damage.&#xD;

        Patients in the study will be between 18 and 85 years old. To prevent any possibility that&#xD;
        previous manipulation of the iris and uveal structures may affect results of the assays,&#xD;
        patients with any previous intraocular surgery or laser iridotomies will be excluded.&#xD;
        Patients who have undergone laser trabeculoplasty within 90 days of surgery also will be&#xD;
        excluded. In the normal controls undergoing cataract surgery, patients with signs of&#xD;
        pigment dispersion syndrome or exfoliation syndrome without glaucoma will be excluded from&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;
