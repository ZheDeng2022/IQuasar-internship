      This research is being done to find how soon the liver cancer may come back and whether&#xD;
      proteins or genes in tumor, blood or urine can give us clues of early recurrence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world1. HCC risk&#xD;
      increases drastically in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, hepatitis C infection&#xD;
      or liver cirrhosis. HCC is very prevalent in our region due to endemic hepatitis B infection&#xD;
      and increasing incidence of hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HCC have very poor prognosis because HCC tumors are usually non-symptomatic.&#xD;
      Most patients will not be diagnosed until the disease has reached an advanced stage.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy may offer palliative benefit to some patients with advanced HCC but has not been&#xD;
      shown to prolong survival in these patients. HCC patients are in need for innovative and&#xD;
      targeted therapies. Therefore, we propose to study gefitinib as an adjuvant therapy in&#xD;
      patients with resected HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gefitinib blocks the function of epidermal growth factor receptor which is a key factor in&#xD;
      stimulating liver cancer growth. In mice, gefitinib has been shown to reduce the size of&#xD;
      liver cancer. It also had anti tumor activity in patients with various cancers including HCC.&#xD;
      Gefitinib can relieve disease-related symptoms in these patients. Overall, gefitinib is a&#xD;
      very well tolerated treatment and is suitable for long-term use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of diagnosis and surgical evaluation, patients with resectable hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma will be asked to participate in this study.Patients will be registered after&#xD;
      consent form is obtained. Patient is asked to donate tumor tissues, urine and blood&#xD;
      samples.Tumor and normal specimens are collected at the time of surgery. After patient&#xD;
      recovers from surgery (4-6 weeks) and fulfills the eligibility, patient will receive&#xD;
      gefitinib 250 mg p.o. daily for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will remain on study till completion of treatment. The following are conditions when&#xD;
      your study doctor will remove you from the study or stop the therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interruption of treatment for 4 consecutive weeks due to side effects, which do not&#xD;
           resolve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. withdraw of consent by patient. ii. Your disease becomes worse. iii. New information&#xD;
           that gefitinib treatment is harmful to patients has become available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be evaluated at one month, 3 months and 6 months on gefitinib. After that,&#xD;
      evaluate patient at least every 3 months for first 2 years, then every 6 months for next 3&#xD;
      years, then yearly afterwards. Draw blood and store sera and urine at the same interval until&#xD;
      relapse and/or death. Conduct correlative studies of urine, serum and tumor tissue with&#xD;
      clinical outcome.&#xD;
