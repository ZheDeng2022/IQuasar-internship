      Penetration of cefpirome and moxifloaxacin into abscess fluid of humans will be tested.&#xD;
      Patients with an abscess scheduled for drainage will receive study drugs (single or multiple&#xD;
      dose), pus samples and plasma samples will be collected and analyzed by High pressure liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (HPLC). Pharmacokinetics of the study drugs in pus and plasma will be&#xD;

      Title: Plasma and abscess fluid pharmacokinetics of cefpirome and moxifloxacin single dose&#xD;
      and multiple dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Extensive research in the field of abscess treatment has established a claim for&#xD;
      invasive drainage as the most efficient means of resolving suppurative lesions. In&#xD;
      particular, computer tomography-guided percutaneous abscess drainage has repeatedly been&#xD;
      reported to be advantageous compared to other invasive methods. However, application of the&#xD;
      percutaneous interventional method is subject to some limitations. Coagulation abnormalities&#xD;
      are considered a contraindication, and the absence of a safe anatomic access route, the&#xD;
      presence of fistulas, severe inflammation of organs, or patients with advanced age have&#xD;
      likewise been linked to low success rates of percutaneous abscess drainage. From these&#xD;
      considerations, it becomes evident that percutaneous and surgical abscess drainage alone are&#xD;
      not satisfactory in a number of patients suffering from abscess/infected cyst-related&#xD;
      disease. In some patients antibiotic therapy is administered in bridging them to more stable&#xD;
      conditions that drainage can be performed. Therefore, it is eminent for the overall outcome&#xD;
      of patients to select an appropriate antibiotic. For this purpose, a model was recently&#xD;
      developed to simulate the concentration time-curve of fosfomycin in abscess fluid after a&#xD;
      single dose and after multiple doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cefpirome and moxifloxacin are drugs which may be used in the empiric therapy of purulent&#xD;
      infections. They may be used as monotherapy or they may be combined, e.g. with fosfomycin.&#xD;
      Cefpirome is a 4th class cephalosporin with a broad spectrum (gram positive and gram negative&#xD;
      pathogens), penetrating well into soft tissues. Moxifloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone with a&#xD;
      considerable antimicrobial spectrum, also penetrating excellently into soft tissues. Based on&#xD;
      the experiences with the methods and results obtained from our recent study on fosfomycin&#xD;
      penetration into abscess fluid, the present pilot study will be set out to gain PK&#xD;
      information on the penetration properties of cefpirome and moxifloxacin into abscess fluid&#xD;
      and abdominal cysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: To determine pharmacokinetics of cefpirome and moxifloxacin in abscess&#xD;
      (cyst) fluid and plasma after single and multiple doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Pharmacokinetic pilot study. Drug concentrations will be determined in abscess&#xD;
      liquid upon drainage and in plasma over a period of eight hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 20 Patients with an abscess or an abdominal cyst, scheduled for surgical or&#xD;
      computer tomography-guided drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 1) High pressure liquid chromatography 2) Analysis of computer tomography (CT)&#xD;
      images 3) Pharmacokinetic simulation model&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drugs: Cefpirome (Cefrom, Aventis): will be administered to patients intravenously as&#xD;
      single or multiple doses of 2 g dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water over 20 minutes.&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin (Avelox, Bayer): will be administered to patients per os as tablet as single or&#xD;
      multiple doses of 400 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: A total of 20 patients will be enrolled in the study. They will be assigned to 2&#xD;
      groups. Group 1: single dose (n = 12), Group 2: multiple doses (n = 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome variable: The cefpirome and moxifloxacin concentrations in abscess fluid will be&#xD;
      measured. Considering plasma PK and the ratio of the surface to volume ratio of the abscess,&#xD;
      the individual concentration-versus-time curve in abscess (cyst) fluid will be calculated.&#xD;
      Individual pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined for abscess (cyst) fluid after a&#xD;
      single dose and at steady state: AUC, AUC0-12/24h, Cmax, Tmax, t1/2ß, Cav(ss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional outcome variables: Plasma (single dose and steady state): AUC, AUC0-12/24h, Cmax,&#xD;
      Tmax, t1/2ß, Cav(ss). Pus and plasma: ratios of AUC and Cav(ss) to MIC, T&gt;MIC The following&#xD;
      parameters will be determined if possible: the diameter of the pericapsular space with&#xD;
      enrichment of contrast agent, the degree of contrast agent enhancement in this zone and the&#xD;
      pus density, rate of drug degradation in pus at body temperature in vitro, pH-value of pus,&#xD;
      pus viscosity and specific weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inconveniences and risks for patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following side effects may occur after administration of cefpirome: Hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reaction, allergic skin reactions, exanthema, urticaria, pruritus, drug fever, anaphylactic&#xD;
      reactions, anaphylactic shock, interstitial nephritis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,&#xD;
      diarrhoea, pseudomembraneous colitis, elevation of liver enzymes and serum creatinine,&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, local&#xD;
      irritation and pain at the site of injection, dysgeusia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following side effects may occur after administration of moxifloxacin:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often or occasionally: Nausea, diarrhea, vomits, dyspepsia, QT-prolongation, elevation of&#xD;
      AST, ALT, bilirubin, gamma GT, amylase, leucocytopenia, decrease of prothrombin,&#xD;
      eosinophilia, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, abdominal and head pain, dizziness,&#xD;
      dysgeusia; unfrequent: asthenia, candidosis, thoracal and back pain, discomfort, leg pain,&#xD;
      anaphylactic reactions, anaphylactic shock, insomnia, vortex, nervousness, tremor,&#xD;
      paresthesia, discomposure, depression, hallucination, depersonalization, ataxia, xerostomia,&#xD;
      flatulence, obstipation, anorexia, stomatitis, glossitis, tachycardia, edema, hypertension,&#xD;
      palpitations, QT-prolongation, syncope, atrial fibrillation, angina pectoris, vasodilatation,&#xD;
      hypotension, ventricular arrhythmia, torsade de pointe, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
      elevation of prothromin, icterus, arthralgia, myalgia, tendonitis, rash, pruritus,&#xD;
      perspiration, urticaria, xerodermia, amblyopia, tinnitus, vaginitis, hepatitis, ataxia,&#xD;
      tendon rupture, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, neutropenia, hemolysis, transient loss of&#xD;
      vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total blood loss will be limited to a maximum of 85 mL, which is usually well tolerated by&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/benefit assessment: CT and abscess drainage represent standard diagnosis and therapeutic&#xD;
      procedures. Therefore, any risk associated with CT or abscess drainage is not ascribed to&#xD;
      study procedures. Single and multiple doses of cefpirome (maximum of 14 doses) and&#xD;
      moxifloxacin (maximum of 7 doses) are normally well tolerated and have very few side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing therapy will not be affected or changed by study procedures. In summary, the risk&#xD;
      conferred to patients by study procedures appears minimal.&#xD;
