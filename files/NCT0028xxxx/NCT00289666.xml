      This study is designed to determine the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) on heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).&#xD;

      Visit 1: You will come to the Diabetes and Metabolic Research Center having refrained from&#xD;
      taking your routine medications and having not eaten in the last 8 hours, avoided using&#xD;
      caffeine-containing beverages and tobacco products in the last 10 hours, and having had no&#xD;
      alcoholic beverages in the last 24 hours. In addition, you should refrain from taking any&#xD;
      nonprescription drugs and avoid engaging in any vigorous exercise for 48 hours before&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those individuals who have diabetes, a letter or direct verbal permission will be&#xD;
      obtained, prior to coming to this study visit, from your eye doctor indicating that you can&#xD;
      take part in one of the tests listed below. During this visit, an electrocardiogram (EKG,&#xD;
      usual heart rhythm test performed in a doctor's office) will be performed. Your heart rate&#xD;
      will also be measured for six minutes with an EKG machine while breathing as deeply as&#xD;
      possible. This test, which will be performed twice, will tell whether or not the nerves that&#xD;
      go to the heart are normal. You will be asked to blow into a plastic tube for 15 seconds&#xD;
      (this is the test for which we will obtain the eye doctor's permission for individuals with&#xD;
      diabetes). Your heart rate will be measured during and for 60 seconds after you have finished&#xD;
      blowing. This test, which will be performed twice, will tell if the nerves that go to blood&#xD;
      vessels are normal. Your blood pressure will be measured four times, one minute apart, while&#xD;
      you are lying down. You will then be asked to stand up and your blood pressure will again be&#xD;
      measured four more times, each time one minute apart. Change in your heart rate will also be&#xD;
      determined as you go from lying down to standing. All individuals will have a fingerstick&#xD;
      blood sugar level performed prior to the performance of the tests describe above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have about 2 tablespoons of blood drawn. This blood will be stored (frozen) in case&#xD;
      possible risk factors of reduced heart rate variability are discovered in the future. A&#xD;
      random urine sample will be stored (frozen) for potential examination for microalbuminuria&#xD;
      (protein in the urine) or other possible risk factors. At this visit, we will give you a&#xD;
      container with instructions for collecting urine for 24-hours. You will also be given some&#xD;
      dietary suggestions (e.g., eating a liberal salt diet) that we would like you to follow for&#xD;
      3-days prior to the 24-hour collection of urine. For individuals with diabetes, a small&#xD;
      portion of blood will be checked to determine your blood sugar control level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard medical history questions will be asked during this visit along with questions that&#xD;
      assess the likelihood of you falling asleep in various situations. Your medical records from&#xD;
      your pulmonary doctor will be reviewed for information about the results of the sleep study&#xD;
      you had that determined you have a sleep disorder. You will be asked to keep a diary&#xD;
      everyday, for the first six weeks, of how many hours per night you use the treatment for your&#xD;
      sleep disorder. This visit will last approximately 1-1 ½ hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Within 1-48 hours of completion of the 24-hour urine collection and before you begin&#xD;
      treatment for your sleep disorder, you will need to bring the urine specimen to the Diabetes&#xD;
      and Metabolic Research Center. A part of this urine will be stored (frozen) for possible&#xD;
      testing of a hormone called aldosterone, substances filtered by the kidneys (salt and&#xD;
      creatinine), and other potential risk factors. Also at this visit, about 2 tablespoons of&#xD;
      blood will be drawn and stored for potential testing of a protein in the blood called renin.&#xD;
      You should continue the dietary suggestions (e.g., liberal salt diet) given for the&#xD;
      collection of the 24-hour urine until the blood is collected. A part of the blood drawn&#xD;
      during this visit will also be stored (frozen) in case potential risk factors of heart rate&#xD;
      variability are discovered in the future. This visit will last approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since some drugs can affect how much your heart speeds up and slows down, if your doctor adds&#xD;
      a new drug or changes the dosage of any current drugs you may not be able to continue in this&#xD;
      study. Please inform a member of the research staff when your doctor makes any change in your&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before coming to the Diabetes and Metabolic Research Center for visit 3, we will need to&#xD;
      determine if you have used your device for the treatment of your sleep disorder enough during&#xD;
      the six week period. Therefore, a member of the research staff will call you on a weekly&#xD;
      basis to ask you to tell us the information that you have recorded in your diary with regard&#xD;
      to how often you used the device for the treatment of your sleep disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (approximately six weeks after you begin treatment for your sleep disorder): If you&#xD;
      have used the device that is being used to treat your sleep disorder enough, you will be&#xD;
      invited to come for visit 3. All of the tests performed during the first visit will be&#xD;
      performed again during visit 3. Thus, you will need to follow the same instructions about&#xD;
      food, medicine, and exercise as described under visit 1 before coming to visit 3. You will&#xD;
      again have a fingerstick blood sugar level performed. In addition, about 2 tablespoons of&#xD;
      blood will be drawn. This blood and a random urine sample will be stored (frozen) in case&#xD;
      possible risk factors of reduced heart rate variability are discovered in the future and in&#xD;
      case these factors need to be examined before and after treatment for a sleep disorder. The&#xD;
      same questions asked with regard to the likelihood of you falling asleep in various&#xD;
      situations will be asked. This visit will last approximately 1-1 ½ hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 (approximately 18-months after you begin treatment for your sleep disorder): If you&#xD;
      continue to use the device that is being used to treat your sleep disorder for 18-months, you&#xD;
      will be invited to come for visit 4. All of the tests performed during the first visit will&#xD;
      be performed again during visit 4. Thus, you will need to follow the same instructions about&#xD;
      food, medicine, and exercise as described under visit 1 before coming to visit 4. You will&#xD;
      again have a fingerstick blood sugar level performed. In addition, about 2 tablespoons of&#xD;
      blood will be drawn. This blood and a random urine sample will be stored (frozen) in case&#xD;
      possible risk factors of reduced heart rate variability are discovered in the future and in&#xD;
      case these factors need to be examined before and after treatment for a sleep disorder. For&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes, a small portion of blood will be checked to determine your blood&#xD;
      sugar control level. The same questions asked with regard to the likelihood of you falling&#xD;
      asleep in various situations will be asked again. This visit will last approximately 1-1 ½&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
