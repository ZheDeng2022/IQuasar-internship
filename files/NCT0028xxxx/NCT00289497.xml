  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foot ulcers develop in diabetics with neuropathy because of cumulative injury over the course&#xD;
      of several days. These patients do not feel pain, and do not recognize their foot is being&#xD;
      injured until a wound develops. Areas about to ulcerate become inflamed and &quot;hot spots&quot; can&#xD;
      be identified. This study's purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of a home infrared&#xD;
      temperature probe designed to forewarn patients that an area on the foot is inflamed so they&#xD;
      can take preventive measures. The study will evaluate the incidence of diabetic foot ulcers&#xD;
      among high-risk patients, evaluate the cost of home temperature monitoring compared to&#xD;
      standard therapy, and evaluate patient satisfaction. 180 diabetics at high-risk of having&#xD;
      foot complications will be randomized into 3 treatment arms: 1) standard therapy consisting&#xD;
      of regular foot care; 2) standard therapy plus recording of a structured foot evaluation&#xD;
      using a hand mirror; and 3) standard therapy plus infrared home temperature assessment to&#xD;
      identify &quot;hot spots.&quot; Device patients will measure temperatures at 6 sites on the foot each&#xD;
      day. When temperatures are elevated &gt;4°F patients will contact the research nurse and&#xD;
      decrease activity. The primary study outcome will be incident foot ulcers and Charcot&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;

      SIGNIFICANCE &amp; RATIONALE FOR PROPOSED PROJECT Foot problems are the most common complication&#xD;
      in diabetics leading to hospitalization.1-5 Approximately one quarter of all hospital days&#xD;
      for persons with diabetes are related to foot complications.4,5,8 In the United States there&#xD;
      are approximately 120,000 non-traumatic lower extremity amputations performed each year.6,7&#xD;
      In the U.S., 45%-83% of all lower extremity amputations involve diabetics.1,9,5 Overall,&#xD;
      patients with diabetes are 15-46 times more likely to have an amputation than patients&#xD;
      without diabetes.11,14,15 It has been estimated that 5% to 15% of diabetics will have a lower&#xD;
      extremity amputation in their lifetime.11 After their initial amputation 9-17% of diabetic&#xD;
      patients will experience a second amputation within the same year12-17 and 25% to 68% of&#xD;
      diabetics will have an amputation of the contralateral extremity within five years.18-20 The&#xD;
      five-year survival rate after a lower extremity amputation ranges from 41% to 70%.19-21&#xD;
      Indeed, 10% of these patients die before leaving the hospital after a lower extremity&#xD;
      amputation.7,9,20 National Initiatives: There are a number of initiatives by federal and&#xD;
      state government organizations to prioritize efforts to reduce the burden of diabetes related&#xD;
      amputations. Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010 have set a goal of reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of diabetes related amputation by 40%, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human&#xD;
      Services has prioritized amputation reduction in minorities as one of its strategic&#xD;
      Initiatives to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health. Likewise, the Veterans&#xD;
      Administration and Indian Health Service have prioritized amputation prevention for patients&#xD;
      with diabetes. For instance, the VA has mandated the development of special programs to&#xD;
      evaluate patients with diabetes, identify patients that fit a high-risk profile, and provide&#xD;
      specialized treatment programs in order to decrease the impact of diabetes related&#xD;
      complications within the Veterans Health Administration. Lower extremity complications in&#xD;
      diabetics are common, costly and associated with a high rate of recurrence, morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Several studies in the U.S. and Europe suggest that amputations and ulcerations&#xD;
      can be prevented when special foot care and education are implemented. Despite these types of&#xD;
      initiatives, increasing research knowledge, better re-vascularization and diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures and an expanding armamentarium of new drugs and technology, the incidence of&#xD;
      amputation has increased over the past few decades.15 Precursors to amputation: In diabetes,&#xD;
      as in other chronic diseases, patient involvement to identify early warning signs of the&#xD;
      disease process is imperative to reduce the incidence of complications and prevent morbidity.&#xD;
      Many lower extremity complications involve sensory neuropathy as a pivotal component of the&#xD;
      critical pathway for both the development of ulcers and amputations. Therefore, pain and loss&#xD;
      of function, primary natural warning systems that alert us to take action and seek medical&#xD;
      care, are faulty. Diabetic patients can hence sustain injuries that are not recognized until&#xD;
      they are so severe that full thickness ulcerations result. The aim of this study was to&#xD;
      further evaluate a tool to help high-risk diabetics identify areas on their feet that are&#xD;
      inflamed and prone to ulceration before a wound develops at sites that would otherwise not be&#xD;
      recognized as &quot;symptomatic.&quot; Results of the Phase I study indicated that high-risk patients&#xD;
      with diabetes can effectively use an infrared temperature device to monitor foot&#xD;
      temperatures. Patients who used the device had significantly fewer foot complications&#xD;
      compared to patients who received education, therapeutic shoes plus insoles and regular foot&#xD;
      evaluations alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foot ulcers are one of the most common precursors to diabetes related amputations.8,25 Other&#xD;
      factors that have been associated with amputation, such as infection, faulty wound healing,&#xD;
      and ischemia, usually do not cause tissue loss or amputation in the absence of a wound.&#xD;
      Therefore, ulcer prevention is one of the foci of any amputation prevention program. Three&#xD;
      primary pathways or mechanisms of injury have recently been identified in the development of&#xD;
      foot ulcers They include wounds that result from ill-fitting shoes (low-pressure injuries&#xD;
      that are associated with prolonged or constant pressure from narrow or short shoes),&#xD;
      repetitive moderate forces on the sole of the foot, and from puncture wounds (high-pressure&#xD;
      injuries with a single exposure of direct pressure). The most common mechanism involves the&#xD;
      second scenario (receptive moderate force). Except for puncture wounds, areas that are likely&#xD;
      to ulcerate have been associated with increased local skin temperatures due to inflammation&#xD;
      and enzymatic autolysis of tissue. Several reports have suggested that wounds develop due to&#xD;
      a cumulative effect of unrecognized repetitive injury over the course of several days.&#xD;
      Identifying areas of injury by the presence of inflammation would then allow patients or&#xD;
      health care providers to take action to decrease the inflammation before a wound develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of prevention: Several studies have suggested that foot complications can be&#xD;
      prevented by a focused team approach to identify and treat lower extremity complications.&#xD;
      This approach generally involves de-weighting pressure areas with special shoes, patient&#xD;
      education and self-care practices, re-vascularization, optimal glucose control, infection&#xD;
      control, use of appropriate referral patterns, and regular foot care.18, 26-30 Several&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated a significant decrease in the incidence of ulceration and&#xD;
      re-ulceration when therapeutic footwear, education, and regular diabetic foot care was&#xD;
      provided. However, 19-28% of these patients still re-ulcerated within 12-18 months.26,31,32&#xD;
      Edmonds and coworkers18 reported a 26% re-ulceration rate in high-risk diabetics with special&#xD;
      shoes and insoles compared to an 83% re-ulceration rate in patients that wore their own&#xD;
      shoes. Likewise Uccioli26 reported a 28% re-ulceration rate in diabetics treated with custom&#xD;
      shoes and insoles compared to 50% re-ulceration among patients without special footwear. In a&#xD;
      descriptive report, Helm and co-workers32 reported a 19% re-ulceration over an 18-month&#xD;
      period among patients that healed neuropathic ulcers in total contact casts. As in other&#xD;
      studies, after wound closure patients received custom shoes or healing sandals and regular&#xD;
      clinical follow-up care. All of these studies were performed at specialty foot centers with a&#xD;
      focus on diabetes. Even in these centers, the risk of re-injury was very high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicting impending injury: Our rationale for evaluating skin temperatures involves the&#xD;
      search for a quantifiable, reproducible measurement of inflammation that can be used to&#xD;
      identify pathologic processes before they result in ulcers. Inflammation is one of the&#xD;
      earliest signs of foot ulceration. Five cardinal signs characterize inflammation: redness,&#xD;
      pain, swelling, loss of function and heat. Many of these signs are difficult to assess&#xD;
      objectively. In the neuropathic extremity, pain and disturbance of function may be absent&#xD;
      because of neuropathy and thus are poor indicators of inflammation. In addition, swelling and&#xD;
      redness are difficult to objectively grade from clinician to clinician or from visit to&#xD;
      visit. Most lay people will not be able to understand or accurately evaluate these subtle&#xD;
      parameters. However, temperature measurements can be easily performed by patients or their&#xD;
      spouses and provide quantitative information that has been shown to be predictive of&#xD;
      impending ulceration in diabetics with sensory neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since ulcers develop as a result of cumulative injury over the course of several days,&#xD;
      patients need a mechanism to identify early warning signs of ulceration to prompt them to&#xD;
      take appropriate action.44 The high re-ulceration rates reported in previous studies indicate&#xD;
      that early warning signs are missed. A home temperature monitoring system for wound&#xD;
      prevention is a similar concept to home glucose monitoring to help patients adjust their&#xD;
      insulin. In both cases patients need frequent information about a health parameter that has&#xD;
      the potential to change in a very short period of time. In both cases patients are taught to&#xD;
      use the objective data provided from their home monitoring device to alter their behavior&#xD;
      whether it is used to change insulin dosage or activity level. One of the barriers to&#xD;
      lowering the incidence of ulcers and amputation is an objective mechanism that patients can&#xD;
      use at home, such as a home monitoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, standard patient education focused on teaching patients self-inspection skills&#xD;
      that most patients could not adequately perform such as using a hand mirror for visual&#xD;
      inspection. In our study of ulcer risk factors, a large proportion of both patients with and&#xD;
      without foot ulcers did not have the visual acuity, manual dexterity, or joint flexibility to&#xD;
      perform simple self-examination checks of their feet. Among ulcer patients 49% could not&#xD;
      position and/or visualize their feet, and 15% of ulcer patients were legally blind in at&#xD;
      least one eye. Even if a family member is available to visually inspect the foot, without an&#xD;
      objective measure of injury, most laymen will only be able to identify ulcers once they have&#xD;
      occurred.33 State of existing knowledge: Over the last three decades, several authors have&#xD;
      suggested that skin temperature monitoring may be a valuable tool to detect &quot;at risk&quot; sites&#xD;
      in patients who are insensate.34-41 As early as 1971 Goller34 reported an association between&#xD;
      increased local temperature and localized pressure leading to tissue injury. Sandrow and&#xD;
      coworkers35 subsequently used thermometry as a tool to diagnosis occult neuropathic fractures&#xD;
      in patients with diabetes in 1972.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stess et al.37 and Clark et al.40 described the use of infrared thermography to assess skin&#xD;
      temperatures in diabetics, diabetics with neuropathic fractures, diabetics with ulcers,&#xD;
      patients with leprosy, and controls. They found that neuropathic foot ulcers frequently had&#xD;
      increased skin temperatures surrounding a central necrotic area and suggested that infrared&#xD;
      thermometry may be a useful technique to identify patients at risk for ulceration.40 Benbow&#xD;
      and coworkers38 took this work a step further and evaluated foot temperatures as a tool to&#xD;
      identify diabetics at risk of foot ulceration. They suggested that thermographic patterns&#xD;
      could be used to screen high-risk patients.38 They prospectively evaluated 50 patients with&#xD;
      diabetes and sensory neuropathy for 3 to 4 years. Six patients developed a neuropathic ulcer&#xD;
      during the study period. These patients had significantly higher foot temperatures at&#xD;
      baseline than patients who did not ulcerate. All of these early studies used liquid crystal&#xD;
      contact thermography to map temperature patterns on the sole of the foot. The devices used in&#xD;
      these studies were bulky, expensive and difficult to use or integrate into a normal clinical&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study at the High-Risk Diabetic Foot Clinic at the University of Texas27 at San Antonio,&#xD;
      it was hypothesized that local skin temperatures on the affected limb would be higher in&#xD;
      extremities with pathology (neuropathic ulcers, acute Charcot's arthropathy) and the same in&#xD;
      patients without pathology when compared to the corresponding site on the contralateral foot.&#xD;
      Further, it was expected that temperatures return to normal once ulcer and fracture healing&#xD;
      is complete. Lastly, it was questioned whether dermal thermometry could be potentially&#xD;
      predictive of neuropathic ulceration. To that end, 143 consecutive patients with diabetes&#xD;
      that presented for treatment to the High-Risk Diabetic Foot Clinic were enrolled. All were&#xD;
      evaluated with thermometry. These patients were divided into 3 groups: 78 patients with&#xD;
      asymptomatic loss of protective threshold, 44 with neuropathic foot ulcerations, and 21&#xD;
      patients with neuropathic (Charcot) fractures. Temperatures were evaluated with a portable&#xD;
      handheld infrared skin temperature probe (Dermatemp 1001, Exergen Products, Watertown, MA,&#xD;
      USA). Patients' skin temperatures were measured at the time pathology was initially&#xD;
      identified and at subsequent clinical follow-up visits for an average of 22.1 ± 6.4 months.&#xD;
      Temperatures on the contralateral foot were measured as a control. In this population, there&#xD;
      were significant differences in skin temperature in both the Charcot (8.30°F, p &lt; 0.001) and&#xD;
      ulcer groups (5.60°F, p &lt; 0.001) compared with the region overlying the site of pathology on&#xD;
      the contralateral side. No significant temperature difference was identified in the group&#xD;
      with asymptomatic loss of protective threshold group and no acute pathology. Temperatures all&#xD;
      normalized at the time of Charcot quiescence and ulcer healing. Eleven percent of patients in&#xD;
      the ulcer group re-ulcerated a mean 12.2 ± 6.4 months after initial healing with a&#xD;
      corresponding significant increase in skin temperature at the clinic visit immediately&#xD;
      preceding reinjury (p &lt; 0.001). These data suggest that monitoring of the corresponding&#xD;
      contralateral foot site may provide objective, clinical information before other clinical&#xD;
      signs of injury can be identified and that infrared dermal thermometry may be predictive of&#xD;
      neuropathic ulceration.27 Subsequent studies have indicated that elevated skin temperatures&#xD;
      are directly correlated with location of acute neuropathic osteoarthropathy (Charcot's&#xD;
      arthropathy) and that temperatures will equilibrate in a predictable manner as acute&#xD;
      Charcot's arthropathy resolves into a quiescent state.28,29 Furthermore, the difference in&#xD;
      temperature on the wounded side compared with the corresponding contralateral site decreases&#xD;
      as the surface area of the wound decreases.30 As a practical measure, the opposite extremity&#xD;
      has been used in previous studies as a control because it is exposed to the same duration and&#xD;
      control of diabetes and systemic complications as the affected limb and should represent a&#xD;
      built-in comparison source. In this manner, the patient serves as his own control. Because&#xD;
      the disease processes of neuropathic fractures and ulceration involves multiple factors that&#xD;
      affect lower extremity perfusion and temperature regulation, it would be difficult to&#xD;
      identify an absolute skin temperature level that could be considered normal or one that could&#xD;
      be used as a universal reference. For instance, the baseline temperatures for a patient with&#xD;
      Charcot's fracture may be higher than diabetic patients without this complication or persons&#xD;
      without diabetes.45-47 In a related study, temperatures assessed by manual palpation were&#xD;
      identified as a relatively inaccurate means of quantifying skin temperature.47 To that end,&#xD;
      eleven healthy physicians, eight male with a mean age of 28.6 ± 4.4 years, were enrolled for&#xD;
      study. These subjects were instructed to palpate two of five steel cylinders of known&#xD;
      temperature using the volar surface of their hands. The five cylinders, arranged randomly&#xD;
      were carefully gradated to produce equal, 2, 4 and 6 degree Celsius temperature gradients.&#xD;
      They were then asked whether the temperature difference between any two cylinders was equal,&#xD;
      2º, 4º or 6° Celsius. This process was repeated a total of ten times for each participant.&#xD;
      Subjects correctly estimated the temperature gradient a mean 1.00 ± 0.89 times out of 10&#xD;
      random attempts. There was not a significant difference between temperature gradient and&#xD;
      frequency of correct answers (p &gt; 0.05). It was concluded that, while the laying on of hands&#xD;
      in a clinical setting is a necessary and crucial component of the doctor-patient&#xD;
      relationship, manual palpation, even in a controlled environment, is not a reliable or&#xD;
      objective means to assess temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this TempTouch IR Thermometry of high-risk diabetic patient self care study the STUDY&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of a home infrared temperature probe to reduce the&#xD;
           incidence of diabetic foot ulcers among high-risk patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the cost of home temperature monitoring compared to standard therapy among&#xD;
           high-risk patients with diabetes; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate patient perceived benefits and satisfaction of home temperature monitoring.&#xD;
