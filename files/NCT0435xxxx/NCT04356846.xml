  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm phase I clinical study of LP-108.&#xD;
      Patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, arm A) and other B&#xD;
      cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, Arm B). Each arm has a dose escalation phase (phase Ia) and&#xD;
      expansion phase (phase Ib). During the dose escalation phase, the primary objectives are to&#xD;
      define dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to explore a&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose. Dose escalation is based on the classic &quot;3 + 3&quot; design, while&#xD;
      accelerated titration is applied to the initial lower doses. After the RP2Ds are determined,&#xD;
      additional patients will be enrolled in the expansion phase to further evaluation the safety,&#xD;
      PK and preliminary efficacy of LP-108, each therapy can enroll 12-20 subjects.&#xD;
