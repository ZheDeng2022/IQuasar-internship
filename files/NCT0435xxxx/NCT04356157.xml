    <textblock>
      Background: More than two-thirds of people living with HIV live in Sub-Saharan Africa, where&#xD;
      the HIV prevalence in the adult population (aged 15-49) is 3.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these countries a critical issue is represented by low level of adherence to treatment&#xD;
      particularly in HIV positive pregnant women. Among the causes, the lack of male partner&#xD;
      involvement represents a significant criticality. This issue emerge in Malawi, one of the&#xD;
      countries with the highest prevalence of HIV in the world: 9.2% of the adult population&#xD;
      living with HIV in 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to assess three different interventions aimed at improving adherence and retention&#xD;
      to Anti Retroviral therapy among HIV positive women through engagement with their life&#xD;
      partner in four Malawian healthcare centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The prospective, controlled before-and-after study is articulated in three phases&#xD;
      (total 24 months): pre-intervention, intervention and post-intervention analyses. The number&#xD;
      of selected clinical centres is limited to four, one for each intervention plus a centre&#xD;
      where no intervention will be performed (control arm). The interventions are 1) opening the&#xD;
      facility on Saturday a month, only for men, defined &quot;special day&quot;; 2) peer-to-peer&#xD;
      counselling among men, &quot;male champions&quot;; 3) providing incentive to all women accompanied by&#xD;
      their partners at the facility, &quot;nudge&quot; (note1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is the evaluation of the variations in retention in care and&#xD;
      women's adherence to therapeutic protocols; the intermediate outcome is the assessment of the&#xD;
      variations in Male Involvement (MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of MI in the health of female partners (intermediate outcome) will be evaluated&#xD;
      through a questionnaire administered at baseline and in the post-intervention phase. Data&#xD;
      will be collected at the clinical centres and will be stored in two electronic databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Analysis of data collected in the four centres during the pre-intervention phase is&#xD;
      on-going as the enrolment is stopped 31st March 2020. Total patients enrolled are 452 (133&#xD;
      Namandanje: 133, Kapeni: 78, Kapire: 75, Balaka: 166). Meantime, several meetings are&#xD;
      performed in the centres to organize the intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: The study will identified the better intervention to involve male partners in&#xD;
      women's health according to an approach based on a broad spectrum of behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Note1: the reason of the incentive is not reward the participation in the study but is the&#xD;
      main activity of the intervention assessed. The intervention consist in giving an incentive.&#xD;
      For this reason is not recommendable to eliminate this information as requested by the&#xD;
      reviewer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The design is a prospective controlled study, that is suitable for the evaluation of&#xD;
      promising interventions to improve male involvement and enhance maternal adherence to HIV&#xD;
      PMTCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, we adopted a framework based on the ecological model adapted by Kaufman et al&#xD;
      to health behaviors in HIV prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the ecological model, many factors affect male involvement in women's health&#xD;
      care processes at different levels. In this study, we focused on individual level,&#xD;
      interpersonal and network (eg, family and peers), community, health system (health facility&#xD;
      level), and structural level (eg, access to transportation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate 3 different interventions aimed at improving adherence&#xD;
      and retention to Anti Retroviral therapy among HIV-positive women through engagement with&#xD;
      their life partner. The interventions are (1) testing peer-to-peer counseling and&#xD;
      community-level health education sessions delivered by men, male champions; (2) opening the&#xD;
      facility once a month, only for men, special day; and (3) providing incentive to all women&#xD;
      accompanied by their partners at the facility, nudge or incentive (note1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention 1 (Male Champions) will act at the community level, providing educational&#xD;
           interventions that are aimed at territorial communities and religious groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention 2 (Special Day) will act at the health system level delivering activities&#xD;
           based on health facilities that are aimed at reshaping the clinic as male-friendly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention 3 will also act at the structural level by providing incentives to support&#xD;
           the cost of transportation and other costs that reduce a male partner's ability to&#xD;
           access the service (note1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 3 phases: preintervention (baseline), intervention, and postintervention&#xD;
      analyses, as shown in Figure 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preintervention analysis, the baseline situation of the 3 participating centers will&#xD;
      be evaluated. The aim of this phase is to set a starting point to weigh the relative effect&#xD;
      of each intervention to be studied. For that purpose, baseline data of each study site will&#xD;
      be collected. To evaluate the effect of the interventions, the same indicators will be&#xD;
      measured during the pre- and postintervention phases, as described above. The preintervention&#xD;
      phase will last 9 months. During this period, data will be collected at each site and&#xD;
      included in a database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the limited resources available for the study and the practical difficulties related to&#xD;
      the disadvantaged context in which the study was conducted, sample size calculations and&#xD;
      criteria for assigning interventions were based on a pragmatic approach. The number of&#xD;
      selected clusters is limited to 4, one for each intervention plus a cluster where no&#xD;
      intervention will be performed as a control arm. The number of participants enrolled for data&#xD;
      collection is given by the number of patients attending the selected clinical centers during&#xD;
      the pre- and postintervention phases. Therefore, the main unit of analysis of the study is&#xD;
      the cluster, which is the clinical center. Thus, the interventions will target each health&#xD;
      facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following criteria were followed to select the 4 centers included in the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The centers represented the Malawian population. As Malawi is a country where 83% of the&#xD;
           population resides in rural or semirural environments, rural clinics were selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Centers that only provided maternal services were excluded because it was not possible&#xD;
           to use a male-friendly approach in a center that is designed to accommodate only women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The remaining centers with the highest number of female patients were selected. The&#xD;
           special day intervention was assigned to the center of Balaka (Balaka district). At this&#xD;
           site, health care staff are available to offer the planned services. The male champion&#xD;
           intervention was assigned to the Kapire center (Machinga district), where there are&#xD;
           patients available to engage themselves as male champions who have sufficient levels of&#xD;
           education necessary to perform the task assigned to them and communicate with the&#xD;
           researchers. The nudge intervention was assigned to the Kapeni center (Blantyre&#xD;
           district), where the number of women being treated was consistent with the available&#xD;
           budget necessary for the provision of noneconomic incentives (note1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the unit of analysis is the clinical center, and therefore all patients who are&#xD;
      referred, the study focuses on the population of adult females and the influence of male&#xD;
      partners on the health practices of women. Therefore, data will be collected from this&#xD;
      specific population. Eligibility criteria for women included the following: being HIV&#xD;
      positive; inclusion in an HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment program; aged 18 years or older;&#xD;
      and living at home with a male partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment of participants will be consecutively based on the order of patient&#xD;
      appointments. Recruitment will be entrusted to doctors and clinical officers responsible for&#xD;
      the medical visits of women participating in HIV treatment programs, who interact with&#xD;
      patients during every visit to the clinical center. All women who met the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and agreed to participate in the study will be enrolled. Recruitment will be&#xD;
      conducted before the medical examination: the software used for patient management reports to&#xD;
      the clinician whether patients aged less than 18 years are enrolled, allowing the clinician&#xD;
      to check entry criteria and invite eligible participants for study participation with the&#xD;
      provision of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at the clinical centers and will be stored in 2 electronic databases&#xD;
      managed through 2 different types of software:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical and medical service data are routinely collected through an electronic DREAM&#xD;
           program health record software used routinely at the clinical centers named DREAM_S.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data on health behaviors reported by patients who participate in the study will be&#xD;
           collected through the software created specifically for the study, also respecting rules&#xD;
           for patient privacy and data security.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preintervention phase, data will be collected at the medical visit immediately after&#xD;
      the enrollment visit to evaluate the partner's acceptance of the invitation to come to the&#xD;
      clinical center for testing and counseling in the company of the patient. In the&#xD;
      postintervention phase, data will be collected 2 months from enrollment to allow for a&#xD;
      wash-out period where the effects of the interventions would be expressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions will be implemented according to standard clinical practices in Malawi with&#xD;
      some modifications based on the international experiences described in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The male champion is a figure present in a few settings that conducts home visits with&#xD;
           men and couples and follows up with men who did not accompany their partners to&#xD;
           Ante-Natal Care (ANC) visits. Usually, this role is covered by the female expert&#xD;
           clients, namely HIV-positive patients working in the organization as volunteers after&#xD;
           appropriate training. Some men among patients who are receiving treatment will be&#xD;
           identified and trained to cover this role. The intervention called male champion aims to&#xD;
           change the beliefs and attitudes of men, not intervening directly on individuals but&#xD;
           upon entire communities and particularly involving community leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The special day is a practice that is becoming increasingly common to facilitate access&#xD;
           to health facilities by vulnerable groups such as adolescents. In this study, we target&#xD;
           men. The special day takes place with an extraordinary opening of the clinical center&#xD;
           once a month on a pre-festive day (Saturday). During this day, access will be reserved&#xD;
           exclusively for men, including those who are not on treatment for HIV. The center will&#xD;
           offer free health promotion services to all participants. This intervention aims to&#xD;
           remove the attitude linked to beliefs regarding masculinity, in which the male partners&#xD;
           see access to health centers as an activity suitable only for women. The special day&#xD;
           aims to make the clinical center more male-friendly and therefore attempts to overcome&#xD;
           the social pressure that pushes men to have only sporadic attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The intervention based on the use of incentives (nudge) to men who follow the prevention&#xD;
           and treatment program aims to evaluate whether this action is effective in guiding&#xD;
           behavior change toward the test, treatment, involvement, and adherence to therapy&#xD;
           approach. The intervention defined as nudge aims to remove the obstacles of a structural&#xD;
           or a material nature, therefore it supports the costs related to transportation to&#xD;
           health care facilities and time taken away from work through a noneconomic incentive&#xD;
           (note1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational tools developed for these interventions are based on standards adopted in the&#xD;
      country for couples counseling on HIV/AIDS. To these standard guidelines, messages were added&#xD;
      to initiate a reflective discussion of stereotypes and false beliefs related to the idea of&#xD;
      masculinity in the Malawian culture. All staff involved in the delivery of these&#xD;
      interventions were provided with a guide (included in Multimedia Appendix 1) on the contents&#xD;
      to be delivered. They also participated in a one-day training of the themes of the project.&#xD;
      The guide was developed by study investigators and Malawian health care staff. The guide was&#xD;
      based on tools developed and applied in other contexts with the purpose of increasing men's&#xD;
      access to health care services and to reduce stereotypes and gender-based violence. It was&#xD;
      also based on the ecological model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational content will be delivered using 3 different approaches. The special day arm&#xD;
      will address the community in the catchment area of the clinical center, but the intervention&#xD;
      will take place at the facility level. Through visibility activities such as leaflet&#xD;
      distributions or information campaigns with audio messages, men living in the communities&#xD;
      surrounding the treatment center will be invited to an extraordinary opening day at the&#xD;
      center dedicated only to men. During the special day, the center's clinical staff will offer&#xD;
      basic health care services such as HIV testing and counseling, blood pressure measurement and&#xD;
      counseling on cardiovascular disease, blood glucose measurement and counseling on diabetes,&#xD;
      and nutritional evaluation and counseling. During the morning, group educational activities&#xD;
      led by male community health care workers together with the doctors of the center and 2&#xD;
      educational sessions using drama techniques will be conducted. In the male champions arm, the&#xD;
      intervention will be conducted at the level of regional and religious communities, with group&#xD;
      educational sessions and use of the male champions. Male champions will be selected from&#xD;
      patients receiving treatment for HIV for more than a year at the local DREAM centers. The&#xD;
      educational sessions, based on an interactive approach with questions and answers both from&#xD;
      the audience and the male champions, will last between 30 min to an hour. The male champion&#xD;
      will be allowed to prolong the intervention if the audience requests it. Meetings will be&#xD;
      planned and implemented in communities where at least five patients who receive treatment at&#xD;
      DREAM centers reside, including religious communities in those regions. In the nudge arm, the&#xD;
      intervention will be directed to individuals or to male partners of female patients being&#xD;
      treated at DREAM centers. Women who agree to participate in the study will be asked to invite&#xD;
      their male partners to the center for a health education session, and male partners who agree&#xD;
      to participate will receive an incentive for attending the service in the form of a food&#xD;
      package (note1). At the second visit, the couple will be given a health education session&#xD;
      based on educational materials prepared for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Note1: the reason of the incentive is not reward the participation in the study but is the&#xD;
      main activity of the intervention assessed. The intervention consist in giving an incentive.&#xD;
      For this reason is not recommendable to eliminate this information as requested by the&#xD;
      reviewer.&#xD;
