      The purpose of this study is to determine if medically tailored meals provided for either 2&#xD;
      weeks or 4 weeks (1 meal per day) to a Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) member after&#xD;
      hospital discharge will improve their health. Medically tailored meals (MTM) are meals that&#xD;
      are approved by a dietitian and shown to help people with certain health conditions.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine if medically tailored meals provided for either 2&#xD;
      weeks or 4 weeks (1 meal per day) to a Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) member after&#xD;
      hospital discharge will improve their health. Medically tailored meals (MTM) are meals that&#xD;
      are approved by a dietitian and shown to help people with certain health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators propose a research study with four Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if MTM provided post hospitalization for 4 weeks to patients&#xD;
      with one or more of seven chronic health conditions will decrease depression/anxiety measured&#xD;
      by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at 60 days in comparison to meals&#xD;
      provided for 2 weeks to members discharged from two hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Patients receiving meals for 4 weeks will have a clinically significant&#xD;
      increase in their HADS score at 60 days compared to those receiving meals for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if MTM provided for 4 weeks to patients with one or more of&#xD;
      seven chronic health conditions post hospitalization will improve general well-being and&#xD;
      functional status measured by Katz's Activities of Daily Living (ADL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Patients receiving meals for 4 weeks will have a clinically significant&#xD;
      increase in their sense of well-being and ADLs at 60 days compared to those receiving meals&#xD;
      for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine if MTM provided for 4 weeks to patients with one or more of&#xD;
      seven chronic health conditions post hospitalization will decrease a composite outcome of&#xD;
      rehospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits at 60 days in comparison to: a) meals&#xD;
      provided for 2 weeks to members discharged from two hospitals; and b) a concurrent&#xD;
      prospective control group not receiving meals at two other KPCO-contracted hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Patients receiving meals for 4 weeks will have a decreased composite rate of&#xD;
      rehospitalizations and ED visits at 60 days compared to those receiving meals for 2 weeks or&#xD;
      the non-randomized control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To determine the feasibility, acceptability and scalability of the Meals&#xD;
      Matter Program to KP members, their households, and hospital leadership and staff.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized trial to compare two approaches to meal delivery. Group 1 will receive meal delivery for 2 weeks (1 meal per day for a total of 14 days) and Group 2 will receive meal delivery for 4 weeks (1 meal per day for a total of 28 days). A concurrent propensity matched control group which will not receive an intervention will also be used.</intervention_model_description>
