  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project &quot;QV-Delirium&quot; is based on the decision of the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) from&#xD;
      2017. The aim is to improve inpatient care for older patients who are undergoing inpatient&#xD;
      surgery and thus to specifically reduce the postoperative risk of delirium. This is achieved&#xD;
      through the implementation of evidence-based and consensus-based measures to prevent&#xD;
      postoperative delirium in a comprehensive structured concept in routine care. The transparent&#xD;
      documentation in an electronic patient file enables the relationships between the symptoms to&#xD;
      be depicted in accordance with the clinical circumstances and the genesis of the&#xD;
      postoperative delirium to be recorded and treated at an early stage.The independent Institute&#xD;
      for Quality Assurance and Transparency in Health Care (IQTIG) receives the elements&#xD;
      predefined (e.g. incidence of delirium) by IQTIG with which the quality is measured. The&#xD;
      content of the additional elements from the routine data (see primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures) is merged internally and with BARMER and other health insurance data for a joint&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subproject 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative evaluation of systolic and diastolic heart function in patients of the QV&#xD;
      delirium cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this process, this subproject relates to the evaluation of patients during the&#xD;
      premedication visit. During the visit, an evaluation of the heart function using TTE should&#xD;
      also take place in order to be able to evaluate later whether there is a association between&#xD;
      the preoperative cardiac function examined and the development of postoperative delirium. The&#xD;
      parameters to be collected are for the systolic heart function (LVEF, TAPSE, rest LV-SV and&#xD;
      SVI, LVCO, LVCI LV / RV index, as well as for the diastolic dysfunction according to current&#xD;
      recommendations (Nagueh SF et al., 2016) : MV DecT, MV E / A ratio, E'lat, E'sept, E ', E /&#xD;
      E', IVRT-LV, S ', A', LAVI, tricuspid valve flow in tricuspid valve insufficiency: TR V max.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subproject 2 starts at 01.10.2021:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymous quantitative employee (nurses and doctors) survey on the content of the quality&#xD;
      contract with regard to employee satisfaction, feasibility, effectiveness, efficiency&#xD;
      (cost-benefit balance), acceptance, needs, quality of the introduction, quality of the&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;

    <measure>Person's level of consciousness</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a clinical scale used to reliably measure a person's level of consciousness after a brain injury. The GCS assesses a person based on their ability to perform eye movements, speak, and move their body. These three behaviors make up the three elements of the scale: eye, verbal, and motor. A person's GCS score can range from 3 (completely unresponsive) to 15 (responsive). This score is used to guide immediate medical care after a brain injury (such as a car accident) and also to monitor hospitalized patients and track their level of consciousness.&#xD;
Lower GCS scores are correlated with higher risk of death.</description>
