  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancers are often treated with external beam radiotherapy. Current radiotherapy treatments&#xD;
      are performed using computed tomography (also known as CT) scans which may not always clearly&#xD;
      identify the cancer. In some instances, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be able to&#xD;
      better identify cancers. Therefore, efforts are currently underway to use the MRI scans to&#xD;
      improve radiotherapy treatments or eventually even use radiotherapy equipment that only uses&#xD;
      MRI scans to guide treatments. This new technology that will only use MRI scans to guide&#xD;
      treatments is called the Linac-MR (linear accelerator with an MRI). The purpose of this pilot&#xD;
      phase of the study is to test whether the Alberta linac-MR P3 system at the Cross Cancer&#xD;
      Institute can acquire high quality MR images safely. It will allow the researchers to develop&#xD;
      the best collection of MR images possible with this new machine, in order to allow them to&#xD;
      visualize tumors for future patients that are treated on this machine.&#xD;

      This prospective, pilot phase, clinical trial is an imaging study to optimize the necessary&#xD;
      MR sequences on the Alberta linac-MR P3 system to allow for MR-guided radiotherapy in adult&#xD;
      patients with cancer that are treated with high dose external beam radiotherapy. Each&#xD;
      participant will undergo a single MR imaging session (30 - 40 minutes) on the Alberta&#xD;
      linac-MR P3 system. Towards the end of the study, patients will be approached to participate&#xD;
      in an optional sub-study, where they will undergo a total of five MR imaging sessions&#xD;
      (performed every two to five days) to allow for an assessment of inter-fraction motion.&#xD;
