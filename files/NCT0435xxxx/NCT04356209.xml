  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conserving surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is currently the therapeutic standard&#xD;
      for patient with Breast Cancer. Symptoms are common among patients receiving this treatment.&#xD;
      Ten percent of them will develop severe and chronic radio-induced toxicities, such as breast&#xD;
      radio-induced-fibrosis impairing their quality of life (QoL). Yet, paying attention to&#xD;
      symptom improves the empowerment and psychological adjustment to the disease. Web-based&#xD;
      systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been shown to&#xD;
      prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control, and to enhance&#xD;
      patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being.Benefits of&#xD;
      systems to elicit e-PRO improve reliable measure of health-related quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      remains discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are few specific treatments for these severe radio-induced fibrosis except the&#xD;
      antifibrotic combinaison Pentoxifylline/Vitamin E with inconsistent result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2000, we and others have developed a mechanistic approach modulating the severity of&#xD;
      RIF by targeting the Rho/ROCK/CTGF pathway, especially by inhibiting Rho activation by&#xD;
      pravastatin. Our preclinical data, then followed by the Phase II PRAVACUR-01 trial, concluded&#xD;
      that the use of pravastatin has an anti-fibrotic action on different experimental models and&#xD;
      reduces the severity of the grade of fibrosis in 50% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can now benefit from this new anti-fibrotic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken as a whole, these data encourage combining both drug (pravastatin) and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological intervention , in particular e-PRO, in the RIF management.&#xD;

    <description>Statements of symptoms and patients' health status (PROs) will be collected via a web interface, including access and use in patients with burden symptoms.&#xD;
The platform will include four items concerning 7 side effects of fibrosis of grade &gt; 2 in breast cancer.
