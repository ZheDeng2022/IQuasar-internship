      Objective: To assess the effectiveness of an intervention exercise program on enhancing fall&#xD;
      risk deterrent factors, such as balance, postural control, overall strength, functionability&#xD;
      in community-dwelling individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single-blinded randomized controlled trial, comparing two groups, with follow-ups at&#xD;
      the begging and 15 days after the completion of the program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Nursing homes in Ano Volos and Kanalia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: A total of 40 elderly people, both male and female, aged 65 years and older&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to an intervention exercise group (n = 20) and a control group (n =&#xD;
      20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Intervention exercise program consisted of two sessions each week for 8&#xD;
      consecutive weeks. The control group received no exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: Main outcomes were measured by the Timed Up and Go Test, Berg Balance Scale,&#xD;
      10-second chair stand test, Saehan hand grip dynamometer, Upper and Lower Limp reach tests.&#xD;

      Methods Research design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single - blind, randomized controlled trial design was used to examine the effects of a&#xD;
      fall prevention exercise program in reducing fall incidence and fall risks for&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults at a risk for falls. The study was approved by the ethics&#xD;
      committee of University of Thessaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Forty (40) community dwelling elderly individuals, both males and females, were&#xD;
      recruited from nursing homes. Convenience sampling was used. Subject eligibility criteria&#xD;
      were: a) 65 years of age and older, b) absence of serious health problems or neurological&#xD;
      diseases, c) absence of dementia, d) no recent surgeries. Out of the 40 subjects meeting the&#xD;
      above criteria, 20 were randomly assigned to the control group (mean age 79.3±5.49) and 20 to&#xD;
      the rehabilitation group (mean age 79.6±7.38). In both groups, 10 subjects reported at least&#xD;
      one incidence of falling during the past year whilst the remaining 10 the absence of any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Base line assessment A structured questionnaire was used to record a) anthropometric and&#xD;
      demographic data (age, weight, height, profession etc.), b) comorbid medical conditions&#xD;
      (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, psychiatric illness), c)&#xD;
      prescribed medications including psychotropic medications (antidepressants, and sedative&#xD;
      hypnotics), d) use of walking aids, e) prior history of falls and fall-related injuries&#xD;
      during the past year, f) prior surgeries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group was designed to undergo supervised exercise 2 days a week for 8&#xD;
      consecutive weeks for 45-50 min/session. The intervention program was implemented at the&#xD;
      nursing home facilities. The control group did not receive any intervention during that&#xD;
      period and were instructed to pursue their habitual daily life activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments and assessments (outcome measures) Participants were assessed prior to the&#xD;
      beginning of their program and 15 days after the completion of the intervention. Parameters&#xD;
      being assessed were: weight, height, BMI, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      grip strength, upper and lower limb force, plus upper and lower extremity elasticity,&#xD;
      equilibrium and functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobility was assessed using the Time Up &amp; Go Test (TUG) which was measured by recording the&#xD;
      time taken to stand up from a standard chair (43cm), walk 3m at a natural pace, turn around,&#xD;
      and sit back down in the chair. Expected time for the completion of this task is estimated at&#xD;
      7-10''. (Viccaro et al 2011)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional balance was assessed with the Berg Balance Scale that has been developed to&#xD;
      measure an elderly person's static and dynamic balancing abilities. It is composed of a total&#xD;
      of 14 items and a full score of 56 points. The time required is around 15 minutes. Higher&#xD;
      scores indicate better degrees of balance. Based on the total score participants are&#xD;
      classified in: a) need for a wheelchair (0-20 points), b) need of aiding tools to walk (21-40&#xD;
      points), c) independent (41 points or higher). Persons with scores of 40 points or higher are&#xD;
      not likely to fall (Berg et al., 1992 ; Bogle &amp; Newton 1996; Downs et al 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grip strength was measured using the SAEHAN hand grip dynamometer. The subject was sitting on&#xD;
      a standard chair with the elbow flexed at 900. When the subject was ready, he would begin to&#xD;
      strain the device in a maximal isometric effort, maintaining, at the same time, high&#xD;
      concentration, as this was a required condition for maximal results. No other body movement&#xD;
      was allowed during testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower Limb's strength was assessed through the &quot;sit to stand 10&quot; trial. Subjects were asked&#xD;
      to sit on a chair, stand up and return to the sitting position for 10 consecutive times at&#xD;
      full speed, with no intervals between. Normal time expected for the successful completion of&#xD;
      the trial was estimated at 24&quot;-27&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower Body Flexibility was assessed using a modified Sit and Reach test. This test was&#xD;
      performed in a standard chair with one leg fully extended and the other in a flexed position.&#xD;
      Participants reached forward with one hand as far as possible and held this position for&#xD;
      three seconds. Distance between fingers and toes was measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Upper Body Flexibility assessment, subjects were instructed to bring their hand back as&#xD;
      high as possible in order to reach the A7 vertebra. The distance between the thumb and the A7&#xD;
      vertebra was measured (Collins et al 2004) Intervention The intervention protocol was&#xD;
      starting with a 10 minute warm up (5 minutes circular walking combined with neck rotation in&#xD;
      clockwise and counterclockwise fashion and 5 minutes upper and lower limp stretching&#xD;
      exercises) and was followed by 30 minutes of exercises that were aiming to muscle&#xD;
      strengthening, balance improvement and functionability enhancement. The muscle strengthening&#xD;
      routine consisted of exercises both from standing and sitting position using an elastic band&#xD;
      (hip flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, knee flexion and extension, ankle dorsi and&#xD;
      plantar flexion), heel and toe standing, upper limb strengthening using dumbbells. Balance&#xD;
      training consisted of standing on one leg, shifting weight laterally from one foot to the&#xD;
      other, staggered stance, side stepping. Functionalibility improvement was promoted through&#xD;
      walking upstairs and downstairs, standing up from sitting to upright position. At the end a 5&#xD;
      minute cool down procedure was following consisting of circular walking, mild head movements&#xD;
      and upper and lower body stretching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the whole duration of the intervention the elderly subjects were provided with&#xD;
      constant feedback for the maintenance of the proper sitting and standing posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing rate, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored at every interventional session.&#xD;
      All participants were asked to immediately declare any symptom or feeling of dizziness or&#xD;
      general discomfort and on that case the current intervention would stop.&#xD;
