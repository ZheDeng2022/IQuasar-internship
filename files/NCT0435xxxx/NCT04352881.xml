  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For 12 years, the odontology service of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital group (GHPS) has been&#xD;
      responsible for day and night dental emergency care. Several surveys have been conducted in&#xD;
      order to analyze the sociological characteristics of the patients and the typology of the&#xD;
      acts performed. These studies indicate that pain is the main reason for consultations, cited&#xD;
      by 60 to 80% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, very few studies have been done in the context of emergencies. Very recently, a study&#xD;
      was undertaken on the satisfaction of patients consulting the odontological emergencies of&#xD;
      the GHPS, during a thesis work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, carried out in collaboration with the URC Pitié Salpêtrière, under analysis,&#xD;
      relates to the satisfaction of patients consulting the odontological emergencies of the GHPS&#xD;
      during the day and week, Monday to Friday, excluding night and week emergencies -end (WE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attendance at night and during WE is important because it is sociologically and medically&#xD;
      different from that of day and week. It is therefore important to complete this study by&#xD;
      focusing on patients consulting the emergency room at night and during the weekend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work therefore responds to a request from the Odontology Emergency Reception Service&#xD;
      (SAUO) of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital Group. It will be carried out in the form of a&#xD;
      survey whose objective is to assess: on the one hand, the effectiveness of the care provided&#xD;
      in this emergency functional unit, and on the other hand the satisfaction of the patients&#xD;
      after their passage to the emergency room .&#xD;

      I. Research progress Two investigators will take turns in the service for the search&#xD;
      duration. They will be responsible for informing patients of the research upon their arrival&#xD;
      in the service and for the data collection and telephone follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course of the research will take place as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of consultation (D0):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient information on the search when he arrives in the service; explanation of its&#xD;
           objectives, its modalities and constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Verification of eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collection of the patient's non-opposition by the dentist during the consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Consultation according to the usual care. During this procedure, the practitioner&#xD;
           performs a medical history and, according to the patient's answers, completes the&#xD;
           &quot;General Information Questionnaire&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           He carries out the emergency care and explains the postoperative consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient filling in the satisfaction questionnaire immediately after consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Telephone follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Telephone follow-up by the interviewer and fill in the questionnaire - in case of&#xD;
           non-availability of the patient on day 1, the patient will be recalled on day 2 and the&#xD;
           extrapolated data on the slope of the curve between D1 and D2&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Telephone follow-up by the interviewer on the day and filling in the questionnaire - if&#xD;
           the patient is not available on day 3, the patient will be recalled on day 4 and the&#xD;
           data extrapolated according to the slope of the curve between D1 and D4; if the patient&#xD;
           is not available at D4, he will be recalled to D5 and the extrapolated data between D1&#xD;
           and D5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Telephone follow-up on the interviewer's day and fill in the questionnaire in case of&#xD;
           non-availability of the patient on day 7, the patient will be recalled to D8 and the&#xD;
           data extrapolated according to the slope of the curve between D3 and D8; if the patient&#xD;
           is still not available on D8, he will be recalled to D9 and the extrapolated data&#xD;
           between D3 and D9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the night sample : from 6:30 pm to 8 am Recall should be 24 hours after the care, but it&#xD;
      seems not ethical or efficient to recall patients the night following ; an extension of 12&#xD;
      hours will be instaurated, taking then the recalls to 36h (D1), 84h (D3), and 180h (D7) after&#xD;
      the care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the WE sample : from 8 am to 6:30 pm D1: 24 hours after the care D3: 72 hours after the&#xD;
      care D7 :168 hours after the care&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.1.STATISTICAL ASPECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.1. Statistical justification for the sample size 58,921 patients were received in&#xD;
      emergency consultation day and night during the year 2017. We wish to constitute a sample of&#xD;
      1% of the population concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the night sample The investigators are interested here in patients received in night&#xD;
      emergencies, 26 050 patients in 2018. On average 72 patients are received daily in&#xD;
      emergencies of day, about 504 per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a previous study in the department (15), 50% of patients in care could not be&#xD;
      included in the study or were lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This leads to a number of 252 analysable patients per week. The investigators will therefore&#xD;
      conduct our study over 9 nights, to include 325 patients, ie 1.25% of the population&#xD;
      consulting For the WE sample The investigators are interested here in patients received in&#xD;
      Saturday and Sunday emergencies, 10 657 patients in 2018. On average 204 patients are&#xD;
      received each week-end in emergencies of day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a previous study in the department (15), 50% of patients in care could not be&#xD;
      included in the study or were lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This leads to a number of 102 analysable patients per week-end. The investigators will&#xD;
      therefore conduct our study over 2 week-ends, to include 204 patients, ie 1.9% of the&#xD;
      population consulting&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.2. Description of statistical methods A descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the&#xD;
      sample will be performed (age, sex, reason for consultation, diagnosis, prior appointment&#xD;
      test, average score of anxiety and pain scores on D0, D1, D3, D7, compliance with&#xD;
      instructions and making follow-up appointments,), satisfaction rating, appreciation of the&#xD;
      quality of medical care, politeness of staff, waiting time, assessment of the quality of the&#xD;
      care setting, the information received, the treatment received, and the recommendation of the&#xD;
      service to third parties will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis of the evolution of pain and anxiety scores between D0, D1, D3 and D7 will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations between the type of treatment and the perceived pain as well as the type of&#xD;
      treatment and the perceived anxiety will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.3. Method of taking into account missing or invalid data Patients unreachable during the&#xD;
      telephone follow-up period will be contacted the next day; the pain and anxiety scores will&#xD;
      then be extrapolated from the previous data and the new data collected, by calculating the&#xD;
      nearest point on the curve connecting these two data. If they are new unreachable, the data&#xD;
      will be considered missing. Data from patients with missing data will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. DATA MANAGEMENT III.1. Terms of data collection The research does not foresee the use of&#xD;
      data extracted from existing information systems or from previously completed studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No nominative data will be collected as part of this research. The data will be rendered&#xD;
      non-identifying. They must not in any case show in clear the names of the persons concerned&#xD;
      or their address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this research, topics will be identified as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N or W (depending on the Night or Week-end sample) - Chronological order of the person (3&#xD;
      digits) - first letter of the first name - first letter of last name The answers to the&#xD;
      different questionnaires (completed by the patients and the interviewers) will be entered&#xD;
      into an EXCEL file. This file will be protected by a password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The seizure will be carried out by the coordinating investigator or one of those&#xD;
      collaborators (dentist or student) declared in the center and trained in research at the end&#xD;
      of each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.2. Data circuit The investigators will collect the data directly from the patient during&#xD;
      the consultation or during telephone interviews on paper forms (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data will then be entered into an Excel database specifically created for the search.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database will be kept on the computer of the odontology service at the Pitié-Salpêtrière&#xD;
      hospital and will be protected by a password known only to research stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be done by the principal investigator and the research stakeholders&#xD;
