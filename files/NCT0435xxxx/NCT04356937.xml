  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, multi-center study to evaluate the effects of tocilizumab&#xD;
      compared to placebo on patient outcomes in participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      and evidence of systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the effect of Tocilizumab on multi-organ dysfunction in a&#xD;
      phase 3 randomized controlled trial among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, as compared to placebo, we will test whether tocilizumab is associated with a&#xD;
      reduction in multi-organ dysfunction among hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients with elevated&#xD;
      inflammatory measures. Multi-organ dysfunction will be measured as the incidence of the&#xD;
      following composite endpoint (mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, mechanical&#xD;
      support, need for inotropes or vasopressors, liver dysfunction (increased bilirubin), and&#xD;
      all-cause mortality). We will also assess multiple pre-specified secondary (exploratory)&#xD;
      endpoints and safety endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that, as compared to placebo, tocilizumab will reduce transfer to the ICU,&#xD;
      need for mechanical ventilation, increase rates of hospital discharge in patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with severe COVID-19 infection and evidence of exaggerated inflammatory response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As of April 3, 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in over 1 million people worldwide, with an&#xD;
      estimated symptomatic case fatality ratio of around 1.4%. Currently without an effective&#xD;
      treatment for SARS-CoV-2 there is an urgent need for effective treatment to curtail the rate&#xD;
      of respiratory failure, the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 disease. Moreover, with&#xD;
      increasing numbers of patients requiring intensive unit level care and mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, nations are already having to triage patients for ventilatory support due to&#xD;
      limited resources and healthcare systems around the world being stretched to the point of&#xD;
      collapse, highlighting the importance of identifying interventions that could prevent the&#xD;
      development of respiratory failure for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease course of COVID-19 includes an incubation period, an acute viral phase that most&#xD;
      commonly presents with flu-like symptoms that in some individuals progresses to a severe&#xD;
      hyperinflammatory phase marked by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxemic&#xD;
      respiratory failure.Though there is spectrum of clinical course, many progress to the&#xD;
      hyperinflammatory phase around day seven of symptoms, often requiring intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) level care and mechanical ventilation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the&#xD;
      pathophysiology underlying this profound decline is a severe inflammatory response as&#xD;
      demonstrated by multi organ system dysfunction akin to cytokine release syndrome&#xD;
      (CRS)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).CRS/MAS is a systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome&#xD;
      on a spectrum with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), typically&#xD;
      characterized by multiorgan failure that is often triggered by viral infections in the&#xD;
      setting of excessive immune activation, typically with marked hyperferritinemia.Postmortem&#xD;
      assessment of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated pathologic findings consistent with&#xD;
      MAS such as mono/lymphocytic infiltrates within the lung parenchyma with associated edema and&#xD;
      alveolar congestion, splenic necrosis with macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytosis, as&#xD;
      well as a lymphocyte/histiocyte predominate infiltrate of portal vasculature accompanying&#xD;
      liver necrosis and sinusoidal congestion.Cytokine profiling of patients with MAS/sHLH&#xD;
      overlaps with that seen in patients with severe COVID-19 and includes elevated levels of&#xD;
      IL-1, IL-2, IL-7, IL-6, G-CSF, MCP- 1, and TNF-α as well as elevated D-dimer, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, LDH and troponins.Moreover, preliminary data from a non-randomized series of&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients with &quot;severe or critical COVID-19&quot; from China who were treated with&#xD;
      tocilizumab (in addition to standard therapies) showed they had dramatic improvement in&#xD;
      fever, arterial oxygen saturation and inflammatory markers within the first 24-hours&#xD;
      following administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these data strongly suggest an immunologic link between COVID-19 and immune&#xD;
      dysregulation resulting in MAS. Clinical trials are already underway studying the role of&#xD;
      immunomodulatory therapy including modulation of IL-1 and IL-6 and downstream pathways in the&#xD;
      setting of CAR-T induced MAS (NCT04150913, NCT04071366) and agents such anakinra and&#xD;
      tocilizumab have been used in this context with promising results and good safety profiles.&#xD;
      There is an urgent and dire need to study the therapeutic role for immunomodulatory therapy&#xD;
      in COVID-19 disease to both halt disease progression in patients at an individual level and&#xD;
      prevent the inevitable saturation of healthcare resources at a systems level, to which end&#xD;
      there are numerous ongoing international trials to expand these efforts into the setting of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection (ChiCTR2000029765, NCT04324021, TOCOVID-19). Based on the MGH experience&#xD;
      thus far with COVID-19, including over 200 patients to date, the need for mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation has been approximately 30%. With the upcoming surge anticipated between April&#xD;
      17th and 21st we expect the need for hundreds of additional ICU beds. Investigators propose a&#xD;
      trial of IL-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab given early in disease course to try to&#xD;
      prevent progression of COVID-19.&#xD;
