    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well T-DMI with or without abemaciclib works for the&#xD;
      treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). T-DM1 is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy&#xD;
      drug called DM1. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and&#xD;
      delivers DM1 to kill them. Abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving T-DM1 and abemaciclib may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer compared to T-DM1 alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether progression-free survival (PFS) is improved with the addition of&#xD;
      abemaciclib to trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for patients with estrogen receptor positive&#xD;
      (ER+)HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer who progressed on treatment with a&#xD;
      taxane, trastuzumab and pertuzumab (Cohort 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess whether progression-free survival (PFS) is improved with the addition of&#xD;
      abemaciclib to T-DM1 for patients with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) HER2-positive&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer who progressed on treatment with a taxane, trastuzumab&#xD;
      and pertuzumab (Cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of each treatment regimen. II. To assess overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) of each treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether the presence of vimentin expression or the level of tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes (TILs) in the baseline tumor specimen is associated with an increased likelihood&#xD;
      of longer PFS in the abemaciclib arms compared to the non-abemaciclib arms (regardless of ER&#xD;
      status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess both the baseline prognostic effects of circulating tumor cell (CTC) levels, ER&#xD;
      expression in CTCs, HER2 expression in CTCs, serum TK1 levels, circulating tumor-derived&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA), ESR1, or PIK3CA mutations and whether a reduction in these&#xD;
      levels after 2 cycles of treatment is associated with an increased likelihood of longer PFS&#xD;
      overall and separately in the treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess whether polymorphisms in FCgamma receptors (FCGR2A and FCGR3A) are associated&#xD;
      with inferior PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe alterations seen in the peripheral blood immune system architecture after 2&#xD;
      cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess whether peripheral blood immune markers at baseline are prognostic and whether&#xD;
      change in peripheral blood immune markers after 2 cycles of treatment are associated with&#xD;
      PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive T-DM1 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive T-DM1 IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and abemaciclib orally (PO) twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;
