      This will be an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover study to compare the&#xD;
      bioavailability of two IMP4297 formulations (10 mg capsules and 20 mg capsules) after single&#xD;
      oral administration of 100 mg IMP4297 under fasted condition in healthy male subjects. It&#xD;
      will be conducted at one site, and approximately a total of 18 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment sequences according to a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization schedule. Each treatment sequence will consist of 2 periods,&#xD;
      separated by a washout period of at least 7 days between each period.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed&#xD;

             measurement, temperature, 12-lead ECG, or clinical laboratory tests, etc., judged by&#xD;
             the investigator. For example, the reference normal ranges (inclusive) are as follows:&#xD;
             after at least 5-minute rest in a supine position, BP: 90-139/60-89 mmHg, and PR:&#xD;
             50-100 bpm. Repeat assessment can be conducted at the discretion of the investigator&#xD;

             &gt;120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTcF or&#xD;
             QRS values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;
