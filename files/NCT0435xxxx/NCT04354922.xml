  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise intervention for depression was conventionally recommended three times&#xD;
      weekly with moderate intensity in previous studies, but little is known about the training&#xD;
      effect of aerobic exercise at low frequency and vigorous intensity. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to compare the training effect of aerobic exercise at different exercising frequencies and&#xD;
      intensities on older adults with comorbid insomnia and depressive symptoms. In this study, we&#xD;
      will investigate two types of aerobic exercise (i.e., vigorous-intensity exercise and&#xD;
      moderate-intensity exercise) under different exercising frequencies (i.e., regular exercising&#xD;
      pattern and weekend warrior). Individuals with chronic insomnia and depressive symptoms will&#xD;
      be recruited and randomly allocated into 5 groups: 1) attention control group (stretching&#xD;
      exercise), 2) moderate intensity exercise performed thrice weekly (MIE×3/wk), 3) moderate&#xD;
      intensity exercise performed once weekly (MIE×1/wk), 4) vigorous intensity exercise performed&#xD;
      thrice weekly (VIE×3/wk), and 5) vigorous intensity exercise performed once weekly&#xD;
      (VIE×1/wk). Intervention will be maintained for 12 weeks. Outcome assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the intervention. Outcomes including&#xD;
      depressive status, chronic insomnia, objective sleep quality and pattern (measured by&#xD;
      Actigraphy), subjective sleep quality (measured by Epworth sleepiness scale, insomnia&#xD;
      severity index, PSQI), anxiety status (measured by HADS and GAD-7), quality of life (measured&#xD;
      by SF-12), attention level (measured by computer attention test), exercise enjoyment&#xD;
      (measured by physical activity enjoyment scale), habitual physical activity level (measured&#xD;
      by IPAQ), aerobic fitness (measured by metabolic cart), body adiposity (measured by DXA),&#xD;
      blood chemistry, adherence, medication usage, and adverse events will be measure in this&#xD;
      study. This proposed study will provide pilot evidence for the benefits, effectiveness,&#xD;
      safety, adherence, and sustainability of low-frequency vigorous aerobic exercise. We expect&#xD;
      the low-frequency exercise modality will enhance the practical suitability of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise and will provide evidence for weekend warrior aerobic training strategy as a new&#xD;
      exercise option in the management of elderly insomnia and depression.&#xD;
