    <textblock>
      Climate change not only affects the planet's natural resources, but also severely impacts&#xD;
      human health. An individual's ability to adequately cope with short- or long-term increases&#xD;
      in ambient temperature is critical for maintaining health and wellbeing. Prolonged increases&#xD;
      in temperature (heatwaves) pose a serious health risk for older adults, who have a reduced&#xD;
      capacity to efficiently regulate body temperature. However, information regarding the impact&#xD;
      of age on body temperature regulation during prolonged exposure to extreme heat is lacking,&#xD;
      as is research on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing heat strain in such&#xD;
      situations. This project will address these important knowledge gaps by exposing healthy&#xD;
      young and older adults to a prolonged (9 hour) heat exposure, with conditions representative&#xD;
      of heatwaves in temperate continental climates. An additional cohort of older adults will&#xD;
      complete the same heatwave simulation but will be briefly (2 hours) exposed to cooler&#xD;
      conditions (22-23°C) mid-way through the session (akin to visiting a cooling centre or cooled&#xD;
      location). The investigators will evaluate age-related differences in the capacity to&#xD;
      dissipate heat via direct air calorimetry (a unique device that permits the precise&#xD;
      measurement of the heat dissipated by the human body) and their effect on the regulation of&#xD;
      body temperature. The investigators anticipate that older adults will exhibit progressive&#xD;
      increases in the heat stored in the body throughout the simulated heatwave, resulting in&#xD;
      progressive increases in body core temperature. Further, older adults exposed to brief-mid&#xD;
      day cooling will rapidly gain heat upon re-exposure to high ambient temperatures. As a&#xD;
      result, by the end of exposure body temperatures will be similar to the group not removed&#xD;
      from the heat.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES Intervention 1: Evaluate the effect of age on whole-body heat storage, body core&#xD;
      temperature, and the development of cardiovascular strain and acute inflammation during&#xD;
      day-long (9 hours) exposure to simulated heatwave conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 2: Determine whether short-duration exposure (2 hours) to an air-conditioned&#xD;
      environment following extreme heat exposure results in lasting reductions in physiological&#xD;
      strain in older adults upon return to the heat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Intervention 1: Older adults will experience greater heat storage throughout the&#xD;
      9-hour simulated heatwave compared to the younger participants. Consequently, body core&#xD;
      temperature will be greater in the older adults and between-group differences will be&#xD;
      exacerbated as exposure progresses. We will also explore the secondary hypothesis that&#xD;
      differences in body temperature will be paralleled by greater alterations in cardiovascular&#xD;
      variables and acute circulatory and intracellular inflammation in the older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 2: Body heat storage will be exacerbated in the older adults exposed to the&#xD;
      cooling centre intervention upon return to the heat (hours 5-6) compared to the older adults&#xD;
      from Intervention 1 who remained in the heat. Consequently, body core temperature will be&#xD;
      comparable (statistically equivalent) between groups by the end of exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Participants A total of 20 young (age: 18-31 years) and 40 older (age: 64-80 years)&#xD;
      adults will be recruited for the proposed project, with an approximately even distribution of&#xD;
      men and women in each intervention arm. Young (n = 20) and older (n = 20) adults will&#xD;
      complete Intervention 1 and a separate cohort of older adults (n = 20) will complete&#xD;
      Intervention 2. Participants will be homogenous for anthropomorphic characteristics as well&#xD;
      as habitual physical activity levels as verified via standardized questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design Pre-trial instructions All participants will be asked to avoid strenuous&#xD;
      physical activity and alcohol for 24 hours prior to all preliminary and experimental sessions&#xD;
      and to eat a light meal 2 hours before the start of each session. Participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to consume a minimum of 500 ml of water the night before and morning of each session to&#xD;
      ensure adequate hydration. Adequate hydration will be verified upon arrival to the laboratory&#xD;
      (urine specific gravity &lt;1.025). For all sessions, participants will wear athletic shorts&#xD;
      (and a sport top for women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary screening All participants will complete one preliminary evaluation a minimum of&#xD;
      7 days before the first experimental session. During this session they will be familiarized&#xD;
      with all procedures and measurement techniques and will complete the Get Active Questionnaire&#xD;
      (GAQ) and the American Heart Association Pre-participation screening Questionnaire to assess&#xD;
      their eligibility to participate. The GAQ will also be used to assess habitual activity&#xD;
      levels along with the Kohl Physical Activity Questionnaire. Participants will also provide&#xD;
      verbal and written informed consent at this time. Body height and mass will be determined via&#xD;
      a physician stadiometer and a high-performance weighing terminal, respectively, and from&#xD;
      these measurements body surface area will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol (Intervention 1) Each session will commence at 07:00-09:00. Upon&#xD;
      arrival to the laboratory, the participant will provide a urine sample for the assessment of&#xD;
      urine specific gravity, after which a measurement of nude body mass will be obtained.&#xD;
      Participants will then insert a temperature probe for the continuous measurement of rectal&#xD;
      temperature. Thereafter, participants will be instrumented for the measurement of skin&#xD;
      temperature and 5-lead echocardiogram. Baseline cardiovascular parameters will be evaluated&#xD;
      via a brief (~45 min) cardiovascular test battery, performed as follows. Brachial arterial&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic pressures reconstructed from arterial pressure waveforms measured at&#xD;
      the right middle finger (volume clamp technique) and 5-lead echocardiogram recordings will be&#xD;
      collected for 10-min while the participant rests quietly (spontaneous breathing). Immediately&#xD;
      thereafter, arterial systolic and diastolic pressures will be measured in triplicate via&#xD;
      manual auscultation (~30 sec between measures), after which forearm and calf blood flows on&#xD;
      the right side of the body will be measured via automated venous occlusion plethysmography.&#xD;
      Throughout the test battery, the participant will be seated with both feet on the floor,&#xD;
      except for during the measurements of limb blood flow, where the instrumented limbs will be&#xD;
      elevated to facilitate venous drainage. Finally, a venous blood sample and body mass&#xD;
      measurement will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be transferred to the whole-body direct calorimeter chamber, regulated&#xD;
      to 40°C and ~10-15% humidity. These conditions were chosen to simulate peak temperatures&#xD;
      experienced during heatwaves and are similar to peak conditions in recent heatwaves in North&#xD;
      America in 2018 (Ottawa, Ontario; 34°C and 58%, heat index: 41°C) and Europe in 2003 (Paris,&#xD;
      France; 38°C and 25%, heat index: 38°C). The participant will rest quietly for 3-hours (hours&#xD;
      1-3) within the calorimeter chamber while whole-body heat production and exchange are&#xD;
      measured continuously. At the 3-hour mark, the participant will exit the calorimeter and the&#xD;
      brief cardiovascular test battery will be performed again followed by a measurement of body&#xD;
      mass. Hours 4-6 will be spent resting in the heat in the thermal chamber adjacent to the&#xD;
      calorimeter. During this time, participants will be allowed to consume a light, self-provided&#xD;
      lunch with low water content. Tap water will be provided ad libitum via a self-service&#xD;
      insulated water cooler located in the thermal chamber. Another cardiovascular battery will&#xD;
      then be performed followed by a measurement of body mass. The participant will then re-enter&#xD;
      the calorimeter where the final 3 hours will be spent (hours 6-9). At the end of this period,&#xD;
      the participants will undergo a fourth and final cardiovascular test battery and a final&#xD;
      venous blood sample and body mass measurement will be procured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and sample size calculations Primary and secondary variables will be&#xD;
      evaluated using linear mixed-effects models. Time will be modelled as a repeated&#xD;
      within-subject fixed effect, and age-group will be modelled as a between-subject fixed&#xD;
      effect. Pre-heat exposure values of the outcome variable, participant sex, and self-reported&#xD;
      weekly physical activity (min/week, as assessed via the GAQ) will be included as covariates.&#xD;
      Participant identification will be modeled as a random effect in all analyses. Akaike's&#xD;
      information criterion will be used to determine random effect and variance/covariance&#xD;
      structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post hoc multiple comparisons will be made on model estimated marginal means. Given the small&#xD;
      number of comparisons for each variable, multiplicity corrections will not be employed.&#xD;
      Homoscedasticity will be evaluated for all models by visual assessment of residual plots.&#xD;
      Approximate normal distribution of residuals will be assessed via visual inspection of&#xD;
      histograms and Q-Q plots. Data will be log-transformed in the event that the distribution of&#xD;
      residuals meaningfully deviates from normality. For all analyses, alpha will be set at 0.050.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be presented as means and standard deviations. Comparisons&#xD;
      between groups and/or time-points will be presented as means and 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      [lower limit, upper limit].&#xD;
&#xD;
      An a priori power analysis determined that a total sample size of 19 young and 19 older&#xD;
      adults was required to detect a difference in the rate of whole-body heat storage between&#xD;
      groups at the end of each calorimeter session (i.e., hours 3 and 9) with 80% statistical&#xD;
      power. In lieu of clinically meaningful data (i.e., what would be considered a clinically&#xD;
      meaningful change in whole-body heat storage), the standardized effect size (Cohen's d=1.06)&#xD;
      was calculated based on the difference in the rate of whole-body heat storage between young&#xD;
      and older adults over the final 30-min of a 3-hour heat exposure protocol (young: -2 [26]&#xD;
      kJ/hour, older: 43 [54] kJ/hour) in our previous work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol (Intervention 2) Experimental design The protocol for Intervention 2 is&#xD;
      identical to that of Intervention 1 except that after the first calorimeter session and&#xD;
      subsequent cardiovascular battery, participants will exit the thermal chamber and spend ~2&#xD;
      hours (hours 5-6) resting in an air-conditioned room (~23°C, ~50% relative humidity). Similar&#xD;
      to Intervention 1, participants will be allowed to eat a small self-provided lunch during&#xD;
      this time and consume water (tap) ad libitum. The third cardiovascular battery will also be&#xD;
      performed in the cooled environment. As in Intervention 1, participants will then re-enter&#xD;
      the calorimeter for the final 3 hours, where they will rest in the heat for the remainder of&#xD;
      the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and sample size calculations Statistical analysis for Intervention 2&#xD;
      will be performed to assess whether mid-day exposure to a cooled room results in greater body&#xD;
      heat storage following exposure such that physiological responses are similar to those of the&#xD;
      non-cooled group by the end of the 9-hour heatwave simulation. Cumulative whole-body heat&#xD;
      storage will be evaluated using a linear mixed-effects model with experimental group modelled&#xD;
      as a between-subject fixed effect. Cumulative heat storage over the first three hours of the&#xD;
      9-hour exposure will be included as a covariate to account for the influence of any inter- or&#xD;
      intra-individual factors (e.g., sex, physical activity levels), measured or unmeasured,&#xD;
      impacting whole-body heat exchange and storage. Comparisons of heat storage between groups&#xD;
      will be made using model estimated marginal means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body core temperature, as estimated by rectal temperature (primary outcome), will be analyzed&#xD;
      with a linear mixed effects model with experimental group (two levels: cooling and&#xD;
      no-cooling) modelled as a between-subject fixed effect and time as a repeated within-subject&#xD;
      fixed effect (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-hours post-cooling intervention). Like the model for heat&#xD;
      storage, rectal temperature at the end of the first calorimetry session (i.e., hour 3 of the&#xD;
      9-hour exposure) will be included as a covariate to account for the influence of any measured&#xD;
      or unmeasured inter- or intra-individual factors impacting the body temperature responses to&#xD;
      resting heat exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of cooling on rectal temperature will then be assessed via two one-sided tests&#xD;
      performed on the mixed-effects model derived estimated marginal means at each timepoint.&#xD;
      Equivalence bounds will be set to ±0.3°C, which corresponds to the typical day-to-day&#xD;
      variation of core temperature and has been suggested to reflect a meaningful/detectable&#xD;
      change in body temperatures in a recent study assessing the influence of cooling strategies&#xD;
      on physiological strain in young adults. Secondary variables will be similarly evaluated. The&#xD;
      level of significance will be set at P &lt; 0.050. Descriptive statistics will be presented as&#xD;
      mean (standard deviation) and comparisons between groups will be presented as mean ± 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An a priori power analysis determined that a total sample size of 18 older adults in each&#xD;
      group (36 participants total) is required to confirm whether between-group differences in&#xD;
      rectal temperature are equivalent within upper and lower bounds of +0.3°C and -0.3°C,&#xD;
      respectively, with 80% power. This corresponds to an effect size (Cohen's d) of 1.0, based on&#xD;
      the pooled-standard deviation of 0.3°C, determined from published data from our laboratory&#xD;
      demonstrating a 0.2°C (SD 0.3) difference in core temperature between young and older adults&#xD;
      and a 0.0°C (SD 0.3) difference in core temperature between older adults with and without&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes following 3 hours of rest in a hot environment.&#xD;
