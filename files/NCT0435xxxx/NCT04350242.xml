    <textblock>
      Epidemiology, a word derived from the Greek epi (on) demos (people), is a scientific&#xD;
      discipline in the area of medicine that studies the distribution, frequency and determining&#xD;
      factors of chemical diseases in defined human populations. It is the method of problem&#xD;
      solving research used by epidemiologists, scientists, statisticians, doctors, and other&#xD;
      health professionals to get to the root of health problems in a community. Beyond the&#xD;
      important role of descriptive epidemiology in generating etiological hypotheses, it also&#xD;
      provides a description of the frequency and / or patterns of disease occurrence at the&#xD;
      individual or social level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of medicine and physiotherapy, epidemiological studies of musculoskeletal&#xD;
      injuries acquire great relevance considering that they are the main cause of disability,&#xD;
      increasing their prevalence year after year and carrying high economic and social costs.&#xD;
      Worldwide, the Epidemiology of musculoskeletal pathologies has been reported in both the&#xD;
      general population and specific populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that kinesiology has been an established profession in Argentina since the&#xD;
      1940s, there is an evident lack of scientific information on this discipline. Currently,&#xD;
      epidemiological reports of published musculoskeletal pathologies are scarce in our country.&#xD;
      To our knowledge, the characteristics of the population of patients with musculoskeletal&#xD;
      injuries who attend a private sports kinesiology office are not known. A study of these&#xD;
      characteristics could help to better understand this population, improving routine clinical&#xD;
      practice, as well as providing a database for the development of future scientific studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, the main objective of this study is to describe the characteristics of the&#xD;
      patients who come to an external kinesiology office at a private institution in Argentina.&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the relationship between the body mass index (BMI) and&#xD;
      the affected body regions.&#xD;

      Design Variables related to injury Analytical, cross-sectional and retrospective study will&#xD;
      be recorded. Population Those patients who attended a private physiotherapy center in the&#xD;
      Autonomous City of Buenos Aires between January 2017 and December 2019 were consecutively&#xD;
      included. Those cases in which the affected body region was not recorded were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the characteristics of the study, the signing of the informed consent by the patients&#xD;
      was not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process The information used for the analysis was collected during the first session in an&#xD;
      evaluation form, prepared by kinesiologists belonging to the institution and used since&#xD;
      January 2017. All the professionals who participated in the study had a prior period of&#xD;
      theoretical training in the use of the file and the registration of the data. The information&#xD;
      of each patient was collected by kinesiologists from this institution and posted on a&#xD;
      Microsoft Excel® spreadsheet from which the corresponding analyzes were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic variables The following variables will be recorded: sex, age, weight,&#xD;
      height, body mass index (BMI), laterality, main sport, smoking, hours of rest and quality of&#xD;
      self-perceived sleep (good, fair or poor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables: affected body region, type of injury, duration and form of onset of&#xD;
      symptoms (acute without apparent reason, acute by specific event, gradual without apparent&#xD;
      reason and gradual by specific event).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis Categorical variables are reported as presentation number and percentage.&#xD;
      Continuous variables that assume a symmetric distribution are reported as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation, while those with asymmetric distribution as median and interquartile range (RIC&#xD;
      25-75). A univariate analysis was used to search for the association between BMI and&#xD;
      probability of injury. The R Markdown program was used for data analysis.&#xD;
