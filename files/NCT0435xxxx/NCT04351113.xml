  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged periods of reduced activity are associated with decreased vascular function and&#xD;
      muscle atrophy. Physical inactivity due to acute hospitalization is also associated with&#xD;
      impaired recovery, hospital readmission, and increased mortality. Older adults are a&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable population as functional (vascular and skeletal muscle mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction) and structural deficits (loss in muscle mass leading to a reduction in strength)&#xD;
      are a consequence of the aging process. The combination of inactivity and aging poses an&#xD;
      added health threat to these individuals by accelerating the negative impact on vascular and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle function and dysfunction. The underlying factors leading to vascular and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle dysfunction are unknown, but have been linked to increases in oxidative&#xD;
      stress. Additionally, there is a lack of understanding of how vascular function is impacted&#xD;
      by inactivity in humans and how these changes are related to skeletal muscle function. It is&#xD;
      our goal to investigate the mechanisms that contribute to disuse muscle atrophy and vascular&#xD;
      dysfunction in order to diminish their negative impact, and preserve vascular and skeletal&#xD;
      muscle function across all the lifespan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disuse following injury or during acute hospitalization is associated with a host of negative&#xD;
      outcomes including functional deficiencies, hospital readmission, disability, and increased&#xD;
      mortality. Older adults are a particularly vulnerable population as functional (vascular and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle dysfunction) and structural deficits (loss in muscle mass leading to a&#xD;
      reduction in strength) are present as a consequence of the aging process. Any additional and&#xD;
      accelerated insult caused by disuse poses a serious health threat to these older individuals&#xD;
      by depleting their already diminished physiological and functional reserve and hastening the&#xD;
      onset of disability. Current strategies aimed at preserving function during disuse have&#xD;
      focused on preserving skeletal muscle mass and strength while the critical role of the&#xD;
      vasculature has been largely ignored. Moreover, the underlying cause of dysfunction has not&#xD;
      been adequately addressed in humans. This disintegrated and myopic approach likely&#xD;
      contributes to the fact that interventions capable of preserving health during disuse do not&#xD;
      exist. The vascular and skeletal muscle systems are inextricably linked to optimal mobility&#xD;
      through oxygen and nutrient delivery, thus, vascular dysfunction likely contributes to and&#xD;
      exacerbates skeletal muscle deficiencies that occur during disuse. To fully understand the&#xD;
      impact of disuse on health and mobility and develop effective countermeasures it is our&#xD;
      contention that both the vascular and musculoskeletal systems must be examined and the root&#xD;
      cause of the problem must be addressed. While the underlying factors leading to these&#xD;
      accelerated losses during disuse are unknown, they appear to be mechanistically linked to&#xD;
      oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term goal is to minimize losses in vascular and skeletal muscle function that occur&#xD;
      during disuse in order to maintain functional reserve and avoid serious adverse events. The&#xD;
      objective here, which is the next step in pursuit of this goal, is to determine how oxidative&#xD;
      stress contributes to disuse-induced vascular and skeletal muscle dysfunction. It is our&#xD;
      central hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers the accelerated declines in vascular and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle function during disuse. To test this hypothesis and provide compelling&#xD;
      evidence that oxidative stress is the trigger of dysfunction the investigators will utilize&#xD;
      two novel and fundamentally distinct strategies to improve redox balance during disuse. In&#xD;
      Aim 1, the mitochondrial targeted antioxidant (MITO-AO) mitoquinone will be administered&#xD;
      during disuse to improve free radical scavenging at the level of the mitochondria. In Aim 2,&#xD;
      activation of Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2-like 2 (Nrf2) the &quot;master regulator of antioxidant&#xD;
      enzymes&quot; will be accomplished with PB125 (a novel naturally occurring Nrf2 activator) to&#xD;
      augment endogenous antioxidant defense systems. The impact of these interventions on measures&#xD;
      of isolated and integrated vascular and skeletal muscle function before and after disuse will&#xD;
      be examined. The central hypothesis is supported by preliminary data reporting substantial&#xD;
      losses in vascular and skeletal muscle function and concomitant increases in oxidative stress&#xD;
      following 5 days of bed rest. Importantly, MITO-AO prevents disuse-induced losses in muscle&#xD;
      mass and restores age-related deficits in vascular function in aged animals and humans&#xD;
      (preliminary data). Additionally, PB125 activates the Nrf2 pathway at multiple control points&#xD;
      resulting in prolonged and amplified activation and subsequent gene expression of key&#xD;
      antioxidant enzymes leading to a decrease in oxidative stress in humans (preliminary data).&#xD;
