  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection rates are on a rapid rise within Asian Pacific Americans (APA) communities,&#xD;
      with 80% of new infects being men. The purpose of this study is to adapt and evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of a 4-session, 4-week family-informed self-management intervention protocol to&#xD;
      promote health among APA men with HIV (APAMHIV). Family-informed self-management is a&#xD;
      promising intervention to assist APAMHIV in securing family support and promoting health, and&#xD;
      hence help address HIV epidemics in this understudied population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection rates are on a rapid rise within Asian Pacific Americans (APA) communities, 17%&#xD;
      annually, with men comprising 80% of new infections in the United States. Optimal&#xD;
      self-management is a key to HIV treatment success, because it may alleviate physical and&#xD;
      mental symptoms, promote health behaviors, and therefore enhance quality of life and suppress&#xD;
      virus replication. Studies suggested that securing assistance from family members in&#xD;
      self-management may be effective in addressing these challenges in APA communities. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to adapt and evaluate the feasibility of a 4-session, 4-week&#xD;
      family-informed self-management intervention protocol to promote health among APA men with&#xD;
      HIV (APAMHIV). The scientific premise is, regardless of Asian ethnicity, APA communities&#xD;
      often share a more collectivist orientation, such that APA prioritizing their&#xD;
      responsibilities to their families over their own individual needs. To preserve the harmony&#xD;
      in family, HIV disclosure is often indirect. In previous projects, investigators interviewed&#xD;
      an ethnically diverse sample of 40 APAMHIV and 20 family members to explore self- and family-&#xD;
      management strategies. The hypothesis is that APAMHIV will receive greater levels of family&#xD;
      support and health following the family-informed self-management intervention. This study&#xD;
      addresses the critical need to optimize self-management skills among APAMHIV that&#xD;
      simultaneously address the needs of APAMHIV with support from their families. The long-term&#xD;
      goal is to implement a comprehensive, family-informed self-management intervention for&#xD;
      APAMHIV. In this project, researchers will conduct a mixed-methods study with two study&#xD;
      phases. In Phase 1, researchers will analyze the available qualitative data from the prior&#xD;
      projects to revise the conceptualization of family-informed self-management. Based on the&#xD;
      revised conceptualization, researchers will adapt an evidence-based self-management&#xD;
      intervention using a modified ADAPT-ITT model. In Phase 2, researchers will conduct a pilot&#xD;
      waitlist-controlled clinical trial to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the adapted family-informed self-management intervention among 30 APAMHIV without&#xD;
      explicitly involving their family members. This small RCT will contain two arms, with&#xD;
      participants randomly assigned to either the immediate treatment group (IT Group) or the&#xD;
      delayed treatment group (DT Group). Researchers will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary effect sizes, and use the data to revise this family-informed self-management&#xD;
      intervention protocol. This will provide the basis for future applications for a fully&#xD;
      powered Randomized Controlled Trial of the protocol in the future. Aims are to: 1. Follow the&#xD;
      ADAPT-ITT model to culturally adapt an evidence-based family-informed self-management&#xD;
      intervention 2. Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy with a&#xD;
      randomized waitlist-controlled trial. And, 3. Finalize the study protocols for future project&#xD;
      operations by documenting emerging difficulties and solutions throughout this project&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Intervention Core Modules: Developed upon the results of the prior studies involving familial relations among APA HIV+ populations, the family-informed self-management intervention has been fully manualized, and has eight modules: (1) psycho-education, (2) cognitive-behavioral management skills training, (3) preparation for disclosure, (4) family relations and support management, (5) anxiety and depressive symptom management, (6) brief mindfulness training, (7) symptom reduction, and (8) the Life-Steps program. The intervention will be delivered via four face-to-face, one-on-one counseling sessions to the participants over 4 weeks. Each module will take on 30 minutes for delivery and each session will deliver two modules in sequence. The primary desired outcome is improved quality of life and diminished viral load.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>There are four data collection points: week 1 (before intervention for immediate treatment (IT) group), week 4 (right after intervention for the IT group, but before intervention for delayed treatment (DT) group), week 7 (after intervention for the DT group), and week 10. Therefore, in this data collection schedule, the IT group will have one-baseline (week 1), two-post-intervention evaluation (week 4), and three and four- follow-ups with 3-week intervals (week 7 and week 10), while the DT group will have 2 baselines (week 1 &amp; week 4), 1 post-intervention evaluation (week 7), and 1 follow-up with a 3-week interval (week 10). Assessment consists of surveying at two times and a dried blood spot test at week 1 and 4.</masking_description>
