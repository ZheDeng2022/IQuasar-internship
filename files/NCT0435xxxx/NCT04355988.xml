    <textblock>
      Increased incidence of peri-radicular lesions have been reported in diabetic patients which&#xD;
      has been implicated due to compromised immune response. Much research has been done on the&#xD;
      pathogenesis and progression of this lesion in diabetic patients. Although there are few&#xD;
      studies which focus on healing of periradicular lesions after nonsurgical root canal&#xD;
      treatment. There is a lacunae in literature which highlights peri-radicular healing after&#xD;
      nonsurgical root canal treatment in relation to Glycaemic control in diabetic patients&#xD;
      measured in terms of HbA1c levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is defined as a group of metabolic disorders characterized by chronic&#xD;
      hyperglycemia with disturbances in carbohydrates, fat, and protein metabolism resulting from&#xD;
      defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The effects of diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      include long-term damage, dysfunction and failure of various organs: eyes, kidneys, nerves,&#xD;
      heart, and blood vessels . Diabetes Mellitus is broadly classified into two types. Diabetes&#xD;
      due to reduced insulin secretion from islet cells of pancreas is are known as type 1 and&#xD;
      Diabetes due to combination of insulin resistance , reduced or increased insulin secretion&#xD;
      are known as type 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main detrimental effects of diabetes is its downregulation of immune system. It&#xD;
      affects the immune cell function, up-regulates cytokines from monocytes or leukocytes and&#xD;
      down-regulates the various growth factors predisposing to chronic inflammation, progressive&#xD;
      tissue breakdown and reduced tissue repair capacity . So body becomes increasingly&#xD;
      susceptible to infections and worsens if the blood glucose levels are not brought back to&#xD;
      normal range .Oral symptoms of uncontrolled diabetes may comprise a plethora of conditions,&#xD;
      such as dry mouth, tooth decay, periodontal diseases, delayed wound healing, and increased&#xD;
      incidence of infection following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus inhibits collagen fibril formation and also interferes with collagen&#xD;
      cross-linking and may impair degradation of matrix proteins and subsequent tissue remodeling&#xD;
      , leading to poor wound healing in diabetics. Poor wound healing is similar in diabetic&#xD;
      dental pulp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apical periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory lesion of the periapical region caused due to&#xD;
      release of infectious products from the infected root canal system in the case of necrotic&#xD;
      non vital pulp. It is characterized by periapical bone loss which does not heal unless the&#xD;
      irritating agent is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, pro-inflammatory status and impaired immune response associated with systemic diseases&#xD;
      can affect the reparative response of the dental pulp and periapical healing.Periapical&#xD;
      immune response localizes the infection within the confines of the root canal system and&#xD;
      prevents its systemic dissemination. In the host immune system, neutrophil is the first&#xD;
      defense line when pathogens invade. Diabetes mellitus seriously impairs the function and&#xD;
      bactericidal activity of neutrophils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apical periodontitis and chronic periodontitis share many common features including common&#xD;
      microbiota and chronic nature of the disease. Several studies have been conducted linking&#xD;
      periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus in terms of prevalence and worsening of glycaemic&#xD;
      control in diabetic's patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have been done focusing on the effect of periodontal therapy on glycemic control&#xD;
      in diabetes, including reviews and meta-analysis Although there are few studies which focus&#xD;
      on healing of periradicular lesions after nonsurgical root canal treatment. Further research&#xD;
      is necessary in this area to solidify our understanding on periapical healing and glycaemic&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives To evaluate the clinical and radiographic success of primary non-surgical&#xD;
      root canal treatment in teeth with apical periodontitis in good controlled/poor controlled&#xD;
      diabetics To evaluate the clinical and radiographic success of primary non-surgical root&#xD;
      canal treatment in teeth with apical periodontitis in diabetic patients (well controlled and&#xD;
      poor controlled diabetics)/non-diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the HbA1c levels as a means of glycemic control during the treatment of apical&#xD;
      periodontitis in well controlled/poor controlled diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS This study will be conducted in the department of conservative&#xD;
      dentistry and endodontics, post graduate institute of dental sciences, Rohtak. Study subjects&#xD;
      will be obtained from the pool of OPD patients in the Department of conservative dentistry&#xD;
      and endodontics, PGIDS, Rohtak. Protocol for the study will be submitted for approval to&#xD;
      institutional ethical committee of PGIDS Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Prior to treatment a thorough clinical and radiological examination will be&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thorough history will be taken from each patient. Prior informed consent will be taken&#xD;
      after explaining the procedure, risks and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 75 patients (n=25 in each group) will be included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was determined using Karlsson's method with a power of 0.90 , P &lt; 0,05% and&#xD;
      standard deviation Â± 0.50 according to which a sample of minimum 21 patients in each group&#xD;
      was calculated , but keeping in mind the attrition a total of 25 patients will be recruited&#xD;
      in each group .&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mature mandibular permanent molar with diagnosis of apical periodontitis (as confirmed&#xD;
      clinically &amp; by periapical radiograph) will be chosen for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All periapical radiographs will be exposed by using constant kVP, mA and exposure time (70&#xD;
      KVP, 8 mA, 0.8 sec.) with a Rinn paralleling device and processed manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A customized zig will be prepared using addition silicone for each patient to keep as a&#xD;
      future reference for film placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting and post prandial blood glucose test &amp; glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test will be&#xD;
      done to evaluate the diabetic status of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divide into three groups Good control diabetic patients- HbA1c levels&#xD;
      ranging from 6.5%-7.5% Poor control diabetic patients-HbA1c levels greater than 7.5% Non&#xD;
      diabetic Healthy controls-HbA1c levels less than 6.5% After administration of local&#xD;
      anesthesia, rubber dam isolation of involved tooth will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acess cavity will be prepared using carbide burs in high speed hand piece with copious&#xD;
      irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negotiation of canals will be done. Working length will be determined using root ZX apex&#xD;
      locator and will be verified radiographically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronal enlargement will be done using Gates-Glidden drills. Hand files No. 10, 15 and 20&#xD;
      were used till working length (WL) to prepare a smooth reproducible glide path.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canals will be prepared using the crown down technique with protaper rotary instruments in&#xD;
      which coronal enlargement will be be done by Sx,S1 and S2. Finishing until the apex will be&#xD;
      done by F1 and F2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5ml of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite will be used for optimal irrigation after each instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of canal instrumentation , the canals will be irrigated with 5.0 ml of 17%&#xD;
      ethylene-diamine-tetra acetic acid for 1minute followed by a final irrigation with 5.0 ml of&#xD;
      5.25% sodium hypochlorite Canals will be dried with absorbent paper points and filled with a&#xD;
      paste of calcium hydroxide; the access cavity will be restored with intermediate restorative&#xD;
      material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patients will be recalled after 1 week. Second Appointment At the next appointment, the&#xD;
      paste will be removed with H-files, copious irrigant with 5.25% NaOCl will be done; and&#xD;
      canals will be dried with paper points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canals will be obturated with the Gutta-Percha and zinc Oxide-Eugenol based sealer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obturation, the cavity will be restored permanently. Immediate post-operative&#xD;
      radiograph will be taken using preset exposure parameters and will be processed manually&#xD;
      Follow up clinical and radiographic examination will be carried out at 3 months, 6 months, 9&#xD;
      months and 12th month.&#xD;
