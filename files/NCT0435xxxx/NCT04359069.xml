  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the length of time a urinary catheter is needed to&#xD;
      drain urine from the bladder after colorectal surgery. Urinary retention is a well known&#xD;
      complication after pelvic colorectal surgery, and current practice is to continue urinary&#xD;
      catheterization for 3- days following pelvic colorectal surgery in an effort to avoid this&#xD;
      complication. However, prolonged urinary catheterization is associated with increased risk of&#xD;
      urinary tract infections as well as longer hospital stays. We hypothesize that postoperative&#xD;
      urinary catheters may be safely removed on postoperative day 1 without increased urinary&#xD;
      retention rates. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a shorter duration of&#xD;
      urinary catheterization (1 day) is non-inferior when compared to standard duration (3 days)&#xD;
      in regards to postoperative urinary retention. We plan to perform a prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial comparing the urinary catheter duration of 1 day and 3 days with the&#xD;
      primary endpoint of postoperative urinary retention. Secondary endpoints are urinary tract&#xD;
      infection and length of hospital stay. The participants will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      control group (catheter removal on postoperative day 3) or the experimental group (catheter&#xD;
      removal on postoperative day 1).&#xD;

      Disease Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total mesorectal excision can be associated with transient post-operative urinary retention&#xD;
      due to surgical disruption of pelvic autonomic nerves during procedure. These patients&#xD;
      receive intra-operative urinary catheter to prevent post-operative urinary retention.&#xD;
      However, the optimal duration for post-operative urinary catheter is not known, and longer&#xD;
      duration of urinary catheter is associated with increased morbidity, such as urinary tract&#xD;
      infection. A previous prospective randomized controlled trial from 1999 looking at this&#xD;
      subject showed an increased rate of postoperative urinary retention in patients who had&#xD;
      shorter duration of urinary catheterization (1). However, surgical techniques have improved&#xD;
      significantly since then and a newer retrospective study comparing outcomes between patients&#xD;
      who had catheter removal on postoperative day 1 vs catheter removal on day 2 or later&#xD;
      demonstrated lower rates of urinary retention overall and there was no difference in rates of&#xD;
      urinary retention between the two groups (2). A recent randomized non--inferiority trial&#xD;
      investigating early urinary catheter removal in patients undergoing major colorectal surgery&#xD;
      found that early removal, when combined with an oral alpha- antagonist, is non--inferior to&#xD;
      standard removal and is associated with lower rates of urinary tract infections and shorter&#xD;
      hospital stays (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A current prospective randomized trial is needed to determine the optimal duration of urinary&#xD;
      catheterization in patients who receive total mesorectal excision (TME). Urinary&#xD;
      catheterization is an established part of the intraoperative and postoperative care for this&#xD;
      surgery. There should be minimal urinary dysfunction as total mesorectal excision should&#xD;
      preserve pelvic autonomic nerve function with careful dissection. Current standard of&#xD;
      practice is removal of urinary catheter on postoperative day 3. The study participants would&#xD;
      be exposed to minimal risk as they would already require urinary catheterization as part of&#xD;
      the standard of care. While this study will determine duration of postoperative urinary&#xD;
      catheterization, it will not impact the surgical procedure itself. The control group would&#xD;
      undergo removal of urinary catheter on postoperative day 3 and the experimental group would&#xD;
      undergo removal of urinary catheter on postoperative day 1. The main risk endured by study&#xD;
      participants would be the need to replace the urinary catheter if the patient has urinary&#xD;
      retention following catheter removal. This study will contribute to existing knowledge by&#xD;
      providing a prospective randomized non--inferiority trial investigating the impact of&#xD;
      duration of urinary catheterization following total mesorectal excision on rates of&#xD;
      postoperative urinary retention, urinary tract infections, and length of hospital stay. If&#xD;
      shorter duration of urinary catheterization is shown to be non--inferior to standard duration&#xD;
      of catheterization in terms of postoperative urinary retention, adopting a practice of&#xD;
      catheter removal on postoperative day 1 may result in lower rates of catheter--associated&#xD;
      urinary tract infections and shorter hospital stays. This practice would also adhere to the&#xD;
      Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) measures which recommend removal of urinary catheter&#xD;
      on postoperative day 1 or 2. We hypothesize that postoperative urinary catheters may be&#xD;
      safely removed on postoperative day 1 following total mesorectal excision without increased&#xD;
      urinary retention rates when compared to removal on postoperative day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized, non-inferiority trial. We will&#xD;
      evaluate all patients undergoing total mesorectal excision for study eligibility. Consent for&#xD;
      participation in the study will be obtained perioperatively. All male patients will be given&#xD;
      a survey to assess their international prostate symptom severity (IPSS) score preoperatively.&#xD;
      After surgery, the participant will be randomly assigned to the control (day 3 catheter&#xD;
      removal) or experimental (day 1 catheter removal) group if there were no intraoperative&#xD;
      complications deemed to interfere with the study, such as genitourinary tract injury&#xD;
      requiring prolonged urinary catheterization postoperatively. Randomization will be performed&#xD;
      using Microsoft Excel using a reported simple randomization method.(6) The control group will&#xD;
      have catheter removed at 9AM on postoperative day 3, while the experimental arm will have&#xD;
      catheter removed at 9AM on postoperative day 1. Participants will receive appropriate&#xD;
      maintenance IV fluids depending on their ability to tolerate PO intake postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study will be urinary retention, defined by grade 2 urinary&#xD;
      retention per NCI CTCAE. Clinically, we will identify these patients as those unable to void&#xD;
      within 6 hours of urinary catheter removal with associated signs of suprapubic fullness&#xD;
      and/or tenderness, and bedside ultrasound bladder scan showing more than 250cc of urine.&#xD;
      Bladder scan will only be performed on patients who have signs of urinary retention and are&#xD;
      unable to void within 6 hours of catheter removal. If subjects are unable to void&#xD;
      spontaneously within 6 hours following catheter removal, a one-time straight catheterization&#xD;
      will be performed, as per standard practice. If subjects are still unable to urinate within 6&#xD;
      hours following straight catheterization, an indwelling urinary catheter will be replaced.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include urinary tract infection and length of hospital stay&#xD;
      postoperatively. Urinary tract infection is defined as grade 2 or 3 urinary tract infection&#xD;
      per NCI CTCAE. Patients will be evaluated for symptoms and signs of infection such as&#xD;
      suprapubic pain, tenderness, dysuria, hematuria, and urinary frequency in addition to the&#xD;
      presence of &gt;100,000 colony-forming units/mL of bacteria on urine culture. Urinalysis and&#xD;
      urine culture will only be sent in the setting of clinical signs and symptoms of urinary&#xD;
      tract infection. Patients identified with UTI will be treated with pathogen-appropriate&#xD;
      antibiotics as per standard practice. Length of hospital stay will be defined as the number&#xD;
      of admitted days in the hospital from day of surgery to day of discharge. The participants&#xD;
      will remain in the study until discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding patient's demographic, past medical history, surgical indication, surgical&#xD;
      approach, intraoperative complications, and postoperative outcomes including the mentioned&#xD;
      endpoints will be collected prospectively through the electronic medical record system. The&#xD;
      international prostate symptom severity (IPSS) score will be completed preoperatively for all&#xD;
      male patients. Patient's medical record number will be numerically encoded and stored in a&#xD;
      separate file. All paper documentation, including the original consent form, will be stored&#xD;
      in a secure cabinet in the division office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will not be post-discharge follow up for the purpose of the research. Only data related&#xD;
      to patient's history and inpatient hospital stay will be collected. Therefore, the follow up&#xD;
      period for the endpoints is up to day of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Accrual:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have identified rates of urinary retention following rectal surgery to&#xD;
      approximately 20% (4, 5). Given no expected difference between the two groups, we therefore&#xD;
      anticipate the urinary retention rate of both the study and control group to be 20%. Using a&#xD;
      type I error of 5%, a power of 0.8, and a non-inferiority limit of 15% as reported by&#xD;
      literature (3), a sample size of 88 per group will be needed. Given the anticipated rate of&#xD;
      approximately 10 total mesorectal excision procedure per month, we anticipate needing 18&#xD;
      months to fulfill the required sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses Plans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two randomized groups will be compared in terms of their preoperative demographics, prior&#xD;
      history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, surgical indication, cancer staging, and neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatments. Intraoperative and postoperative factors will also be compared between the two&#xD;
      groups. Subgroup analysis may be performed stratifying patients with different surgical&#xD;
      indications and/or cancer staging. Given that the main research question involves patients&#xD;
      following TME, regardless of surgical indication, the study may not be powered to observe&#xD;
      differences when performing subgroup analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between groups will be analyzed by the chi square test, the Mann Whitney U test,&#xD;
      or the Student t test for quantitative and qualitative variables, as appropriate. The early&#xD;
      catheter removal will be considered noninferior to standard removal if the upper limit of a&#xD;
      1-sided 95% confidence interval excludes a difference in favor of the standard group of the&#xD;
      standard group of more than 15%. A p-value of &lt;.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
