  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people develop joint pain, stiffness and swelling due to their cancer treatment that&#xD;
      targets the immune system. The severity of symptoms ranges from mild to debilitating and&#xD;
      sometimes requires delaying or stopping cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual plan is to discontinue cancer treatment and give relatively high doses of a&#xD;
      medication called prednisone (a steroid, which is an anti-inflammatory medication which may&#xD;
      suppress the immune system) with a gradual lowering of the dose over several weeks. While&#xD;
      this can be effective, prednisone can cause a number of side effects, and it is not known if&#xD;
      this is the best or safest treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine is a medication that is often used to treat inflammatory joint pain, such&#xD;
      as rheumatoid arthritis, has relatively few side effects when compared to prednisone, and may&#xD;
      be effective at treating this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether it is better to receive hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      and prednisone, or prednisone alone for joint pain. To do this, some participants will get&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine and some will receive a placebo (a substance that looks like the study&#xD;
      drug but does not have any active or medicinal ingredients). A placebo is used to make the&#xD;
      results of the study more reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blinded study, which means that neither participants nor the study doctor or&#xD;
      study staff will know which group participants are allocated. After 12 weeks of study&#xD;
      treatment, the blind will be opened and participants will be informed which treatment was&#xD;
      given.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be 18 years of age, or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be capable of providing consent to enrolment and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a performance status of ECOG 0-2 will be eligible for enrolment (see&#xD;
             appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with histologically confirmed cancer receiving anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody ICI therapy, either alone or in combination with anti-CTLA4&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody ICI therapy who develop CTCAEv5.0 grade ≥2 arthritis or arthralgia&#xD;
             that has developed on, or after, ICI therapy and is felt to be treatment related&#xD;
             (irAA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate hepatic and renal function defined by the following laboratory parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST and ALT and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5x ULN,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ upper limit of institutional normal OR calculated creatinine&#xD;
                  clearance of ≥ 60 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum (or urine)&#xD;
             pregnancy test at the time of screening. WOCBP is defined as any female who has&#xD;
             experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy) and is not postmenopausal.&#xD;
             Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 years in the&#xD;
             absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females under the&#xD;
             age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level &gt; 40&#xD;
             mIU/mL to confirm menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients of childbearing / reproductive potential should use highly effective birth&#xD;
             control methods, during the study treatment period and for a period of 3 months after&#xD;
             the last dose of study drug. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as&#xD;
             those that result in low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used&#xD;
             consistently and correctly. These may include: hormonal contraceptives (e.g. combined&#xD;
             oral contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants); intrauterine&#xD;
             device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); vasectomy and tubal ligation.&#xD;
             Double-barrier methods may be acceptable in circumstances when highly effective&#xD;
             methods cannot be implemented (e.g. male condom with diaphragm, male condom with&#xD;
             cervical cap). Note: Contraceptive requirements for the oncology regiments will apply,&#xD;
             if they are more stringent than those for this trial. Abstinence is acceptable if this&#xD;
             is established and preferred contraception for the patient and is accepted as a local&#xD;
             standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patients who are breast-feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study treatment and until 3 months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male patients should agree to not donate sperm during the study and for a period of at&#xD;
             least 3 months after last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Absence of any condition hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow- up&#xD;
             schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in&#xD;
             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of inflammatory arthritis, including, but not limited to: Rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, Ankylosing spondylitis or&#xD;
             other chronic inflammatory arthritis. Note: Patients with a known history of stable&#xD;
             osteoarthritis will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with an indication for systemic immunosuppressive medications or&#xD;
             corticosteroids. Patients with CTCAEv5.0 grade ≥2 irAE's other than irIAA (ie.&#xD;
             colitis, pneumonitis, rash, etc) are not eligible for trial, with the exception of&#xD;
             endocrinopathies that are being treated with hormone replacement alone and not&#xD;
             systemic immunosuppressive medications or corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients weighing &lt; 40 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with G6PD deficiency, porphyria or psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular&#xD;
             accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (≥ New York Heart&#xD;
             Association Classification Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prolonged corrected QT interval or concurrent medications that prolong QT interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following: a. intranasal,&#xD;
             inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular&#xD;
             injection); b. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan&#xD;
             premedication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its&#xD;
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies (CTCAEv5.0 Grade ≥ 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including inflammatory bowel disease,&#xD;
             immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including recent&#xD;
             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for&#xD;
             entry into this study.&#xD;
