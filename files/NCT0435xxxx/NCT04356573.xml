      The specific hypothesis is that the consumption of 2 Hayward green kiwifruit (containing&#xD;
      actinidin protease) prior to 100g of ground beef will increase the rate of protein digestion&#xD;
      from the beef in the elderly, leading to an increased uptake of the essential amino acids.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this increased essential amino acid availability will produce a greater&#xD;
      postprandial net anabolic protein response, as well as increased fractional synthetic rates&#xD;
      of muscle proteins.&#xD;

      The specific hypothesis is that the consumption of 2 Hayward green kiwifruit (containing&#xD;
      actinidin protease) prior to 100g of ground beef will increase the rate of protein digestion&#xD;
      from the beef in the elderly, leading to an increased uptake of the essential amino acids.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this increased essential amino acid availability will produce a greater&#xD;
      postprandial net anabolic protein response, as well as increased fractional synthetic rates&#xD;
      of muscle proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will use a double-blinded crossover design&#xD;
      involving two intervention arms; in both arms 100g of ground beef (cooked weight) will be&#xD;
      consumed following either 2 Hayward green kiwifruit (containing actinidin protease) or 2&#xD;
      Hort16A Gold kiwifruit (devoid of actinidin protease) by elderly subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Blood samples were analyzed to quantify the appearance of the stable isotopes: 2H2-tyrosine, 2H4-tyrosine, and 2H5-phenylalanine in tracer to tracee ratio or mole percent excess. Changes in these markers over time enable the calculation of whole body protein metabolism. Calculations are done as follows:&#xD;
Total plasma rate of appearance = infusion rate/enrichment Fractional rate of appearance of tyrosine from phenylalanine= 2H4-tyrosine/2H5-phenylalanine Phenylalanine hydroxylation = fractional rate of appearance of tyrosine from phenylalanine x rate of appearance of tyrosine Protein Synthesis = [(rate of appearance of phenylalanine -Phe hydroxylation) x 25] Protein Breakdown = [(rate of appearance of phenylalanine - phenylalanine infusion rate) x 25 - phenylalanine intake] Net Balance = Protein Synthesis - Protein Breakdown</description>

    <description>Muscle samples were analyzed to quantify the appearance of the stable isotope 2H5-phenylalanine in trace to tracee ratio or mole percent excess. The change in 2H5-phenylalanine in subsequent muscle biopsy allow for the calculation of muscle protein synthesis. The calculation is done as follows: [(2H5-phenylalanine enrichment in second biopsy - 2H5-phenylalanine enrichment in second biopsy)/ (2H5-phenylalanine plasma enrichment × time)] × 60 × 100.</description>

        <title>Whole Body Net Balance Measured by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were analyzed to quantify the appearance of the stable isotopes: 2H2-tyrosine, 2H4-tyrosine, and 2H5-phenylalanine in tracer to tracee ratio or mole percent excess. Changes in these markers over time enable the calculation of whole body protein metabolism. Calculations are done as follows:&#xD;
Total plasma rate of appearance = infusion rate/enrichment Fractional rate of appearance of tyrosine from phenylalanine= 2H4-tyrosine/2H5-phenylalanine Phenylalanine hydroxylation = fractional rate of appearance of tyrosine from phenylalanine x rate of appearance of tyrosine Protein Synthesis = [(rate of appearance of phenylalanine -Phe hydroxylation) x 25] Protein Breakdown = [(rate of appearance of phenylalanine - phenylalanine infusion rate) x 25 - phenylalanine intake] Net Balance = Protein Synthesis - Protein Breakdown</description>

        <description>Muscle samples were analyzed to quantify the appearance of the stable isotope 2H5-phenylalanine in trace to tracee ratio or mole percent excess. The change in 2H5-phenylalanine in subsequent muscle biopsy allow for the calculation of muscle protein synthesis. The calculation is done as follows: [(2H5-phenylalanine enrichment in second biopsy - 2H5-phenylalanine enrichment in second biopsy)/ (2H5-phenylalanine plasma enrichment × time)] × 60 × 100.</description>
