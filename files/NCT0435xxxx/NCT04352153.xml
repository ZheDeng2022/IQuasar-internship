    <textblock>
      Hyperuricemia (HUA) is a common systemic metabolic disease. Its incidence is increasing year&#xD;
      by year and more young people suffer from hyperuricemia. HUA can not only cause the onset of&#xD;
      gouty arthritis, and then affect joint function, and even cause joint deformities. It can&#xD;
      also cause damage to multiple organs such as the heart, brain, and kidney through multiple&#xD;
      channels. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) refers to chronic kidney structural and dysfunction&#xD;
      caused by various reasons. HUA is an independent risk factor that accelerates the progress of&#xD;
      CKD. Studies have shown that lowering uric acid is another key treatment to delay the&#xD;
      progress of CKD. A large number of studies have shown that the formation of uric acid&#xD;
      crystals is the main mechanism of inducing renal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017, the &quot;Multidisciplinary Expert Consensus for the Diagnosis and Treatment of&#xD;
      Hyperuricemia-Related Diseases in China&quot; recommended that patients with hyperuricemia&#xD;
      receiving uric acid lowering drugs, especially those treated with uric acid excretion drugs&#xD;
      and patients with uric acid nephrolithiasis, recommended that the pH of urine be adjusted&#xD;
      during pH6.2 ~ 6.9 to increase the solubility of uric acid in urine. It is recommended to use&#xD;
      sodium bicarbonate or potassium sodium citrate drugs to alkalinize urine, but it is not clear&#xD;
      if there is any difference in the kinetic parameters of urine alkalinity, compliance rate of&#xD;
      alkalinized urine and safety between sodium bicarbonate and potassium sodium citrate. No&#xD;
      &quot;head-to-head&quot; clinical publications have been reported. This clinical trial was designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the rate of alkalinization of urine, the therapeutic effect of renal lithiasis and&#xD;
      adverse reactions between the sodium bicarbonate and potassium sodium hydrogen citrate&#xD;
      granules in healthy people and patients with hyperuricemia and renal calculi (uric acid).&#xD;
      This study provides a more direct and objective basis for the widespread use of potassium&#xD;
      sodium hydrogen citrate granules in the treatment of uric acid stones.&#xD;
