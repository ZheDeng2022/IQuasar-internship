      Hypothesis: display of predictive analytics monitoring on acute care cardiology wards&#xD;
      improves patient outcomes and is cost-effective to the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed and validated computational models for predicting key&#xD;
      outcomes in adults, and a useful display has been developed, implemented and iteratively&#xD;
      optimized. These models estimate risk of imminent patient deterioration using trends in vital&#xD;
      signs, labs and cardiorespiratory dynamics derived from readily available continuous bedside&#xD;
      monitoring. They are presented on LCD monitors using software called CoMET (Continuous&#xD;
      Monitoring of Event Trajectories; AMP3D, Advanced Medical Predictive Devices, Diagnostics,&#xD;
      and Displays, Charlottesville, VA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the impact on patient outcomes, the investigators propose a 22-month&#xD;
      cluster-randomized control trial on the 4th floor of UVa Hospital, a medical-surgical floor&#xD;
      for cardiology and cardiovascular surgery patients. Clinicians will receive standard CoMET&#xD;
      device training. Three- to five-bed clusters will be randomized to intervention (predictive&#xD;
      display plus standard monitoring) or control (standard monitoring alone) for two months at a&#xD;
      time. In addition, risk scores for patients in the intervention clusters will be presented&#xD;
      daily during rounds to members of the care team of physicians, residents, nurses, and other&#xD;
      clinicians. Data on outcomes will be statistically compared between intervention and control&#xD;
      clusters.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hours free of events of clinical deterioration</measure>
    <time_frame>within 21 days of the admission</time_frame>
    <description>(1) The number of hours free of acute clinical events within 21 day of admission. Hours of acute clinical events are defined as time when one or more of the following occur:&#xD;
An emergent ICU transfer (emergent defined as urgent, unplanned) and ICU stay&#xD;
Emergent intubation (emergent is defined by clinician's notes as a non-planned procedure)&#xD;
Cardiac arrest, if prior to ICU transfer or death&#xD;
Death&#xD;
A maximum score will be 21 event-free days (504 hours). Patients who are discharged from the hospital prior to 21 days without an event will be counted as having 21 event-free days. Patients who die during the admission will be counted as having 0 event-free days. Patients will be censored (with no event observed) at the time of non-emergent ICU transfer, surgery transfer, or other transfer.</description>

    <description>A subgroup secondary outcome will be a Kaplan Meier or Cox Proportional Hazard curve showing post-ICU transfer, event-free survival, hours free of the following events:&#xD;
Time of emergent intubation post-ICU transfer (emergent is defined by clinician's notes as a non-planned procedure)&#xD;
Time of the 1st order post-ICU transfer for transfusion of 3 units or more of blood ordered within 24 hours&#xD;
Time of first order post-ICU transfer of IV inotropes or pressors&#xD;
Time of cardiac arrest post-ICU transfer&#xD;
Time of CHF escalation, defined by the time of first order for diuretic drip, time of first order for CVVHD, or time of dialysis initiation&#xD;
Time of death post-ICU transfer&#xD;
Discharge from the ICU without an event will count as &quot;infinite&quot; event-free survival.</description>
