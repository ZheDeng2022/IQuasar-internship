      Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is among the most common complications of preterm birth,&#xD;
      and typically becomes manifested soon after birth. A failure of the rapid reuptake of fetal&#xD;
      lung fluids after birth, with subsequent liquid retention in the alveolar space, together&#xD;
      with the deficit of surfactant proteins ensuing from lung immaturity represent the leading&#xD;
      mechanisms for the development of RDS, which may require different levels of respiratory&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasingly used method for the evaluation of the neonatal lung is pulmonary ultrasound,&#xD;
      which allows assessing alveolar fluids and other pathological conditions in a non-invasive&#xD;
      manner, and has been shown to predict the need for respiratory support and for surfactant&#xD;
      administration in preterm infants with RDS. However, this method requires specific training,&#xD;
      is operator-dependent and does not provide a trend able assessment over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) allows continuous and non-invasive monitoring of&#xD;
      static and dynamic thoracic fluids. It has been recently introduced in neonatal clinical&#xD;
      practice to assess such hemodynamic parameters as cardiac output and also quantifies static&#xD;
      thoracic fluids contents (TFC). This method provides continuous and non-operator dependent&#xD;
      data on the pulmonary fluid status over time and does not require specific training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of lung ultrasound with TEB could open to new diagnostic and prognostic&#xD;
      perspectives in preterm infants with RDS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is among the most common complications of&#xD;
      preterm birth, and typically becomes manifested soon after birth. The rapid reuptake of fetal&#xD;
      lung fluids plays an important role in transitional events at birth. Most of this fluid is&#xD;
      reabsorbed through epithelial alveolar cells by an active sodium transporter. Mechanical&#xD;
      events play a role in this exchange too. A failure of the rapid reuptake of fetal lung fluids&#xD;
      after birth, with subsequent liquid retention in the alveolar space, together with the&#xD;
      deficit of surfactant proteins ensuing from lung immaturity represent the leading mechanisms&#xD;
      for the development of RDS, which may require different levels of respiratory support,&#xD;
      ranging from mechanical ventilation to less invasive modalities (nasal cannulas or continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasingly used method for lung evaluation in the newborn is lung ultrasound, which&#xD;
      allows to evaluate the alveolar fluid and to differentiate among several pathological&#xD;
      conditions (transient tachypnea of the newborn, meconium aspiration, respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion) and, in the preterm population, has also been&#xD;
      proved to predict of the need for respiratory support and for surfactant administration.&#xD;
      Compared to traditional radiological assessments, this non-invasive technique does not imply&#xD;
      the use of X-ray; however, it requires specific training, it is operator-dependent and does&#xD;
      not allow a continuous and trend able evaluation over time, but only serial assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) allows continuous, non-invasive and real-time&#xD;
      monitoring of static and dynamic thoracic fluids. It has been recently introduced in neonatal&#xD;
      clinical practice to monitor such hemodynamic parameters as cardiac output, providing useful&#xD;
      clinical information in hospitalized preterm infants, or neonates undergoing hemodynamic&#xD;
      procedures. This technique allows quantifying static thoracic fluid contents (TFC) in a&#xD;
      non-invasive and continuous manner. Compared to ultrasound, this method provides continuous&#xD;
      and non-operator dependent data on the lung fluid status over time and does not require&#xD;
      specific training for its use and interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current literature reported a significant correlation between TFC values and respiratory&#xD;
      distress, but, to date, it has not been investigated whether this parameter may predict RDS&#xD;
      evolution, or if it is influenced by specific neonatal characteristics associated with&#xD;
      pulmonary overflow, such as the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which is a&#xD;
      common finding over the transitional period, defined as the first 72 hours of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining lung ultrasound to transthoracic electrical bioimpedance could open to new&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic perspectives in preterm infants with RDS during the first days of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the correlation between TFC, measured by transthoracic electrical&#xD;
           bioimpedance (TEB), and a pulmonary ultrasound score, used for the evaluation of lung&#xD;
           fluids in preterm infants with RDS in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess whether the combination of TFC with a pulmonary ultrasound score can be&#xD;
           predictive of RDS evolution over the next 24 hours (need for surfactant, need for&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation vs. suspension of ventilatory support).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of pulmonary ultrasound score, TFC levels and left cardiac output in relation&#xD;
           to the status of the ductus arteriosus (hemodynamically significant, restrictive or&#xD;
           closed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants born at S. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital and Niguarda Hospital and admitted to the local&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Units are consecutively enrolled in this observational prospective&#xD;
      study if fulfilling the following eligibility criteria: gestational age ≤34 weeks' gestation,&#xD;
      diagnosis of respiratory distress (defined by the need for respiratory support with nasal&#xD;
      cannulas, nasal CPAP or mechanical ventilation), 0-24 hours of life, written informed consent&#xD;
      obtained from parents/legal guardians of each infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following conditions are considered as exclusion criteria: main congenital malformation,&#xD;
      including congenital heart disease, meconium aspiration, pneumothorax, perinatal&#xD;
      asphyxia/hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, concomitant use of experimental dugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled infants undergo serial lung and cardiac ultrasound evaluations at 0-24 (V1), at&#xD;
      24-48 (V2) and at 48-72 (V3)hours of life. A simultaneous evaluation of hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters and TFC by means of TEB is also performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound findings are classified according to a validated pulmonary ultrasound score&#xD;
      that takes into account six pulmonary fields (right upper anterior, right lower anterior,&#xD;
      right lateral, left upper anterior, left lower anterior, left lateral). For each field a&#xD;
      number is assigned:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0: only A lines or &lt;3 B lines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1: ≥3 B lines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2: crowded and confluent B lines with or without consolidations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3: important consolidation If at 72 hours of life a hemodynamically relevant patent&#xD;
           ductus arteriosus is still evident at cardiac ultrasound, the ultrasound and TEB&#xD;
           monitoring are carried on until PDA closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: need for surfactant administration (and number of surfactant administrations),&#xD;
      inhaled oxygen fraction, need for diuretic therapy, duration of ventilatory support with&#xD;
      nasal canula/nasal CPAP/mechanical ventilation, duration of oxygen therapy, bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia at 36 weeks, duration of hospitalization and time for reach total enteral&#xD;
      nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis: SPSS will be used for the statistical analysis. The diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      of TFC and of the ultrasound score for predicting the need for ventilatory support and for&#xD;
      surfactant administration will be evaluated by area under ROC curve in order to find the&#xD;
      optimal cut off value. The cardiac output values will be analyzed in relation to the state of&#xD;
      the ductus arteriosus with Kruskal-Wallis test and included in a multivariate model in order&#xD;
      to rule out the influence of confounding factors (for example the modality of ventilatory&#xD;
      support). Significance level is set at p&lt;0,05.&#xD;
