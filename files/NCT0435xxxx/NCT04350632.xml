  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk prediction of obstetric anal sphincter injury couyl be optimized by considering&#xD;
      pregnant women's anal sphincter intrinsic viscoelastic properties. Shear wave elastography is&#xD;
      a new technology that allowed an in vivo assessment of viscoelastic properties of tissues&#xD;
      such as muscles. The main endpoint of this study is to assess the intra-observer and the&#xD;
      inter-observer reproducibility of a the external anal sphincter assessment using shear wave&#xD;
      elastography in term pregnant women.&#xD;

      Investigations Assessment of the external anal sphincter viscoelastic properties using shear&#xD;
      wave elastography technology using a transperineal approach in term pregnant women in two&#xD;
      visits (the 1st one with only one observer and the second one with two observers)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Prospective study including nulliparous term pregnant women with 2 visits planned,&#xD;
      spaced at least by 12 hours and, for the most, 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The mean value of shear modulus measures in the external anal sphincter for&#xD;
      the three considered conditions (rest, Valsalva maneuver and contraction) at each visit and&#xD;
      for each observer with a calculation of Intraclass Correlation Coefficient and Variation&#xD;
      Coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: The secondary outcomes will be the percentage of completed procedure&#xD;
      (ability to see the external sphincter and to obtain a measure of the shear modulus), the&#xD;
      existence of a perineal tear according the RCOG-OMS classification and the answer to an&#xD;
      acceptability question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective monocentric study including nulliparous term pregnant women with&#xD;
      two visits spaced of at least 12 hours and, for the most, 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Assessment of the external anal sphincter viscoelastic properties using shear&#xD;
      wave elastography technology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women in lithotomy position with an empty bladder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The linear probe is applied on transversal plane on the perineal with a transperineal&#xD;
           approach&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The external anal sphincter will be identified in 2D ultrasound using a SL 18-5 linear&#xD;
           probe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viscoelastic properties of the muscle will be assessed by measuring the shear modulus at&#xD;
           rest, Valsalva maneuver and contraction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exactly the same investigations will be performed for the two visits planned in the&#xD;
           protocol. In the first visit, it will be one single observer and for the second it will&#xD;
           be 2 observers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data about the mode of delivery and the occurrence of OASI will be collected into&#xD;
           women's medical file&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: 40 volunteers pregnant women are planned for this research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The number of successful procedures will be reported as effectives and&#xD;
      percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reproducibility will be reported by calculating the coefficient of variation and the&#xD;
      intraclass correlation coefficient. The level of significance will be considered for p&lt;0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions : Obstetric anal sphincter injury&#xD;
