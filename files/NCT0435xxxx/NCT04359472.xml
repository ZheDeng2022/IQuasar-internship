    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of collecting amniotic fluid at&#xD;
      delivery that will be immediately processed and then applied as a spray to the various layers&#xD;
      of cesarean wound closure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, prospective pilot study involving the collection of amniotic fluid at&#xD;
      cesarean delivery followed by the immediate processing and re-application to the closure&#xD;
      among twenty women at term undergoing cesarean delivery at Duke University Hospital. The&#xD;
      objective of the study is to determine the feasibility of collection and application of&#xD;
      autologous amniotic fluid at cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 1: Screening/Enrollment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent is obtained, demographic information, as well as medical and surgical&#xD;
      history will be obtained. A medical release form will also be signed so that in the event&#xD;
      that the subject is seen outside the Duke Health system after delivery, the study team will&#xD;
      be able to request pertinent medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 2: Day of Surgery Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At presentation for delivery, study team members will reconfirm eligibility criteria.&#xD;
      Subjects will then undergo cesarean delivery as per standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Recibio kit includes the following supplies, all of which are packaged in a sterile kit&#xD;
      and will be opened onto the sterile surgical field:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mucous trap&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Yankauer suction device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tubing to connect to wall suction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 ml syringe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 ml syringe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Syringe spray applicator and spray tip with attached syringes - the spray device is&#xD;
           included in sterile packaging and manufactured and distributed by Recibio, Inc. Ratio&#xD;
           Applicator Kit, Ref # 2101 with an have FDA clearance via Class 1 exempt device FDA&#xD;
           listing number D377967.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10% calcium chloride vials will be provided separately. Vials will not be placed on the&#xD;
           sterile field as it will likely not have sterile packaging. The calcium chloride&#xD;
           solution will either be poured into a small sterile bowl so that it may be drawn up into&#xD;
           the1 cc device syringe in a sterile manner OR drawn up into the device syringe directly&#xD;
           by a member of the sterile surgical team while a member of the study team holds the&#xD;
           non-sterile portion of the vial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sterile supplies will be placed on the surgical table and set up for use prior to the&#xD;
      start of the cesarean section. The surgery will begin and be completed as part of standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the uterine incision has been made the following steps will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following incision of the lower uterine segment, the amniotic sac will be opened with an&#xD;
      amniotic perforator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Yankauer will be used to suction the amniotic fluid into the mucous trap as it escapes&#xD;
      from the amniotic cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery of the newborn and placenta and the uterine incision closed, the amniotic&#xD;
      fluid will be drawn from the mucous trap into the 10 ml syringe&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 10 mL syringe containing the amniotic fluid will then be observed for gross contamination&#xD;
      (i.e. vertex, meconium-staining) and then attached to the spray device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1 ml syringe containing 1 ml of 10% calcium chloride will then also be attached to the&#xD;
      spray device via the second port (final concentration of 1% once sprayed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amniotic fluid-calcium chloride mixture will then be sprayed (1.5 to 2.0 ml) across the&#xD;
      closed uterine incision and lower uterine segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next the fascia will be closed and the fascial incision sprayed (1.5 to 2.0 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the subcutaneous tissue will be closed and sprayed (1.5 to 2.0 ml) and then the skin&#xD;
      will be closed and sprayed (1.5 to 2.0 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A photo of the closed incision will be taken prior to the application of any bandages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incision will then be dressed as part of standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any extra amniotic fluid will be kept and stored at -80 degrees in the Duke Reproductive&#xD;
      Biology and Perinatal Research Laboratory for potential future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this study is testing product feasibility, only licensed investigators that are&#xD;
      included as study personnel will be permitted to apply CeaLogic to the various tissue layers&#xD;
      as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data elements regarding certain time points during surgery, use of the CeaLogic, and any&#xD;
      complications will be recorded. These include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
