  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract. Gastric&#xD;
      cancer patients diagnosed for the first time in China have a higher proportion of advanced&#xD;
      stages and a higher postoperative metastasis rate. Studies have shown that patients with good&#xD;
      pathological response after preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (such as tumor regression grade,&#xD;
      TRG0 or 1) have a better prognosis. The AIO-FLOT4 study found that preoperative perioperative&#xD;
      FLOT chemotherapy not only prolonged the progression-free survival (PFS) time and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) time of patients with advanced gastric cancer, but also increased postoperative&#xD;
      pathological remission rate. How to further improve the efficacy of the perioperative&#xD;
      treatment plan may be beneficial to improve the long-term survival of gastric cancer&#xD;
      patients. Several clinical studies have also confirmed that PD-1 antibody significantly&#xD;
      prolongs the life of gastric cancer patients who have failed advanced chemotherapy in the&#xD;
      back-line treatment. Thus the investigators plan to conduct this clinical trials to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of Toripalimab (PD-1 antibody) combined with FLOT regimen in the&#xD;
      perioperative period.The secondary end points included pathological remission rate, resection&#xD;
      rate, D2 radical resection rate, 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate and 5-year OS rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract, accounting&#xD;
      for the second incidence of malignant tumors, and the third mortality factor related to&#xD;
      malignant tumors. In China, most patients with gastric cancer diagnosed for the first time&#xD;
      are already in the advanced stage, with stage II and III patients accounting for 63%, and the&#xD;
      postoperative recurrence rate is higher. Studies have shown that patients with good&#xD;
      pathological response after preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (such as TRG0 or 1) have a&#xD;
      better prognosis. In recent years, the AIO-FLOT4 study have found that perioperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy with FLOT regimen has prolonged the PFS and OS in patients with advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer. It is preferred to recommend perioperative chemotherapy with FLOT regimen for&#xD;
      patients with advanced gastric cancer in the NCCN guidelines or Chinese CSCO guidelines. How&#xD;
      to further improve the efficacy of the perioperative treatment plan may be beneficial to&#xD;
      improve the long-term survival of gastric cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical studies have also confirmed that PD-1 antibody significantly prolongs the&#xD;
      life of gastric cancer patients who have failed advanced chemotherapy in the back-line&#xD;
      treatment. In the KEYNOTE-059 study, the effectiveness of chemotherapy combined with PD-1&#xD;
      antibody in gastric cancer patients newly treated reached 62%. It is necessary to explore the&#xD;
      efficacy of PD-1 antibody combined with FLOT regimen in the perioperative period. Thus the&#xD;
      investigators plan to conduct this clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Toripalimab (PD-1 antibody) combined with FLOT regimen in the perioperative period.The&#xD;
      secondary end points included pathological remission rate, resection rate, D2 radical&#xD;
      resection rate, 5-year DFS rate and 5-year OS rate.&#xD;
