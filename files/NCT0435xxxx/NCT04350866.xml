  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic insomnia, one of the most common health problems among Veterans, significantly&#xD;
      impacts health, function, and quality of life. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia&#xD;
      (CBTI) is the first line treatment; however, despite efforts to train VA clinicians to&#xD;
      deliver CBTI, there are still significant barriers to providing adequate access to insomnia&#xD;
      care. Up to 44% of Veterans seen in Primary Care report insomnia, making it an optimal&#xD;
      clinical setting for improving access to insomnia care. Furthermore, Brief Behavioral&#xD;
      Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI), adapted from CBTI as a briefer, more flexible treatment, is&#xD;
      easily delivered by Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) clinicians and can greatly&#xD;
      improve access to care for Veterans with insomnia. Yet, simply training PCMHI clinicians to&#xD;
      deliver BBTI is not enough. Implementation strategies are needed for successful uptake,&#xD;
      adoption, and sustainable delivery of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This stepped-wedge, hybrid III implementation-effectiveness trial involves four VA Medical&#xD;
      Centers: Baltimore, Durham, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. The hybrid design allows for&#xD;
      testing of implementation and treatment effectiveness. The stepped-wedge design allows for&#xD;
      fewer sites to achieve adequate power as all sites are exposed to BBTI training (BBTI) and&#xD;
      BBTI+Implementation Strategies (BBTI+IS). The target sample are PCMHI clinicians and the&#xD;
      impact of a bundle of strategies on the success of sustainable delivery of BBTI in Primary&#xD;
      Care. Retrospective data collected from VA electronic health records will be used to obtain&#xD;
      variables of interest related to Veteran treatment outcomes and data related to PCMHI&#xD;
      clinician delivery of BBTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will compare the impact PCMHI clinicians trained to deliver BBTI vs. the impact of BBTI&#xD;
      training plus 12-months of access to an implementation strategy bundle (BBTI+IS). BBTI+IS vs.&#xD;
      BBTI training alone is expected to result in more Veterans with access to insomnia care in&#xD;
      PCMHI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 will identify specific strategies that promote successful implementation of BBTI in&#xD;
      PCMHI through the use of qualitative interviews and surveys with clinical stakeholders at&#xD;
      each study site.&#xD;

    <description>Site PIs and PCMHI clinicians trained to deliver BBTI will complete a quarterly survey about strategies from the bundle being utilized (e.g., &quot;Did providers use X strategy to promote delivery of BBTI?&quot;). These surveys will assess the uptake of strategies, longitudinally, across study phases. Response choices will be yes, no, or not able to accurately assess.&#xD;
Site PIs and PCMHI clinicians will also be asked to rate each strategy on its importance (i.e., how vital a strategy is to improving implementation [high/low]) and its feasibility (i.e., how possible a strategy is to implement [high/low]).</description>

During the pre- and post-implementation phases, PCMHI clinicians will be rated quarterly but will not receive feedback. However, during the implementation phase, clinicians will receive feedback and any necessary re-training, from their site PI, if they score below the competency cutoff (&lt;50% or &lt;2 per item; 2=satisfactory).</description>

    <description>As a secondary check of Implementation, PCMHI clinicians will have a random selection of BBTI progress notes reviewed, by their site PI, to assess BBTI elements being utilized (10% or at least 1 per month of eligible notes).

    <description>Maintenance will measure the sustainability of Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, and Implementation during the 6-month post-implementation phase as well as during the long-term sustainability period (&gt;6-months). The outcomes from the sustainability periods will then be compared to the outcomes during the pre- and implementation phases. The same operational definitions as described above will be used for Reach, Effectiveness, and Implementation. For Adoption, comparisons will be based on the rate a clinician delivers BBTI over time within each study phase. For example, the number months of successful Adoption relative to the number of months [n=6] in the post-implementation phase).</description>

    <description>After the pre-implementation phase, all sites will enter a 12-month implementation phase (except site 1, which will begin implementation following BBTI training). During this phase, sites will receive access to and support for the bundle of implementation strategies, both from the hub site and their local champion/internal facilitator. During this phase, PCMHI clinicians trained in BBTI will receive feedback as necessary regarding their BBTI skills from their local champion/internal facilitator. During this phase, PCMHI clinicians will also complete quarterly surveys regarding implementation strategies they are using and which strategies are/are not helpful. Qualitative interviews will be conducted at the end of this phase.</description>
