  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  (Cause of cholelithiasis) Recently, the average age has increased, and the occurrence of&#xD;
           gallstones has increased as the dietary life has been westernized due to the improvement&#xD;
           of socio-economic level. When cholesterol increases, the occurrence of gallstones&#xD;
           increases. Factors include high-calorie high-fat diet, increasing age, women, pregnant&#xD;
           women, obesity, and oral contraceptives. There are cases. As another cause, gallstones&#xD;
           occur well even when bile stasis occurs due to a decrease in motility of the&#xD;
           gallbladder. These are conditions that lower mobility. And cholelithiasis has a genetic&#xD;
           tendency in about 30%. In addition, since the eating habits of the family are similar,&#xD;
           the genetic factors and the eating habits overlap, which often leads to the occurrence&#xD;
           of cholelithiasis in the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (symptoms of cholelithiasis) In most cases, complaints of non-specific digestive system&#xD;
           symptoms, such as abdominal bloating, nausea, and especially indigestion after fatty&#xD;
           diet, are often observed. According to domestic reports, the nonspecific symptoms&#xD;
           complained by patients with cholelithiasis were indigestion, flatulence, frequent&#xD;
           belching, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting. In general, many healthy&#xD;
           people without gallstones complain of non-specific digestive system symptoms in 50% of&#xD;
           cases, and there is a possibility that functional gastrointestinal diseases such as&#xD;
           dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, and gastritis may be accompanied by these digestive system&#xD;
           symptoms. It is difficult to know whether it is unrelated to gallstones. Symptoms caused&#xD;
           by typical cholelithiasis usually have a characteristic that they often improve on their&#xD;
           own after a few hours, and the start and end of the symptoms are relatively clear and&#xD;
           repeatedly occur. In addition, various symptoms are displayed depending on the presence&#xD;
           or absence of inflammation and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (Principle of treatment of cholelithiasis)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Medical treatment: Medical treatment of gallstones is a method of dissolving using&#xD;
                drugs to treat cholesterol gallstones in gallbladder stones. In 1973, Nakano et al.&#xD;
                [1] published the first example of dissolving cholesterol gallstones using&#xD;
                ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Currently, UDCA is the only drug administered to&#xD;
                patients with asymptomatic or mild symptoms of cholelithiasis in actual clinical&#xD;
                practice, and there is no specific prescription drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Surgical treatment: In the case of indications of cholecystectomy, acute&#xD;
                cholecystitis, severe symptoms, chronic cholecystitis with severe thickening of the&#xD;
                gallbladder wall, repeated and severe symptoms, porcelain gallbladder, Patients&#xD;
                with gallstones of 3 cm or more in size, patients with anomalous pancreato-biliary&#xD;
                duct unions, or gallbladder polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (Study on increasing gallbladder contractility) So far, there have been studies that&#xD;
           some drugs increase or decrease gallbladder contractility. Catnach SM et al. [2]&#xD;
           reported that erythromycin increased gallbladder contractility in patients with&#xD;
           autonomic neuropathy due to diabetes. Sengupta S et al. [3] reported that indoramin&#xD;
           (α-adrenergic antagonist), a prokinetic agent, increased gallbladder contractility in&#xD;
           patients with cholelithiasis, resulting in a significant decrease in gallbladder volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motilitone® developed in Korea is a gastrointestinal motility stimulator that stimulates&#xD;
      5-HT4 receptors to increase acetylcholine secretion and has a mechanism of contracting smooth&#xD;
      muscles, improving symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia in cholelithiasis It is&#xD;
      expected to be able to give, and it is thought to have the effect of preventing the&#xD;
      crystallization of bile acids due to an increase in the gallbladder contractility, thereby&#xD;
      preventing the formation of gallstones and preventing newly generated gallstones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no special drugs for dyspepsia or pain improvement in patients with&#xD;
      cholelithiasis. It is hypothesized that administration of motilitone® will increase the&#xD;
      contractile capacity of the gallbladder, thereby improving digestion and preventing further&#xD;
      formation of gallstones. As a control group, Gasmotin® was administered to improve functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia, and the degree of symptom improvement was measured and compared by completing the&#xD;
      Symptom Score Questionnaire for Indigestion between the two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Severance Hospital, patients with cholelithiasis with symptoms of indigestion are divided&#xD;
      into the Motilitone® and Gasmotin® groups. Provide sufficient oral and written explanation of&#xD;
      the clinical trial and obtain consent from the patient who has revealed his willingness to&#xD;
      participate. Randomization uses random numbers, and patient assignment by random numbers is&#xD;
      managed by a third party who does not have direct contact with the patient or clinical&#xD;
      history, and after obtaining consent, the group according to the random number is given and&#xD;
      medication is given. It is provided to. Each drug is prescribed for 6 months. The symptom&#xD;
      score check should be completed at the first outpatient visit(3 months after administration).&#xD;
      We will Check the following items through abdominal ultrasound examination 6 months after&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      : Gallbladder wall thickening presence and extent, number of gallstones, maximum diameter of&#xD;
      gallstones, presence or absence of sludge. The general blood test (CBD) and general chemical&#xD;
      test (SMA) are conducted three times at the first outpatient visit(3 months after&#xD;
      administration), and the research expenses for 3 months and 6 months are supported by the&#xD;
      research fund. In the final analysis, we compare the symptom scores between the two groups&#xD;
      through the Student T-test, and compare the blood test and ultrasound using the Chi-square&#xD;
      test. We want to confirm the following three things through this study. ① In patients with&#xD;
      cholelithiasis with symptoms of dyspepsia, prospective data on the degree of symptom&#xD;
      improvement following motilitone administration can be obtained. ② It is possible to evaluate&#xD;
      the degree of relief or exacerbation of gallstones through ultrasound examination. ③ It is&#xD;
      expected that it will be effective in improving symptoms and alleviating cholelithiasis in&#xD;
      patients with dyspeptic cholelithiasis due to increased gallbladder contractility of&#xD;
      motilitone.&#xD;

    <description>The symptom score check should be completed at the first outpatient visit 3 months after administration. Nepean Dyspepsia Index- Korean version will be used to check the patient's indigestion symptoms. The questionnaire contains the following gastrointestinal symptoms How often it happened / how severe the symptoms were / how much it bothered you There are five (or six) answers. Gastrointestinal symptoms included Abdominal pain, Abdominal discomfort, Having a sour stomach, Heart burn, A Spasm of the stomach, Chest pain, Early fullness, Gastric acid reflux, Satiety after eating, pressure in the upper abdomen, Bloating of the upper abdomen, Nausea, Vomiting, Burp, Hard to breathe. The answer can be selected in 5 (6) numbers; from 0 to 4 (5). We will check the total score with the sum of each score. The symptom score is compared before and 3 months after administration.</description>
