  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed hypothesis is that high doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for at least 2 weeks&#xD;
      can be effective antiviral medication both as a treatment in ambulatory patients and&#xD;
      prophylaxis/treatment in health care workers because it impairs lysosomal function and&#xD;
      reorganizes lipid raft (cholesterol and sphingolipid rich microdomains in the plasma&#xD;
      membrane) content in cells, which are both critical determinants of Emerging Viral Disease&#xD;
      (EVD) infection. This hypothesis is based on a growing literature linking chloroquine to&#xD;
      antiviral activity. It is estimated that enough information exists to launch a clinical trial&#xD;
      of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19.&#xD;

      Sub-Study 1: COVID-19 patients in self-quarantine. Group 1: Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg bid&#xD;
      (two 200 mg tablets taken twice a day; totaling 800 mg per day) for two weeks; Group 2:&#xD;
      Placebo 2 pills twice a day for two weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Study 2: Asymptomatic health care worker prophylaxis. Group 1: Hydroxychloroquine 600 mg&#xD;
      once a day (three 200 mg tablets taken once a day) for up to 2 months; Group 2: Placebo 3&#xD;
      pills once a day for up to 2 months; cross-over from placebo to HCQ 600 mg once a day is&#xD;
      allowed upon confirmatory diagnosis for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Study 1 (Patients tested for COVID-19 who meet symptomology and age requirements for&#xD;
      eligibility): Rate of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Study 2 (Health Care Workers): Rate of COVID-19 infection (confirmed by accepted testing&#xD;
      methods) at 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Sub-Study 1: Rate of secondary infection of co-inhabitants, adverse&#xD;
      events, and negative for COVID-19 (confirmed by accepted testing methods) at 14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Study 2: Number of shifts missed; rate of adverse events, and hospitalization at 2 months&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    As enrollment began external studies called into question the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
    hydroxychloroquine as a treatment which resulted in controversy. The timing of the controversy&#xD;
    significantly impacted our ability to enroll and retain participants.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Sub study 1 HCQ &amp; Placebo groups were identified as patient at least 50 years old self-reported as having a fever within the last four days will undergo swab testing for COVID-19, and then sent home for a self-imposed quarantine that will end 14 days from the start of treatment and consenting patients were randomized. Sub study 2 HCQ and Placebo groups were recruited first through completion of an interest questionnaire then contacted by study PI or designee to assess eligibility consent.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>If Sub Study 1 patients received a negative PCR-test then they were considered no longer a part of the study and had a conversation with the PI or designee. Recruitment was done this way because early in the pandemic, time to receive PCR test results was unclear. At study conclusion 9 substudy 1 participants were Covid positive. 6 of those Covid positive participants completed the study. 30 participants from sub study 2 met eligibility criteria with 13 participants completing the full study.</pre_assignment_details>
