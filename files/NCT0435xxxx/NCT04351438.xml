  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite its growing use across the world, and similar efficacy, filter-based therapeutic&#xD;
      plasma exchange (TPE) continues to be used less often that centrifuge-based TPE. One of the&#xD;
      reasons is that the patient and circuit complications of centrifuge-based TPE are familiar to&#xD;
      the clinical team. There is little data on the patient and circuit complications of&#xD;
      filter-based TPE (using the Prismaflex). Furthermore, there is a reluctance to use&#xD;
      filter-based TPE because historically, most TPE programs have used citrate-regional&#xD;
      anticoagulation, and there is a large gap in knowledge in the use of citrate regional&#xD;
      anti-coagulation when using filter-based TPE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies that evaluate differences between filter-based vs. centrifuge based TPE are lacking.&#xD;
      Heparin-based TPE is the most commonly used method of anti-coagulation when performing&#xD;
      filter-based TPE. Citrate anticoagulation is FDA approved for use during TPE and its use is&#xD;
      the gold-standard anti-coagulant method for TPE. However, citrate has not been studied&#xD;
      rigorously in patients who are on filtration-based TPE on Prismaflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing citrate-based anticoagulation during TPE is challenging for several reasons. First,&#xD;
      because calcium will bind to albumin, one must provide additional albumin in some way to&#xD;
      prevent hypocalcemia. Second, when the replacement fluid is fresh frozen plasma (FFP), the&#xD;
      clinician must account for a very large dose of citrate (which can be 3 times higher than the&#xD;
      dose used to anti-coagulate whole blood) that is present in the FFP. Based on these&#xD;
      principles, with clinical observations and experience using citrate-based continuous renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy, this hospital developed a clinical protocol for use during filter-based&#xD;
      TPE. This protocol has been in use since 2012 in the Renal Care Center at the Children's of&#xD;
      Alabama.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the use of filter-based TPE continue to rise, clinicians need evidence-based data to help&#xD;
      them care for their patients. Although there are a few reports on the complication rates&#xD;
      during centrifuge TPE, known, there are no published reports on the complication rate during&#xD;
      filter-based TPE. A comparison of the complications rate between filter-based TPE and&#xD;
      centrifuge TPE will help providers recognize the safety of filter-based TPE. There are no&#xD;
      known regional citrate anticoagulation protocols for patients receiving filter-based TPE&#xD;
      using Prismaflex. As the use of filter-based TPE continues to rise, there is a great need to&#xD;
      fill this important knowledge gap. As more patients are cared in critical care arena, more&#xD;
      clinicians will need evidence-based protocols for regional citrate anti-coagulation. This&#xD;
      study will fill important gaps in knowledge that will improve the ability of clinical teams&#xD;
      to provide filter-based TPE using Prismaflex.&#xD;
