  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interferon lambda is one of the main arms of the innate antiviral immune response and is&#xD;
      critical for controlling respiratory viral infections in mice. Interferon lambda has a better&#xD;
      side effect profile than other interferons because of the limited tissue distribution of its&#xD;
      receptor. Peginterferon lambda is a long-acting form that has been studied extensively in&#xD;
      human trials in viral hepatitis, confirming its safety. We propose to evaluate&#xD;
      peginterferon-lambda in ambulatory and hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study uses an adaptive design with initial enrolment in the Ambulatory cohort (Cohort A)&#xD;
      followed by a safety assessment before initiation of enrolment in the Hospitalized cohort&#xD;
      (Cohort B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory patients (Cohort A) with confirmed COVID-19 deemed well enough for home isolation&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive a single subcutaneous injection of Peginterferon lambda 180µg&#xD;
      or saline placebo prior to discharge. Patients will be followed remotely with visits for a&#xD;
      repeat swab at Day 3 and 7 with the primary endpoint being the proportion positive for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 on Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data will be reviewed by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee after 50% of the&#xD;
      Ambulatory cohort (n=60) has been enrolled. If the committee approves study continuation,&#xD;
      enrolment will continue in the Ambulatory cohort (Cohort A) and will begin in the&#xD;
      Hospitalized cohort (Cohort B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized patients (Cohort B) with moderate but not severe COVID-19 will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized to Peginterferon lambda 180µg or saline placebo on Day 0 and 5. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be clinical outcomes on the WHO ordinal scale. In addition to the primary&#xD;
      endpoint on which the study is powered, numerous secondary endpoints will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Samples will also be collected for ancillary studies to better understand predictors of&#xD;
      disease severity and response to treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Peginterferon lambda is a covalent conjugate of human recombinant non-pegylated IFN lambda (IFN L) and a 20-kDa linear PEG chain. Peginterferon lambda Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, ready-to-use solution (0.4 mg/mL) that is clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow, and essentially free of particles. Lambda Injection is provided in a 1-mL long Type I glass syringe (0.18 mg/syringe) with a staked 29-gauge, 1/2- inch, thin-walled needle. The syringe has a rigid needle shield and is stoppered with a plunger stopper. Syringes are prefilled with a solution of Peginterferon lambda Injection, mannitol, L-histidine, polysorbate 80, hydrochloric acid, and water for injection; they are intended for a single use at adjustable doses. The syringe is marked with dose indicator lines, which are used as a reference point for administering the correct dose.</description>
