  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess hepatic glucose uptake using non-invasive&#xD;
      metabolic imaging in three different populations that differ in terms of insulin and glucose&#xD;
      kinetics. Between-group comparison will address the following two hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Hepatic glucose uptake will be lower in participants with type 1 diabetes compared with&#xD;
      matched controls due to lack of portal insulin and delayed pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous&#xD;
      bolus insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Hepatic glucose uptake will be higher in participants after bariatric surgery compared&#xD;
      with matched health controls due to accelerated glucose absorption and earlier and higher&#xD;
      peak portal glucose and insulin concentrations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The liver has a central role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. During periods following&#xD;
      food intake the liver stores glucose whilst during fasting periods it produces and releases&#xD;
      glucose into the circulation. These key regulatory features prevent hyperglycaemia after&#xD;
      meals via increase in hepatic glucose uptake and prevent hypoglycaemia during food&#xD;
      deprivation via hepatic glucose output. Although the exact numbers are unknown, it is&#xD;
      suggested that approximately 25%-30% of an oral glucose load are taken up by the liver. Since&#xD;
      hepatic glucose uptake is closely linked with hepatic glycogen synthesis, the fraction of an&#xD;
      oral glucose load that is converted to glycogen is similar or somewhat less. Other pathways&#xD;
      downstream of hepatic glucose uptake are the conversion to lactate, oxidation to carbon&#xD;
      dioxide (CO2) or synthesis of fatty acids. Glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis contribute to&#xD;
      hepatic glucose output, in yet unknown proportions. Key regulators of hepatic glucose&#xD;
      metabolism act through diverse mechanisms. Hepatic glucose uptake is mainly regulated by the&#xD;
      level of insulin, the rate of glucose appearance in the portal vein, the portal-peripheral&#xD;
      glucose and insulin gradient and neuronal signalling1. Hepatic glucose production is&#xD;
      regulated by the provision of substrates such as lactate and glycerol, allosteric control by&#xD;
      metabolites such as glucose, and balance of hormones such as insulin, glucagon and&#xD;
      catecholamines. An imbalance between hepatic glucose uptake and hepatic glucose output&#xD;
      results in dysglycaemia which can be both hyper- or hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic glucose metabolism is dysregulated in a broad spectrum of diseases. Prime examples&#xD;
      are type 1 and type 2 diabetes in which altered hepatic glucose handling contributes to&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia, although via distinct mechanisms. Whereas in type 2 diabetes, insulin&#xD;
      resistance and hence impaired suppression of hepatic glucose output is the key&#xD;
      pathophysiological feature, lack of the portal-peripheral insulin gradient (insulin levels&#xD;
      normally threefold higher in portal vein than in arterial blood due to drainage of secreted&#xD;
      endogenous insulin into the portal vein) seems to be more relevant in type 1 diabetes. In the&#xD;
      latter case absolute insulin deficiency and hence coverage of total insulin requirements by&#xD;
      the exogenous subcutaneous route generates a very different vascular insulin profile compared&#xD;
      with endogenously secreted insulin. Experiments in conscious dogs showed that glucose uptake&#xD;
      is equally divided between the liver and muscle when insulin is infused via the portal vein,&#xD;
      but when insulin is delivered peripherally the percentage of glucose taken up by the liver is&#xD;
      less than half of normal. These findings suggest that peripherally delivered insulin cannot&#xD;
      replicate the physiologic regulation of postprandial hepatic glucose uptake, but direct&#xD;
      evidence in humans is currently lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another condition that is characterised by an altered portal milieu are patients having&#xD;
      undergone bariatric surgery. The re-arrangement of the gastrointestinal tract substantially&#xD;
      alters the portal milieu by accelerated glucose fluxes and higher and earlier gut peptide&#xD;
      hormone patterns. The two most commonly performed bariatric surgery procedures, namely&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which re-routes the small intestine to a small stomach pouch, and&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy, which reduces the stomach to about 15% of its original size,&#xD;
      significantly accelerate glucose absorption. It was recently demonstrated that this effects&#xD;
      is more pronounced after Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass than sleeve gastrectomy. Accelerated&#xD;
      glucose absorption leads to higher glucose concentrations in the portal vein. Of note, animal&#xD;
      experiments using portal vein catheterization showed that under elevated glucose levels in&#xD;
      the portal vein promote hepatic glucose uptake, however direct evidence in post-bariatric&#xD;
      surgery patients is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organ-specific substrate exchanges (uptake and output) can be best studied by measuring&#xD;
      arterio-venous substrate concentration difference and organ blood supply. The additional use&#xD;
      of isotopically labelled substrates further allows calculating intra-organ turnover rate.&#xD;
      Although invasive, this method can be applied for most organs or tissue, such as the kidney,&#xD;
      heart, brain or whole limbs. The liver's anatomical location and connection to the portal&#xD;
      circulation makes the the calculation of arterio-venous-substrate gradient in humans&#xD;
      particularly challenging, however. Surgical catheterization of the portal vein in humans is&#xD;
      not possible for practical and ethical reasons. As a consequence, current non-invasive&#xD;
      approaches in humans rely on the use of stable isotopes and can only provide an estimate of&#xD;
      splanchnic glucose uptake (sum of liver and intestinal glucose utilisation) but do not allow&#xD;
      for the quantification of hepatic glucose uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it is generally assumed that the liver is the sole source of glucose production (an&#xD;
      assumption essentially verified in normal condition, since the kidney appears to contribute&#xD;
      less than 10% total glucose output), a simplified tracer approach with analysis of the&#xD;
      systemic dilution of infused labelled glucose can reliably estimate hepatic (endogenous)&#xD;
      glucose output. However, such isotope dilution cannot estimate hepatic glucose uptake, which&#xD;
      has essentially been indirectly assessed in multiple (oral+iv) glucose tracers experiment and&#xD;
      calculation of the systemic appearance of ingested labelled glucose. These measurements are&#xD;
      however tightly dependent on the mathematical model used and hence remain semiquantitative.&#xD;
      Furthermore, they do not allow to differentiate gut and hepatic glucose uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the only way to directly assess hepatic glucose uptake is through highly invasive&#xD;
      portal vein catheterization which requires animal models. Such models can simulate&#xD;
      postprandial hepatic glucose handling but applicability to humans are limited. Current&#xD;
      concepts of hepatic glucose uptake under different conditions mainly stem from animal&#xD;
      experiments in which overnight fasted conscious dogs underwent portal vein catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the above mentioned dilemma it follows that obtaining quantitative data on hepatic&#xD;
      glucose uptake in humans requires a non-invasive approach such as imaging. Positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) scanning with the tracer fluorine-18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), called&#xD;
      FDG-PET enables direct observation of tissue glucose uptake by quantifying radioactivity over&#xD;
      time in vivo. Some researchers have thus suggested to use FDG-PET to study human glucose&#xD;
      metabolism. However, FDG-PET confers the major downside of exposing individuals to remarkable&#xD;
      amounts of radiation, a risk that is not considered justified for research purposes only. In&#xD;
      addition FDG-PET does not inform on metabolism downstream of glucose uptake and the&#xD;
      intravenous administration route of the radioactive glucose is not reflective of normal&#xD;
      physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clearly, there is a demand for a non-invasive, non-radioactive and easily applicable approach&#xD;
      to investigate human hepatic glucose metabolism including the quantification of hepatic&#xD;
      glucose uptake. Deuterium metabolic imaging is a novel, non-invasive imaging approach that&#xD;
      combines deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging with oral intake or intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of nonradioactive 2H-labeled substrates to generate three-dimensional metabolic&#xD;
      maps. Deuterium metabolic imaging can reveal glucose metabolism beyond mere uptake and can be&#xD;
      used with other Deuterium (2H)-labeled substrates as well. It has recently been demonstrated&#xD;
      by De Feyter et al. that deuterium metabolic imaging allows mapping of glucose metabolism in&#xD;
      the brain and liver of animal models and human subjects using 6,6-2H2-glucose. Deuterium&#xD;
      metabolic imaging is a promising, non-invasive and easy-to-implement imaging technique that&#xD;
      opens new avenues to address important knowledge gaps such as the extent and dynamics of&#xD;
      postprandial hepatic glucose uptake and utilisation.&#xD;
