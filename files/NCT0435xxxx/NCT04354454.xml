  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Step into Support for Endurance and Strength (SISTERS) research study is evaluating&#xD;
      whether a mobile health game designed to increase physical activity is feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable in patients with gynecologic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -SISTERS is testing a mobile health intervention can help increase physical activity.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive either 1) a Fitbit or 2) a Fitbit + a game + help&#xD;
      from a friend or family member whom you chose will help the participant reach their goals.&#xD;
      (i.e. a Teammate).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a two-arm randomized controlled pilot study designed to test the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of using a wearable accelerometer (Fitbit) vs. a wearable accelerometer&#xD;
      (FItbit) + a game designed to help participants increase physical activity + social support&#xD;
      improves participants' average daily step counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible Participants will be randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fitbit (wearable accelerometer) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fitbit (wearable accelerometer) + game + help from a self-selected teammate&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study interventions involved in this research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surveys/Interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fitbits (also known as a wearable accelerometers or fitness trackers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Way to Health Platform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Help from a Teammate (i.e. a friend or family member that participants choose to help&#xD;
           them reach their goals)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 50 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

Participants will select a step goal, use a Fitbit to track daily activity, and select a teammate (e.g. family member or friend) who they think will help them achieve their goals.&#xD;
Participants will participate a 3-month game designed to increase activity and then followed for another 1.5 months to see if their increased activity can be maintained without the game.&#xD;
