  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Since 2001 when the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry was first established several&#xD;
      large-scale interventions aimed at the entire Danish population from all ages have been&#xD;
      initiated. BLS courses have been made mandatory in all primary schools since January 2005,&#xD;
      and when taking driver's license since October 2006. This has resulted in a steep increase in&#xD;
      the number of Danish citizens attending a BLS course to approximately 3-4.5% of the entire&#xD;
      population annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the numerous population-based&#xD;
      interventions to increase bystander basic life support (BLS) prior to arrival of Emergency&#xD;
      Medical Services (EMS) to persons suffering from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).&#xD;
      Further this study aim at identifying geographical areas with low frequency of Basic Life&#xD;
      Support (BLS) education and low level of bystander initiated BLS to enable direction of&#xD;
      further educational efforts in the future to increase survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods By coupling the geographical coordinates of the BLS course certificates with the GPS&#xD;
      coordinates of cardiac arrests, the effects of BLS courses on bystander CPR rates and&#xD;
      survival can be investigated. In collaboration with researchers from Aalborg University&#xD;
      Hospital, the entire Danish geography have been divided into digital squares of 100x100m and&#xD;
      combined with sociodemographic data. This data will be coupled with national administrative&#xD;
      parish of Denmark comprising some 2201 geographical units of approximately equal size. This&#xD;
      geographic model has been combined with data from the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry, the&#xD;
      National Danish Patient registry and the Central Person Registry. The current study has&#xD;
      access to the geodata of the GPS coordinates of Danish citizens who have attained a BLS&#xD;
      course certificate between 2016 and 2019. By combining the two datasets in national&#xD;
      administrative parish's of Denmark, the investigators are able to calculate the correlation&#xD;
      between BLS course certificates, the rate of bystander CPR and survival of OHCA. Further, the&#xD;
      investigators are able to pinpoint geographic areas where improvements of the BLS education&#xD;
      level and bystander initiated BLS rates can be made. To involve laypersons in the current&#xD;
      study, focus group interviews consisting of BLS course participants will be performed to&#xD;
      explore the views of the attending laypersons on the project and revise accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome To identify geographical association between bystander CPR prior to EMS&#xD;
      arrival and BLS training. A verified account of number of BLS certificates issued annually&#xD;
      and geographical visual map of first aid certificates. Finally, it is a goal to be able to&#xD;
      identify areas with which to start with better education. That is, areas where there is low&#xD;
      frequency of courses and low frequency of bystanders initiated BLS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Denmark is known world-wide for our ability to examine out-of-hospital cardiac&#xD;
      arrest (OHCA) on a population scale and for the high number of laypersons educated in&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A nationwide digital dispatch- and patient registry for&#xD;
      the respective EMS providers was implemented in 2016. Since then all OHCAs were registered&#xD;
      electronically via the EMS digital system and stored nationally. Several characteristics is&#xD;
      coupled with each registered OHCA, including bystander-initiated CPR and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denmark has approximately 5400 OHCAs each year nationally. There has been a significant rise&#xD;
      in survival after OHCA in Denmark the last two decades. From 2001 30-day survival rate, from&#xD;
      hospital discharge, has increased fourfold from around 4% in 2001 to 16% in 2018. This is&#xD;
      likely in part due to a significant rise in bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).&#xD;
      Since 2001 bystander-initiated CPR rate has increased from 20% to 77% in 2018. In this same&#xD;
      period Denmark has had a threefold increase in the number of Basic Life Support (BLS) courses&#xD;
      taken by the public. This is largely due to several central initiatives. To increase&#xD;
      bystander CPR rates in Denmark, CPR courses have been made mandatory in all primary schools&#xD;
      since January 2005 and when taking driver's license since October 2006. Further, several&#xD;
      large-scale national campaigns have been initiated to increase bystander CPR frequency and&#xD;
      AED use. In an upcoming study of a representative part of the entire population 4 out of 5&#xD;
      respondents answered that they had participated in some kind of BLS course in their lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently in Denmark, approximately 250.000-300.000 citizens attend certified CPR and&#xD;
      automatic external defibrillator (AED) courses annually. Most courses (&gt;97%) are provided by&#xD;
      one of the organizations of the Danish First Aid Council. Only a minor proportion of&#xD;
      approximately 2.500-4.000 courses annually is provided by the Danish/European resuscitation&#xD;
      council. Both recognized structures intend to follow the standards of the ERC guidelines.&#xD;
      Since 2016 the Danish first aid council, who conduct most courses, have registered all&#xD;
      certificates electronically with personal identification number, type of course and date of&#xD;
      passed course for each of the approximately 250.000-300.000 participants. The courses include&#xD;
      4 hours training in BLS including CPR and AED use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017 a french observational study evaluating the association between BLS education, Public&#xD;
      Access Defibrillation programs and survival after OHCA in conjunction with sports in 51 of 96&#xD;
      French districts from 2005-2010 was published. The study concluded that there was a positive&#xD;
      association between BLS education and survival even when adjusted for relevant confounders.&#xD;
      The authors gained insight to BLS educational level through two sources data. Firstly, from&#xD;
      national records of individuals educated by national initiatives from five governmental&#xD;
      agencies and a through information from one organization. Secondly, from local initiatives by&#xD;
      a media search through web-based media and newspapers with keywords. The authors gained&#xD;
      insight into survival through a register based on OHCA related to sports in each in French&#xD;
      districts. That is within a district all sports-related OHCA, defined as cardiac arrests&#xD;
      occurring during or within 1 hour of cessation of sports activity, whether in a sports&#xD;
      facility or outside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The french observational study provides a concrete basis for further investigations but&#xD;
      presents several obvious shortcomings when investigating national BLS educational&#xD;
      initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, data is not national, and the regions are not geographically aggregated, which&#xD;
      presents obvious challenges to the magnitude of the conclusions on a national level.&#xD;
      Secondly, there is not a geographically or quantitatively accurate count of BLS educated&#xD;
      citizens. The number of citizens with BLS education is recorded over every 5 years with no&#xD;
      account of whether the BLS course is attended post or prior to relevant OHCA sport related&#xD;
      arrest. Further it seems logical to assume, that laypersons do not respect district borders&#xD;
      when assisting for OHCA. Since only about half of the French districts are included, the&#xD;
      perspective of persons trained in the other half of the districts is not accounted for. This&#xD;
      can be overcome with a comprehensive national geographical setting. Thirdly, the study only&#xD;
      compares BLS education with overall survival throughout the district on sports related OHCA.&#xD;
      The obvious association to bystander initiated BLS rates is not examined even though&#xD;
      bystander-initiated CPR proved the strongest predictor for survival in the study. Hence a&#xD;
      causal chain from intervention to survival is not well described. Lastly, as is covered in&#xD;
      the article, survival data were taken only from the subgroup of the national sports OHCA&#xD;
      registry that represents potentially the best situation for AED use and bystander CPR, due to&#xD;
      the high frequency of bystander presence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These fundamental problems can all be overcome in the Danish setting as there is precise and&#xD;
      complete national data with geographical location and other attributes to both BLS education&#xD;
      and all OHCA (not only sports related).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geodata analysis has recently been utilized to compare AED location and OHCA via the Danish&#xD;
      Cardiac Arrest registry. The technology is available and applicable to both OHCA locations&#xD;
      and BLS education certificates. This enables a precise analysis of both temporal and spatial&#xD;
      association between OHCA and BLS education on a national level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine to association between BLS course certificates, bystander initiated BLS and&#xD;
           survival via geographical analysis of distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify geographical areas with low frequency of BLS education and low level of&#xD;
           bystander initiated BLS to direct further efforts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance The present study will greatly add to our knowledge about which factors influence&#xD;
      outcome after OHCA. It will also provide knowledge that can help optimization of public&#xD;
      efforts to increase survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study is a registry-based follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OHCA data All cases of OHCA in which a resuscitative attempt is initiated prior to EMS&#xD;
      arrival, have specific data recorded to the Danish Cardiac arrest registry. Most variables&#xD;
      have been collected since 2001, but GPS coordinates were only recently added nation-wide.&#xD;
      Data will be used from all verified OHCA from the national Danish Cardiac Arrest Register&#xD;
      from the period mid-2016 to mid-2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLS education data All data concerning BLS education level is derived from the Danish First&#xD;
      Aid Council Digital Data base on course certificates from early 2016 to early 2019. The&#xD;
      approximately half a year different in start point from OHCA data is to ensure that&#xD;
      certificates are issues prior to OHCA. That is to ensure some measure of cause and effect of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database is national owned by the Danish First Aid council. In the database, all&#xD;
      certificates have attributed time of issue, social security number and certificate type. With&#xD;
      personal identification number (PIN) and Central Person Registry the public Danish&#xD;
      Statistical Agency can locate official current address of each certificate holder and convert&#xD;
      addresses into anonymized geographical coordinates (European Terrestrial Reference System&#xD;
      1989 (ETRS89) or GPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geodata-analysis A collaborating group from Aalborg University Hospital have divided the&#xD;
      entire Danish geography into squares of 100*100 meters based on the UTM-system, and the group&#xD;
      have obtained data on population density, mean income, educational level, age and several&#xD;
      additional variables within each square. This data can be coupled with national&#xD;
      administrative parish of Denmark comprising some 2201 geographical units of approximately&#xD;
      equal size allowing for a wide range of data coupling through national registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this setting each OHCA is marked with a coordinate and have been tied to the appropriate&#xD;
      square along with data on the individual OHCA, that being both pre-hospital factors, burden&#xD;
      of disease prior to the event, and long-term outcome. In addition, data on large public&#xD;
      facilities, airport, schools etc. where the daytime population will be artificially high does&#xD;
      no skew the results. Further adjusted measures will be created on factors possible presenting&#xD;
      a skewed OHCA survival profile (i.e. nursing homes, rehabilitation centers and areas with&#xD;
      high proportion of elderly). This will allow characterisation of each square by means of&#xD;
      general-population-data and by overall OHCA characteristics within the square.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the data from all certifications of BLS education in the same period all dara can be&#xD;
      coupled in the danish administrative parish units. This allows for a statistical association&#xD;
      calculation and a direct pinpoint of geographical areas in need of further educational&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis data storage and anonymization Descriptive analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      for identifying areas with low BLS educational level and low level of bystander initiated&#xD;
      BLS. Geographical illustrations will be completed using ArcGIS. Pearson's correlations or&#xD;
      other relevant measure between survival, BLS education level, and bystander initiated BLS&#xD;
      will be calculated as a measure of association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is further sought to investigate a link between survival and BLS educational level with a&#xD;
      Pearson's correlation or a Spearmans Rho test and regression analysis to portray strength.&#xD;
      Outcome on survival will, as far as data allows, be adjusted for characteristics of the&#xD;
      individual geographical area. Examples of such are population age, gender distribution, mean&#xD;
      income and educational level. Furthermore, it is considered relevant to examine potentially&#xD;
      relevant sub-group analysis, e.g. after work hours OHCAs. Data management and statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be performed using R-static™ (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing,&#xD;
      Austria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be stored in an anonymous form in secure folders in the regional data storage&#xD;
      system. Data access and analysis on OHCA was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency&#xD;
      (reference 2007-58-0015, GEH-2014-019, I-suite 02737). A formal application to Danish data&#xD;
      Protection Agency regarding usage, transformation and storage of certificate data will be&#xD;
      formulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Because this is a Registry-based study no ethical approval is required.&#xD;
