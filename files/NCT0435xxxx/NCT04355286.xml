    <textblock>
      This will be a single clinical study conducted in 2 parts (Part 1: pilot study and Part 2:&#xD;
      pivotal study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is an open-label, 1-arm study in 14 healthy adult subjects with the following primary&#xD;
      objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: To explore whether the active component, bemotrizinol (BEMT), is absorbed from&#xD;
           a high-penetrating sunscreen formulation including 6% BEMT into the systemic circulation&#xD;
           when applied under maximal-use conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: To obtain information needed for a successful pivotal study such as&#xD;
           preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) data, validation of study and analytical procedures,&#xD;
           and the number of subjects needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is an open-label, randomized, 3-arm study in 42 healthy adult subjects with the&#xD;
      following objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Primary: To assess the systemic absorption and pharmacokinetics of BEMT from 3 market image&#xD;
      sunscreen formulations under maximal-use conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single clinical study conducted in 2 parts (Part 1: pilot study and Part 2:&#xD;
      pivotal study). The duration of study participation will be approximately 42 days for Part 1,&#xD;
      including a 30-day screening period, a 4-day treatment period (Days 1-4), and subjects&#xD;
      leaving the clinical research unit (CRU) on the morning of Day 5. Subjects will then return&#xD;
      to the CRU for follow-up visits on Days 8 and 12. On Day 12, End-of-Study activities will be&#xD;
      completed. For Part 2, the duration of participation will be approximately the same, 42 days,&#xD;
      and may be adjusted based on the results of Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is an open-label, 1-arm pilot study to evaluate the effects of multiple applications&#xD;
      of a topical sunscreen formulation in healthy adult subjects. It will include 14 subjects (7&#xD;
      male and 7 female) that will be admitted to the CRU on Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of Days 1 through 4, subjects will receive a topical application of the study&#xD;
      drug between 07:00 and 10:00 hours followed by 3 more applications each day at 2, 4, and 6&#xD;
      hours after the first application, resulting in study drug application at 0, 2, 4, 6, 24, 26,&#xD;
      28, 30, 48, 50, 52, 54, 72, 74, 76, and 78 hours relative to the first application. The&#xD;
      weight of study drug will be measured and recorded before and after dosing for each subject&#xD;
      and each dose will be applied by a qualified person from the CRU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected for the determination of plasma concentrations of BEMT from&#xD;
      before the first topical application of study drug to 264 hours after the first study drug&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is an open-label, randomized, 3-arm pivotal study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      BEMT after multiple applications of a topical sunscreen formulation in healthy adult subjects&#xD;
      and may be modified based on observations from Part 1 and the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) revision. Part 2 will include 14 subjects (7 male and 7 female) in each arm. At least 3&#xD;
      formulations will be selected based on the plasma exposure data from the pilot study (Part&#xD;
      1), the in vitro permeation testing (IVPT) results, and the market survey for BEMT-containing&#xD;
      formulations. All 42 subjects will be admitted to the CRU on Day -1 and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      a treatment arm before study drug application on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of Day 1, the assigned study drug will be applied topically between 07:00 and&#xD;
      10:00 hours; on Days 2, 3, and 4, subjects will receive an initial application at the same&#xD;
      time as on Day 1 and 3 more topical applications at 2, 4, and 6 hours after the first&#xD;
      application, resulting in study drug application at 0, 24, 26, 28, 30, 48, 50, 52, 54, 72,&#xD;
      74, 76, and 78 hours relative to the first application. The weight of study drug will be&#xD;
      measured and recorded both before and after dosing for each subject and each dose will be&#xD;
      applied by a qualified person from the CRU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK blood sample collection schedule for Part 2 will be based on the results from Part 1.&#xD;
      If significant systemic exposure is observed in Part 1, additional PK blood samples may be&#xD;
      collected in Part 2 for assessment of metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts of the study, In Parts 1 and 2, approximately 2 mg of active sunscreen&#xD;
      ingredient per 1 cm2 of body surface area (calculation per method of Du Bois and Du Bois&#xD;
      [1989]) will be evenly applied 4 times per study day (except for a 1-time application on the&#xD;
      first day in Part 2) to areas of the body typically exposed to the sun: face (except eye&#xD;
      area), ears, neck, torso, arms, and legs (at least 75% of the body surface area). The&#xD;
      antecubital areas will be avoided and protected with an occlusive, self-adhesive cover when&#xD;
      applying the sunscreen due to potential contamination of the sites used for PK blood sample&#xD;
      collection. The topical applications of study drug will be administered with subjects in swim&#xD;
      wear to simulate real world settings as well as for easy application. In addition to swim&#xD;
      wear, subjects may wear scrubs in between applications and at other times throughout the&#xD;
      day/night. Subjects are required to shower each morning after the first PK blood sample&#xD;
      collection (and before the first application of the day), but not at other times during the&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital sign measurements, and&#xD;
      physical examinations. All AEs reported by the subject or observed by the investigator or CRU&#xD;
      staff will be recorded. Any AE reported after the informed consent form is signed and before&#xD;
      study drug application will be recorded as medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the clinical site will follow all FDA,&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and institutional review board (IRB)&#xD;
      recommendations in its oversight and conduct of the trial. This may include changing the&#xD;
      schedule of follow-up visits if it is considered necessary after a full risk/benefit&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
