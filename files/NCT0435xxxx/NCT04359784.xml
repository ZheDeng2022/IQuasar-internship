  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well anakinra works in decreasing the occurrence of cytokine&#xD;
      release syndrome (CRS) and damage to the nerves (neurotoxicity) in patients with B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma who are receiving CD-19 targeted chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy.&#xD;
      CAR-T cell therapy may be complicated by two potentially life-threatening side effects: CRS&#xD;
      and neurotoxicity. Anakinra is a drug typically used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but may&#xD;
      also help in preventing CAR-T cell-related cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anakinra subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 0-13 and axicabtagene ciloleucel&#xD;
      via infusion on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, patients are followed up periodically&#xD;
      for up to 90 days.&#xD;
