  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of patients survive care in medical and surgical Intensive Care Units (ICUs) every&#xD;
      year, only to suffer from a new or accelerated dementia-like process, called post-ICU&#xD;
      long-term cognitive impairment (ICU-LTCI). ICU-LTCI causes considerable problems with&#xD;
      personal relationships, return to work, and everyday tasks, such as managing medicines and&#xD;
      money. No treatment for these patients is currently available. Technology using computerized&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation could improve ICU-LTCI by harnessing the healing potential of the&#xD;
      brain (i.e., neuroplasticity). This intervention is scalable, portable, and economical. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of computerized cognitive rehabilitation in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of 160 VA patients with ICU-LTCI. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that this intervention could improve cognition, and brain structure shown by MRI. This&#xD;
      research has high potential to influence rehabilitation strategies for Veteran and civilian&#xD;
      ICU survivors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a lifetime, an average American will be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) twice,&#xD;
      will spend nearly a week in an ICU during their last six months of life, and will have a one&#xD;
      in five chance of an ICU-related death. Of those millions who annually survive critical&#xD;
      illness, ICU survivorship is marked by an inability to manage medication, handle finances,&#xD;
      live independently, and maintain employment due to post-ICU long-term cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (ICU-LTCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the investigators' group and others show that 50% of ICU survivors suffer from&#xD;
      ICU-LTCI. The investigators' Veterans Affairs (VA) Merit Award funded research, &quot;Measuring&#xD;
      the Incidence and determining risk factors for Neuropsychological Dysfunction in ICU&#xD;
      Survivors&quot; (MIND-ICU) study, helped define the epidemiology of this persistent and&#xD;
      progressive chronic brain dysfunction that affects both executive function and memory domains&#xD;
      of cognition. Among survivors from medical and surgical ICUs, 40% have impairments rivaling&#xD;
      moderate traumatic brain injury, and 30% have impairments similar to mild-moderate&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. The MIND-ICU study indicates that the number of Veterans who develop&#xD;
      ICU-LTCI is as high as the number of new traumatic brain injury diagnoses among all Active&#xD;
      Duty, National Guard, and Reserves of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. For a&#xD;
      public health problem of this magnitude, there is a driving unmet need to find solutions for&#xD;
      ICU-LTCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' pilot randomized &quot;Returning to Everyday Tasks Utilizing Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Networks-I&quot; (RETURN-I) Study showed that a 12-week cognitive rehabilitation intervention (vs.&#xD;
      controls) improved executive dysfunction. Next, the investigators transformed this&#xD;
      non-computerized, resource-intensive strategy into a novel, efficient, and scalable&#xD;
      Computerized Cognitive Rehabilitation (CCR) method. This plasticity-based adaptive CCR was&#xD;
      applied to a case-series of ICU survivors which signaled improvements across multiple&#xD;
      cognitive domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on nearly two decades of aging brain research with the VA-Tennessee Valley Geriatric&#xD;
      Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), the investigators now propose a Phase II&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the efficacy of CCR for survivors with&#xD;
      ICU-LTCI. The Returning to Everyday Tasks Utilizing Rehabilitation Networks-III Study&#xD;
      (RETURN-III Study) will be the next logical data-driven approach to develop and offer&#xD;
      innovative real-world solutions for civilians and Veterans surviving critical illness with&#xD;
      disabling ICU-LTCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these hypotheses, the RETURN-III study will randomize medical and surgical VA ICU&#xD;
      survivors to either intervention using CCR, or control of non-specific computer games. At&#xD;
      three, and twelve months post-randomization, trained research personnel blinded to group&#xD;
      assignment will use a validated battery to assess global cognition [primary outcome].&#xD;
