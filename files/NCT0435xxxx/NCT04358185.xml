  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will assess the effects of Itacitinib as a second line treatment for patients&#xD;
      with advanced inflammatory hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer. Itacinib&#xD;
      is a protein inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase, JAK1, which is believed to enable cancer cells&#xD;
      to metastasise to other parts of the body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JAKaL is a single arm phase Ib study evaluating the effect of Itacitinib in 25 patients with&#xD;
      advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients diagnosed with HCC will have advanced disease where only palliative care is&#xD;
      offered to them, this could account for the relatively low reported 5-year survival rate of&#xD;
      approximately 10%. There are a number of epidemiological and pre-clinical studies that have&#xD;
      investigated the role of chronic inflammatory conditions in the development of HCC and these&#xD;
      provide evidence that inflammation promotes malignant transformation. The production of&#xD;
      tumour-promoting cytokines by inflammatory cells can activate transcription factors, such as&#xD;
      STAT3 via the JAK/STAT pathway in premalignant cells. STAT3, once activated, can cause the&#xD;
      expression of further genes necessary for cell activation, localisation, survival and&#xD;
      proliferation. Inhibition of JAK could therefore be a way of directly affecting malignant&#xD;
      cell proliferation, as STAT3 in most malignancies are persistently phosphorylated and thereby&#xD;
      stimulated to carry out its function; to sustain cell proliferation and block apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For reference, STAT3 is a member of the STAT protein family and is switched on, via&#xD;
      phosphorylation, by receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAK), a type of tyrosine kinase, and&#xD;
      together they form homo-/heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus and act as&#xD;
      transcription activators. STAT3 mediates the expression of a variety of genes and therefore&#xD;
      is integral to many cellular processes, as mentioned above, such as cell growth and&#xD;
      apoptosis, and thus they can promote oncogenesis by being over-active in the different&#xD;
      signalling pathways it is involved in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Itacitinib has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any&#xD;
      clinical indication but has been developed as potential treatments for myelofibrosis (MF),&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), B cell malignancies&#xD;
      and solid tumours like HCC. It is a small molecule selective inhibitor of JAK1 thereby&#xD;
      preventing its phosphorylation of STAT proteins, particularly STAT3, resulting in a decrease&#xD;
      in the expression of genes responsible for cell activation, localisation, survival and&#xD;
      proliferation&#xD;
