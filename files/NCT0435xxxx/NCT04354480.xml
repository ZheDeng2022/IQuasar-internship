  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Solicited Local Adverse Events (AEs) After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after vaccination (Day 1 to Day 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with solicited local AE's will be evaluated. Solicited local AEs (including erythema, swelling, and pain/tenderness at the study vaccine injection site) will be noted in the participant diary after 7 days of vaccination.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Solicited Systemic Adverse Events (AEs) After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after vaccination (Day 1 to Day 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with solicited systemic AEs will be evaluated. Solicited systemic AEs (fatigue, headache, myalgia, nausea and fever) will be noted in the participant diary after 7 days of vaccination.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Unsolicited AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after vaccination (Day 1 to Day 29)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with unsolicited AEs will be evaluated. An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. Unsolicited AEs will include all AEs for which the participant is not specifically questioned in the participant diary.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>First vaccination (Day 1) to the end of the study (up to Day 183)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with SAEs will be evaluated. A SAE is any AE that results in: death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is life threatening experience, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product, is medically important, and may jeopardize participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>RSV Neutralization Assay</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-vaccination), Days 14, 28, and 182 (post-vaccination)</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of neutralizing antibodies to RSV A strain will be performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>RSV Fusion Protein (F-Protein) Binding Antibodies by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-vaccination), Days 14, 28, and 182 (post-vaccination)</time_frame>
    <description>Antibodies binding to RSV F-protein in pre-fusion and post-fusion forms will be assessed by ELISA.</description>
