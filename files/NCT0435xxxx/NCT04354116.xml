      The objective of this randomized controlled study will be to evaluate the dental and skeletal&#xD;
      effects of maxillary protraction with a facemask, associated with MARPE and Class III&#xD;
      elastics in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate (CLP) with maxillary retrusion,&#xD;
      compared to HYRAX type maxillary expanders. The investigators will examine differences in&#xD;
      treatment times, along with skeletal, dental and soft tissue changes.&#xD;

      The CONSORT statement will be used as a guide for this study. This work will be a parallel&#xD;
      group study, randomized, with active control, with an allocation ratio of 1: 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee of the Pontifical Catholic&#xD;
      University of Minas Gerais. Participants will be recruited in the Master's Degree in&#xD;
      Orthodontics at PUC Minas, based on inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palatal expanders of the HYRAX type, with bands on the first permanent molars or second&#xD;
      deciduous molars will be used for patients in both groups. The hooks for the use of Class III&#xD;
      elastics will be welded on the vestibular of the upper molar bands. In the experimental&#xD;
      group, the expander will be anchored mesially and bilaterally in mini-implants, in a&#xD;
      technique known as rapid maxillary expansion assisted by mini-implants (MARPE). The control&#xD;
      group will be active, with conventional dento-mucus-supported HYRAX expanders. All expanders&#xD;
      will be manufactured by the same orthodontic technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be treated with maxillary protraction with a Petit-type face mask at night&#xD;
      (12 hours a day). The direction of the elastics for the maxillary traction force will be&#xD;
      between 15˚ to 30˚ below the occlusal plane, providing a force between 400 and 500 g per&#xD;
      side. During the day (12 hours a day), patients will use a lower expansion plate with an&#xD;
      occlusal stop, which will be activated once a week (0.25 mm), with hooks in the region of the&#xD;
      lower canines for the use of Class III elastics. size 3/16 &quot;(150g). The time-frame of the&#xD;
      experiment will be 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results (primary and secondary) The primary outcome will be the degree of anterior movement&#xD;
      of the maxilla after treatment). Secondary outcomes will be changes in other cephalometric&#xD;
      variables and treatment time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conical beam computed tomography (CBCT) will be performed at the beginning and at the end of&#xD;
      the treatment. Teleradiographies will be extracted from the CFFCs and cephalometric&#xD;
      measurements will be obtained by the investigator (V.E.) using the Dolphin Image software&#xD;
      (Austin, USA). Traditional cephalometric measurements will be used to describe the changes&#xD;
      before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of the sample size As no study in the orthodontic literature used the same&#xD;
      protocol used in this study, the sample size will be estimated by G * Power (version 3.0.8),&#xD;
      with 95% power; significance level of 5%; two-tailed. For point A, sagittal movements of 2.6&#xD;
      +/- 1.5 mm in the RME group and 5.8 +/- 2.3 mm in the RME group with constriction, a minimum&#xD;
      sample size of 11 in each group will be necessary to detect a significant difference between&#xD;
      groups. For ANS, sagittal movements of 2.1 +/- 1.3 mm in the RME group and 4.8 +/- 2.5 mm in&#xD;
      the RME group with constriction, a minimum sample size of 16 in each group will be necessary&#xD;
      to detect a significant difference between groups. Therefore, 16 will be the minimum sample&#xD;
      size for each group. The sample size will be increased by 40%, resulting in 22 patients for&#xD;
      each group, in case there is a withdrawal or the need to use a different protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization (random number generation, allocation hiding, implementation) Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited and allocated to the control group (RME) or the intervention group (MARPE)&#xD;
      according to the sequence of participation. Simple randomization will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The blinding of investigators or participants will not be possible because the&#xD;
      expanders in the two groups will be different. Operators and patients will easily know which&#xD;
      group they are in. However, blinding will be used during cephalometric analysis. All image&#xD;
      exams will be hidden by opaque tape and replaced with research numbers and then mixed&#xD;
      together before analysis. The investigator will not know the clustering of the CT scans,&#xD;
      which will look similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis (primary and secondary results, subgroup analyzes) All statistical&#xD;
      analyzes will be performed using the software (version 18.0; PASW Statistics, Chicago,&#xD;
      Illinois). Descriptive statistics will include the means and standard deviations of age,&#xD;
      total treatment time, maxillary prostration time, cephalometric values and changes in values&#xD;
      in each group. The 1-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to test the normality of&#xD;
      distributions for all times and differences in cephalometric values. Independent t-tests will&#xD;
      be used to compare the two groups, including total treatment time, protraction time and&#xD;
      changes in cephalometric values; the t-tests will be used for the values that show &quot;equality&#xD;
      of variances not assumed&quot; between the groups (SNA and Nasio perpendicular). The level of&#xD;
      significance will be 0.05, with two-tailed test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Error of the Method All locations and measurements of the points will be checked twice&#xD;
      carefully at the end of the initial plots and measurements. Not all images will be traced&#xD;
      twice. However, to evaluate the tracing errors, 20 scans will be chosen at random. Plots,&#xD;
      locations and measurements will be made twice, two weeks apart and then subjected to the&#xD;
      Dahlberg formula. The error of the method will be determined by the Dahlberg formula, where n&#xD;
      = 20 and d will be the difference between the measurements in 2 moments.&#xD;
