  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer mortality in the United States. The current standard of care (SOC) for locally&#xD;
      advanced rectal cancer includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery.&#xD;
      However, great variability exists in patient's response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with&#xD;
      only about 20-25% of patients achieving a complete response while other patients achieve a&#xD;
      partial or no treatment response. The purpose of this study is to test the investigational&#xD;
      agent, Pembrolizumab, in combination with SOC radiation and Capecitabine (or 5-Fluorouacil)&#xD;
      in treatment of patients with mismatch repair deficient locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;

      This study investigates the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of Pembrolizumab, an&#xD;
      immunotherapy agent, in combination with SOC radiation and Capecitabine (or 5-Fluorouacil) in&#xD;
      treatment of patients with mismatch repair deficient locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by enhancing the&#xD;
      functional activity of the target lymphocytes (immune cells) to facilitate tumor regression&#xD;
      and ultimately immune rejection. Pembrolizumab in combination with radiation and Capcitabine&#xD;
      (or 5-Fluorouacil) is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for this specific indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and feasibility&#xD;
      of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with capectiabine (or 5-Fluorouracil ) in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with MMR-d locally advanced rectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to determine the treatment response in MMR-d rectal&#xD;
      cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and Pembrolizumab.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment response as measured by pathologic assessment of treatment response using the AJCC TRG following surgical resection.&#xD;
AJCC TRG grading ranges from 0-3:&#xD;
0 (complete response): no viable cancer cells&#xD;
(near complete response): single cells or rare small groups of cancer cells&#xD;
(partial response): residual cancer with evident tumor regression but more than single cells or rare small groups of cancer cells&#xD;
(poor or no response): extensive residual cancer with no evident tumor regression.</description>

The MRI tumor regression grade uses the following scale:&#xD;
No/minimal fibrosis visible (tiny linear scar) and no tumor signal&#xD;
Dense fibrotic scar (low signal intensity) but no macroscopic tumor signal (indicates no or microscopic tumor)&#xD;
Fibrosis predominates but obvious measurable areas of tumor signal visible&#xD;
Tumor signal predominates with little/minimal fibrosis&#xD;
Tumor signal only: no fibrosis, includes progression of tumor</description>
