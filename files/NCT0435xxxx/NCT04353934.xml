  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background/Objectives: Psychological anxiety has been associated with alterations in eating&#xD;
      patterns. The 2020 global coronavirus pandemic has created a situation characterized by&#xD;
      increased anxiety. The present international survey was designed to examine associations&#xD;
      between exposure to quarantine/isolation measures, anxiety levels and changes in dietary&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The present study utilizes a Google Survey platform to conduct an international&#xD;
      survey querrying dietary patterns before vs. after the coronavirus pandemic; anxiety during&#xD;
      the pandemic; and demographic characteristics. The nutrition portion of the survey is based&#xD;
      on the Mediterranean Diet Score while the anxiety estimate is based on the GAD-7. The survey&#xD;
      is available in English, Hebrew, Spanish, Italian, French, Arabic and Russian. It has been&#xD;
      distributed via social media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results: We believe that changes in dietary habits will be identified and that&#xD;
      these will be associated with anxiety levels. Additionally, we believe that by-country&#xD;
      differences will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The Google Survey format distributed by social media provides an almost immediate&#xD;
      means of distributing the survey globally. The survey can only be completed if the respondent&#xD;
      first indicates his/her informed consent. The convenience sample limits generalizability to&#xD;
      individuals who volunteer to complete online surveys; however, we anticipate a large response&#xD;
      which may mitigate this limitation.&#xD;

      The study will leverage the COVID-19 pandemic to study associations between dietary patterns,&#xD;
      weight changes and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study utilizes an online survey, publicized on public and personal social media pages, to&#xD;
      query demographics, dietary and exercise patterns and measures of anxiety. Dietary patterns&#xD;
      are assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score, which evaluates the similarity between&#xD;
      reported dietary intake and the Mediterranen Diet Pattern, which has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Changes in dietary patterns&#xD;
      and duration of exercise during vs. prior to the pandemic are measured. Anxiety is measured&#xD;
      using the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 scale. Additional measures of social isolation,&#xD;
      both prior to and during the pandemic, are queried in the survey. Data are anonymous and&#xD;
      investigators have no ability to associated the response to an individual or IP address.&#xD;
      However, interested respondents can provide an email address to which an analysis of the diet&#xD;
      score can be sent. Data are automatically downloaded to an Excel spreadsheet, and this is&#xD;
      cleaned and uploaded to SPSS for analysis. Continuous data are assessed for normality using&#xD;
      the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and will be summarized using median (IQ range) or mean (sd) as&#xD;
      appropriate. Nominal data will be summarized in frequency tables and presented as n (%).&#xD;
      Associations between the total Mediterranean Diet Score and the GAD-7 will be described by&#xD;
      calculating the Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficient as appropriate. Before vs.&#xD;
      after responses will be evaluated using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test or the McNemar Test.&#xD;
      Differences in responses by demographic characteristics will be measured using the t-test for&#xD;
      independent samples, the Mann-Whitney U or ANOVA as appropriate. The GAD-7 score will be&#xD;
      dichotomized to moderate anxiety or more (GAD-7=10) vs. lower, and modeled using logistic&#xD;
      regression analyisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey format permits real time response to the ongoing pandemic and the multi-lingual&#xD;
      presentation allows for a wide potential population of respondents who can reply in a&#xD;
      language in which they are comfortable. Further, this permits by-language comparisons.&#xD;
