      Chronic headache is a disabling neurologic condition that affects 2-3 % of the general&#xD;
      population. According to Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache&#xD;
      Society, the chronic headache is defined as of at least one headache episode for 15 days a&#xD;
      month, with at least eight days a month on which their headaches and associated symptoms meet&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria. It is a neurologic condition characterized by attacks of headache,&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to visual, auditory, olfactory, and cutaneous stimuli, nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic migraine is common, often affects people during their most productive years of life,&#xD;
      exerts substantial individual and societal costs, and is associated with numerous comorbid&#xD;
      disorders. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has been involved in the development of&#xD;
      chronic headache. In most of cases, IIH and chronic headache have been associated with a&#xD;
      stenosis of the internal jugular vein (IJV). Some studies have shown that IJV compression&#xD;
      aggravates the severity of migraine and has a possible role in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      migraine. Moreover, patients with migraine have less compliant IJV, which makes them&#xD;
      susceptible to cerebral venous hypertension; these veins are more likely to develop and&#xD;
      transmit venous hypertension caused by the increased venous blood volume during IJV&#xD;
      compression. So, it cannot be excluded that an obstruction of the venous blood flow can lead&#xD;
      to an increase in intracranial venous pressure and, consequently, a state of latent&#xD;
      intracranial hypertension which justifies the chronicity of the headache. Moreover, the&#xD;
      absence of alteration of the intracranial venous blood flow and the elevated intracranial&#xD;
      pressure are found in about half of patients with chronic primary headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this, among the risk factors of migraine chronicity, IIH has been evaluated like a&#xD;
      risk factor for headache chronicity to overlap of clinical manifestations, such as persistent&#xD;
      or high frequency headache, allodynia and to share of some factors (female sex, obesity and&#xD;
      sleep disorders) and to the common therapeutic response to topiramate. In patients with&#xD;
      chronic headache and IIH, a stenosis at the junction of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses&#xD;
      has been recognized through venography but, recently, the role of isolated non-thrombotic IJV&#xD;
      stenosis in IIH has gained a vested interest. Recent studies suggest that non-thrombotic&#xD;
      stenosis of IJV may worsen the headache clinical severity, suggesting a possible causative&#xD;
      role in the pathogenesis of chronic headache. It is demonstrated that the intervention of&#xD;
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was associated with a sustained improvement in&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of patients with persistent headaches and concomitant obstructive disease&#xD;
      of the IJV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balloon angioplasty and endovascular stenting of dural venous sinus stenosis in patients with&#xD;
      IIH is a newer and actively debated treatment and has recently gained popularity. Initial&#xD;
      studies indicate that it reduces headache in 60-88% of patients but carries 2% risk for&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, given the promising risk- benefit ratio, these two therapeutics options&#xD;
      have become an accepted treatment modality characterized by a low patency and clinical&#xD;
      improvement rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bavera et a in a prospective investigation involving 366 patients who underwent PTA and were&#xD;
      subsequently interviewed by an independent assessor and followed up for 4 years, found&#xD;
      improvements respectively in 98.6% of patients with headache and in 98.5% of cases with&#xD;
      associated chronic fatigue. This latter symptom was also investigated longitudinally using&#xD;
      two validated scales and an independent non-blinded assessor, who reported significant&#xD;
      improvements one year after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is abundant evidence linking headaches with obstruction of the cerebral&#xD;
      venous drainage pathways suggesting that PTA might be an effective intervention for patients&#xD;
      suffering from persistent headaches. The endovascular treatments of non-thrombotic IJV&#xD;
      stenosis like balloon venoplasty and stenting have been proven to provide a significant&#xD;
      short-term improvement of IIH and related headache and a good efficacy profile with no&#xD;
      immediate increase of risk, but data on long-term outcome are not satisfactory due to the&#xD;
      high rate of recurrence. This suggests that PTA might be a useful intervention for treating&#xD;
      patients with persistent headaches and concomitant obstructive disease of the IJV and that a&#xD;
      more adequate treatment may be more appropriate rather than restenosis or recurrence. Venous&#xD;
      stenting has emerged as an attractive therapy with the potential of addressing the&#xD;
      intracranial pressure elevation-associated clinical issues from etiological level,&#xD;
      particularly after medical failure. The complications of stenting such as ipsilateral&#xD;
      headache, restenosis, intra-stent thrombosis have been demonstrated in the settings of&#xD;
      intracranial sinus obstruction, but very few studies investigated the role and efficacy of&#xD;
      IJV stenting in the treatment of intracranical hypertension and headache. In a recent study,&#xD;
      the investigator found a subset of patients with presumed IIH with isolated IJV stenosis,&#xD;
      which improved significantly their clinical symptoms (headache, tinnitus) after stenting of&#xD;
      the IJV. The current design of stents for the venous system, however, shows improved and&#xD;
      continuous radial force and resistance to compression. The increasing diameter of vessel&#xD;
      toward the heart requires an oversized stent diameter to avoid migration, and this could&#xD;
      determine the loss of the physiological compliance of the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety profile of an innovative venous-oriented&#xD;
      device (Petalo CVS) in the treatment of patients with non-thrombotic internal jugular vein&#xD;
      stenosis and chronic headache resistant to best medical therapy. This innovative device&#xD;
      (Petalo CVS) has already been evaluated in an animal model in a pre-clinical study to test&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy and has been documented a favourable safety profile of Petalo CVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device Petalo CVS has been designed with full consideration of the collapsible nature of&#xD;
      the vein, which is responsible for great variation in venous capacity with little change in&#xD;
      venous pressure. Petalo CVS was developed considering the delicate and elastic properties of&#xD;
      the venous wall. It has a tubular concave shape with 4 support modules joined by transverse&#xD;
      bridges. The modules are oriented longitudinally and extend along the entire length of the&#xD;
      device's body. The concavity of the four modules is oriented toward the vein wall. The&#xD;
      support modules are internally empty, without bridges or other internal elements, to minimize&#xD;
      the metal structure. Two transversal bridges join the support modules in the central part of&#xD;
      the body, leaving the extremity of the modules free and open. The joined bridges enhance the&#xD;
      conformability of the device and reduce the radial force. The concave shape of the support&#xD;
      modules was studied to reduce the contact between the device and vein wall, with the aim of&#xD;
      decreasing inflammatory. In particular, Petalo CVS was evaluated in an animal model. Twelve&#xD;
      healthy pigs weighing 90kg were used to test it. The devices were implanted into the IJVs&#xD;
      using a femoral vein percutaneous approach. The safety profile including the success rate of&#xD;
      device releasing, anchoring, and positioning was evaluated immediately. Fracture, migration,&#xD;
      primary patency, and endothelial response were assessed at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after the&#xD;
      study procedure. A total of 32 devices were successfully released in both IJV. No procedure&#xD;
      -or device- related complications were reported, and all pigs successfully completed the&#xD;
      different scheduled follow-up periods. The primary patency rate was 100%, and no fracture or&#xD;
      migration of the device into the brachiocephalic trunk was reported. Histological examination&#xD;
      revealed only minimal lesions with minimal or absent inflammatory reaction surrounding the&#xD;
      incorporated metallic rods. So, this porcine model study showed a promising safety and&#xD;
      efficacy profile of Petalo CVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This suggests that the particular shape and configuration of this device will assure a low&#xD;
      rate of complications and satisfactory long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of venous stenting of internal jugular vein in patients with chronic headache are not&#xD;
      well known. However, the expertise of the research group in the endovascular procedures and&#xD;
      the shape and configuration of this device will probably determine a low rate of&#xD;
      procedure-related complications. Long-term complications, such as thrombosis of the stent,&#xD;
      are not well known, but the investigator's preliminary data on the animal model are&#xD;
      encouraging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that Petalo CVS promoted only minimal response of the vein wall,&#xD;
      with a primary patency of 100% and the patency of the target veins was maintained without the&#xD;
      need of any specific anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it is possible that not all patients with chronic headache will be suitable for&#xD;
      venous stenting, due to unfavourable anatomy of internal jugular vein. Previous studies&#xD;
      demonstrated that younger patients with transversal endoluminal defects are more likely to&#xD;
      experience a significant improvement in IJV outflow after venous angioplasty, whereas in&#xD;
      older patients with IJV hypoplasia or longitudinal endoluminal defects, angioplasty is likely&#xD;
      to have only a limited effect. In these patients it is likely that venous stenting will have&#xD;
      a limited efficacy and the procedure will be evaluated on a case-by-case analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, it is expected a negligible rate of procedure-related complications such as&#xD;
      collapse and migration to the heart.&#xD;
