  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether daily use of azithromycin will reduce the rate of exacerbations&#xD;
      and improve lung ventilation and perfusion assessed by XE-MRI. The sensitivity of XE-MRI to&#xD;
      detect COPD progression will be compared with standard clinical assessment measures including&#xD;
      standard lung function tests, 6 minute walk test, and patient reported quality of life.&#xD;
