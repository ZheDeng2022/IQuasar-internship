      INTRODUCTION: Patients with a metastatic breast cancer suffer from a deteriorated quality of&#xD;
      life and numerous symptoms such as pain, severe fatigue and a decrease of their physical&#xD;
      fitness. As the feasibility of a physical activity program has been demonstrated in this&#xD;
      population, ABLE02 aims to assess the efficacy of a 6 month-physical activity program based&#xD;
      on connected devices to improve health-related quality of life and to reduce fatigue in women&#xD;
      with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS/ANALYSIS: ABLE02 is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled and,&#xD;
      open-label study. 244 patients with a metastatic breast cancer , at least one positive&#xD;
      hormone receptor and a first-line chemotherapy planned will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio)&#xD;
      to: (i) the intervention arm to receive physical activity recommendations, an activity&#xD;
      tracker to wear 24 hours a day during the whole intervention (6 months) with at least three&#xD;
      walking sessions weekly and quizzes to answer each week on physical activity and nutrition&#xD;
      (ii) the control arm to receive physical activity recommendations only. Assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted at baseline, M3, M6, M12 and M18 to evaluate the clinical, physical, biological and&#xD;
      psychological parameters and survival of participants. All questionnaires will be completed&#xD;
      on a dedicated application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION: An activity program based on smartphone application linked to an activity tracker&#xD;
      may help to improve quality of life and reduce fatigue of patients with a metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer. The growth of e-health offers the opportunity to get real-time data as well as&#xD;
      improving patient empowerment in order to change long-term behaviors.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and fatigue will be measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality Of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30). QLQ-C30 questionnaire consists of 30 items to evaluate 5 functioning domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), a global HRQoL domain, 3 symptom domains (pain, fatigue and nausea) and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, anorexia, diarrhea, constipation and financial impact). Participants will answer to a Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot; and from &quot;very bad&quot; to &quot;excellent&quot; only for the global HRQoL questions. All scores will be standardized to a 0 to 100 scale according to the EORTC scoring manual. Higher scores represent better functioning, better global HRQoL and greater symptom burden.&#xD;
Deterioration is defined as a 5-point decrease relative to baseline in GHS score, with no subsequent increase above this threshold.</description>

    <description>PA level will be measured by the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GSLTPAQ). The GSLTPAQ is a short validated self-administrated physical activity (PA) questionnaire which includes three main questions about frequency of low (e.g., easy walking), moderate (e.g., brisk walking), and strenuous (e.g., jogging) leisure-time PA of at least 15 minutes duration in a typical week. The total score is obtained by multiplying frequencies from mild, moderate and strenuous PA by three, five and nine metabolic equivalents respectively and adding these together. Finally this score is divided into three categories (≥ 24 units is equivalent to mild active; between 14 and 23 units is equivalent to moderately active and &lt; 14 units is equivalent to insufficiently active).</description>

    <description>Perceived sleep quality will be measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) evaluating seven sleep components: (1) sleep quality, (2) sleep latency, (3) sleep duration, (4) habitual sleep efficiency, (5) sleep disturbance, (6) use of sleeping medication, and (7) daytime dysfunction. Each of the seven components is rated on a Likert scale from &quot;Not during last month&quot; (0) to &quot;3 or 4 times per week&quot; (3). The total score resulting from the sum of the seven components ranges from 0 to 21, and a cut off 5 has been found to reflect clinically significant sleep disturbances.&#xD;
The quality of sleep will also be evaluated by the activity tracker based on automatic recognition of total duration of sleep, duration of deep and light sleep per night for the intervention arm only.</description>

    <description>Based on the Five-Factor Model, personality traits will be assessed by the French Big Five Inventory questionnaire (BFI-Fr). The BFI-Fr contains 45 self-descriptive statements that assess the 5 personality traits: neuroticism (which refers to a propensity to experience negative emotions, distress, and anxiety), extraversion (a propensity to be energetic, sociable, and experience positive emotions); openness to experience (the tendency to be curious, imaginative, and to entertain new ideas, values, and experiences); conscientiousness (reflecting self-disciplined, planful, and organized); and agreeableness (which refers to cooperativeness and altruism). Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). All items will be recoded in the direction of the trait label, and the mean will be taken across items for each personality trait.</description>

    <description>The process of change will be evaluated by a validated scale constructs from the transtheoretical model. The process of change scale is a 22-item self-administrated questionnaire to measure eight process of change: self-reevaluation (item 4,8 and 12), reinforcement management (items 7,15 and 12), self-liberation (items 8, 16 and 22), dramatic relief (items 2 and 10), environmental reevaluation (items 3 and 11), counterconditioning (items 5, 13 and 19), helping relationships (items 6, 14 and 20) and consciousness raising (items 1, 9 and 17). Participants will answer to a Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). Items in each process of change will be added and then an average score will be calculated. When the average is ≥ 3, the process of change is activated.</description>

    <description>The cancer-related cognitive impairment will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognition (FACT-Cog). The FACT-Cog is a validated self-administrated questionnaire in order to assess memory, attention, concentration, language, and thinking abilities. The questionnaire is composed of 37 items with four subscales: patients' perceived cognitive impairments, perceived cognitive abilities, deficits observed or commented on by others, and impact of cognitive changes on HRQoL. Participant will answer how often this situation occurred during the last 7 days on a Likert-type scale ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;several times a day&quot;. For both scales, higher scores indicated better perceived cognitive function.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized in the intervention arm will receive recommandations in physical activity. They will also receive an activity tracker Withings Steel to wear during 6 months. The tracker will be connected to the &quot;Withings Health Mate&quot; application and the ABLE02 application. Participants will be encouraged to practice at least three walking sessions weekly of more than 10 consecutive minutes. Concerning the number of steps per day, the first objective will be determined according to the 6-min walking distance and to participants' preferences and capacities. The objective will be recalculated monthly according to the number of steps performed the previous week and will be adapted by the physical activity (PA) instructor and participants. Phone calls with the participants are regularly planned. Weekly quizzes on PA and nutrition will be proposed through the ABLE02 application. A messaging system and a phone line will be available for participants to contact the study team.</description>
