  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GEHPPI study is a multicentre placebo controlled randomized controlled trial that aims to&#xD;
      prevent early hypoglycaemia in preterm newborns born at ≤32 week's gestation. To do this we&#xD;
      will prophylactically administer to these newborns either a small amount of dextrose 40% gel&#xD;
      early as possible after birth via the buccal route in the delivery room or a placebo. We hope&#xD;
      this dextrose gel will prevent hypoglycemia occurring during the time period needed for the&#xD;
      newborns to be transported to the neonatal unit where they will have their venous access&#xD;
      inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to demonstrate that administering dextrose gel via the buccal route is a&#xD;
      simple and rapid method of preventing early hypoglycaemia in this vulnerable patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to show that giving dextrose gel via the buccal route is simple and feasible&#xD;
      in this premature population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to reduce the need for rescue intravenous dextrose (2ml/kg dextrose 10%) in&#xD;
      those babies who are hypoglycaemic at the time of obtaining intravenous access.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fetal glucose homeostasis in-utero has some very important characteristics: Kalhan et al.&#xD;
      showed that from 20 weeks gestation onwards the lower limit for in-utero (foetal) glucose was&#xD;
      3 mmol/L over most of their remaining gestation (Kalhan et al., 1979); Secondly, foetal&#xD;
      glucose control in-utero is completely dependent on maternal plasma glucose control and&#xD;
      maternal insulin secretion (Stanley et al., 2015); Lastly, steady state glucose utilization&#xD;
      rates in term neonates are 4 to 6 mg/min/kg, however at earlier gestational ages (both foetal&#xD;
      and preterm infants) these values are higher 8-9 mg/min/kg (Hay, 2006) indicating that&#xD;
      preterm infants need an early and reliable glucose source at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A local retrospective audit in our Level 3 Neonatal Unit (King et al., 2018) reviewed 90&#xD;
      patients who were born in-house ≤ 32 weeks gestation with birth weight ≤1500g over 12months&#xD;
      in CWIUH (April 2016 - March 2017). Analysis showed that the first blood gas (at the time of&#xD;
      first intravenous insertion) was at median 48mins (IQR 15min) life. Data showed that 30 of 90&#xD;
      patients (33.3%) had hypoglycaemia of &lt;1.8 mmol/L at the time of first intravenous access.&#xD;
      This hypoglycaemia is at a level below an operational threshold (level at which to intervene)&#xD;
      most commonly accepted internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society (2015) are that for high-risk neonates&#xD;
      (without a suspected congenital hypoglycaemia disorder), the goal of treatment is to maintain&#xD;
      a plasma glucose concentration &gt;2.8 mmol/L for those aged &lt; 48hrs (grade 2+ evidence)&#xD;
      (Thornton et al., 2015). However the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Fetus and&#xD;
      Newborn advise that if asymptomatic, intravenous treatment of hypoglycaemia is not needed&#xD;
      until glucose concentrations are &lt; 1.4 mmol/L (within 4hrs after birth) or &lt;2.0 mmol/L (from&#xD;
      4 to 24 h after birth) (Adamkin, 2011). However if symptomatic and blood glucose &lt;2.2 mmol/L&#xD;
      they recommend treating immediately (Adamkin, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding long-term outcomes, in 2006 Boluyt et al. performed the first systematic review of&#xD;
      the evidence for neurodevelopmental impairment following hypoglycaemia in the first week of&#xD;
      life. They felt that none of the 18 eligible studies identified provided a valid estimate of&#xD;
      the effect of neonatal hypoglycaemia on neurodevelopment. The authors provided&#xD;
      recommendations about an optimal study design (Boluyt et al., 2006). In 2018 Shah et al.&#xD;
      performed a systematic review and meta-analysis which included neonates born ≥32 weeks&#xD;
      gestation who had been screened for hypoglycaemia in the 1st week of life. The authors felt&#xD;
      that tests of general development in infancy are unlikely to adequately assess the effects of&#xD;
      neonatal hypoglycaemia on brain development, but instead future studies will require&#xD;
      longer-term end points at least into mid-childhood, including specific tests of visual-motor&#xD;
      and executive function (Shah et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the absence of consensus in the medical literature today, this study's investigators&#xD;
      feel that tackling the problem of early hypoglycaemia in these very/extremely premature&#xD;
      infants will allow a smoother transition from in-utero (foetal) to postnatal (ex-utero)&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis. This may have important long-term neurodevelopmental consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to tackle this problem of early hypoglycemia in these vulnerable newborns. To&#xD;
      do this we will give these newborns a small amount of 40% dextrose gel as early as possible&#xD;
      after birth via the buccal route. They will absorb the gel through the small blood vessels&#xD;
      located on the inside of their cheeks &amp; gums and it will enter their bloodstream quickly. We&#xD;
      hope this gel will prevent hypoglycemia occurring during the time period needed for the&#xD;
      newborns to be transported to the neonatal unit where they will have some form of venous&#xD;
      access inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this research is a trial we want to see if this dextrose gel has this beneficial effect or&#xD;
      not. To do this we need to compare the dextrose gel to a non-sugar containing gel (called the&#xD;
      &quot;placebo&quot;). The placebo gel will contain simple cellulose ingredient but does not contain&#xD;
      sugar and will have no effect on blood glucose. Both gels used in the trial will look&#xD;
      identical in appearance and neither the researcher nor the patient (nor parent/s) will know&#xD;
      whether they received either the dextrose or the placebo gels. Which gel a newborn receives&#xD;
      will be assigned at random, immediately prior to the birth. All newborns will be cared for in&#xD;
      the same way according to best standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborns will not undergo any additional tests as part of the study. Blood glucose levels&#xD;
      will be measured as per standard practice at the time vascular access is obtained. Blood&#xD;
      glucose values will be measured on either a blood gas analyzer or laboratory glucose. Patient&#xD;
      data collected as part of the study will be pseudo-anonymized/ anonymized and stored safely.&#xD;
      Consent for participation can be withdrawn at any time.&#xD;
