  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is 12-week, randomized, open-label study comparing injectable extended-release&#xD;
      buprenorphine (Sublocade) to standard therapy (sublingual buprenorphine), to see if Sublocade&#xD;
      will be more helpful in treating opiate use for individuals testing positive for fentanyl and&#xD;
      related high potency drugs (HPSO). Those receiving Sublocade will have it administered&#xD;
      monthly and dosing will be according to the FDA prescribing instructions of 300mg for the&#xD;
      first and second dose and 100mg for the third. Individuals receiving sublingual buprenorphine&#xD;
      will receive standard dosing for the entire treatment trial. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      attend the clinic for the first 4 days during week 1 and twice weekly for the remainder of&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Outpatients seeking treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) will be screened, and those&#xD;
      eligible and consenting will be randomized (n=40) to either buprenorphine extended-release&#xD;
      (BXR, Sublocade) or sublingual buprenorphine (BSL). Randomization will occur in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      immediately prior to starting the induction process. The primary hypothesis is that BXR&#xD;
      treatment will significantly reduce opioid use as compared to BSL. This is a 12 week&#xD;
      outpatient trial during which participants will be asked to come into the clinic for the&#xD;
      first 4 days of week 1 and then twice weekly there after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For buprenorphine to be safely administered, participants must be in withdrawal from opioids.&#xD;
      Individuals will be instructed to abstain from opioids starting at consent and will usually&#xD;
      begin buprenorphine medication within 24 hours of consent. Because HPSO use may lead to a&#xD;
      delayed onset of opioid withdrawal syndrome, the first day that buprenorphine is administered&#xD;
      may not be up to three days after a participants last opioid use. Whichever day the first&#xD;
      dose of BSL is administered will be considered the first day of the induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BXR Injection group. There are two dosing schemes for the BXR induction as outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) If on any day of the buprenorphine induction a participant demonstrates a high tolerance&#xD;
      to buprenorphine by tolerating 24 mg buprenorphine SL in one day, BXR 300 mg may be&#xD;
      administered on that study day. This includes participants who on the first day of SL&#xD;
      buprenorphine administration tolerate 24 mg. b) If a patient is able to tolerate 16 mg of&#xD;
      buprenorphine SL for 2 consecutive days of the induction, BXR 300 mg will be given on the&#xD;
      second consecutive day of receiving buprenorphine SL 16 mg. The second injection of BXR 300&#xD;
      mg will be administered approximately 28 days later. The third BXR injection will occur&#xD;
      approximately 28 days subsequent to the second injection at a dose of 100 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance BSL treatment group: Once a participant is able to be stabilized on 16 mg to 24&#xD;
      mg per day during induction they will continue to receive buprenorphine in doses up to 24 mg&#xD;
      administered once daily. Dose adjustments for craving/withdrawal/adverse effects will be made&#xD;
      by the research psychiatrist. Medication will be dispensed on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both study arms participants will be given comfort medications to help manage their&#xD;
      withdrawal for the first two weeks of the treatment study as needed. Comfort medications&#xD;
      prescribed will be clonidine, clonazepam, prochlorperazine, and zolpidem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant is not in adequate withdrawal to be able to start sublingual buprenorphine&#xD;
      (i.e., they continue to use once enrolled), they will have up to 10 days to initiate the&#xD;
      induction for either arm of the study. If a participant is unable to start sublingual&#xD;
      buprenorphine within 10 days of signing consent they will be considered an induction fail and&#xD;
      will be provided referrals for other treatment options noted in the discontinuation section&#xD;
      of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, patients will be seen by the Research Nurse and Research Assistant for&#xD;
      assessment of vital signs, side effects and adverse events, collection of urine for&#xD;
      toxicology, and research assessments. The research psychiatrist will conduct weekly&#xD;
      assessments of the psychiatric and medical status of the study participants. All participants&#xD;
      will have a manual-guided supportive behavioral treatment session with the research&#xD;
      psychiatrist each week. This psychosocial intervention facilitates compliance with study&#xD;
      medication and other study procedures, promotes abstinence from opioids and other substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-study Assessments and Clinical Follow up: At week 12 (or earlier if the patient is&#xD;
      discontinued from the study for clinical reasons or drops out) participants will be provided&#xD;
      with clinical referrals for continuation of treatment. Post-study participants will be seen&#xD;
      weekly for up to 4 weeks while continuing treatment with buprenorphine. Referrals will be&#xD;
      arranged during this period for patients to continue buprenorphine or other appropriate&#xD;
      treatment at community-based treatment programs.&#xD;
