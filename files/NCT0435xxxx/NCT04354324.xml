      Primary objective: The 3-years disease-free survival was compared between low-dose group (30&#xD;
      mCi) and high-dose group (100 mCi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: The successful remnant ablation, efficacy, 3-year progression-free&#xD;
      survival and safety were compared between low-dose group (30 mCi) and high-dose group (100&#xD;
      mCi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis：The 3-year disease-free survival of low-dose group (30mci) may not be&#xD;
      lower than that of high-dose group (100 mci) in intermediate-risk thyroid papillary carcinoma&#xD;
      patients with no structural or functional lesions and stimulated&#xD;
      thyroglobulin(ps-Tg)1-20ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design：Single-center, randomized, double-blinded Sample size：254 patients Follow-up：The&#xD;
      measurement of serum thyroid function, thyroglobulin/ anti-thyroglobulin antibody(Tg/TgAb)&#xD;
      and neck ultrasonography were performed every 3-12 months during the 3 years according to&#xD;
      patients' condition, and computerized tomography(CT) scan, positron emission&#xD;
      tomography/computed tomography(PET/CT) and diagnostic whole-body 131I scan were added if&#xD;
      necessary. Intervention：Randomly allocated into two groups to receive either 30 mCi (low-dose&#xD;
      group) or 100 mCi (high-dose group ) radioiodine for post-thyroidectomy ablation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation index：Primary evaluation index: The 3-year disease-free survival. Secondary&#xD;
      evaluation index: Successful remnant ablation, efficacy, the 3-year progression-free survival&#xD;
      and safety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intermediate risk papillary thyroid carcinoma(PTC) patients with no structural and functional&#xD;
      lesions and stimulated thyroglobulin( s-Tg) 1-20ng/ml were randomly divided into low-dose&#xD;
      group (30 mCi) and high-dose group (100 mCi). The 3-years disease-free survival was compared&#xD;
      between two groups.The successful remnant ablation, efficacy, 3-year progression-free&#xD;
      survival and safety (short-term and long-term adverse reactions) were compared between two&#xD;
      groups (30mci, 100mci).The 3-year disease-free survival of low-dose group (30mci) may not be&#xD;
      lower than that of high-dose group (100mci) in intermediate-risk thyroid papillary carcinoma&#xD;
      patients with no structural or functional lesions and stimulated thyroglobulin 1-20ng/ml.This&#xD;
      study is a single-center, randomized, double-blind parallel controlled study initiated by&#xD;
      Southern Medical University. The follow-up period was 3 years.The study was divided into two&#xD;
      groups: the test group (30mci) and the control group (100mci). And the subjects were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the test group or the control group. This study is a double-blind trial. The&#xD;
      specification of the outer packaging of the control drug is the same as that of the test&#xD;
      drug, and the subjects are blinded. According to literature reports and pre-clinical data,&#xD;
      the disease-free survival of the control group was 92%, non-inferiority cutoff value was δ =&#xD;
      7%, A total of 254 subjects are generated from a=0. 025 (one-sided test), Power=0.8,&#xD;
      proportion=0.5(control group) and lost rate =10% (two groups) by Power Analysis and Sample&#xD;
      Size(PASS) software. Patients admitted to the department for 131I therapy are recruited by&#xD;
      means of propaganda, science popularization and so on. A total of 254 patients with PTC were&#xD;
      enrolled in the study which was conducted in the Nuclear Medicine Department, Zhujiang&#xD;
      Hospital of Southern Medical University from June 2019 to June 2024. The test group: low&#xD;
      dosage (30mci).The control group: high dosage (100mci).The name, appearance and packaging of&#xD;
      the test group and the control group are the same, the dosage forms are different, but&#xD;
      participants can be made into the same volume. Therefore, the products of two groups can not&#xD;
      be distinguished with the naked eye but measuring instruments. Subjects must be screened&#xD;
      within one week before random enrollment. The informed consent of the patient will be&#xD;
      obtained after a detailed explanation of the study to each subject and before any screening&#xD;
      process or evaluation.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Data management The original medical records and Case report form（CRF） should be truthfully&#xD;
      and carefully recorded as required, and the contents should not be changed easily once filled&#xD;
      in. In case of any error, the original record shall not be altered, but shall be supplemented&#xD;
      by an additional statement, signed and dated by the physician in charge. All the observed&#xD;
      results and abnormal findings in clinical trials should be verified and recorded in time to&#xD;
      ensure the reliability of the data. All kinds of instruments, equipment, practice, standard&#xD;
      products and so on used in various inspection items in clinical trials should have strict&#xD;
      quality standards and ensure that they are working in normal condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be programmed with computer software for double input. During this period, the&#xD;
      question form will be forwarded to the researcher for data review through the clinical&#xD;
      inspector, who should answer and return as soon as possible. The data will be locked by the&#xD;
      lead researcher, the applicant, the statistician and the drug supervisor after the blind&#xD;
      state audit and think that the established database is correct. No further changes are&#xD;
      allowed in the locked data file. The database will be submitted for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Statistical software: Statistical Analysis System（SAS）9.4 statistical software is used&#xD;
           for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Basic principle: All statistical inferences are performed by two-sided test. The&#xD;
           statistically significant test level is set to 0.05, and the confidence interval of the&#xD;
           parameters is estimated to be 95% confidence interval. Use the parametric method as much&#xD;
           as possible. When the data does not meet the conditions of the parameter method, it can&#xD;
           be analyzed by conversion method. If it is still not satisfied, consider using a&#xD;
           non-parametric method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Missing data: The integrity of the data is monitored in real time. If the patient is&#xD;
           found not to be followed up in time, he will be notified by phone and the data will be&#xD;
           filled in time. Withdrawal subjects do not fill in the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Abnormal data: analysis of causes, exclusion of objective and subjective reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Descriptive statistics: The mean number, standard deviation and confidence interval are&#xD;
           given in the measurement data. The minimum value, maximum value, P25, median, and P75&#xD;
           are given if necessary; the mean and standard deviation of the difference are given for&#xD;
           the paired measurement data; and the median and average rank are given when the&#xD;
           non-parametric method is used. The frequency distribution and the corresponding&#xD;
           percentage are given by counting data. The frequency distribution and the corresponding&#xD;
           percentage, as well as the median number and the average rank, are given. The positive&#xD;
           rate, positive number and denominator number are given by qualitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. analysis of baseline data: descriptive analysis of baseline data (including demographic&#xD;
           indicators, etc.).&#xD;
