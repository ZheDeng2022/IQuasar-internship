      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mosquito-borne viruses like dengue cause major illness and death worldwide, particularly in&#xD;
      Southeast Asia. When mosquitoes deliver a virus into the skin of humans, they also leave&#xD;
      saliva. Researchers want to learn more about skin immunity to mosquito saliva. They hope this&#xD;
      will help with future vaccines and treatments for these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the early and late innate immune response in the skin of Aedes aegypti bitten&#xD;
      versus unbitten skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18-45 who live within about 15 km of the study site in Chbar Mon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline/screening visit will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and medication history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about participants demographic information, mosquito biting risk factors, and&#xD;
      responses to mosquito or other insect bites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sample for some participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mosquito feeding. A feeding device will be placed on the participant s arm for up to 20&#xD;
      minutes. The insects will feed through a mesh on the bottom of the feeding device.&#xD;
      Participants may be given standard treatments for any skin reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four skin biopsies taken from bitten and unbitten skin. Local anesthetic will be&#xD;
      administered, and a small tool will be used to remove the participant s skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a second visit the next day. They will have a physical exam and blood&#xD;
      tests. They will have 1 skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a final visit about 2 weeks later. They will have a physical exam and&#xD;
      blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will be asked to take measures to prevent more mosquito bites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mosquito-borne viruses continue to cause significant global morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      particularly in Southeast Asia. When mosquitoes deliver the virus into the skin of humans&#xD;
      while probing for a blood meal, they deposit also saliva, which contains a myriad of&#xD;
      pharmacologically active compounds that modulate the host immune system. Little is known&#xD;
      about skin immunity to mosquito saliva, particularly in endemic volunteers as most clinical&#xD;
      studies are performed in na(SqrRoot) ve individuals who have never or rarely been exposed to&#xD;
      a particular mosquito vector. People living in endemic areas have had long-term repeated&#xD;
      exposure to these vectors and therefore have different immune response to mosquito saliva,&#xD;
      which could interfere with mosquito-borne disease vaccine effectiveness. Characterization of&#xD;
      skin immunity via various technical modalities will be important in order to identify&#xD;
      critical aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses after a vector bite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we will execute a paired study of exposed-unexposed skin to carefully examine the&#xD;
      innate and adaptive immune responses in the skin and blood to exposure of the saliva of Aedes&#xD;
      aegypti, the mosquito vector of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. We will enroll 42&#xD;
      participants to undergo vector feeding and give blood samples at baseline and 2 and 14 days&#xD;
      later. Additionally, participants will give skin punch biopsy samples of bitten (exposed) and&#xD;
      unbitten (unexposed) skin. For analysis, we will group 10-12 participants in each of 4&#xD;
      technical modality cohorts or groups : 1) immunohistochemistry, 2) RNA sequencing, 3) flow&#xD;
      cytometry, and 4) T-cell receptor sequencing. With the current rise of vector-borne diseases&#xD;
      in the United States and around the world, we hope the results of this study contribute to&#xD;
      future vaccine design and clinical development strategies for vector#borne diseases.&#xD;
