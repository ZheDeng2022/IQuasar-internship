    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the effects of topical lovastatin/cholesterol vs topical lovastatin&#xD;
      alone in patients with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis. Patients will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups, topical lovastatin/cholesterol and topical lovastatin alone.&#xD;
      Patients will apply topical treatment twice daily to lesions over the course of 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Follow up will occur in the virtual setting and photographs will be used to document&#xD;
      progress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cholesterol/lovastatin versus&#xD;
      lovastatin alone to treat porokeratosis. Our working hypothesis is that both topical&#xD;
      cholesterol/lovastatin and lovastatin alone are helpful in treating patients with&#xD;
      disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP). Potential subjects will be approached&#xD;
      by their care team member to be made aware of the study at MUSC Dermatology clinics.&#xD;
      Subsequently, members of the study team will approach their own patients to ask for&#xD;
      participation in this study. Pertinent project information, risks, and time commitment will&#xD;
      be relayed to subjects. If subjects show interest in participating, they will be given&#xD;
      consent forms to either sign or bring home for consideration. If the patient is eligible for&#xD;
      the study, he or she will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. They will have a 50/50&#xD;
      chance of being in either group. You will not make the choice to which group you are&#xD;
      assigned. The two groups are Group A (cholesterol/lovastatin) and Group B (lovastatin only).&#xD;
      The patient will not be informed of which group they are in and will not be informed of what&#xD;
      their study medication is, allowing single-blinding. Researchers will not be masked. Initial&#xD;
      enrollment will occur virtually. Enrolled subjects will be followed up at monthly intervals&#xD;
      for three months via virtual check-in. At each visit, participants will undergo brief&#xD;
      physical examination; additionally, clinical photographs of the lesion will be obtained.&#xD;
      Photographs will be stored in the electronic medical record and stored in a departmental&#xD;
      secure drive for further analysis of lesion features. At each visit the novel DSAP- General&#xD;
      Assessment Scale and RAND36 QoL scale will be administered. Patients will be contacted via&#xD;
      virtual check-in visits at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Patients will be asked about compliance and&#xD;
      any adverse effects experienced. Participants will also be contacted by phone by study team&#xD;
      member to assess for any adverse effects at weeks 2 and 6 of treatment. Compounded topical&#xD;
      medication prescribed to subjects will be self-applied twice daily. These medications will be&#xD;
      prepared by Tide Water Pharmacy Charleston, SC and Chemistry RX Philadelphia, PA. Chemistry&#xD;
      Rx will ship the medications to the patients. They will be prepared so the study will remain&#xD;
      single-blinded. The associated costs will not be covered by the research budget. Dermoscopic&#xD;
      and clinical photographs will be subsequently analyzed for the presence of cornoid lamella.&#xD;
      The team will record any additional dermoscopic or clinicals feature that may arise during&#xD;
      the analyses. Frequency of dermoscopic and clinical features will be analyzed against&#xD;
      clinical involution to find possible predictors.&#xD;

    <measure>Physician Global Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The physician global assessment scale uses a grading system of 0-4 (clear-severe) to visually and clinically describe the patient's lesion. A higher score would indicate a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Actinic Keratosis Field Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Actinic Keratosis Field Assessment Scale measures the percent area covered by actinic keratosis on a scale of 0-4 (0 being 0% and 4 being &gt;50% total area on face or scalp), the severity of hyperkeratosis based upon size of lesion and degree of hyperkeratosis (considered positive findings if &gt;1 actinic keratosis with significant hyperkeratosis and &gt;5mm in diameter), and sun damage severity, measured positive (moderate or severe sun damage) or negative (none or mild damage), based upon severity of erythema, telangiectasia, inflammation, atrophy, and pigmentation disorders. This will be used to determine skin changes (described above) during treatment. A higher score would indicate a worse outcome.</description>
