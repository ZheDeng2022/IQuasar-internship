      INTRODUCTION: The complexity of the pathophysiology of heterogeneous diseases such as heart&#xD;
      failure and obstructive pulmonary disease causes a different approach to these diseases or&#xD;
      with a view as much as a better understanding of the same situations, with which the clinical&#xD;
      profile of patients who are associated with an association is. It is known that regular&#xD;
      physical training promotes progressive improvements in exercise tolerance, in the pulmonary&#xD;
      ventilation / perfusion ratio and in respiratory function by strengthening. OBJECTIVE: To&#xD;
      compare the effects of high-intensity interval training and continuous aerobic exercise, with&#xD;
      peripheral endothelial function, brain natriuretic peptide levels, maximum exercise&#xD;
      tolerance, distribution of lung volumes and quality of life of patients with obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease associated with heart failure. METHODS: This is a clinical, controlled,&#xD;
      randomized and blinded trial. Peripheral endothelial function, tolerance to maximum and&#xD;
      submaximal exercise, distribution of lung volumes, quality of life, presence of symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and perception of clinical change will be evaluated. EXPECTED RESULTS: Incorporate&#xD;
      into the care of these patients, new effective therapeutic approaches, of low cost and with&#xD;
      greater technical and scientific evidence.&#xD;
