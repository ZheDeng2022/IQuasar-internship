    <textblock>
      The MitraClip System is the first commercially available catheter-based option for the&#xD;
      treatment of MR. The MitraClip System was developed as an alternate percutaneous technology&#xD;
      which may serve as a viable therapeutic option for patients at high risk for open-heart&#xD;
      surgery. Treatment with the MitraClip device allows patients to undergo a less invasive&#xD;
      procedure that can mechanistically reduce MR and allow for improved quality of life. The&#xD;
      MitraClip procedure is performed under general anesthesia without the use of a heart-lung&#xD;
      machine, with recovery typically lasting two to three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of the MitraClip NT&#xD;
      procedure in the Russian population for treatment of Mitral Regurgitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common heart valve condition in the world. MR occurs&#xD;
      when the mitral valve does not close properly, allowing blood to leak back into the upper&#xD;
      chamber of the heart. As a result, the heart may try to pump harder in order to compensate&#xD;
      for the decrease in blood flow to the rest of the body. Patients with severe MR suffer from&#xD;
      debilitating symptoms such as shortness of breath, heart palpitations, lightheadedness, and&#xD;
      fatigue. These patients are at risk of poor quality of life, marked limitation in activity,&#xD;
      repeated heart failure hospitalizations, and increased mortality. Chronic severe MR is often&#xD;
      associated with heart failure and can lead to death if left untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While mitral valve repair or replacement surgery is currently regarded as standard of care,&#xD;
      many patients with clinically significant MR are at an unacceptable risk of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and are therefore not appropriate surgical candidates. To optimize afterload&#xD;
      reduction and treatment of fluid load, these patients are often treated with medical&#xD;
      management (i.e., beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers) which may&#xD;
      relieve MR symptoms, but does not address the underlying cause of the condition. As a result,&#xD;
      a significant portion of patients treated medically continue to progress to heart failure and&#xD;
      experience an increasingly debilitating quality of life. A significant unmet clinical need&#xD;
      thus exists for the treatment of moderate-to-severe and severe MR in high surgical risk&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MitraClip System has been in clinical use for treatment of significant MR since 2003. The&#xD;
      device received CE (Conformité Européenne) Mark for both DMR and FMR indications in March&#xD;
      2008 and was approved by FDA for DMR indication in October 2013 and for FMR indication in&#xD;
      March 2019. The system is approved for use in more than 80 countries or regions. More than&#xD;
      80,000 patients have undergone the MitraClip procedure worldwide, with the majority of&#xD;
      experience in high surgical risk patients.&#xD;
