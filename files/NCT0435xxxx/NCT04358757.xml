  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy results in an altered immune state compared to the nonpregnant population. A&#xD;
      significant proportion of women undergoing cesarean delivery recover poorly. The first step&#xD;
      to determining whether this is an immune driven / associated process is to characterise what&#xD;
      effects this surgery has on maternal immune function. &quot;Normal&quot; changes will be evaluated in&#xD;
      maternal immune function and activity precipitated by surgery and delivery of the neonate.&#xD;
      Immune response to surgery will be compared to historical immune data from patients&#xD;
      undergoing non-obstetric surgery (orthopaedic patients).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Variations will be evaluated in baseline and postpartum leukocyte subset distribution and&#xD;
      singling pathways within leukocyte subsets (including response to surgery) in women&#xD;
      undergoing elective cesarean delivery compare to patients undergoing nonobstetric surgery&#xD;
      (orthopaedic data from a completed study). This will help to determine whether baseline&#xD;
      immune function and response to trauma (surgery) is the same in the pregnant and non-pregnant&#xD;
      states. Women will also be evaluated for clinical recovery parameters using validated scoring&#xD;
      measures and objective measurement of physical activity through use of a smartwatch&#xD;
      (actigraph) around the peripartum period. This information is of significant importance as it&#xD;
      brings us one step closer to identifying immune mechanisms that may be involved in or&#xD;
      associated with poorer postpartum recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim- to determine whether perioperative immune function can predict women who are likely to&#xD;
      have delayed physical recovery or recover poorly as demonstrated by lower scores on&#xD;
      subjective clinical questionnaires and collected via watch actigraphy. This will help to&#xD;
      determine whether a pre-existing deficient immune state is responsible for a worse recovery&#xD;
      profile, which could be identified preoperatively. Similarly whether an impairment in&#xD;
      response to surgery is demonstrable, which predisposes women to worse recovery profiles will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, earlier identification of at-risk parturients (for example, through a&#xD;
      preoperative bedside test) may lead to earlier interventions / patient centred care, in an&#xD;
      attempt to improve their recovery trajectory and patient experience.&#xD;
