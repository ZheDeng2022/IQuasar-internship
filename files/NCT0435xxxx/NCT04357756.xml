  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of YH001 administered intravenously (IV) in&#xD;
      combination with Toripalimab. The study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of YH001 when administered in&#xD;
      combination with Toripalimab to subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will have a run-in phase to explore the safety and tolerability of YH001 as a&#xD;
      single agent for 21 days as DLT observation period then followed by a combination phase to&#xD;
      further explore the safety and tolerability of YH001 combined with Toripalimab (anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody) for each dose level during dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation will follow the traditional &quot;3 + 3&quot; dose escalation scheme. These&#xD;
      subjects will be treated with YH001 and Toripalimab. YH001 will be administered intravenously&#xD;
      every three weeks (Q3W) for 15 weeks (5 cycles) at doses of Dose A, Dose B, Dose C, Dose D,&#xD;
      Dose E, Dose F and Dose G. Toripalimab will be administered by IV (Q3W) by the fixed dose of&#xD;
      240 mg from the 2nd cycle to 5th cycle. A single subject will be enrolled at Dose A as&#xD;
      starting dose of YH001, and subsequent cohort will be expanded to include 3-6 subjects.&#xD;
