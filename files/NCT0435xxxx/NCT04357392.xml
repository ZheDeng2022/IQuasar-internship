  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic patients who have long-term insulin used can product antibody against exogenous&#xD;
      insulin, the investigators named this condition Exogenous insulin antibody syndrome (EIAs).&#xD;
      Exogenous insulin antibody can cause blood glucose fluctuation, high blood glucose and&#xD;
      refractory hypoglycemia, and have a serious impact on the health of diabetic patients. After&#xD;
      adding glucocorticoid, some EIAs patients can reduce insulin dosage, correct hypoglycemia,&#xD;
      even eliminate insulin antibody in about half a year, and achieve the goal of blood glucose&#xD;
      stability. But up to now, there is no study to evaluate the improvement of blood glucose by&#xD;
      glucocorticoid intervention in EIAS patients receiving insulin therapy. This project plans to&#xD;
      collect 20 cases of EIAS and carry out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial to evaluate the improvement of blood glucose by glucocorticoid intervention.&#xD;

      Diabetic patients who have long-term insulin used can product antibody against exogenous&#xD;
      insulin, the investigators named this condition Exogenous insulin antibody syndrome&#xD;
      (EIAs).Exogenous insulin antibody can lead to serious clinical consequences , such as blood&#xD;
      glucose fluctuations, high blood glucose and refractory hypoglycemia, which is not only&#xD;
      affect patients' blood glucose control, but also have a serious impact on the health of&#xD;
      diabetic patients. Change to the oral antidiabetic drugs, change the insulin type or add&#xD;
      glucocorticoids to the patients with serious disease are the main treatments. However, most&#xD;
      of these treatment schemes are case reports, and there is no randomized controlled cohort&#xD;
      study on the treatment scheme. The biosynthetic human insulin sequence is exactly the same as&#xD;
      that of human insulin. Why do some diabetics have insulin antibody? The investigators&#xD;
      speculated that insulin antibody production in some patients with EIAs is related to&#xD;
      autoimmune disorder. After adding glucocorticoid, some EIAs patients can reduce insulin&#xD;
      dosage, correct hypoglycemia, even eliminate insulin antibody in about half a year, and&#xD;
      achieve the goal of blood glucose stability. However, there is no study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of glucocorticoid intervention on the improvement of blood glucose in the EIAs&#xD;
      population. This project plans to collect 20 cases of EIAs and carry out a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the improvement of blood glucose&#xD;
      by glucocorticoid intervention, so as to provide scientific basis for the standardized&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of EIAs.&#xD;
