      This study aims to test the impact of different types of liomyoma on Darwish test&#xD;
      (hysteroscopic bubble suction test and tubal peristalsis of Darwish triad ) in women&#xD;
      subjected to postmenstrual combined laparoscopy and hysteroscopy.&#xD;

      It will include infertile women planned for combined laparoscopy and hysteroscopy as an&#xD;
      integral part of infertility wok-up. Preoperative counseling of all patients followed by an&#xD;
      informed written consent taken from those who will agree. The included patients subjected to&#xD;
      complete history taking and meticulous physical examination. A suspected pregnancy, active&#xD;
      pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), severe co-morbidity, e.g., severe cardiac, neurologic, or&#xD;
      chest disease, and other medical contraindications to pregnancy will be exclusion criteria of&#xD;
      this study. All cases should have basic TVS examination, normal husband's semen analysis, and&#xD;
      a recent HSG. Basic TVs should comment on any uterine pathology . If a uterine myoma is seen&#xD;
      with its characteristic hypoechoic, but can be isoechoic, or even hyperechoic shadow compared&#xD;
      to normal myometrium. Calcification is seen as echogenic foci with posterior shadowing.&#xD;
      Cystic areas of necrosis or degeneration may be seen. Definition of the number, site and&#xD;
      proximity to corneal ends of the uterus should be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation based on our previous study on the prevalence of tubal patency using&#xD;
      bubble suction test in infertility patients with normal FT (5). The percentage of agreement&#xD;
      between office hysteroscopy and diagnostic laparoscopy will be 92% and 88% for the right and&#xD;
      left tubes respectively. If it is supposed that bubble suction test would be positive in&#xD;
      about 90% of apparently normal FT and it would be positive in about 60% of cases with&#xD;
      liomyomata, sample size in each group would be 51 cases needed to have a confidence level of&#xD;
      95% with α error of 0.05 (the real value is within ±5% of the measured/surveyed value).&#xD;
      Eligible women will subjected to combined laparoscopy and hysteroscopy essentially&#xD;
      postmenstrual. Since this study will include infertility patients consenting for all options&#xD;
      of endoscopic management of any infertility problem, a decision of general anesthesia will be&#xD;
      made in all cases. The abdomen, vulva, vagina and the thighs will be disinfected with a 10%&#xD;
      povidone-iodine solution. Sterile draping will be applied. The procedure started by a&#xD;
      standard double puncture laparoscopy to search for any possible cause of infertility. An&#xD;
      additional auxiliary portal will be made whenever a therapeutic procedure is needed. After&#xD;
      completion of laparoscopic procedures to enhance fertility like myomectomy, adhesiolysis or&#xD;
      management of endometriosis, tubal perchromation test using methylene blue dye will be done&#xD;
      with comment on tubal patency in both sides. FT length, integrity, size, external surface and&#xD;
      fimbriae will be reported bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, conventional diagnostic hysteroscopy will be performed using a 4mm 30° rigid&#xD;
      scope with a 5mm outer sheath (Karl Storz, Tutlingen, Germany), and the uterus will be&#xD;
      distended with normal saline at 100-150 mmHg generated from a pneumatic cuff of&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer wrapped around the 500-cm3 infusion bottle. As attached to a 250-W Xenon&#xD;
      light source, the scope will be introduced gently through the cervical canal and internal os&#xD;
      as previously described (5). To perfectly perform hysteroscopic tubal patency testing the&#xD;
      following tricks should be followed. Clear view of the endometrial cavity should be achieved&#xD;
      on panoramic view by placing the hysteroscope at internal os waiting for a while to achieve&#xD;
      homogenous distension. The uterine cavity should be systematically examined starting by its&#xD;
      anterior and posterior walls, the fundus, and the borders. Examination will be considered&#xD;
      complete if the both tubal ostia will be reached describing any gross pathology, e.g.,&#xD;
      septum, adhesions, polyp, myoma, and growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the uterus appears externally and internally normal , the patient allocated as group A. If&#xD;
      there is one or more liomyomata the patient allocated as group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prerequisites for a successful access to evaluate tubal patency include utilization of a 300&#xD;
      telescope with gaining skill of its rotation to reach both cornea and most importantly&#xD;
      orientation with a fundamental anatomic triad (Darwish triad) (DT). The most proximal corneal&#xD;
      fine wide circle is the ostium (the end of the endometrial cavity) representing a base of a&#xD;
      cone which is followed by a shallow conical groove (the first millimeters of the intramural&#xD;
      part of FT). Finally, a distal pinhole dark spot (the narrowest part of the FT) representing&#xD;
      the tip of the cone. Putting DT (ostium, intramural part and dark spot) in mind is the key&#xD;
      step to evaluate tubal patency and physiology via hysteroscopy. If DT is clearly accessible,&#xD;
      the hysteroscopist should comment on this. If there are some osteal lesions like tiny polypi&#xD;
      or fine adhesions (figure 3, video 2) that may hinder proper evaluation of the tubal anatomy&#xD;
      and physiology, the hysteroscopist should notice and document. Passage of any air bubbles in&#xD;
      the irrigating fluid towards DT is reported. If no observed air bubbles, the hysteroscopist&#xD;
      should inject just 2 ml of air into the rubber end of the sterile infusion set. Hysteroscopic&#xD;
      bubble suction test is considered positive if air bubbles are sucked by DT within 1 min.&#xD;
      During this period, neither injection of air nor increased pressure will be done. If no&#xD;
      suction of gas bubbles occurred, the examiner should wait for 1 min more to exclude tubal&#xD;
      spasm. Again, if no suction of the bubbles by DT and their accumulation at the corneal end,&#xD;
      the test will be considered negative (figure 4). Simultaneously, careful visualization of any&#xD;
      change in the shape of the ostium and intramural part of FT particularly during suction of&#xD;
      the air bubbles will be recorded in all cases. Tubal peristalsis is defined as observed&#xD;
      osteal and intramural tubal rhythmic opening and closing on maintained intrauterine pressure,&#xD;
      i.e., periodic changes of DT in the form of widening followed by collapse on meticulous&#xD;
      observation. If the ostium and intramural part of the tube is obviously opened followed by&#xD;
      collapse and non-visualization of the pinhole dark spot of DT for a while, positive&#xD;
      peristalsis will be reported. The same steps repeated on the contralateral side and reported.&#xD;
