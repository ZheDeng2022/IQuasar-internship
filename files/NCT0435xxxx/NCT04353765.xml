  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To understand the epidemiology, treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC). Data from mRCC patients who received cabozantinib versus&#xD;
      non-cabozantinib Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) (a type of targeted cancer drug) immediately&#xD;
      after Check Point Inhibitor (CPI) treatment (a type of immunotherapy that blocks proteins&#xD;
      that stop the immune system from attacking the cancer cells) in US community oncology&#xD;
      practices will be analyzed.&#xD;
