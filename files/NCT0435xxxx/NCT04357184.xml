  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle weakness or atrophy is a common condition following acute and chronic musculoskeletal&#xD;
      injuries. Strength training is an imperative component in clinical rehabilitation of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injuries. Heavy exercise loads (approximately 70% of one repetition maximum)&#xD;
      is necessary to elicit muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. However, patients with severe&#xD;
      muscle atrophy are frequently unable to tolerate these loads due to pain. Blood flow&#xD;
      resistance training with low resistance loads may be used to safely develop muscle strength.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a safe type of low intensity resistance exercise&#xD;
      that has demonstrated enhanced muscle growth, muscle strength, oxygen delivery and&#xD;
      utilization (VO2Max). With BFRT, lighter loads can be used to build muscle while sparing the&#xD;
      joints from heavy loading and without overly fatiguing the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of BFRT are 1) to increase the effectiveness of physical therapy, 2) safely&#xD;
      increase muscle mass, reduce arterial stiffness, increase bone density, increase Vo2Max,&#xD;
      improve carotid arterial compliance and enhance response of the autonomic nervous system, 3)&#xD;
      improve muscle endurance in 1/3 the time, improve strength and hypertrophy after surgery,&#xD;
      improve muscle recruitment and increase anabolic growth signaling.&#xD;

    <description>Blood flow resistance training will be performed with a standard blood pressure cuff that is placed and inflated by a clinician. The patient will perform 4 exercises with low resistance loads that will produce a muscle burn to enhance promotion of strength. Training will be supervised in the clinic. The cuff is deflated between exercises.</description>
