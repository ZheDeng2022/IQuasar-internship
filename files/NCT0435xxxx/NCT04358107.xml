      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare cancer. It has a poor prognosis. Some people live&#xD;
      with ACC for years; others live for just months. The average survival from the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis is 14.5 months. Researchers do not know if local directed treatments may work&#xD;
      better than systemic ones. They want to learn more about ACC by looking at data from previous&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the overall prognosis and treatment responses in people with ACC with various&#xD;
      systemic therapies and correlate them with age, sex, race, and disease burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with ACC enrolled on any of the following studies: 92-C-0268, 93-C-0200, 00-C-0044,&#xD;
      01-C-0129, 04-C-0011, 09-C-0242, 08-C-0176, 10-C-0203, 13-C-0114, and 14-C-0029&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study researchers will review participants medical records. They will collect the following&#xD;
      data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical record numbers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics (such as age, sex, and race)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments (such as surgeries, radiology procedures, and systemic treatments)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of disease progression between treatments and genetic/molecular data (if available)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of diagnosis/time of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be kept in secure network drives or sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who opted out of future use of data on their prior studies will be not be&#xD;
      included in this study....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor with an incidence of 1.5 to 2 per million&#xD;
      people per year. It has a very poor prognosis with an overall 5-year mortality rate of 75 -&#xD;
      90% and an average survival from the time of diagnosis of 14.5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural history of ACC can vary greatly ranging from an aggressive course with patient&#xD;
      survival measured in months to a more indolent course with patients living with the disease&#xD;
      for years. The basis for these differing clinical presentations is not known. Therefore,&#xD;
      accurate survival predictions in ACC are difficult and tumor classification methods with&#xD;
      better clinical prognostic value are needed to help rationally guide the clinical management&#xD;
      of patients with ACC. Over the last 20+ years in the CCR we have seen patients with ACC in&#xD;
      different stages of their disease receiving various types of therapies from local directed&#xD;
      therapies to systemic therapies, however, we have been unable to determine if local therapies&#xD;
      may improve survival compared to the approved systemic therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we plan to characterize the overall prognosis and treatment responses among&#xD;
      patients with ACC with various systemic therapies and correlate with age, sex, race and&#xD;
      disease burden. Identifiers will be recorded in order to correlate outcomes with therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve review of patient records and will not use specimens or participant&#xD;
      contact. The participants whose records will be reviewed in this protocol were enrolled&#xD;
      various ACC studies conducted by CCR. The Principal Investigators of each protocol have been&#xD;
      contacted and have given permission to conduct this study and have verified that none of the&#xD;
      original protocols or informed consent documents precludes such a review of clinical data.&#xD;
      Participants who did not consent to future research will be excluded.&#xD;
