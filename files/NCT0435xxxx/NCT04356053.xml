  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently about 90 cases of infection in children are reported every year in pediatric&#xD;
      intensive care, a disease considered to be the main cause of hospitalization of children. 16%&#xD;
      of invasive pneumococcal infections are linked to a genetic abnormality in immunity. Herpetic&#xD;
      encephalitis has become a model of genetic infectious disease, with new mutations identified&#xD;
      in the TLR3 pathway. Severe infections are no longer the result of chance and can be the way&#xD;
      to reveal a primary immune deficiency. In this context, the investigators propose to evaluate&#xD;
      the incidence of hereditary immune deficiency after a systematic immunological screening in&#xD;
      children admitted for a severe infection in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe infection requiring admission in intensive care unit (ICU) are not so rare. A&#xD;
      retrospective pilot study conducted at Montpellier University Hospital Center (UHC) between&#xD;
      2013 and 2015 showed that 19.7% of the pediatric ICU admissions were related to a severe&#xD;
      infection. An isolated severe infectious episode could be related to a hereditary immune&#xD;
      deficiency (HID), even though there are no history of recurrent clinical signs and biological&#xD;
      stigmata. For example, Gaschignard and colleagues considered that 16% of the invasive&#xD;
      pneumococcal infections are related to a genetic defect of immunity (doi:&#xD;
      10.1093/cid/ciu274). Growing evidence has shown that severe infectious diseases occurring in&#xD;
      childhood are attributed to inborn errors of immunity (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1521651112). While&#xD;
      the nosology of severe infections has strong links to inherited immune deficiency that are&#xD;
      rare diseases affecting less than 1 birth / 5000, there are no prospective studies that&#xD;
      assessed the incidence of primary immune deficiencies in children who presented a severe&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
