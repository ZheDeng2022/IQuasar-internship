  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial conducted in pediatric simulators that wishes to compare the&#xD;
      success of fiberoptic tracheal intubation using supraglottic device AuraGain compared with&#xD;
      fiberoptic tracheal intubation without laryngeal mask, performed by anesthesiologists and&#xD;
      anesthesiology residents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the required sample size, the data reported from studies were studied where the&#xD;
      Auragain device for intubation with fibrobronchoscope in adult patients is studied. In these&#xD;
      studies, an average intubation rate at the first attempt in adults of 87% of all cases was&#xD;
      found compared to an average success rate of intubation with FBC without a supraglottic&#xD;
      device of 60%. Based on these data, and assuming an alpha error of 0.05 of two tails and a&#xD;
      power of 80%, a total number of participants of 82 is required, that is 41 participants per&#xD;
      group. However, being a cross study, a total of 41 participants is required since each&#xD;
      participant will be their own control. For its calculation, the Stata 14.0 program was used&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The recruitment of participants will be carried out by the research group. A&#xD;
      verbal and email invitation will be made to the anesthesiology residents from different&#xD;
      University centers, in addition to the residents of this same specialty of other institutions&#xD;
      that are doing some rotation at the University Hospital San Vicente Foundation or IPS&#xD;
      University Clinic León XIII. In the same way the anesthesiologists of these two health&#xD;
      institutions will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling will be carried out for the convenience of consecutive participants until the&#xD;
      necessary number is fulfilled according to the sample design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, the possible participants of the clinical trial will be asked about their&#xD;
      intention to be part of the study, and those interested will be explained the relevant&#xD;
      aspects of this study, including the protocol, objectives, safety aspects and doubts will be&#xD;
      resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once they accept their participation in the clinical trial, the eligibility criteria to enter&#xD;
      the study will be determined and it will be remembered that they must perform a CUSUM&#xD;
      learning curve for fibrobronchoscopy in pediatric simulators. If the participant accepts the&#xD;
      informed consent, authorizing the proceeding of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recruitment rate of 4 to 5 participants per week is expected, so a recruitment period of 10&#xD;
      weeks after study approval is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategies used to favor recruitment will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create a work team with interest in the area and committed to the development of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motivate residents of anesthesiology and anesthesiologists through information boards in&#xD;
           the operating rooms of the San Vicente Foundation University Hospital or IPS University&#xD;
           Clinic León XIII&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a check every two weeks to determine that recruitment goals are being met&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be clarified that there will be no economic incentive for the patients or the group&#xD;
      of anesthesiologists participating in the study Retention The participants understudy do not&#xD;
      participate in economic stimulation that the incentives to participate or continue in.&#xD;
      Participation will be voluntary, free acceptance of the anesthesiologist or anesthesiology&#xD;
      student, who has understood the scientific benefits of the study and the possible associated&#xD;
      risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Losses: Participants who perform the intervention or control and the selected data will be&#xD;
      evaluated immediately after intubation maneuvers. There will be no subsequent measurements&#xD;
      that involve the monitoring of the participants. It is unlikely that participants will be&#xD;
      lost since data collection is immediate, however, and given that complications occur at&#xD;
      different times, there is a the possibility that the participant does not attend one or both&#xD;
      moments of intervention so a loss of 5% of participants is projected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawals: Since all participants will be trained with the CUSUM curve, there are no causes&#xD;
      to withdraw participants, the only cause will be that the participant will not wish to&#xD;
      continue the investigation once the informed consent has been completed. In case this happens&#xD;
      by sending a written report to the research coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis by intention to be treated: Due to the nature of the study, participants can perform&#xD;
      intubation maneuvers with both arms, see this type of analysis by default.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan for handling data, inputs, coding, security, and storage, which guarantee their&#xD;
      quality will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection: The researcher who observes the intervention of the participant will record&#xD;
           the data in physical format, then the data recorded in the physical formats will be&#xD;
           subjected to quality control; avoiding loss and error in data entry. This information&#xD;
           will be subject to review by double-checking by two different investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sending of the data: Once the data has been collected, they are entered into an&#xD;
           envelope, marked according to the assignment number and the participant's identification&#xD;
           number, and sealed. They will be sent to the data collection center, located in the&#xD;
           Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Section office.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coding: The data will be entered in a magnetic medium (Excel © 2010) by an assistant of&#xD;
           the research group, who does not participate in the research directly. A second&#xD;
           assistant performs the double-check, to verify the agreement between the data entered&#xD;
           and the data reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Security: It will be encrypted with a password that only the auxiliaries who collect the&#xD;
           data know. Periodically, the assistants will take a backup to keep the data, with&#xD;
           restricted access for researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Storage: Envelopes with the information of physical formats will be stored for 2 years&#xD;
           after the end of the study in the office of Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis: Once the collection stage is finished and the analysis begins, the data will&#xD;
           be delivered to the researchers with allocation concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           18. Statistical method and Analysis Plan. The baseline characteristics will be presented&#xD;
           in Table 1. For quantitative variables, Shapiro Wills normality test will be performed,&#xD;
           and if they are normal, they will be presented by means and standard deviation; if&#xD;
           normality is not demonstrated, they will be presented through medians and interquartile&#xD;
           range. For qualitative variables, it will be presented by frequencies and proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be presented at relative risk with their respective 95% confidence interval,&#xD;
      with the value of p, so Fisher's exact test will be performed. A p-value of less than 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the other outcomes, the statistical analysis will be presented (Outcome, Measures, and&#xD;
      methods of analysis):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation success at first attempt: Incidents Relative Risk Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time in seconds of the intubation maneuver : Mean or median, Difference of means or medians&#xD;
      Student t-test or Mann Whitney U test. In case of non-normality in this variable, it will be&#xD;
      considered to report in the median and a non-parametric test will be carried out as a&#xD;
      hypothesis test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global intubation successful: Incidents, Relative Risk Fisher's exact test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Display Degree: Proportion of each grade Relative Risk Chi-square test of homogeneity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation success at the second and third attempt: Incidents Relative Risk Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accidental extubation: Incidents Relative Risk Fisher's exact test Degree of the difficulty&#xD;
      of orotracheal intubation: Proportion of each grade Relative Risk Chi-square test of&#xD;
      homogeneity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of lost data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the study, participants will perform intubation maneuvers in both arms,&#xD;
      so it is not possible to perform this type of analysis. A loss should not occur, as the data&#xD;
      will be collected immediately, except in cases of force majeure. Methods of the imputation of&#xD;
      lost data will not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring and interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data monitoring will be carried out by the external research committee consisting of 2&#xD;
      anesthesiologists from the Department of Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the University&#xD;
      of Antioquia and staff of the research institute of the same higher education institutions.&#xD;
      They will have as function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation and monitoring of recruitment, randomization, adherence to the protocol,&#xD;
           among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blindly evaluate and monitor research data and generate recommendations to the research&#xD;
           group. Among the suggested recommendations may be the suspension of the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interim analysis: They will not be carried out, because the study will be carried out in&#xD;
           simulators, no serious adverse effects are planned and the recruitment time is not&#xD;
           prolonged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data quality audit will be carried out by a person from the Anaesthesiology and&#xD;
      Resuscitation service, who will have the function of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the the relevance of data collection formats and databases designated for the&#xD;
           registration of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate adherence to the protocol by researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An audit will be conducted after the end of the third week of recruitment, taking as a&#xD;
           sample the data of 50% of participants who have entered the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team must adopt the following measures to guarantee the quality of data&#xD;
      management:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a procedure manual that is easily accessible to researchers, with availability&#xD;
           in the simulation service, which clearly states the objectives, eligibility criteria,&#xD;
           outcomes, randomization, and diligence of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data collection formats: that contain clear information and that are agile to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Training and evaluation of the research team to ensure homogeneity in the application of&#xD;
           the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Double review of the data that is transferred from the physical medium to the magnetic&#xD;
           medium. Storage of physical data to be reviewed in case of loss of data in&#xD;
           electromagnetic media.&#xD;
