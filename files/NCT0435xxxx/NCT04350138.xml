  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site trial of the&#xD;
      FDA licensed rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine, Bexsero. The targeted study population is men and women&#xD;
      18-50 years of age who are disproportionately vulnerable to N. gonorrhoeae infection.&#xD;
      Approximately 2,200 participants are expected to be enrolled to achieve at least 202&#xD;
      evaluable participants. Data will be collected in an observer-blind manner. Study product&#xD;
      recipients and study staff responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint will be&#xD;
      unaware of whether Bexsero or placebo were administered. The duration of the study for&#xD;
      participants who are enrolled and randomized will be approximately 16 months. Study&#xD;
      participation is expected to be completed in approximately 36 months. The primary objective&#xD;
      of the study is to demonstrate efficacy of Bexsero in prevention of urogenital and/or&#xD;
      anorectal gonococcal infection.&#xD;

      This is a Phase II, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site trial of the&#xD;
      FDA licensed rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine, Bexsero. The targeted study population is men and women&#xD;
      18-50 years of age who are disproportionately vulnerable to N. gonorrhoeae infection.&#xD;
      Approximately 2,200 participants are expected to be enrolled to achieve at least 202&#xD;
      evaluable participants. Data will be collected in an observer-blind manner. Study product&#xD;
      recipients and study staff responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint will be&#xD;
      unaware of whether Bexsero or placebo were administered. Participants who consent to&#xD;
      screening will have baseline clinical information collected at Visit 0, Screening (Day -14&#xD;
      [Window -45 to -7]). This information will consist of medical history, concomitant&#xD;
      medications, physical exam, sexual history, and clinical and laboratory findings.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a physical exam and have blood drawn to establish baseline&#xD;
      laboratory values for safety assessment. Urine or a vaginal swab, and a rectal swab will be&#xD;
      collected for Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) for gonorrhea and chlamydia. A&#xD;
      pharyngeal swab will be collected for NAAT testing of gonorrhea. At the enrollment visit,&#xD;
      Visit 1, participants who test negative for gonorrhea and who otherwise qualify will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the initial intramuscular (IM) dose of&#xD;
      study product. A phone call, Visit 2, will be held approximately 30 days after the initial&#xD;
      study product dose was received and will be conducted with all participants to assess for&#xD;
      safety events in the interim. At Visit 3, the participant will receive the second dose of&#xD;
      study product. Visit 4 will be held 1 month after second dose. At 3-month intervals, through&#xD;
      the final study follow-up visit, participants will have clinic study visits, Visit 5 thru&#xD;
      Visit 8. The duration of the study for participants who are enrolled and randomized will be&#xD;
      approximately 16 months. For those not enrolled, participation could end at their Visit 0,&#xD;
      Screening; post Visit 0, Screening based on NAAT test results; or Visit 1, Enrollment. Study&#xD;
      participation is expected to be completed in approximately 36 months. The primary objective&#xD;
      of the study is to demonstrate efficacy of Bexsero in prevention of urogenital and/or&#xD;
      anorectal gonococcal infection. The secondary objectives are to estimate efficacy of Bexsero&#xD;
      in prevention of overall gonococcal infection and by anatomical site (urogenital, anorectal&#xD;
      or pharyngeal) and to assess safety of Bexsero.&#xD;
