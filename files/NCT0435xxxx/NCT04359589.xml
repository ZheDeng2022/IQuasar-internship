      Background: Acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are a kind of diseases&#xD;
      with high incidence, rapid progression, poor prognosis and high mortality and disability rate&#xD;
      of the circulatory system, mainly including acute myocardial infarction, acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke and acute limb ischemia, which place a heavy burden on individuals, families and&#xD;
      society due to their severe prognosis and high medical costs. At present, the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases mainly focus on single&#xD;
      organ diagnosis and treatment of target organs, lacking of indicators to comprehensively&#xD;
      evaluate the body's pathophysiology. As ischemic disease of the circulatory system, ischemic&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases have common pathophysiological basis such as&#xD;
      ischemia, hypoxia and inflammation. These common pathophysiological basis suggests that&#xD;
      different acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases can be monitored and&#xD;
      evaluated from an integrated perspective, it suggests the possibility of comprehensive&#xD;
      diagnosis, evaluation and treatment guidance. At present, the &quot;circulatory integration&quot;&#xD;
      therapy represented by the combined treatment of heart and brain has achieved certain&#xD;
      results, but there is no corresponding evaluation system to provide accurate guidance.&#xD;
      Therefore, with the concept of &quot;circulation integration&quot;, it is an urgent problem to find the&#xD;
      common indicators of the circulation system and construct the hierarchical diagnosis and&#xD;
      subsequent evaluation system of acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular integration. The&#xD;
      development of efficient and comprehensive stratified diagnosis and prognosis evaluation&#xD;
      system is of great significance in clinical, market and social aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the early stage of the efforts our team, it was found that Dan Shen Su-(±)-3,&#xD;
      4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DSS) could be detected in the plasma and urine of patients with&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke through metabolomics. It has been proved that&#xD;
      it can be generated by the transformation of dihydroxyphenylalanine by proteus mirabilis, and&#xD;
      its structure is consistent with the water-soluble component of salvia miltiorrhiza, which is&#xD;
      related to the body's states of ischemia, hypoxia and inflammation. The findings provide a&#xD;
      material basis for the &quot;circulatory integration&quot; assessment of acute ischemic cardiovascular&#xD;
      and cerebrovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study aims at acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases,&#xD;
      with the concept of &quot;circulatory integration&quot;, to build a hierarchical diagnosis and&#xD;
      prognosis evaluation system with DSS as the core, in order to improve the diagnosis rate and&#xD;
      cure rate, improve the prognosis and reduce mortality of ischemic cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The project included 500 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 300 patients&#xD;
      with acute ischemic stroke, 300 patients with acute lower limb ischemia, and 200 healthy&#xD;
      controls in the Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, Peoples R&#xD;
      China. Plasma and urine were collected during the disease process. Various relevant clinical&#xD;
      indicators including DSS level were included, COX model was applied to analyze the influence&#xD;
      of multiple factors on the prognosis of the above diseases, and the indicators were screened&#xD;
      and the integrated stratified diagnosis and prognosis evaluation system of acute ischemic&#xD;
      cardio-cerebrovascular system with DSS as the core were established. The newly established&#xD;
      integrated stratified diagnosis and prognosis assessment system was used to evaluate 200&#xD;
      patients with each of the three diseases, and the sensitivity and specificity of the new&#xD;
      assessment system were tested. And a simple, rapid and accurate method for detecting DSS was&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;

      The experiments as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1. Observe the dynamic changes of DSS level in acute ischemic cardiovascular and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular diseases of different severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research object Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) group: 500 patients with AMI; Acute&#xD;
           ischemic stroke group: 300 patients with acute ischemic stroke; Acute lower limb&#xD;
           ischemia group: 300 subjects with acute lower limb ischemia; Control group: 200 healthy&#xD;
           volunteers were included as controls. All the subjects were from the first and second&#xD;
           affiliated hospitals of the Xi'an Jiaotong University and the Shaanxi Provincial&#xD;
           People's Hospital;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collecting indicators Peripheral blood and morning urine were collected from the&#xD;
           patients and the volunteers after admission on the first, second, third and seventh days&#xD;
           for DSS detection. The investigators collected several demographics, clinical and&#xD;
           analytical parameters. Age, gender, height and weight were recorded, and body mass index&#xD;
           (kg/m2) was calculated. Blood pressure (BP) was measured three times or more by a nurse&#xD;
           while patients were seated after 5 min of rest. Several parameters, including myocardial&#xD;
           enzyme, serum uric acid, total cholesterol, total triglycerides low density&#xD;
           lipoprotein-cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, estimated glomerular&#xD;
           filtration rate and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured. The patient was&#xD;
           included in all the clinical data after admission and as the admission diagnosis,&#xD;
           including: medical history (including risk factors), physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
           examination, imaging examination, nursing report, records of interventional operation&#xD;
           and all the indicators of in-hospital examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyze the regularity curve of DSS level in disease DSS levels of blood and urine were&#xD;
           detected by gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In the disease progression of&#xD;
           patients with AMI, acute ischemic stroke and acute lower limb ischemia, the difference&#xD;
           of DSS production was analyzed, and the regular curve of the dynamic change process of&#xD;
           ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases was plotted based on the normal&#xD;
           control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2. To establish an assessment system of &quot;circulatory integration&quot; for acute&#xD;
      ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases with DSS as the core.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Clinical outcomes on follow up Adverse events (survival outcome) were observed and&#xD;
           recorded in the hospital and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. Major adverse&#xD;
           events mainly include disease recurrence, cardiac death and all-cause death. The time of&#xD;
           recurrence, complication or death, type of complication and cause of death were recorded&#xD;
           in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish a diagnosis and treatment evaluation system Blood and urine DSS levels were&#xD;
           measured by GC-MS. COX regression model analysis, including DSS level, basic&#xD;
           information, risk factors, symptoms, physical examination, laboratory tests, image&#xD;
           examination and electrocardiogram, assess the influence of various factors on major&#xD;
           adverse events in patients with acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular&#xD;
           diseases and the prognosis of three diseases. Moreover, these indicators were used to&#xD;
           build a scoring system, and analyze its correlation with prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 3. To verify the &quot;circulatory integration&quot; diagnosis and treatment evaluation&#xD;
      system of acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases with DSS as the core&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research Object AMI group: 200 patients with AMI; Acute ischemic stroke group: 200&#xD;
           patients with acute ischemic stroke; Acute lower limb ischemia group: 200 subjects with&#xD;
           acute lower limb ischemia; All these subjects were from the first and second affiliated&#xD;
           hospitals of the Xi'an Jiaotong University and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collecting Indicators Peripheral blood and morning urine were collected and measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow up and record the outcome The major adverse events were observed and recorded in&#xD;
           the same way as in the above-mentioned experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Verify the diagnosis and treatment evaluation system The newly established &quot;circulatory&#xD;
           integration&quot; diagnosis and treatment evaluation system of acute ischemic cardiovascular&#xD;
           and cerebrovascular diseases with DSS as the core was used to predict the prognosis of&#xD;
           the newly included 600 patients with acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular&#xD;
           diseases. This paper analyzes the specificity and sensitivity of the newly built&#xD;
           &quot;circular integration&quot; diagnosis and treatment evaluation system through its disease&#xD;
           evaluation and actual adverse events.&#xD;
