  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormal of cardiometabolic risk related index</measure>
    <time_frame>3th month after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiometabolic risk related index includes fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, blood pressure and abdominal obesity.Cardiometabolic risk related index would be set to 1 as at least 2 indexs mentioned were abnormal while 0 for less than 2.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Waist-to-height ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12th months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Waist-to-height ratio is calculated by the formula ：Waist-to-height ratio=waistline (cm)/height(cm). All the participates' Waist-to-height ratio would be calculated at baseline and 12th months after enrollment. The change would be manifested in the situatuion of the difference.</description>

    <measure>Change of Body Mass Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12th months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Body Mass Index is calculated by the formula ：Body Mass Index=weight(kg)/(height(cm))^2. All the participates' Body Mass Index would be calculated at baseline and 12th months after enrollment. The change would be manifested in the situatuion of the difference.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Exercise programme</intervention_name>
    <description>Exercise programme includes 8 anaerobic movements choosen from Tabata. This exercise programme workout is aimed at body fat reduction, and the structure is as follows:&#xD;
8 anerobic movements in 20 seconds is a set&#xD;
Rest for 10 seconds before another set&#xD;
Finish 4 sets every time, it shall take you 4 minutes&#xD;
Do 4 sets 2 to 3 times a week</description>
