  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      16.2 million American adults are affected by depression each year. The investigators are&#xD;
      studying the relationship between sleep/wake cycle and depression. Mounting evidence suggests&#xD;
      that abnormalities in circadian rhythms (biological changes that happen over the course of&#xD;
      the day or night) are related to mood disorders. This may explain why people with depression&#xD;
      frequently suffer with sleeping problems. The purpose of this study is to understand how&#xD;
      circadian (sleep/wake) rhythms may be affected in depression and the best way to improve&#xD;
      depression caused in this way. This will be performed by comparing circadian (sleep/wake)&#xD;
      rhythms in people with and without depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves being kept awake for one night. For depressed individuals, this technique&#xD;
      will likely result in a brief (&lt;1 day) improvement in depression. Following this study,&#xD;
      participants with depression will be offered antidepressant medication at no cost. During the&#xD;
      study, the investigators use brain scans to learn more about brain chemistry in health and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves four overnight stays. On the first overnight stay, sleep can occur as&#xD;
      normal and the investigators will measure hormone levels during sleep. On the second&#xD;
      overnight stay (which happens 1-2 weeks later), three sets of imaging over the course of the&#xD;
      night are performed. The imaging is positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI). It is designed to look at brain chemistry (particularly glutamate levels in&#xD;
      the brain). Participants may sleep in between scans. On the third overnight stay (1-2 weeks&#xD;
      after the second night), participants will be kept awake for around 36 hours. On the last&#xD;
      overnight stay (occurring right after night 3), the investigators will measure hormone levels&#xD;
      again during sleep. All participants with depression enrolled in the study will be seen by a&#xD;
      clinician throughout the study and offered medication at no cost after the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess circadian (sleep/wake) phase in depressed and non-depressed individuals.&#xD;
      Melatonin secretion is now an easily accessible circadian marker. Further, the average time&#xD;
      interval between dim light melatonin onset (DLMO, the time at which melatonin rises above a&#xD;
      certain threshold, &quot;the most accurate biomarker of circadian phase position&quot;) and sleep&#xD;
      midpoint (average bedtime plus half the average sleep duration) has been established as 6&#xD;
      hours in non-depressed participants and likely deviates from this optimum in major depressive&#xD;
      disorder (MDD). For this reason, the investigators will measure melatonin in the blood on&#xD;
      overnight visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1. Average phase angle difference (DLMO - sleep midpoint) will be 6 hours&#xD;
      (optimal) in healthy controls, but not depressed, participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2. MDD severity (assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, HDRS) will be&#xD;
      correlated with deviation from optimal phase angle difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess brain chemistry (specifically one of the glutamate receptors, the metabotropic&#xD;
      glutamate receptor subtype 5, mGluR5) expression at 3 times: the time of DLMO, peak and nadir&#xD;
      of melatonin secretion (as measured from overnight visit 1). mGluR5 availability will be&#xD;
      assessed near these times to capture mGluR5 circadian rhythmicity using PET and a tracer&#xD;
      specific for mGluR5, [11C]ABP688.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3. mGluR5 variation will be inverse to that of melatonin in both cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine the effect of acute sleep deprivation on circadian rhythms. Within&#xD;
      approximately one week of Aims 1 &amp; 2, all participants will receive sleep deprivation&#xD;
      therapy. Following up to 36 hours of wakefulness (shown to increase mGluR5 at a single time&#xD;
      point), the investigators will measure acute effects with repeat assessments of melatonin and&#xD;
      depression severity. This will thus require two overnight stays in a row- one for the sleep&#xD;
      deprivation and then the next to measure melatonin again in the blood while the participant&#xD;
      sleeps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4. Sleep deprivation will be most successful in the depressed participants with&#xD;
      greatest disruption in phase (Aim 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 5: Depressed participants will experience greater changes in phase angle&#xD;
      difference following sleep deprivation than non-depressed participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To determine whether reliable estimates of [11C]ABP688 in plasma can be obtained using&#xD;
      a miniPET scanner. [11C]ABP688 concentration will be measured at the wrist or leg with a&#xD;
      novel synchronized PET scanner developed by Stony Brook Investigator, Dr. Paul Vaska. This&#xD;
      innovative device provides estimates of plasma radioactivity simply by placing the&#xD;
      participant's wrist or leg in a mini-PET scanner called versaPET. The radioactivity derived&#xD;
      from this wrist or leg scanner, as well as the resulting outcome measures, will be compared&#xD;
      to those estimated using blood analysis. This could make future PET studies easier by finding&#xD;
      a substitute for blood sampling during the PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncovering the link between mGluR5, circadian disruption and MDD could:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Identify biological underpinnings of circadian (sleep/wake) dysfunction; (2) Identify&#xD;
      individuals (those with mGluR5 disruption) for whom treatments like sleep deprivation would&#xD;
      be most effective; and (3) Increase use of this safe and rapid treatment.&#xD;
