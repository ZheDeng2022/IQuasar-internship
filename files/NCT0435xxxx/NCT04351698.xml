  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood condition causing long term health problems&#xD;
      including pain and brain problems which affect quality of life. These may be made worse if&#xD;
      patients have low night-time oxygen levels when the upper airways close repeatedly during the&#xD;
      night (obstructive sleep apnoea). This is associated with increased pain, poorer&#xD;
      concentration and increased kidney problems. Montelukast, widely used in the treatment of&#xD;
      Asthma, has been shown to improve symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea in patients without&#xD;
      sickle cell anaemia. Investigators think this treatment could be useful in patients with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease too. Early intervention with Montelukast could help prevent deterioration&#xD;
      in concentration and thinking skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to see whether young children with sickle cell disease randomised&#xD;
      (randomise: the same as tossing a coin and not knowing whether it will come up heads or&#xD;
      tails) to Montelukast treatment have better thinking skills compared with people randomised&#xD;
      to placebo (tablet with no active medical ingredients - i.e. &quot;sugar pill&quot;). This means that&#xD;
      the child could be on Montelukast treatment or he/she might be on placebo tablets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial, funded by Action Medical Research, will involve 200 SCD patients recruited from&#xD;
      haematology clinics and ENT (ear, nose and throat) surgery waiting lists or their local sleep&#xD;
      laboratory at Evelina Children's hospital (Guy's &amp; St Thomas), University College London&#xD;
      hospital, North Middlesex hospital and Whittington Hospitals. Patients are eligible if they&#xD;
      are between 3 and &lt;8 years old w SCD, give informed consent, have any Sleep-Disordered&#xD;
      Breathing, e.g. snoring, and/or any abnormality on overnight oximetry. After consenting, the&#xD;
      PI/Coordinator will organise a simple app-based questionnaire and baseline testing of brain&#xD;
      speed, with an optional brain scan, and randomisation to chewable Montelukast tablets or&#xD;
      Placebo for 3 months after which the brain speed tests, questionnaires and MRI will be&#xD;
      repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is designed as a phase 2/3 trial of Montelukast therapy to investigate whether this drug&#xD;
      improves processing speed, which appears to underpin the difference in full scale IQ&#xD;
      (intelligence quotient) United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      between children with sickle cell disease and their siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the paediatric and adult sickle clinics at the involved&#xD;
      hospitals. These clinics are attended by over 2000 patients with sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a paediatric trial in a group of children who mainly belong to an ethnic minority as&#xD;
      it is this age group who are vulnerable to sleep-disordered breathing (90% of children with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease in our previous study snored). The investigators have successfully run 4&#xD;
      previous randomised controlled trials and 2 longitudinal studies in this group of children.&#xD;
      The proposal has been developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers/scientists, many&#xD;
      of whom have lengthy clinical experience in this area. This team includes two patient&#xD;
      representatives. Processing speed has been measured until recently using the Coding and&#xD;
      Symbol search Wechsler subtests but investigators found that there was a practice effect in&#xD;
      both arms of our pilot trial of continuous positive airways pressure, which was not seen for&#xD;
      Cancellation, another test of processing speed and attention. The NIH toolbox processing&#xD;
      speed is a new iPad test which has extensive normal data down to the age of 3 years, but a&#xD;
      team member who has used it has found a practice effect. Investigators are therefore&#xD;
      including 2 primary endpoints: Cancellation and the NIH toolbox processing speed It is&#xD;
      possible that investigators will not recruit 200 patients across the 4 London sites so:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigators have ensured that they will be adequately powered to detect an effect of&#xD;
           Montelukast on adenoid: nasopharynx ratio on MRI if they recruit at least 3 willing to&#xD;
           undergo MRI in each arm; this will allow exploration of the secondary brain MRI&#xD;
           endpoints in addition to the primary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigators will extend to additional UK sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigators will apply for additional funds to extend the study outside the UK, e.g.&#xD;
           by applying for $500,000 from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institutes (USA) to run&#xD;
           the study in Cincinnati and New York.&#xD;

    <description>Dimensional Change Card Sort Test: There are 40 trials, and scoring was based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time.&#xD;
Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test: There are 40 trials. For children aged 3-7.99 years scores of ≥ 90% using preliminary fish stimuli were followed that an additional 20 trials using arrows. Scoring was based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time.&#xD;
List Sorting Working Memory Test: The number of items in series increases from 2 to a maximum of 8. The test was discontinued when 2 trials at the same length were failed. Responses were entered by the examiner on a wireless keyboard. Children under 7 years did not complete this test. Scoring was based on the total number of items correctly recalled across all trials.&#xD;
