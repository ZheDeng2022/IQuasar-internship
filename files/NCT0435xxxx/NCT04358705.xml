      The purpose of this research is to understand how flavor affects young adult's perceptions of&#xD;
      little cigar or cigarillo use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to examine and better understand adolescent and young adult&#xD;
      perceptions, visual attention, use intentions and purchasing behaviors among users and&#xD;
      non-users of cigarillos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental Aim 1: Consists of evaluation of the differences in perceptions of flavors on&#xD;
      appeal, purchasing and risk perceptions of cigarillo products between young adult sexual and&#xD;
      gender minorities (SGM) and heterosexual females. A convenience sample of SGM females will be&#xD;
      recruited using online social media platforms with targeted advertising. From the parent&#xD;
      survey (or Aim 1), an existing sample of female heterosexual cigarillo users will be&#xD;
      leveraged. Both samples will receive the same survey, Aim 1, to compare perceptions of&#xD;
      appeal, risk, and purchasing across cigarillos and other tobacco products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 of this study is exploratory and will consist of an online survey. Findings from Aim 1&#xD;
      will inform the questions asked about advertising and product use in Aim 2 and 3. Both Aim 2&#xD;
      and 3 are randomized sections. Participants in Aim 2 are either tobacco users or non-users.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to view a series of tobacco related images. The sequence of those&#xD;
      images is randomized. In Aim 3, participants will be randomized in terms of the options they&#xD;
      are presented within the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM) (i.e. which tobacco items&#xD;
      they can purchase and at what price).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental Aim 3 consists of evaluating the differences in the abuse liability/addictive&#xD;
      potential of flavored versus unflavored cigarillos and the substitutability of flavored&#xD;
      versus unflavored disposable e-cigarettes between young adult sexual and gender minorities&#xD;
      (SGM) and heterosexual females. SGM female cigarillousers will be recruited from participants&#xD;
      of the Supplemental Aim 1 sample and be compared to heterosexual female participants of the&#xD;
      parent study (or Aim 3). Both samples will receive the same questions and be exposed to the&#xD;
      same ETM conditions tocompare perceptions of appeal of flavors and substitutability between&#xD;
      cigarillos, e-cigarettes, and other tobacco products.&#xD;

Participants will have their gaze monitored continuously by the camera on the computer monitor while a randomized set of stimuli (product advertisements) are viewed (n=30) for 10 seconds per image. Following each advertisement, an on-screen closed response question will re-center the participant's gaze for standardization prior to the next image</description>

Cigarillo price conditions: 1) market price 2) ½ market price 3) 2X market price 4) 4X market price&#xD;
Flavor condition: 1) flavored cigarillos and fruit-flavored disposable-cigarettes available 2) unflavored cigarillos and fruit-flavored ecigarettes available 3) flavored cigarillos and tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes available 4) unflavored cigarillos and tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes available.&#xD;
Participants will purchase cigarillos with their account balance. During all ETM conditions, constant-priced alternative tobacco products (smokeless tobacco, nicotine lozenges, nicotine gum, and the nicotine patch) will be available in addition to the cigarillos and e-cigarettes.</description>

The participant will be given a select section of the survey questions from Aim 1. The survey will be uploaded to Qualtrics to reflect the way that survey would be conducted in Aim 1. With the survey questions in front of the participant on the computer screen, research personnel will ask probing questions about each one of the survey questions. If the participant is not able to participate in person or via Zoom, they will be allowed to be interview over the phone with access to the Qualtrics survey or a paper form. If the participant is unable to access the internet, the participant will be read the questions by research personnel. The participant will provide feedback about the questions and walk the research personnel through their thought process for approaching each survey question.</description>
