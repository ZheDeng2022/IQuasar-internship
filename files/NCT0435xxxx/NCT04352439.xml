    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine the safety and efficacy of low dose aspirin for the&#xD;
      prevention of venous thromboembolism among women with advanced ovarian cancer receiving&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who are receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer,&#xD;
      including primaries of mullerian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube origin, with a Khorana score&#xD;
      of 1 will be recruited from the Duke Gynecology Oncology clinic at Duke Cancer Institute.&#xD;
      After discussion of the risks and benefits, written informed consent will be obtained for&#xD;
      initiation of prophylactic, daily low dose aspirin (81 mg) therapy. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      aspirin tablets in medication vials obtained from the Duke pharmacy supply and will be&#xD;
      instructed to take one tablet daily until the day of their interval debulking surgery. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes will be safety and medication adherence. Secondary outcome will be rate of&#xD;
      VTE. We hypothesize that daily low dose aspirin will be safe with acceptable medication&#xD;
      adherence and may reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolic events during neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy for low risk patients when compared to a historical control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse safety events and medication adherence will be evaluated using descriptive statistics&#xD;
      using a validated questionnaire. We will calculate the incidence of venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      among the study cohort and estimate a 95% exact binomial confidence interval. A drop greater&#xD;
      than 20% (from 8% in the historical control to 6.4%) in the venous thromboembolism rate would&#xD;
      be considered clinically meaningful. We will also monitor for adverse safety events related&#xD;
      to low dose aspirin use, including major or minor bleeding events, clinically significant&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (resulting in treatment delay), and gastrointestinal complications. Of note,&#xD;
      low dose aspirin for venous thromboembolism prevention is already considered an acceptable&#xD;
      option for standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma receiving antiangiogenesis&#xD;
      agents with chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone as well as for postoperative thromboprophylaxis&#xD;
      for some orthopedic procedures; we therefore believe the potential benefit outweighs any&#xD;
      clinically significant risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from patients at the Duke Gynecology Oncology clinics at the Duke&#xD;
      Cancer Center or Macon Pond (Duke Women's Cancer Care Raleigh) with advanced epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, including primaries of mullerian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube origin, who&#xD;
      are going to initiate neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A provider will approach the patient and&#xD;
      inquire about interest in participating in the study. If the patient desires to receive more&#xD;
      information about participating, clinical research personnel will discuss the study with&#xD;
      patient and obtain informed consent if all selection criteria are met (detailed in a prior&#xD;
      section). If the patient consents, they will then be considered an enrolled study subject. We&#xD;
      will use the Duke hosted REDCap platform for collecting eConsent. If the patient is willing&#xD;
      to hear about the study but a member of the research team is unable to be physically present&#xD;
      in clinic, the research team will contact the patient via phone to perform the same&#xD;
      recruitment, eligibility screening, and consent process that would typically be completed in&#xD;
      person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 120 patients will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer&#xD;
      at Duke Gynecology Oncology clinics for the designated study recruitment period of 07/01/2020&#xD;
      to 12/30/2021 with an estimated 50% accrual rate for a total of 60 enrolled patients.&#xD;
      Currently there is no established practice guideline for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis&#xD;
      for these high risk patients. There will be no direct cost to subjects for participation in&#xD;
      the study. They will not incur any costs for travel as they will already be presenting to&#xD;
      Duke Gynecology Oncology clinic for their scheduled clinic visit. The study drug will be&#xD;
      provided without cost. There will be additional time (10 minutes) incurred with study&#xD;
      participation for informed consent and explanation of the study design and medication&#xD;
      adherence diary. Subjects will not be compensated.&#xD;
