  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study with the sample size&#xD;
      is 362. The patients with high-grade osteosarcoma who had previously received surgery and&#xD;
      completed adjuvant chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to ZKAB001 group (trial group) or&#xD;
      placebo group (control group) according to 1:1. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of ZKAB001 in maintenance therapy after adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      high-grade osteosarcoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients will be given ZKAB001 injection in 10mg/kg or placebo once every 3 weeks for a&#xD;
      total of 16 cycles or 1 year. The end point is that the patient has been taking the drug for&#xD;
      16 cycles or 1 year, or the patient dies or develops intolerable toxicity or confirmed&#xD;
      disease recurrence or distant metastasis or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever comes&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, after a screening period of no more than 28 days, qualified subjects will be&#xD;
      given ZKAB001 or placebo and test visits. Imaging examination will be performed every 12&#xD;
      weeks after the first dose until the local or distant recurrence of the disease, or the&#xD;
      initiation of other systematic anti-tumor therapy or death, whichever come first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survival follow-up period starts from the last treatment to a maximum of 4 years, or to&#xD;
      the death or loss of follow-up or withdrawal of informed consent or the sponsor terminates&#xD;
      the study every 3 months.&#xD;
