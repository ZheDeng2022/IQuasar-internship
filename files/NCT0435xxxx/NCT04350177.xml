  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the safety and tolerability of drug IkT-148009 in healthy elderly&#xD;
      volunteers (55 to 70 years old). It also looks at the movement of IkT-148009 in the body.&#xD;
      This first-in-human study is designed in 3 parts. In Part A, healthy participants will take a&#xD;
      single, oral dose of IkT-148009 or placebo. Part A participants will be at the study site for&#xD;
      approximately 4 days. In Part B, healthy participants will take an oral dose of IkT-148009&#xD;
      once a day for 7 days. Part B participants will be at the study site for approximately 12&#xD;
      days. In Part C, Parkinson's patients will take an oral dose of IkT-148009 once a day for 7&#xD;
      days. Part C participants will be at the study site for approximately 12 days.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, Phase 1 study in older adult or elderly healthy volunteer subjects with&#xD;
      subsequent extension into Parkinson patients to identify the safety, tolerability, maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of IkT-148009 capsules given as&#xD;
      single or multiple capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A (SAD) cohorts will consist of eight (8) subjects, six (6) of whom will receive&#xD;
      treatment with IkT-148009 and two (2) with matching placebo. Sentinel dosing will be employed&#xD;
      on the first day of each cohort, with one subject randomized to receive IkT-148009 and the&#xD;
      other placebo. These two subjects in each cohort will be monitored for 48 hours after dosing&#xD;
      before deciding to dose the remainder of the cohort. The other six subjects in the first&#xD;
      cohort will be dosed approximately 48 hours later. Each cohort will be monitored for at least&#xD;
      48 hours before deciding whether to administer drug to the sentinel pair for the next cohort.&#xD;
      Each cohort will be dosed at approximately weekly intervals to allow adequate time for&#xD;
      collection and review of safety and PK data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will evaluate all available safety, tolerability, and PK data&#xD;
      for each cohort. Escalation to a next dose will be undertaken only after these data have been&#xD;
      reviewed by the SRC and agreement reached that it is safe to increase the dose. The SRC will&#xD;
      not receive any unblinded PK data unless they agree to unblind a subject and/or cohort based&#xD;
      on the completed safety review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If Part A clinical exposure and PK data through 2 or more cohorts raise no concerns to the&#xD;
      SRC, Part B may commence at the discretion of the SRC while the remaining Part A cohorts are&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B (MAD) cohorts will consist of eight (8) subjects, six (6) of whom will receive&#xD;
      treatment with IkT-148009 and two (2) with matching placebo daily for up to seven consecutive&#xD;
      days. Subjects in each cohort will be observed for 48 hours after their last dose before&#xD;
      deciding to initiate the next (higher dose) cohort. Each cohort will be dosed at&#xD;
      approximately weekly intervals in order to allow adequate time for collection and review of&#xD;
      safety and PK data. At the discretion of the SRC, MAD cohorts may be added consisting of&#xD;
      eligible participants with Parkinson's Disease (Part C).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Sentinel dosing will be employed for each cohort in Part A, with one subject randomized to receive IkT-148009 and the other placebo on the first day. These two subjects in each cohort will be monitored for 48 hours after dosing before deciding to dose the remainder of the cohort. As such, the other six subjects in the first cohort will be dosed approximately 48 hours later. Each cohort will be monitored for at least 48 hours before deciding whether to sentinel pair in the next (higher dose) cohort, and each cohort will be dosed at approximately monthly intervals in order to allow adequate time for collection and review of safety and PK data. In Part B, 8 patients will be 3:1 randomized to placebo and dosed once per day for 7 days. In Part C, 8 patients will be 3:1 randomized to placebo and dosed once per day for 7 dayts.</intervention_model_description>

&#xD;
             5. Physical examination, clinical laboratory values, vital signs (as defined in the&#xD;
             CRU standard operating procedure [SOP]), and the electrocardiogram (ECGs) are&#xD;
             clinically acceptable to the Investigator. Body weight ≥ 45 kg at screening and&#xD;

        Approved by an Enrollment Authorization Committee (EAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria Parts A and B:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis at the screening and admission visits. Abnormalities considered to be&#xD;
             non-clinically significant by the Investigator are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examination or 12-lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) at the screening or admission visits. NOTE: QTcF interval of &gt;&#xD;
             450 msec in males or &gt; 470 msec in females will be the basis for exclusion from the&#xD;
             study. Safety ECG may be repeated for confirmatory purposes if initial values obtained&#xD;
             exceed the limits specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Significant history (within six months prior to receiving the study drug) and/or&#xD;
             presence of clinically significant medical, surgical or psychiatric disorder. Subjects&#xD;
             with co-morbid conditions that are stable and controlled may remain eligible (stable&#xD;
             defined as no change in the dose or frequency of medications over the prior three&#xD;
             months).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. For optional lumbar puncture: participants with bleeding disorders, relevant lab&#xD;
             abnormalities (Screening INR greater than 1.4, platelets less than 50), relevant blood&#xD;

             treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Any subject with a history, presence and/or current evidence of serologic positive&#xD;
             result for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibodies, or HIV antibodies 1 or&#xD;
             2. Subjects considered to be cured for hepatitis C will be eligible. 9. Recent history&#xD;
             (within previous six months prior to screening) of alcohol or drug abuse (as judged by&#xD;
             the investigator) or has consumed &gt; 2 alcohol drinks/day during the last three months&#xD;
             prior to screening (one glass is approximately equivalent to: beer [284 mL], wine [125&#xD;
             mL/4 ounces], or distilled spirits [25 mL/1 ounce]). Subjects that consume three&#xD;
             glasses of alcoholic beverages per day but less than 14 glasses per week may be&#xD;
             enrolled at the discretion of the Investigator. Positive screens for alcohol or&#xD;
             controlled substances at the screening or admission visits will disqualify a subject&#xD;
             from study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
