  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective, randomized, controlled phase III clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus oxaliplatin and capecitabine versus oxaliplatin plus&#xD;
      capecitabine in the treatment of gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with&#xD;
      postoperative pathological stage IIIB and IIIC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2019, CSCO guidelines grade I recommend gastric or gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma patients, after D2 R0 resection, whose postoperative pathological stage was&#xD;
      III treated with XELOX as an adjuvant chemotherapy. However, some retrospective clinical&#xD;
      studies in China suggest that the 3-year DFS rate of XELOX program as an adjuvant&#xD;
      postoperative chemotherapy program is still low, and the risk of recurrence is higher for&#xD;
      patients with postoperative pathological stage IIIB/IIIC.In recent years, the success of the&#xD;
      JACCRO GC-07 trial has provided evidence for the value of Taxoids in postoperative adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy of gastric cancer. In the FLOT4 trial, the FLOT improved the DFS rate by 3 years&#xD;
      compared with the ECF/ECX. At present, there is no clinical study data to prove whether the&#xD;
      combined three-drug regimen can further reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence and&#xD;
      improve the treatment effect compared with oxaliplatin combined capecitabine two-drug regimen&#xD;
      for patients with high postoperative recurrence risk (patients with postoperative&#xD;
      pathological stage IIIB/IIIC). Therefore, the investigators carried out this trial.&#xD;
