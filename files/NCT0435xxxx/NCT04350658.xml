      The procedure is performed via transfemoral or transcaprotid access; Patients were confirmed&#xD;
      to be eligible for TAVR by a multidisciplinary heart team including at least an&#xD;
      interventional cardiologist, a cardiothoracic surgeon and an anesthetist. All TAVR&#xD;
      implantation procedures were performed with the Edwards SAPIEN 3 THV or the MEDTRONIC&#xD;
      CoreValve EVOLUT . For all patients, both vascular access and aortic valve were evaluated&#xD;
      before the procedure by multislice computerized tomographic angiography (MSCT) of the entire&#xD;
      aorta using vascular windows settings. The prosthesis and the vascular access were left to&#xD;
      the discretion of the operating team. Transfemoral access was the first choice when possible.&#xD;
      All TAVR procedures were performed in the same hybrid room (in Montpellier University&#xD;
      Hospital), Most TAVR were performed under sedation or general anesthesia using mild low&#xD;
      profile 14-16 French delivery systems and using percutaneous or surgical vascular access.&#xD;
