  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of cognitive impairment is severe, and often hinders affected people to act&#xD;
      independently in daily life. Individuals in different stages of cognitive decline are&#xD;
      frequently affected by existential distress and associated health issues (such as stress&#xD;
      symptoms, anxiety, and depression), as well as social avoidance due to the unclear prognosis.&#xD;
      Although the need for psychological support is large, there is a lack of efficient&#xD;
      individualized psychological treatments- and methods to maintain psychological health that&#xD;
      sufficiently impact daily life and promote behavioral- and biological change. In keeping with&#xD;
      that notion, the investigators have developed a novel psychological treatment manual focused&#xD;
      on supporting individuals with early phase cognitive impairment. The treatment manual is&#xD;
      centered on facilitating behavioral change in accordance with personal values and long-term&#xD;
      goals even in the presence of negative experiences, as well as to promote meaningful&#xD;
      life-style changes. Conceptually, the treatment manual has its basis in the cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT) tradition, but the investigators have strived to adapt the manual to&#xD;
      suit a cognitively affected population. The investigators will evaluate the psychological&#xD;
      treatment in a RCT were the investigators will include approximately 138 individuals in their&#xD;
      early phases of cognitive decline and randomize them into either an experimental group&#xD;
      (psychological treatment), an active control group (cognitive training), or a treatment as&#xD;
      usual control group. Evaluations will be conducted with, psychological health measures,&#xD;
      cognitive assessments, and with biological markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in comparison with the control conditions, the response to&#xD;
      psychological treatment will be associated with improved psychological health and improved&#xD;
      cellular protection.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden of cognitive impairment is severe, and often hinders affected people to act&#xD;
      independently in daily life, and their families frequently carry a large burden. A great&#xD;
      challenge is to support the maintenance of cognitive health in order to avoid cognitive&#xD;
      disability. Individuals diagnosed with subjective cognitive decline (SCD [unimpaired&#xD;
      performance on cognitive tests]), mild cognitive impairment (MCI [Impaired performance on&#xD;
      cognitive tests]) are frequently affected by health issues (such as stress symptoms, anxiety,&#xD;
      and depression), as well as social avoidance due to the unclear prognosis of their cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction. Thus, the need for efficient psycho-social support are utterly needed both from&#xD;
      an individual- as well as a societal perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a novel psychological treatment manual focused on supporting&#xD;
      individuals with SCD and MCI. The treatment manual is centered on facilitating behavioral&#xD;
      change in accordance with personal values and long-term goals even in the presence of&#xD;
      negative experiences, as well as to promote meaningful life-style changes. The treatment&#xD;
      manual has its basis in the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) tradition, but the&#xD;
      investigators have strived to adapt the manual to suit a cognitively affected population with&#xD;
      for example with reminders, more sessions, validation techniques, repetition, and concrete&#xD;
      examples etc. Recent developments within CBT, particularly acceptance commitment therapy&#xD;
      (ACT), emphasize the utility of acceptance and mindfulness strategies, contrasting&#xD;
      interventions focused on reduction or control of symptoms. In brief, the treatment objective&#xD;
      in ACT and in our study is to improve functioning by increasing psychological flexibility.&#xD;
      Psychological flexibility is defined as the ability to notice and accept interfering&#xD;
      thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations without acting on them, to facilitate behaving in&#xD;
      accordance with personal values and long-term goals also in the presence of those negative&#xD;
      experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can the psychological treatment rationale with its focus on psychoeducation, validation,&#xD;
           exposure, and acceptance among other therapeutic techniques, preserve cognitive status,&#xD;
           increase life satisfaction, improve psychological health, show positive biological&#xD;
           changes in individuals with SCD/MCI?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are potential treatment effects maintained longitudinally?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can significant treatment predictors be identified on treatment outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How does the participants perceive the treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in comparison with the control conditions, the response to&#xD;
      psychological treatment will be associated with improved psychological health flexibility&#xD;
      (i.e., the ability to notice and accept interfering thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations&#xD;
      without acting on them, to facilitate behaving in accordance with personal values and&#xD;
      long-term goals also in the presence of those negative experiences), and improved cellular&#xD;
      protection (indexed by increased telomerase activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the Cognitive Centers at the Karolinska University Hospital,&#xD;
      Solna, and Huddinge within Stockholm metropolitan area, where they partake in cognitive&#xD;
      examination (i.e., neuropsychological assessments, anamnesis, biological markers etc.). These&#xD;
      patients will be younger than 70 years and will have received a diagnosis of SCD or MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identified patients receive verbal and written information about the project. In the next&#xD;
      step, patients that express interest for the project signs an informed consent and will then&#xD;
      be evaluated in a semi-structured interview, conducted by a psychologist at the Unit of&#xD;
      Behavioral Medicine at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Patients that&#xD;
      fulfill the inclusion criteria and considered suitable for treatment, are randomized. For the&#xD;
      randomization process, the investigators will engage the Karolinska Trial Alliance,&#xD;
      Stockholm, Sweden (https://karolinskatrialalliance.se/en/), that is a professional clinical&#xD;
      research center at Karolinska University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT design and groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group will receive psychological treatment (experimental group), one group will get&#xD;
      cognitive training (active control group), and one group will get the gold standard&#xD;
      treatment, which is health information (TAU). Participants need to be present for at least 75&#xD;
      % of the intervention and completed at least 75 % of the homework to be considered adherent.&#xD;
      All evaluation assessments will be conducted by blinded assessors. Participants cannot be&#xD;
      blinded to their group assignment, which is typical of nonpharmacological intervention&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated with the R package SIMR, which allows power calculations of Linear&#xD;
      Mixed Models (LMM). The sample size estimate is based on changes in our primary outcome,&#xD;
      AAQ2. The model included the interaction of time (pre- versus post-test 1; continuous) and&#xD;
      group (experimental versus active control; factor). The model also had subject ID (factor) as&#xD;
      a random effect to account for repeated measurements. The analysis showed that to get a&#xD;
      significant difference between the experimental group and the active control group we need at&#xD;
      least 40 participants (to have 93% power) in each group. We expect a 15% attrition rate, so&#xD;
      an initial recruitment of 138 (46 in each group) participants should ensure that about 120&#xD;
      participants remain in the final sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has an approved ethical application (Dnr. 2018/2057-31) by the Regional Ethical&#xD;
      Committee in Stockholm and follows the Declaration of Helsinki. Cognitive impairments are&#xD;
      often related to progressive decline in cognitive and intellectual abilities. Thus, there is&#xD;
      a risk that patients may progress in their decline during the period in which they are&#xD;
      included. The investigators therefore need to be watchful on potential progression, and&#xD;
      referral to other health care units can be needed if the patient's conditions are changing to&#xD;
      the worse. The treatment/rehabilitation might in some cases be perceived as psychologically&#xD;
      tough when it comes to behavioral changes. This is not unique for the current study, but&#xD;
      often a part of any psychological clinical treatment/rehabilitation. To provide qualified&#xD;
      support to the patients, only professional clinicians will interact with the participants.&#xD;
      Most of them will be licensed and sanctioned by the Social Board of Health and Welfare&#xD;
      (Socialstyrelsen) who is governed by ethical guidelines and the need to protect the patients&#xD;
      and their personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT will be analyzed with analysis of covariance (ANCOVAS) considering group-by-time&#xD;
      interaction, main effect of group, and main effect of time analysis. The cognitive diagnosis,&#xD;
      gender, age, and education will be included in the model as covariates of interest.&#xD;
      Individual growth curves will also be analyzed. To predict the outcome of the treatments,&#xD;
      artificial intelligence (AI) methods such as support vector machine learning (SVM) will be&#xD;
      used. Briefly, SVM procedures consider each variable as one dimension in a multi-dimensional&#xD;
      hyperplane structure within which the SVM algorithm searches for the best separation of&#xD;
      multi-dimensional data points where each point corresponds to a participant which is labelled&#xD;
      as belonging to different classes. The investigators will use Principal Component Analysis&#xD;
      (PCA) to select the input variables for the SVM procedures, and mixed models to test within&#xD;
      and between participant changes over time and explore causal effects. The investigators will&#xD;
      also conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of dropout. The qualitative approach&#xD;
      will be conducted in line with Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research&#xD;
      (COREQ).&#xD;
