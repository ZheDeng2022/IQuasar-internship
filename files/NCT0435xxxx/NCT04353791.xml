  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase Ib/IIa to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral treatment with OST-122 in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis over 28 days. This trial will also&#xD;
      explore pharmacokinetics (PK) profile and preliminary therapeutic efficacy associated with&#xD;
      OST-122 through biomarker analysis and clinical, endoscopic and histologic assessments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OST-122 is an oral, gut-restricted and subtype-selective Jak3/Tyk2/Ark5 inhibitor for the&#xD;
      local treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's&#xD;
      disease and, potentially, fibrotic lesions in Crohn's patients. The compound was well&#xD;
      tolerated in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and has been shown to be stable during the&#xD;
      GI transit, while no significant plasma levels were detected. The gut-restricted PK profile&#xD;
      of OST-122 lowers the risk of systemic toxicities inherent to other JAK inhibitors. In the&#xD;
      current proof of concept study, the compound's safety, PK profile and trends of efficacy will&#xD;
      be investigated in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
