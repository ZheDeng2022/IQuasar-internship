      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Complete removal of irritants is not possible with mechanical therapy alone.&#xD;
      Adjunctive use of systemic administration of antibiotics results in the distribution of drug&#xD;
      throughout the body, which can give rise to toxicity. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a&#xD;
      constituent of Curcuma longa plant, which possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and&#xD;
      anti-microbial properties. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of curcumin oral&#xD;
      gel on the anti-inflammatory chemokines (IL_8) in the gingival crevicular fluid and to&#xD;
      compare the effects of the curcumin gel as an adjunct to sub gingival scaling and root&#xD;
      planing with the effect achieved using sub gingival scaling and root planing alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty systemically healthy patients either male or female with chronic periodontitis aged&#xD;
      between 30 and 45 years with pocket depth of 5-7 mm affecting at least two nonadjacent sites&#xD;
      will be included. A split mouth design will be followed and the patients will receive a&#xD;
      complete prophylaxis including scaling and root planning. In the experimental site scaling&#xD;
      and root planing to be performed, followed by placement of the curcumin gel and periodontal&#xD;
      pack application. In the control site, sub gingival scaling and root planning alone will be&#xD;
      performed followed by periodontal pack application. collecting of GCF from the pocket which&#xD;
      will be followed the same site for each visit to determine the level of IL_8 by ELISA and&#xD;
      measurement of the clinical Parameters to be included: PLI (plaque index), BOP (bleeding on&#xD;
      probing), PPD (probing pocket depth) and RAL (relative attachment level). These parameters&#xD;
      will be recorded on day 0 and 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of curcumin oral gel on the anti inflammatory chemokines (IL_8) in&#xD;
      the gingival crevicular fluid and to compare the effects of the curcumin gel as an adjunct to&#xD;
      sub gingival scaling and root planning with the effect achieved using sub gingival scaling&#xD;
      and root planing alone in the treatment of (5-7 mm) periodontal pockets on clinical&#xD;
      Parameters: PLI (plaque index), BOP (bleeding on probing) , PPD (probing pocket depth) and&#xD;
      RAL (relative attachment level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy of sub gingival application of curcumin gel as an adjunct to&#xD;
           SRP in the treatment of (5-7 mm) periodontal pockets on clinical periodontal parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the concentration of IL-8 in gingival crevicular fluid before and after&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin gel may have anti-inflammatory effect by reducing IL-8 and may have effect on&#xD;
      clinical Parameters: PLI (plaque index), BOP (bleeding on probing) , PPD (probing pocket&#xD;
      depth) and RAL (relative attachment level) in the treatment of periodontal pockets .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be no difference in treatment of periodontal pocket by scaling and root planning&#xD;
      and by scaling and root planning adjunct by curcumin oral gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Double blind, prospective , bio clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: AL-Najaf dental specialized center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty systemically healthy patients either male or female with chronic periodontitis aged&#xD;
      between 30 and 45 years with pocket depth of 5-7 mm affecting at least two nonadjacent sites&#xD;
      will be included. A split mouth design will be followed and the patients will receive a&#xD;
      complete prophylaxis including scaling and root planing. Selected sites will be randomized&#xD;
      into control and experimental sites. In the experimental site scaling and root planing to be&#xD;
      performed, followed by placement of the curcumin gel and periodontal pack application. In the&#xD;
      control site, sub gingival scaling and root planing alone will be performed followed by&#xD;
      periodontal pack application. collecting of GCF from the pocket which will be followed the&#xD;
      same site for each visit to determine the level of IL_8 by ELISA and measurement of the&#xD;
      clinical Parameters to be included: PLI (plaque index), BOP (bleeding on probing), PPD&#xD;
      (probing pocket depth) and RAL (relative attachment level). These parameters will be recorded&#xD;
      on day 0 and 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure/intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      collecting of GCF from the pocket which will be followed the same site for each visit to&#xD;
      determine the level of IL_8 by ELISA and measuring of the clinical parameters: PLI (plaque&#xD;
      index), BOP (bleeding on probing) , PPD (probing pocket depth) and RAL (relative attachment&#xD;
      level) prior to the each procedure. The pocket will randomly have selected for both groups.&#xD;
      PD will be measured with UNC 15 mm probe, acrylic stent as a guide for reproducibility from&#xD;
      the gingival margin to base of the pocket. To achieve concealment, the patient will be&#xD;
      blinded about intervention which side is test and which side is control. Before baseline&#xD;
      (baseline regarded as first visit) we do oral hygiene motivation and supra gingival scaling&#xD;
      only. At first visit (baseline ) day 0 will include collecting GCF from pocket of both side (&#xD;
      test and control ) to determine the level of IL_8 by ELISA and measurement of the clinical&#xD;
      parameters : PLI (plaque index) , BOP (bleeding on probing), PPD (probing pocket depth) and&#xD;
      RAL (relative attachment level) it also include sub gingival scaling and root planing for&#xD;
      both side and curcumin gel will be inserted to the pocket of tested group with a 2 ml&#xD;
      disposable syringe equipped with a blunted 25-gauge needle, which is bent along its shank&#xD;
      after that periodontal dressing (Coe- Pak) will be used to cover the pocket on both side so&#xD;
      as to prevent the ingress of oral fluids as well as to allow the retention of the material&#xD;
      within the pocket. The first visit will also include oral hygiene instructions. Subjects will&#xD;
      be recalled after 7 days, for periodontal dressing to be removed and curcumin gel will be&#xD;
      inserted to the pocket of tested group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second visit (after thirty day)will include collecting GCF from the same previous site of&#xD;
      pocket on both side to determine the level of IL_8 by ELISA and measurement of the clinical&#xD;
      parameters : PLI (plaque index) , BOP (bleeding on probing), PPD (probing pocket depth) and&#xD;
      RAL (relative attachment level).To ensure excellent collection of GCF, we must make sure the&#xD;
      sites should be dried and not contaminated by saliva or blood, using cotton rolls, gentle&#xD;
      force should be applied to avoid bleeding and the periocol strip should be inserted for 30&#xD;
      seconds, the sample will be transferred into eppendrof tubes and stored in -20 c until the&#xD;
      completion of the samples collections, the tube will be allocated to the patient'code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the clinical parameters in the recall visit, separation of the GCF will be done&#xD;
      by the following procedure : each sample will be micro centerfuged at 400-500g for 4-5 min&#xD;
      then diluted by 500 microliter phosphate buffered saline and stored overnight in 4c to&#xD;
      achieve optimal protein elusion. the periocol is then removed and the supernatants will be&#xD;
      assayed by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total level of the IL_8 will be determined by using ELISA kits according to the&#xD;
      manufacture instruction.&#xD;
