  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility of using Indocyanine Green in the laparoscopic surgical treatment&#xD;
      of benign organic ovarian cysts (dermoid, serous, mucinous and endometriotic) in patients&#xD;
      with a short-term desire for pregnancy. The use of Indocyanine Green during this surgery&#xD;
      could allow early evaluation of the absence of alteration of the underlying ovary by the&#xD;
      cystectomy. To do so, the fluorescence scores (indocyanine green staining) need to be&#xD;
      compared to the ovarian reserve of the patient, previously verified intraoperatively and&#xD;
      postoperatively at M6 and M12, these scores being determined according to the vascularization&#xD;
      visualized in laparoscopy and established both by a double visual notation (Likert scale) and&#xD;
      by a computer software (METAMORPH) objective notation. This procedure would, in patients with&#xD;
      fertility disorders or wishing for pregnancy in the short run, reassure them about their&#xD;
      reproductive potential immediately after the intervention. In the event of poor staining, if&#xD;
      correlated by a decrease in ovarian reserve, the concerned patients could be referred to a&#xD;
      MPA treatment facility much earlier in the postoperative period or, if no desire for&#xD;
      immediate pregnancy, towards fertility preservation methods.&#xD;

      The study will be open to any patient meeting the inclusion / exclusion criteria, scheduled&#xD;
      for intraperitoneal cystectomy or cyst destruction using Plasmajet, corresponding to a benign&#xD;
      organic cyst requiring surgical treatment according to current recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will proceed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment of patients during the preoperative consultation. The information form will&#xD;
           be given to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The day before the intervention: Inclusion proposed to the patient after re-explanation&#xD;
           of the objectives and the progress of the study, submission of the consent form for the&#xD;
           patient to sign. Realization of an ultrasound with count of antral follicles, and&#xD;
           description of the ovarian cyst (size, aspect, IOTA criteria). Performing a blood test&#xD;
           with AMH measurement to assess the preoperative ovarian reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The day of the intervention: Intraoperative, injection at the end of the procedure of a&#xD;
           bolus of indocyanine green intravenously. Studied through an infrared camera system -&#xD;
           the SPIES system (KARL STORZ GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) - fluorescence within&#xD;
           the ovary will bring out the vascularization of the area of cystectomy or destruction of&#xD;
           the cyst. Evaluation of the degree of fluorescence (between 0 and 4, on the model of a&#xD;
           Likert scale) carried out at the area of cystectomy or destruction of the cyst. Then,&#xD;
           the second evaluation technique using the METAMORPH software will assign a raw and&#xD;
           objective score according to the fluorescence visualized. The 2 evaluation results will&#xD;
           be compared with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperatively: there will be no special clinical or biological monitoring. If&#xD;
           undesirable effects related to Indocyanine Green occur, they will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After discharge, as part of her standard follow-up for short-term desire for pregnancy:&#xD;
           she will have a postoperative consultation planned 1 month after the intervention,&#xD;
           followed by examination at 6 months and 12 months with an ultrasound for evaluation CFA&#xD;
           and blood work with AMH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any natural pregnancy will be noted.&#xD;

    <description>A fluorescence score based on a Likert scale will be used. The presence of fluorescence will correspond to a success, defined by a value on the scale strictly greater than 0. The absence of fluorescence will be a failure, defined as equal to 0. The judgment criterion will therefore be binary (fluorescence uptake or no at the area of cystectomy), allowing the feasibility judgement.</description>

A fluorescence score between 0 and 4 (on the model of a Likert scale) will be used for the evaluation of fluorescence.&#xD;
A second reading of the Likert scale results will be carried out by a second inspector so that the score is as objective as possible. Then, second evaluation technique realized by the METAMORPH software, which will assign a raw and objective score according to the fluorescence visualized.</description>
