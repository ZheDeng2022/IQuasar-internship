    <measure>Hematologic response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Hematologic response&quot; is defined as subjects having blood counts.&#xD;
&quot;Effective&quot; when 2 or more of the following criteria: Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500/ μL Platelet count &gt; 20,000/ μL Reticulocyte count &gt; 60,000/ μL&#xD;
For subjects of Aplastic Anemia Stage 2b or 3 at the baseline, hematological response will be &quot;effective&quot; when the bellow-mentioned criteria are met and Stage is improved at the same time.&#xD;
Improvement in counts that are dependent upon exogenously administered growth factors or transfusion will not be considered as fulfilling response criteria.</description>

             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of aplastic anemia by bone marrow aspiration/biopsy findings&#xD;
             and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must meet the following criteria of moderate and above aplastic anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent/assent as described in Appendix 1, which&#xD;
             includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed&#xD;
             consent document (ICD)/assent document and in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          -  Eligible and willing to have a sibling allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of a myelodysplastic syndrome (except for refractory cytopenia in children),&#xD;
             as well as other primitive marrow disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or clinical suspicion of congenital aplastic anemia (Fanconi anemia,&#xD;
             Congenital keratosis, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignant tumors with active disease within 5 years from study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding participants.&#xD;

             aminotransferase (ALT) or total bilirubin values &gt;5 × upper limit of normal (ULN),&#xD;
             and/or creatinine value &gt;2 × ULN].&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior immunosuppressive therapy with lymphocyte-depleting agents/therapies, including&#xD;
             both non-B-cell selective and B-cell-depleting agents (e.g., alefacept, alemtuzumab,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined&#xD;
             by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of investigational&#xD;
             product used in this study (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant&#xD;
             abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results&#xD;
             (e.g., baseline corrected QT [QTc] interval &gt;450 msec, complete left bundle branch&#xD;
             block [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate-age myocardial infarction, ST-T&#xD;
             interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second- or third-degree&#xD;
             atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the&#xD;
             baseline uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450 msec, this interval should be rate-corrected&#xD;
             using the Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making&#xD;
             and reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be&#xD;
             repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to&#xD;
             determine the participant's eligibility. Computer-interpreted ECGs should be overread&#xD;
             by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and&#xD;
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or&#xD;
             Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
