  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic digital ulcers (DUs) are a frequent complication in systemic sclerosis with a major&#xD;
      impact on hand function and quality of life. Digital injection of autologous cultured&#xD;
      adipose-derived stromal constitutes a promising approach to treat scleroderma-induced&#xD;
      refractory ischemic DUs where no alternative therapy is validated. The aim of this phase 2&#xD;
      study is to compare efficacy and safety of digital injection of autologous cultured&#xD;
      adipose-derived stromal cell versus placebo for healing refractory active ischemic digital&#xD;
      ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by an&#xD;
      autoimmune-mediated microangiopathy and progressive fibrosis. Ischemic digital ulcers (DUs)&#xD;
      are frequent in the disease course. DUs are an expression of the severity of the&#xD;
      microangiopathy. DUs lead to pain, infection, gangrene, autoamputation, impaired hand use and&#xD;
      impaired quality of life. The management of DUs is often based on optimal wound care to&#xD;
      promote healing and and repeated hospitalizations to perform onerous prostacyclin infusions&#xD;
      to reduce pain and accelerate healing. With optimal standard of care, only 60% of DUs are&#xD;
      healed after 3 months and 46.2% experiences recurrence during that time among them 11.2%&#xD;
      experiences a chronic evolution. No drug has demonstrated a positive effect on refractory DUs&#xD;
      healing. The rational underlying the use of cultured adipose-derived stromal cell (ASC) in&#xD;
      this indication is based on the finding of ASC, in vitro and in vivo, angiogenic and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory potential in other ischemic pathologies, with an excellent safety profile.&#xD;
      The pilot phase of the ACellDREAM trial demonstrated the feasibility and safety of autologous&#xD;
      ASC transplantation in patients with non- revascularizable critical limb ischemia and showed&#xD;
      improvement in ulcer evolution and wound healing. The EFS-O culture procedure safety is&#xD;
      validated and is already in use in ongoing French and European clinical trials. Two pilot&#xD;
      studies showed the safety of autologous adipose tissue grafting for scleroderma-Induced DU.&#xD;
      The SCLERADEC pilot study outlines the safety, in 12 SSc patients, of the digital injection&#xD;
      of adipose- derived autologous stromal vascular fraction, which is a heterogeneous population&#xD;
      of cells including only 36% of uncultured ASC. An improvement in hand disability, quality of&#xD;
      life and DUs was observed, the phase II is ongoing. The hypothesis of the study is that&#xD;
      digital injection of autologous cultured adipose-derived stromal cell could be efficacious&#xD;
      for scleroderma-induced refractory ischemic DUs healing by digital vascular regeneration in a&#xD;
      clinical situation where no alternative therapy is validated.&#xD;
