    <time_frame>Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a general dermatology questionnaire that consists of 10 items that assess participant health-related quality of life (daily activities, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, leisure, work and school, and treatment). It has been extensively used in clinical trials for AD. The DLQI is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument that has been translated into several languages, and the DLQI total scores have been shown to be responsive to change. The minimally important difference for the DLQI has been estimated as a 2-5 point change from baseline. Each item is scored as &quot;very much (3)&quot;, &quot;a lot (2)&quot;, &quot;a little (1)&quot; and &quot;not at all (0)&quot;. The score can range from 0 to 30. The higher values represent the worse dermatology life quality</description>
