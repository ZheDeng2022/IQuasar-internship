  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of&#xD;
      the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as adjunctive treatment for treatment-refractory opioid use&#xD;
      disorder. This study will include 3 individuals with opioid use disorder and relapsing opioid&#xD;
      use despite active participation in a drug addiction treatment program.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three (N = 3) subjects with treatment refractory opioid use disorder will receive bilateral&#xD;
      DBS implants in the NAc using the Abbott Medical Infinity DBS system. The primary outcome of&#xD;
      this study is to demonstrate the safety of bilateral NAc DBS in patients with&#xD;
      treatment-refractory opioid use disorder. Secondary outcomes include time to relapse,&#xD;
      remission of opioid use, and change in opioid craving scores. Other secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      include the following: Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS), neurophysiological tests, body weight&#xD;
      and biochemical markers of health and nutrition. If effective, DBS may reduce opioid use and&#xD;
      opioid relapse in people with opioid use disorder who may continue to display relapse despite&#xD;
      ongoing multidisciplinary standard of care. DBS brain electrode implantation and implantation&#xD;
      of the IPGs and extension wires will be done in the operating room and will require the&#xD;
      subject to be admitted post-operatively for an overnight stay. Two weeks after the DBS&#xD;
      operation, subjects will undergo systematic testing each of the quadripolar contacts and&#xD;
      formal programming. Subsequent parameter settings will be changed at routine outpatient&#xD;
      visits based on clinical effects. Standard of care can consist of methadone or buprenorphine&#xD;
      maintenance treatment provided by an addiction specialist.&#xD;
