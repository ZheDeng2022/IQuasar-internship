  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the most aggressive kind of brain cancer and leads on average to 20 years of&#xD;
      life lost, more than any other cancer. MRI images of the brain are taken before the&#xD;
      operation, and every few months after treatment, to see if the cancer regrows. It can be hard&#xD;
      for doctors to tell if what they see in these images represent growing cancer or a sideeffect&#xD;
      of treatment. The similarity of the appearance of the treatment side-effects to cancer is&#xD;
      confusing and is known as &quot;pseudoprogression&quot; (as opposed to true cancer progression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If doctors mistake the appearance of treatment side-effects for growing cancer, they may&#xD;
      think that the treatment is failing and change the patient's treatment too early or put them&#xD;
      into a clinical trial. This means that patients may not be given the full treatment and the&#xD;
      results from some clinical trials cannot be trusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to provide doctors with a computer program that will use MRI images&#xD;
      of the brain that are routinely obtained throughout treatment, in order to help them more&#xD;
      accurately identify when the cancer regrows.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of pseudoprogression is significant on patient care and medical research. The&#xD;
      existing evidence shows that it is feasible to use Support Vector Machine and Deep Learning&#xD;
      classification models for predicting survival using routine MRI images as well as&#xD;
      differentiating progression from pseudoprogression. The investigators wish to capture signal&#xD;
      changing over time in routine MRI images using parametric response maps (via a&#xD;
      state-of-the-art postoperative-to preoperative image registration method that they have&#xD;
      developed) and use such classifiers to differentiate progression from pseudoprogression. The&#xD;
      research the investigators are proposing is needed in order to provide a solution to the&#xD;
      problem of pseudoprogression and be implemented across the NHS easily and efficiently.&#xD;
      Importantly, this does not depend on advanced imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected at KCH from the last 24 months shows that, even at a leading glioma imaging&#xD;
      centre, only 66% of patients had advanced imaging (e.g. DSC-MRI) performed at the time of&#xD;
      increase in contrast-enhancement i.e. possible progression. The primary aim of this research&#xD;
      is to use routine clinical MRI data in order to train the classifier. This will increase the&#xD;
      utility of the classifier, as such routine MRI data can be acquired by all imaging centres,&#xD;
      and the new classifier can therefore provide a much more cost-efficient solution than an&#xD;
      alternative classifier which may depend on advanced imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial training, testing and cross validation of a classification model will be carried out&#xD;
      using MRI data of glioblastoma obtained from publicly-accessible imaging archives and King's&#xD;
      College Hospital (KCH), London. For clinical validation, the trained model will undergo&#xD;
      testing using MRI data from patients recruited prospectively.&#xD;
