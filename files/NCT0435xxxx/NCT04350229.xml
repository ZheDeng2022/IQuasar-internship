  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for patients with high-risk breast cancer diagnoses is based on chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      with side effects. Dexamethasone is a drug that is part of the arsenal of pre-chemotherapy&#xD;
      medications to prevent adverse events resulting from treatment, however common endocrine&#xD;
      pathological conditions resulting from high doses of this corticoid are clinically evident in&#xD;
      these individuals. The aim of this study is to evaluate the omission of corticosteroid doses&#xD;
      as a pre-medication in cancer treatment after the second week of treatment with taxane in a&#xD;
      curative setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Treatment for patients with diagnoses of high-risk breast cancer is based on chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs such as anthracyclines and taxanes and its main side effects described are cardiac&#xD;
      toxicity and hypersensitivity and / or allergic reactions, respectively. Dexamethasone is a&#xD;
      drug that is part of the arsenal of pre-chemotherapy medications to prevent adverse events&#xD;
      resulting from treatment, however common endocrine pathological conditions resulting from&#xD;
      high doses of this corticoid are clinically evident in these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These changes certainly have a negative impact on the patient's quality of life, however,&#xD;
      with early recognition and the treatment of hypercortisolemia, we can lead to a reduction in&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the omission of corticosteroid doses as&#xD;
      pre-medication in cancer treatment after the second week of treatment with taxane in a&#xD;
      setting with curative intent can prevent or decrease the incidence of endocrinological&#xD;
      changes, and what is its impact on treatment and on quality of life of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized clinical study, without blinding as a research strategy&#xD;
      used to increase the validity of clinical trials that evaluate the effect of interventions&#xD;
      (eg, drugs or exercise). The process involves randomly assigning participants to an&#xD;
      intervention group or to a control group and requires that participants have an equal chance&#xD;
      of being allocated to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be recruited 86 patients diagnosed with breast cancer with indication for neoadjuvant or&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment with the standard ICESP protocol.&#xD;

    <description>To compare change in Quality of Life, as defined by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) during chemotherapy. The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) uses for the questions 1 to 28 a 4-point scale. The scale scores from 1 to 4: 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;), 2 (&quot;A little&quot;), 3 (&quot;Quite a bit&quot;) and 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 3.&#xD;
For the raw score, less points are considered to have a better outcome. The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) uses for the questions 29 and 30 a 7-points scale.&#xD;
The scale scores from 1 to 7: 1 (&quot;very poor&quot;) to 7 (&quot;excellent&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 6. First of all, raw score has to be calculated with mean values. Afterwards linear transformation is performed to be comparable. More points are considered to have a better outcome.</description>
