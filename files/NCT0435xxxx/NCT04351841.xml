  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary fiber is an important nutrient that supports gastrointestinal function, as well as&#xD;
      the maintenance of blood glucose and cholesterol. Additionally, it is suggested that dietary&#xD;
      fiber may provide other health benefits, such as maintenance of healthy weight through&#xD;
      effects on satiety. Furthermore, dietary fiber can improve health by modulating the microbial&#xD;
      communities residing in human gut, particularly in the large intestine. The microbes in the&#xD;
      gut modulate a wide variety of biological processes essential for health of the host.&#xD;
      Currently, the average intake of fiber in the U.S. is ~40-50% below adequate intake levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ResitAid, a Lonza's arabinogalactan, is a hemicellulose that is abundant in plants.&#xD;
      Arabinogalactans including ResitAid are found in seeds, leaves, roots, and fruit of higher&#xD;
      plants, such as cereals, beans, leeks, pear, corn, bark, and wheat. ResitAid, the&#xD;
      arabinogalactan ingredient used in this study, is isolated from larch (Larix laricina) using&#xD;
      a patented water-based extraction process. ResitAid has been designated as Generally&#xD;
      Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. FDA for multiple uses and has been used in numerous&#xD;
      previous clinical studies in humans, with no significant safety issues observed at intakes of&#xD;
      up to 30 g daily for up to 6 weeks. It was reported that 15 g and 30 g of different&#xD;
      preparation of arabinogalactan could significantly increase certain microbial populations&#xD;
      considered to be beneficial (e.g., Lactobacillus spp.). Nevertheless, more clinical evidence&#xD;
      is needed to support the effect of ResistAid on the microbial composition in the gut. This&#xD;
      study is designed to investigate the effect of daily consumption of 15 g of ResitAid on the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal microbial profile and fecal short-chain fatty acid contents in healthy&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Modulation of the microbiome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in Lactobacillus ssp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in Bifidobacterium ssp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Changes in SCFA&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Changes in bowel movement&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Changes in the SF-36 questionnaire&#xD;

      The study is a randomized, crossover, single-center trial with one screening visit (Visit 1;&#xD;
      Week -1) and 2 test periods [Test Period I (Visits 2, 3, and 4; Weeks 0, 3, and 6) and Test&#xD;
      Period II (Visits 5, 6, and 7; Weeks 9, 12 and 15)] separated by a minimum 3-week washout&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1 (Week -1), subjects will provide informed consent and undergo assessments of&#xD;
      medical history and medication/supplement use, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fasting&#xD;
      (12 ± 2 h) blood samples will be collected for chemistry and hematology. Subjects will be&#xD;
      counseled to exclude fermented foods or beverages that do or might contain live probiotics&#xD;
      (e.g., yogurt, kombucha). Subjects will also be dispensed a gastrointestinal (GI) and Bowel&#xD;
      Habits Diary and stool collection kit. Subjects will be instructed to complete the GI and&#xD;
      Bowel Habits Diary during the 3 days prior to Visit 2 (Week 0) and to collect fecal samples&#xD;
      from one bowel movement during the 3 days prior to Visit 2 (Week 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects will arrive at the clinic fasted (12 ± 2 h, water only) to&#xD;
      undergo clinic visit procedures. Adverse events (AE) will be assessed and the SF-36&#xD;
      Questionnaire will be administered. Fecal samples will be collected and the GI and Bowel&#xD;
      Habits Diary will be collected and reviewed. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a study&#xD;
      product for home consumption with or without breakfast in the morning. Subjects will be&#xD;
      dispensed a GI and Bowel Habits Diary and stool collection kit and will be instructed to&#xD;
      complete the diary during the 3 days immediately prior to Visit 3 (Week 3) and to collect&#xD;
      fecal samples from one bowel movement during the same 3 days immediately prior to Visit 3&#xD;
      (Week 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 3 (Week 3), subjects will return to the clinic for clinic visit procedures. AEs will&#xD;
      be assessed and the SF-36 Questionnaire will be administered. The fecal samples will be&#xD;
      collected and the GI and Bowel Habits Diary will be collected and reviewed. Study product&#xD;
      will be re-dispensed back to subjects for home consumption. Subjects will be dispensed a GI&#xD;
      and Bowel Habits Diary and stool collection kit and will be instructed to complete the diary&#xD;
      during the 3 days immediately prior to Visit 4 (Week 6) and to collect fecal samples during&#xD;
      the same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 4 (Week 6), subjects will arrive at the clinic fasted (12 ± 2 h, water only) to&#xD;
      undergo clinic visit procedures. AEs will be assessed and the SF-36 Questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered. Subjects will be queried about compliance with study instructions. The fecal&#xD;
      samples will be collected and GI and Bowel Habits Diary will be collected and reviewed.&#xD;
      Fasting (12 ± 2 h) blood samples will be collected for chemistry and hematology. Subjects&#xD;
      will be dispensed a stool collection kit and will be instructed to collect fecal samples from&#xD;
      one bowel movement during the 3 days immediately prior to Visit 5 (Week 9). Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to begin the 3-week washout period and return to the clinic to begin Test Period&#xD;
      II at Visit 5 (Week 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 5 (Week 9), subjects will return to the clinic fasted (12 ± 2 h, water only),&#xD;
      crossover to the other study product in their test sequence, and repeat the procedures from&#xD;
      Visits 2 (Week 0) with the exclusion of the randomization procedure. At Visit 6 (Week 12),&#xD;
      subjects will repeat the procedures from Visit 3 (Week 3) and at Visit 7 (Week 15), subjects&#xD;
      will repeat the procedures from Visit 4 (Week 6). Subjects will be dismissed at the end of&#xD;
      Visit 7.&#xD;

             starting from 2 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Week -1), with the exception of 7 days prior&#xD;
             to the stool collection period, during which consumption of these products are not&#xD;

&#xD;
         23. Has a condition the Clinical Investigator believes would interfere with his ability to&#xD;
             provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might confound the&#xD;
