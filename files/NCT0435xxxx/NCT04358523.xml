      The objective of this study is to evaluate potential drug interaction between RDV and SOF in&#xD;
      ASC18 tablets (RDV/SOF compound tablets) and the influence of food effect on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of ASC18 tablets were evaluated in healthy subjects -and compare the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters of ASC18 tablets（ravidasvir and sofosbuvir fixed dose&#xD;
      combination）with ravidasvir tablets and sofosbuvir tablets in healthy subjects after single&#xD;
      and multiple oral dosing.&#xD;

      This randomized, open-label, crossover study will evaluate the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      ASC18 (ravidasvir and sofosbuvir fixed dose combination) tablets as compared to ad hoc&#xD;
      combination of reference tablets of ravidasvir and sofosbuvir in healthy volunteers. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences to receive multiple oral doses of either&#xD;
      ASC18 tablets (ravidasvir and sofosbuvir fixed Dose Combination) or ravidasvir and sofosbuvir&#xD;
      as separate tablets. In the crossover design, subjects will participate in 2 study periods&#xD;
      with at least a 14-day washout between periods.&#xD;
