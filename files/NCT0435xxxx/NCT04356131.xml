      A total of 97 female students, 50 in the intervention group and 47 in the control group, were&#xD;
      included in this pretest-posttest design randomized controlled study. Massage and progressive&#xD;
      relaxation exercises are self-administered practices that are easy to adopt, with no side&#xD;
      effects, and have beneficial effects on pain, sweating, fatigue, and gastrointestinal and&#xD;
      central nervous system signs. So, it can be asserted that when applied together, massage and&#xD;
      progressive relaxation exercises could be more effective in reducing menstrual symptoms than&#xD;
      applying them separately.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysmenorrhea is one of the most frequent problems during menstruation and described as&#xD;
      periodic and painful pelvis menstruation among women at reproductive age. It is classified as&#xD;
      primary and secondary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is defined as suprapubic pelvis&#xD;
      pain with cramps that begin a couple hours before menstrual bleeding, after menstrual&#xD;
      bleeding, or during the last 12-72 hours of menstruation and occur repeatedly without organic&#xD;
      pathology. PD is associated with an increase in prostaglandin production in the endometrium,&#xD;
      which causes pain by increasing uterine contractions in the suprapubic region. According to&#xD;
      De Sanctis et al., PD prevalence varies between 16% and 93%. It is often seen with sweating,&#xD;
      fatigue, gastrointestinal system signs (lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), and&#xD;
      central nervous system signs (dizziness, headache, syncope, and lack of concentration). These&#xD;
      symptoms that occur just before or just after menstrual bleeding among women with normal&#xD;
      pelvic anatomy may prevent them from attending school and work or joining social activities.&#xD;
      Secondary dysmenorrhea is defined as menstrual pain caused by a pathology in the pelvis such&#xD;
      as endometriosis. If a patient has pain for 3-6 months, a more comprehensive evaluation of&#xD;
      chronic pelvic pain should be performed to evaluate the potential etiologies of secondary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The international literature includes oral contraceptive, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, and&#xD;
      sedative drugs for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. However, the fact that some of&#xD;
      these drugs cause side effects such as indigestion, headache, drowsiness, and substance&#xD;
      addiction causes individuals to remain indifferent to them. In Turkey, it is reported that&#xD;
      women prefer their family members as the first source of information and therefore use&#xD;
      individual methods (massage, herbal teas, hot application, lying down, sweet food&#xD;
      consumption, etc.) rather than pharmacological treatments due to cultural differences in&#xD;
      coping with PD. Complementary and integrated therapy approaches, which are widely used all&#xD;
      over the world today, have become common in coping with gynecological disorders among women&#xD;
      in recent years. Some studies state that PD can be cured using such complementary therapies&#xD;
      as essential oil acids, vitamins, acupuncture, herbal medicines, aromatherapy, reflexology,&#xD;
      acupressure, massage, sports, and exercise. However, ACOG emphasizes that although these&#xD;
      methods are frequently used by patients, they have not been studied enough yet, and mostly&#xD;
      supports the use of exercise, high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and&#xD;
      topical heat to help manage dysmenorrhea symptoms. Research on PD has applied massage and&#xD;
      exercise practices using different application protocols. Studies on massage applications&#xD;
      have examined the effect of inhaling herbal essential oils alone or together with massage.&#xD;
      Research solely on exercise has examined the effectiveness of long-term and regular exercise,&#xD;
      although with various practices. However, it can be said that massage and progressive&#xD;
      relaxation exercises are more advantageous than other methods because they are easy,&#xD;
      economical, and can be applied without the need for someone else.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Massage intensifies the blood flow in the area of application and reduces muscle tension. It&#xD;
      also increases endorphin secretion and raises the pain threshold. Relaxation exercises, on&#xD;
      the other hand, provide a decrease in sympathetic activity, an increase in parasympathetic&#xD;
      activity and consequently a widening of the peripheral vessels, an increase in blood flow in&#xD;
      the blood vessels, and a decrease in muscle tension and pain perception. Moreover, it has&#xD;
      been reported that pain, anxiety, and depression symptoms decrease as a result of the&#xD;
      decrease in the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, thanks to the deep breathing&#xD;
      exercises performed during PRE. Therefore, it is predicted that massage combined with PRE&#xD;
      will be beneficial in PD management. In this sense, this study was conducted to examine the&#xD;
      effect of massage and PRE together on pain severity and other menstrual symptoms in PD&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature includes no studies on the use of massage and PRE together in PD management.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine the effect of massage and PRE together&#xD;
      on pain intensity and other menstrual symptoms in the management of PD.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study was done experimentally in pre-test and post-test design and randomized controlled model among students with PD.&#xD;
The sample size was calculated with power analysis. According to calculations, it was found that 58 students were enough for sampling through 95% of power value, 0.05 of confidence interval and 0.88 of effect size. Students who were determined to meet sampling and inclusion criteria through questionnaire and accepted to participate in the study were assigned into the experimental and control groups through randomization.&#xD;
During the follow-up of the three menstruation periods, the number of groups was increased in case of drop-out and 100 students were included. However, the study was completed with a total of 97 students -50 students for the experimental group and 47 students for the control group- because 3 students of the control group withdrew from the study in the second month.</intervention_model_description>

Without any application by the control group the form is filled in after pain start.&#xD;
In the form, pain quality is determined with 15 descriptors that describe sensory (first 11) and affective pain (last 4). Dimension of pain is evaluated to demonstrate the intensity by using a rating of 0-3 (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Pain quality scores of sensory pain (0-33 score), of affective pain (0-12 score) and of total (0- 45 score) are obtained. A rise in total pain quality score indicates a rise in pain sensory. In the study in order to provide an overall intensity score; Visual analog scale is included in the scale. Visual analog scale suggests general pain intensity.</description>

Without any application by the control group &quot;Daily Symptom Rating Scale&quot; form is filled in after menstrual symptoms start.&#xD;

    <description>Students in the experimental group were taught about massage and progressive relaxation exercises (PRE). The phases of the massage and PRE trainings were first explained by being demonstrated by the author on herself. In the meantime, the trainings were video-taped and uploaded to the mobile phones of the students. After the author, each student was made to perform massage and PRE. Both the exercises and massage techniques were daily performed 3 times a day after pain had started and relaxation exercises lasted 30 minutes whereas massage was performed for 15 minutes consecutively</description>
