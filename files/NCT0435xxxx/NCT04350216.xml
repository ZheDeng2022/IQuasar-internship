  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a condition associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CV), primarily as a result of accelerated atherosclerosis . Patients with RA also&#xD;
      have a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) The state of chronic inflammation in RA&#xD;
      patients contributes to increased CV risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deregulation of both genetic and serological adipocines, MS biomarkers, and biomarkers of&#xD;
      endothelial activation and inflammation also contributes to the increased CV risk in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increased incidence of abnormal carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) values and carotid&#xD;
      plaques, considered surrogate markers of subclinical atherosclerotic disease, has also been&#xD;
      described in patients with RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a noninvasive imaging technique&#xD;
      useful for the evaluation of inflammation (by 18F-FDG uptake) and mineralization (by 18F-NaF&#xD;
      uptake) in carotid atheroma plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis and RA share many common inflammatory pathways, and the mechanisms that lead&#xD;
      to synovial inflammation are similar to those seen in atherosclerotic plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin (IL)-6 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in both the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      RA and the development of atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarilumab is a human monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor that has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in patients with RA, improving symptoms, as well as at the functional and&#xD;
      radiographic levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with IL-6 receptor inhibitors has been described to result in a modulation of lipid&#xD;
      metabolism, mediated by a reduction in lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) and an improvement in the&#xD;
      anti-oxidant function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) . In this regard, Sarilumab may have&#xD;
      beneficial effects in RA patients on MS, which is implicated in the development of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information regarding the beneficial effect of IL-6 receptor blockade on atheroma plaque&#xD;
      formation and its effect at the vascular level in RA patients is scarce.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RA is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by chronic and erosive arthritis that&#xD;
      mainly involves peripheral joints. RA affects activities of daily living, significantly&#xD;
      decreasing the quality of life of affected patients. Several studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      RA patients are at higher risk of developing CV disease that is the main cause of premature&#xD;
      mortality and sudden death in these patients. In this sense, the increased risk of CV disease&#xD;
      observed in patients with RA is the result of a process of accelerated atherosclerosis. In&#xD;
      addition, a large meta-analysis also found an increased prevalence of obesity, dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      and hypertension, alterations in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, which are&#xD;
      features of MS, in patients with RA. Such characteristics are associated with inflammation&#xD;
      and endothelial dysfunction, an early step of atherosclerosis. Besides traditional CV risk&#xD;
      factors, the chronic inflammatory state present in these patients also contributes to the&#xD;
      increased CV risk in RA. Moreover, CV risk in RA patients is further enhanced by a&#xD;
      dysregulation both at the genetic and serological level of adipokines, MS-related biomarkers,&#xD;
      biomarkers of endothelial activation and inflammation, which appear to be crucial in the&#xD;
      development of atherosclerotic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, an adequate identification of patients at risk to develop CV events is needed.&#xD;
      In this regard, carotid ultrasound and PET/CT are non-invasive techniques used to assess the&#xD;
      extension and severity of atherosclerosis in RA. In this sense, molecular imaging techniques&#xD;
      have the potential to study 'in vivo' the metabolic processes in the carotid atheroma. In&#xD;
      fact, the incidence of abnormal cIMT values as well as the frequency of carotid plaques,&#xD;
      which are surrogate markers of subclinical atherosclerotic disease, has been found increased&#xD;
      in RA patients. In addition, it is well known that inflammation and mineralization are&#xD;
      simultaneous phenomena in the atheroma plaque formation. In this regard, the uptake of&#xD;
      18F-FDG in relation with the inflammation of the carotid arteries has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      patients with RA. Consequently, 18F-FDG may be considered as an established technique to&#xD;
      evaluate the atheroma inflammation and to monitor the response to new anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      therapies. Likewise, active calcification (which has a relevant role in the early phase of&#xD;
      atherogenesis) measured by the uptake of 18F-NaF seems to be predominant over inflammation&#xD;
      (18F-FDG) in symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid atheroma. This biological behavior opens&#xD;
      new insights on the role of 18F-NaF in the study of calcification and in the identification&#xD;
      of the vulnerable carotid atheroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis and RA share many common inflammatory pathways, and the mechanisms leading to&#xD;
      synovial inflammation are similar to those found in atherosclerotic plaque. Indeed,&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines produced within locally affected joints in RA, such as IL-6, which&#xD;
      regulates both the innate and adaptive immune system with a pivotal role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of RA, are also central to the development of atherosclerosis. Specifically,&#xD;
      IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by a variety of cells types, including T-lymphocytes,&#xD;
      macrophages, monocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. This cytokine leads to the&#xD;
      production of acute phase proteins in the liver, including serum CRP, among others. The&#xD;
      production of IL-6 and thus CRP are key mediators of the systemic and local inflammation&#xD;
      observed in RA. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that IL-6 has been shown to be&#xD;
      significantly associated with atherosclerosis in RA patients. On the one hand, this molecule&#xD;
      plays a direct role in mediating IR by inhibiting insulin receptor signal transduction and&#xD;
      insulin action. On the other hand, IL-6 is independently predictive of endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and a reduction in its serum levels leads to decreased endothelial cell&#xD;
      activation in patients with RA. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the levels of&#xD;
      Lp(a), a lipoprotein with atherogenic and thrombogenic properties, are higher in individuals&#xD;
      with elevated IL-6 serum concentrations. Both IL-6 functions and its circulating levels are&#xD;
      partially controlled by its receptor (IL-6R). Several studies have demonstrated a favourable&#xD;
      effect on lipid metabolism with an anti-IL-6R treatment, besides reducing inflammatory&#xD;
      disease activity. Moreover, a modulation of lipid metabolism, mediated by reduction of Lp(a)&#xD;
      and improvement of the anti-oxidant role of HDL-cholesterol, has been reported in patients&#xD;
      with RA following anti-IL-6R treatment. In this sense, Sarilumab (the first fully human&#xD;
      anti-IL-6Rα monoclonal antibody) binds membrane-bound and soluble human IL-6R with high&#xD;
      affinity, thereby blocking IL-6 signaling, with no evidence of complement-dependent or&#xD;
      antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In preclinical studies, Sarilumab has been&#xD;
      shown to inhibit IL-6 signaling in a dose-dependent manner. In phase II studies, SC Sarilumab&#xD;
      was reasonably well tolerated and led to a decrease in acute-phase reactant levels, mainly in&#xD;
      CRP in patients with RA. In addition, in RA patients treated with Sarilumab in combination&#xD;
      with methotrexate, both drugs provided sustained clinical efficacy, significant improvements&#xD;
      in symptomatic, functional, and radiographic outcomes are shown. In this regard, although it&#xD;
      is plausible to think that the blockage of IL-6R may lead to a beneficial effect on&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and MetS in patients with RA, this potential effect has not been extensively&#xD;
      evaluated yet. With respect to this, little is known about the beneficial effect that IL-6R&#xD;
      blockade may cause in the formation of atheroma plaque as well as the net vascular effect of&#xD;
      lipids and lipoproteins changes in RA patients, which makes it a potent target of major&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking all these considerations into account, the aim of this study is to assess by PET/CT&#xD;
      the effect of Sarilumab in the carotid atheroma plaque (effect on the inflammatory component&#xD;
      as well as on mineralization) in patients diagnosed with RA over 6 months of Sarilumab&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
