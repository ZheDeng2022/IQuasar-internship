  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth loss can in many cases be treated with an artificial titanium root (dental implant) and&#xD;
      subsequent manufacture of a porcelain crown. After the tooth is lost bone resorption of the&#xD;
      existing jaw bone often occurs making implant placement difficult. Therefore, bone&#xD;
      augmentation is often necessary before implant placement. Six months after the bone&#xD;
      augmentation has been performed, the implant can be inserted into the jaw bone and after&#xD;
      additionally 6 months the final porcelain crown can be mounted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reconstruction of the jaw bone is often done by harvesting a bone block from the patient's&#xD;
      own jaw. The bone block is harvested typically from the posterior part of the lower jaw,&#xD;
      where after it is placed and fixated by screws in the part of the jaw where the bone is&#xD;
      missing. Finally, the bone graft is covered with artificial bone substitute and a collagen&#xD;
      membrane. Recent studies have suggested that adding platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membranes will&#xD;
      have an advantageously effect in reconstruction of the jaw bone and bone healing. PRF&#xD;
      membranes are derived from a blood sample of the patient and has been introduced to&#xD;
      accelerate soft tissue as well as bone healing. No comparative studies have been conducted in&#xD;
      humans for the time being evaluating the effect of PRF in conjunction with bone augmentation.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare a control group with a test group in which&#xD;
      the control group is treated in a standardized manner, while PRF is added to the bone graft&#xD;
      in the test group. After 6 months of bone healing, a dental implant can be inserted in both&#xD;
      groups using a standard technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the two groups, the following is examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The final treatment outcome of the dental implant focusing on clinical outcome,&#xD;
           radiologic outcome, aesthetic outcome, patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bone changes over time with a focus on volume changes. In addition, focus on soft tissue&#xD;
           healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bone healing assessed using bone biopsies taken in connection with the implant&#xD;
           installation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients is missing a tooth where bone augmentation is needed before an implant&#xD;
      can be inserted. A general study is conducted and patients are randomly assigned to a control&#xD;
      group (20 patients) and a test group (20 patients). The control group is treated with a&#xD;
      standard bone augmentation procedure. This is done in local anesthesia, where initially a&#xD;
      bone graft is removed from the back of the lower jaw. The gingiva corresponding to the&#xD;
      toothless area is loosened and the bone graft is fixed with 2 titanium screws before being&#xD;
      covered with a artificial bone substitute and a membrane to protect the bone graft during the&#xD;
      healing period. The test group is treated in the same way, however, a PRF-membrane is used&#xD;
      instead of the bone substitute material and the membrane. The PRF-membrane is prepared by&#xD;
      taking a blood sample from the arm (80 ml) as with a regular blood sample. The blood is&#xD;
      centrifuged, which transforms the blood into a platelet-rich membrane. Thus, the membrane is&#xD;
      produced 100% natural without any additives. However, the membranes contain growth factors&#xD;
      that have the potential to promote mucosal and bone healing. In both groups, common&#xD;
      penicillin (Amoxicillin / Clavulanic acid, 1000/250 mg) and painkillers (Ibuprofen, 400 mg x&#xD;
      4, supplemented with Panodil 1000 mg x 4) are given before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After six months, the dental implant is inserted using standard procedure in both groups. The&#xD;
      gingiva is set aside and perpendicular to the bone grafted area, a cylindrical bone tissue&#xD;
      biopsy (2 mm in diameter, approximately 8 mm long) is taken containing the applied bone graft&#xD;
      and the original jaw comb (for study 3). Then the previously inserted 2 titanium screws are&#xD;
      removed and the implant is inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After another six months, the final porcelain crown is made. The implant is exposed and a&#xD;
      healing cap is applied. After 2-3 weeks, the gum is healed, after which the final impression&#xD;
      is made to the crown, which the patient will have installed 1-2 weeks after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bone augmentation procedure, the implant installation and manufacturing of the porcelain&#xD;
      crown are characterized by minimal risks and complications. In bone augmentation, there is&#xD;
      minimal risk of altered sensation similar to the lower lip. It is typically of a temporary&#xD;
      nature but can be permanent in very rare cases. The implant operation, including subsequent&#xD;
      crown manufacturing, is performed in both groups by a standardized procedure, which is also&#xD;
      characterized by minimal risk of side effects and complications. Thus, numerous studies have&#xD;
      shown that implant treatment is characterized by a high implant survival of approx. 95% after&#xD;
      10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the treatment, a total of 3 scans of the jaw (for study2) as well as 3 ordinary&#xD;
      dental films are made for assessment of the jaw bone volume and as a control of the bone&#xD;
      around the implant. This radiation dose equals approximately 60 days of background radiation&#xD;
      in Denmark.&#xD;

      Project title: Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) membranes in lateral alveolar ridge augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Tooth loss induce extensive resorption of the alveolar ridge, thereby compromising&#xD;
      implant placement in a correct anatomical position. Therefore, various procedures for&#xD;
      alveolar ridge augmentation have been introduced. The most frequently used procedure includes&#xD;
      lateral alveolar ridge augmentation by an autogenous bone graft harvested from an intraoral&#xD;
      donor site. The bone graft is often covered by a resorbable collagen barrier membrane and an&#xD;
      anorganic bovine bone substitute to minimize the resorption of the autogenous bone graft&#xD;
      during the healing period. However, it has been indicated that the use of a barrier membrane&#xD;
      increases the risk of bone graft exposure, thereby significantly compromising the treatment&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological platelet rich fibrin (PRF) membranes derived from a blood sample of the patient&#xD;
      has been introduced to accelerate soft tissue as well as bone healing. In vitro studies have&#xD;
      revealed that PRF membranes may enhance proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts,&#xD;
      collagen protein production, and angiogenesis. The potential benefit of PRF membranes for&#xD;
      lateral alveolar ridge augmentation has been evaluated in one animal experiment only.&#xD;
      However, the use of PRF membranes in lateral alveolar ridge augmentation has not been&#xD;
      addressed in humans. Clinical studies using PRF membranes have indicated accelerated soft&#xD;
      tissue and bone healing in periodontal therapy, soft tissue reconstructive surgery, and&#xD;
      vertical alveolar ridge augmentation using the maxillary sinus lift procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of investigations, including hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the investigations is to evaluate the treatment outcome after lateral alveolar&#xD;
      ridge augmentation by using an autogenous bone graft covered by 1) a PRF membrane (test&#xD;
      group) or 2) an anorganic bovine bone substitute and a resorbable collagen barrier membrane&#xD;
      (control group) in a randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT) with focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: Outcome of the oral implant treatment with focus on clinical, radiographic,&#xD;
      esthetic, and socioeconomical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Soft tissue and bone healing with focus on volumetric changes. Study 3: Bone healing&#xD;
      by using histological and stereological methods. It is the investigator's hypothesis that&#xD;
      there are no differences between the test and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods A total of 40 patients with a healthy dentition are included at random&#xD;
      within the test (n=20) and control (n=20) group in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lateral alveolar ridge augmentation The lateral alveolar ridge augmentation is performed as&#xD;
      previously described. An autogenous bone graft is initially harvested from the mandible via&#xD;
      an intraoral approach. The lateral aspect of the posterior part of the mandible is exposed by&#xD;
      using a standard incision technique and the harvested bone graft is adjusted and fixated with&#xD;
      two titanium mini-screws as a lateral block graft. In the test group, a venous blood sample&#xD;
      (80 ml) via puncture of a vein in the fossa cubiti is collected and centrifuged according to&#xD;
      a previously described method. A total of 20 ml of the 80 ml collected blood is collected for&#xD;
      later biochemical characterization of the blood sample and the PRF membrane. The obtained PRF&#xD;
      membrane is adjusted and placed to cover the bone graft. In the control group, the lateral&#xD;
      block graft is covered with anorganic bovine bone substitute (Bio-Oss, Geistlich Pharma,&#xD;
      Switzerland) and a collagen membrane (Bio-Gide, Geistlich Pharma, Switzerland). Preoperative&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotic treatment (Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid, 1000/250 mg) is given as well&#xD;
      as postoperative pain control (Ibuprofen, 400 mg x 4 daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant installation After a healing period of 6 month, a standard incision technique is used&#xD;
      to expose the augmented alveolar ridge. The previously inserted mini-screws are removed and&#xD;
      an implant (Bone Level, Straumann, Switzerland) with a cover screw is installed according to&#xD;
      the manufacture's recommendation. Before implant installation, a cylindrical biopsy of the&#xD;
      augmented bone and the resident alveolar bone is retrieved perpendicularly to the lateral&#xD;
      aspect of the augmented ridge by a 2-mm trephine bur for later histological and stereological&#xD;
      evaluation. The biopsy cavity is filled with locally harvested autogenous bone chips&#xD;
      (Safescraper, Divisione Medical Meta, Italy). If the buccal bone thickness after implant&#xD;
      installation is less than 2 mm, localized alveolar ridge augmentation is performed by using&#xD;
      also locally harvested autogenous bone chips covered by an anorganic bovine bone substitute&#xD;
      and a resorbable collagen membrane. Preoperative prophylactic antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      (Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid, 1000/250 mg) is given as well as postoperative pain control&#xD;
      (Ibuprofen, 400 mg x 4 daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prosthetic treatment After a healing period of 6 month, a healing abutment is placed (Nobel&#xD;
      Biocare, Switzerland). After an additional 2-week soft tissue healing period, the healing&#xD;
      abutment is removed and an individual definitive zirconium abutment and an all-ceramic crown&#xD;
      with a framework of alumina oxide and veneering porcelain is placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis, including calculation of sample size Data management and analysis including&#xD;
      calculation of descriptive statistics are performed in collaboration with a biostatistician.&#xD;
      The statistical analyses will mainly include t-test, Pearson's correlation analysis, and&#xD;
      analysis of variance. Power calculations are based on differences in patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      changes in marginal bone level in a previous study involving replacement of a single tooth&#xD;
      with 2 different protocols of implant treatment. When the calculation of the group size is&#xD;
      based on the figures for patient satisfaction measured on a VAS scale (with a maximum of 100)&#xD;
      after treatment (a difference between treatments of 6.81 and a standard deviation of 6.82),&#xD;
      17 patients should be included in each group to detect a difference at the 5%-level with a&#xD;
      power of 80%. When the power calculation is based on the observed changes in marginal bone&#xD;
      level from insertion of the implant to abutment connection (a change of 0.65 mm and a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 0.65), 17 patients in each group reaches a power of 97% at the&#xD;
      5%-level. With 15% to cover any drop-outs, each treatment group should include 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone biopsy storage The previously describes bone biopsies are kept during the histological&#xD;
      processing at Aarhus University. All material will be anonymous and destroyed at the end of&#xD;
      the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects, including risks, data management, and publication The two described lateral&#xD;
      alveolar ridge augmentation procedures are both commonly used in the clinic. As previously&#xD;
      described, potential benefits and disadvantages are presently unknown, because no comparative&#xD;
      study has been performed. The described implant treatment is performed according standard&#xD;
      procedure. It has been documented that lateral alveolar ridge augmentation and implant&#xD;
      treatment are characterized by minimal risk of complication, including pain, swelling, and&#xD;
      inflammation. The bone harvesting procedure includes a minimum risk for compromised&#xD;
      sensibility of the lip and tongue. The change in sensibility is in most cases temporarily,&#xD;
      but can rarely be permanent. The study involves a total of 3 segmented CBCT scanning&#xD;
      procedures and 5 intra-oral radiographic images corresponding to a total radiation dose&#xD;
      equivalent to 60 days of background radiation. Therefore, the total radiation dose of the&#xD;
      patients seems from an ethical point of view acceptable. In conclusion, the described study&#xD;
      is characterized by a very low risk of complications. If failure of the augmentation&#xD;
      procedure or implant treatment occurs, prosthetic treatment involving a conventional, fixed&#xD;
      bridge can always be performed. If unexpected adverse events occur, the project will be&#xD;
      cancelled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The all surgical procedures will be performed by the applicant, who is an oral and&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgeon with extensive clinical skills within the field of bone augmentation&#xD;
      and implant treatment. Moreover, the prosthetic part of the treatment will be performed by&#xD;
      two dentists with extensive clinical skills within the field of implant prosthetics. The&#xD;
      patients will be covered by the same health assurance as all patients at the Department of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Aarhus University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRF membranes derived from the patient's own blood using a chair-side method have recently&#xD;
      been commercially available. These membranes may enhance soft tissue as well as bone healing,&#xD;
      but the hypothesis has not been validated in a randomized controlled clinical trial. The&#xD;
      described studies will provide new and important knowledge, which from a clinical,&#xD;
      economical, and scientific perspective is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies are performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and internationally&#xD;
      accepted guidelines for randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT), and has been approved in&#xD;
      accordance with Danish regulations by the Committee of Ethics, the Central Denmark Region&#xD;
      (Project-ID: 44710) 2014 before the start of the study. The physical and mental integrity of&#xD;
      the patients will be respect. The project is performed as Ph.D. collaboration project between&#xD;
      Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital after approval by the Danish Data Protection&#xD;
      Agency. All processing of personal data and free movement of such data will be in according&#xD;
      to Danish law. The results will be published in international scientific journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding The project has been developed by the applicant in collaboration with the supervisors&#xD;
      without commercial influences. Aarhus University has supported the project and used material&#xD;
      including implants will be provided for free by the manufactures (Nobel Biocare and Geistlich&#xD;
      Pharma, Switzerland). These companies will not have any influence on the project, including&#xD;
      publication of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are recruited among patients referred to the Department of Dentistry, Aarhus&#xD;
      University from dentist for bone augmentation and implant treatment. If insufficient numbers&#xD;
      of patients are referred, advertisement of the project will be announced by e-mail or within&#xD;
      the Danish Dental Journal (Tandlægebladet). Detailed written and oral information about the&#xD;
      project including all potential risks will be given by the applicant in a separate,&#xD;
      undisturbed clinic at the Section for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Oral Pathology,&#xD;
      Department of Dentistry, Aarhus University. The patients will be provided with the written&#xD;
      information at the time of the initial examination. All patients will have sufficient time to&#xD;
      read the information before the oral information is given. Moreover, the patients will be&#xD;
      given sufficient time (1 week) to consider their participation in the study before the&#xD;
      informed consent form is signed and dated by the patient as well as the applicant. The&#xD;
      patients will receive the original version, while the applicant will keep a copy as part of&#xD;
      the study documentation. The patients are provided with the opportunity to have an assessor&#xD;
      during the entire information and approval phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be treated at the Department of Dentistry, Health, Aarhus University and&#xD;
      the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.&#xD;
