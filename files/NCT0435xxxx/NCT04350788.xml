  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the feasibility of the enhanced survivorship&#xD;
      care plans (ESCPs, regular SCPs with the a web-based couple-focused symptom self-management&#xD;
      project (PERC) or National Cancer Institute prostate cancer web links) and to conduct an&#xD;
      initial benefit assessment of enhanced survivorship care plans among prostate cancer patients&#xD;
      transitioning from active treatment to post-treatment self-management, and their partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation of this study lasts for about for 16 weeks. Depending on participants' need for&#xD;
      information, it takes 10-30 minutes of their time each week to review the information about&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible and consented patients with newly treated localized prostate cancer and your partner&#xD;
      (couples) are randomly assigned to the regular survivorship care plan (SCPs) with the NCI&#xD;
      website or the enhanced survivorship care plans (SCP plus the web-based prostate cancer&#xD;
      education program, PERC) groups. They complete baseline (T1, prior to randomization) and&#xD;
      4-month post-T1 follow-up measures (T2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methods: A two-group randomized controlled pretest-posttest design will be used and collect&#xD;
      data at baseline (T1) and 4 months later (T2) among 50 patients completing initial treatment&#xD;
      for localized prostate cancer and their partners. First, the investigators will assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of ESCP by recruitment, enrollment, and retention rates, program satisfaction&#xD;
      with the ESCP, and perceived ease of use of the ESCP. To achieve the secondary aim, the ESCP&#xD;
      users will be compared with the standardized SCP users and assess their primary outcomes of&#xD;
      QOL (overall, physical, emotional, and social QOL), secondary outcomes (reduction in negative&#xD;
      appraisals and improvement in self-efficacy, social support, and health behaviors to manage&#xD;
      symptoms), and number of visits to post-treatment care services at T1 and T2. The primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are assessed using measurements with sound psychometrical properties. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a qualitative and quantitative mixed methods approach to achieve the&#xD;
      research aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: The results from this study will help design a definitive randomized trial to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of the ESCPs, a potentially scalable program, to enhance supportive care&#xD;
      for prostate cancer patients and their families.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in FACT-G Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline upon enrollment, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change in QOL determined using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General Scale (FACT-G) v.4, a 27-item measure yielding total score and scores for physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being of demonstrated reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change. FACT-G consists of 4 subscales: physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and social well-being (SWB). Scores on the four subscales are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 108 with higher scores indicating better quality of life. Change from baseline is the post-Baseline values minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Change in Appraisal of Prostate Cancer-Specific Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline upon enrollment, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment. EPIC will be used to measure change in appraisal of symptoms scores among patients from Baseline (T1) to T2 (4 months post T1). EPIC contains 26 items within 5 domains: Urinary Incontinence, Urinary Irritative/Obstructive, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing opposite results by role: patient with better appraisal of symptoms and partner with worse appraisal of symptoms. Change from baseline is the post-Baseline values minus the Baseline value.</description>

It measures how much trouble the participant has with the general symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and etc. The total score ranges between 0 and 38, with higher scores indicating worse appraisal of symptoms. Change from baseline is the post-Baseline values minus the Baseline value.</description>

FACT-G consists of 4 subscales: physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and social well-being (SWB). Scores on the four subscales are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 108 with higher scores indicating better quality of life.

        <description>The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment. EPIC will be used to measure change in appraisal of symptoms scores among patients from Baseline (T1) to T2 (4 months post T1). EPIC contains 26 items within 5 domains: Urinary Incontinence, Urinary Irritative/Obstructive, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing opposite results by role: patient with better appraisal of symptoms and partner with worse appraisal of symptoms. Change from baseline is the post-Baseline values minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <population>Intention-to-treat was used in analyses. The sample size was 124 participants (62 patient-partner couples in each group) who completed baseline and were randomized. We analyzed group differences by role (patient vs partner).</population>

          <description>The 19-item Risk for Distress-general symptoms is a subscale of the Risk for Distress Scale. It measures how much trouble the participant has with the general symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and etc. The total score ranges between 0 and 38, with higher scores indicating worse appraisal of symptoms. Change from baseline is the post-Baseline values minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>The PROMIS Instrumental Support-Short Form 8a will be used to assess changes in patient and partner reported instrumental support system using a 5-point Likert scale from Baseline (T1) to T2 (4 months post T1). The total score range: 8-40. Higher scores indicate more instrumental support. Change from baseline is the post-Baseline values minus the Baseline value.</description>
