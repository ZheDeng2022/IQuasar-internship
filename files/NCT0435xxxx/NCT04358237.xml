  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled and multicenter phase I/II study of PM01183&#xD;
      in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A dose-ranging phase I stage with escalating doses of PM01183 in combination with a&#xD;
           fixed dose of pembrolizumab, followed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A non-randomized phase II stage as an expansion study at the recommended dose (RD)&#xD;
           determined during the phase I stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase I stage will focus on the selection of the RD based on safety/tolerability, while&#xD;
      the phase II stage will assess the overall response rate (ORR) and clinical response.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      • During the phase I stage, patients will start receiving pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of&#xD;
      200 mg as a 30-min intravenous (IV) infusion followed by PM01183 at a starting dose of 2.4&#xD;
      mg/m2 as a 1-h IV infusion on Day 1, both every 3 weeks (Q3W). A cycle is defined as an&#xD;
      interval of 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PM01183 dose will be escalated from the starting dose in successive cohorts of patients, with&#xD;
      a pre-established fixed dose increase (in mg/m2) of approximately 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will follow a classical 3+3 design, according to the observed tolerance and&#xD;
      safety. All evaluable patients within a dose level will be followed for at least one cycle&#xD;
      (i.e., 3 weeks) before dose escalation may proceed. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be&#xD;
      the lowest dose level explored during dose escalation at which one third or more of evaluable&#xD;
      patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be terminated once the MTD or the last dose level (i.e., DL2) is&#xD;
      reached, whichever occurs first, except if all DLTs occurring at a given dose level are&#xD;
      related to neutropenia. If this is the case, dose escalation may be resumed, starting at the&#xD;
      lowest dose level at which exclusively neutropenia-related DLTs were observed, and will&#xD;
      follow the same original schedule but with mandatory primary granulocyte colony-stimulating&#xD;
      factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expansion cohort to complete a minimum of 6 evaluable patients will be recruited at the&#xD;
      immediate lower dose level from the MTD, or at DL2 if the MTD is not defined yet. This level&#xD;
      will be confirmed as the RD if less than one third of the first 6 evaluable patients&#xD;
      experience DLT during Cycle 1. Intermediate dose levels could be tested upon agreement of the&#xD;
      Scientific Steering Committee members, as defined in Section 8.4, if deemed appropriate. This&#xD;
      will also be discussed with Pharma Mar and MSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • During the phase II stage, patients will receive pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of 200 mg as&#xD;
      a 30-min IV infusion followed by PM01183 as a 1-h IV infusion on Day 1 Q3W at the RD&#xD;
      determined during the phase I stage. A cycle is defined as an interval of 3 weeks. No dose&#xD;
      escalation will be allowed during the phase II stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of stage, patients will receive PM01183 in combination with pembrolizumab until&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal or if it is not considered in their&#xD;
      best interest to continue, after specific agreement between the Investigators and the Sponsor&#xD;
      (this will also be discussed with Pharma Mar and MSD). Maximum treatment period with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab is 35 dose administrations (approximately 2 years). After 35 dose&#xD;
      administrations, patients might continue on treatment with lurbinectedin alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological tumor assessments will be done every 6 weeks (± 2 weeks), or prior to every&#xD;
      second subsequent cycle, while on treatment. After treatment discontinuation, patients will&#xD;
      be followed until resolution or stabilization of all toxicities, if any. Patients&#xD;
      discontinuing treatment without disease progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria In&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 will be followed every 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) until disease&#xD;
      progression as per RECIST 1.1, start of a new anti-cancer therapy, death or the end-of-study&#xD;
      date (clinical cutoff, as described in Section 2.1.1), whichever occurs first. After one year&#xD;
      of follow-up, patients will be evaluated every 9 weeks (± 2 weeks) until the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 or start of a new anti-cancer therapy, patients&#xD;
      will be followed up for survival every 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) until death or the end-of-study&#xD;
      date, whichever occurs first (a phone contact will be acceptable). An exception will be those&#xD;
      patients who are clinically stable at the time of disease progression as per RECIST 1.1, who&#xD;
      could remain on treatment according to the Investigator's criteria up to the next&#xD;
      radiological assessment. If no disease progression as per immune RECIST (iRECIST) 1.1 is&#xD;
      observed in this assessment, treatment will continue until disease progression as per iRECIST&#xD;
      1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at the end of the study (i.e., clinical cut-off, as defined in Section 2.1.1) any patients&#xD;
      are still on treatment with lurbinectedin monotherapy, the investigator will evaluate if it&#xD;
      is appropriate that they continue receiving that treatment. If needed, the Sponsor may&#xD;
      facilitate appropriate measures to ensure access to lurbinectedin and maintenance of safety&#xD;
      reporting obligations beyond study closure in those cases. According to the end of study&#xD;
      definition (see Section 2.1.1), no patients will remain under treatment with pembrolizumab at&#xD;
      the clinical cut-off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v.5, whereas antitumor response will be assessed using the RECIST&#xD;
      1.1, and also the iRECIST 1.1 whenever applicable. These methods are generally accepted as&#xD;
      standard clinical procedures in oncological studies.&#xD;

                  needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Known history of active neurologic paraneoplastic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Myopathy or any clinical situation that causes significant and persistent&#xD;
                  elevation of CPK (&gt;2.5 x ULN in two different determinations performed one week&#xD;
                  apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Limitation of the patient's ability to comply with the treatment or follow-up&#xD;
                  protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Any other major illness that, in the Investigator's judgment, will substantially&#xD;
                  increase the risk associated with the patient's participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational&#xD;
             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may&#xD;
        participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous&#xD;
        investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;
             within the past 5 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ (e.g., breast carcinoma,&#xD;
             cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically&#xD;
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging&#xD;
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment. Brain CT-scan or MRI results must be provided at&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab, lubinectedin and/or any of&#xD;

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment. Exception: patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood&#xD;
             asthma/atopy; patients who require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local&#xD;
             steroid injections; and patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or&#xD;
             Sjögren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
