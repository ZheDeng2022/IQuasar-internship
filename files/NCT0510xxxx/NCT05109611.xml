      A decentralized, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical efficacy&#xD;
      study evaluating nitric oxide nasal spray (NONS) as prevention for treatment of individuals&#xD;
      at risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a decentralized, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled, Phase 3 clinical&#xD;
      efficacy study evaluating NONS in healthy adult volunteers as a prevention treatment for&#xD;
      individuals at risk from COVID-19 infection. Participants aged 18 or over with no known&#xD;
      history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or previous vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will be enrolled&#xD;
      into one of two cohorts of this study in a ratio of 1:1 (Treatment: Placebo Control).&#xD;
      Participants with or without underlying medical conditions will be eligible to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will self-administer a nasal spray at a maximum of 3 times per day, morning,&#xD;
      noon, and night containing either blinded study treatment or placebo (herein called study&#xD;
      treatment). Nitric oxide nasal spray will be delivered from manual pump nasal spray&#xD;
      containing 25 mL of solution with each nasal spray dispensing approximately 130-150 ÂµL of&#xD;
      solution. Each treatment will require two sprays per nostril, or about 0.56 mL per treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to assess the efficacy of NONS in the prevention of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection as determined by a positive COVID-19 test (antigen or reverse-transcriptase&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]), The secondary endpoints are to determine the proportion&#xD;
      for participants requiring hospitalization or emergency room (ER/emergency department [ED])&#xD;
      visits for COVID-19 or flu-like symptoms by Day 28 and assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      use of NONS in participants with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a decentralized trial, with all data collection and monitoring to be&#xD;
      remote. Screening and enrollment will take place through an online portal and through&#xD;
      telehealth assessments. Participants will receive study treatment shipped directly to their&#xD;
      homes. Participants will enter their study treatment dates and times and describe any&#xD;
      symptoms in an online questionnaire.&#xD;
