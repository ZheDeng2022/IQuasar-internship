  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori is a pathogenic bacteria transmitted from individual to individual, being&#xD;
      scientifically recognized as an agent who causes persistent inflammatory activity on the&#xD;
      gastric mucosa. This pathogen represents a Global Health problem, as shown in a systematic&#xD;
      review by Hooi et al. Besides regional differences, more that half of the world population is&#xD;
      expected to have already been infected by this bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Portugal, research studies estimate that more than 80% of the adult population has already&#xD;
      contacted with H. pylori.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. pylori infection is associated with active chronic gastritis in every colonized patient,&#xD;
      what may consequently lead to peptic ulcer disease, atrophic gastritis, gastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For that reason, H. pylori infection is considered to be a disease, independently of the&#xD;
      presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, H. pylori has been classified as a&#xD;
      confirmed carcinogen (class I) by the International Agency for Research, being responsible&#xD;
      for carcinogenic pathways conducting to both gastric adenocarcinoma and lymphoma. This fact&#xD;
      gains a particular relevance taking into account that gastric cancer is one of the most&#xD;
      prevalent cancers worldwide. On other hand, more than 75% of the gastric cancers occur&#xD;
      following H. pylori infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, H. pylori eradication constitutes an essential Public Health measurement, being&#xD;
      inclusively considered a cost-effective method to decrease the gastric cancer burden, by&#xD;
      promoting pre-malignant lesions regression, such as atrophic gastritis, and by delaying the&#xD;
      disease progression in case of intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maastricht V consensus is a document updated in 2016, including the major recommendations&#xD;
      regarding H. pylori diagnosis, follow-up and treatment. It highlights the emergence of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistances and how they must influence clinical practice, namely the choice of&#xD;
      antibiotic regimens, as successful eradication has become less frequent with more prevalent&#xD;
      antibiotic resistances. This is the case of clarithromycin and metronidazol, both currently&#xD;
      recommended as first-line options by the Portuguese Society of Gastroenterology. In fact, a&#xD;
      systematic review conducted in 2018, aiming to evaluate antibiotic resistances on the&#xD;
      Portuguese population observed that clarithromycin, metronidazole and double resistance&#xD;
      occurred in 42%, 25% and 20% of the individuals, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, Maastricht V guidelines recommend quadruple regimens containing bismuth, such as&#xD;
      Pylera (r), as the first-line option in areas with significant double resistance to&#xD;
      metronidazole and clarithromycin. Another option currently being investigated is the double&#xD;
      therapy with amoxicillin in high doses and proton pump inhibitor. This has become a&#xD;
      particularly attractive alternative due to its efficacy, good tolerability and significantly&#xD;
      low resistance (&lt;1%) among the European population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this clinical trial is to compare both regimens - pylera (r) and high-dose&#xD;
      amoxycillin - in H. pylori eradication, regarding their efficacy, tolerability and side&#xD;
      effects, in order to asses viable therapeutic options in a population with progressively&#xD;
      increasing resistances to alternative regimens currently recommended.&#xD;
