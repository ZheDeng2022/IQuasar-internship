  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Managed Access Program (MAP) Cohort Treatment Plan is to provide guidance&#xD;
      to the Physician for the treatment and monitoring of patients in the Cohort MAP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to inclusion of a patient in the Cohort, the requesting Physician must submit a request&#xD;
      for access to the product in GEMS (Grants, External Requests and Managed Access System)&#xD;
      accessible through&#xD;
      https://www.novartis.com/our-focus/healthcare-professionals/managedaccess-programs providing&#xD;
      the rationale for the request and relevant medical history of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The request is then assessed against the MAP and Cohort inclusion/exclusion criteria by the&#xD;
      medical team experienced with the product and indication. Upon the required approvals, the&#xD;
      patient is included in the Cohort.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients eligible for inclusion in this Treatment Plan have to meet all of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has histological or cytological confirmation of hormone-receptor positive&#xD;
             (HR+) breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is a postmenopausal woman: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of&#xD;
             child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea&#xD;
             with an appropriate clinical profile (i.e. age appropriate history of vasomotor&#xD;
             symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy),&#xD;
             total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of&#xD;
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed&#xD;
             by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing&#xD;
             potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has recurrence or progression of their cancer after treatment with Femara®&#xD;
             (letrozole) or Arimidex® (anastrozole).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is willing to be treated with concomitant exemestane.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has adequate bone marrow and coagulation function as shown by: absolute&#xD;
             neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L; platelets ≥ 100 × 10^9/L; hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥&#xD;
             9.0 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has adequate liver function as shown by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5&#xD;
                  ULN (or ≤ 5x ULN in patients with liver metastases),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  INR ≤2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has adequate renal function as shown by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has fasting serum cholesterol ≤ 300mg/dL or 7.75 mmol/L and fasting&#xD;
             triglycerides ≤ 2.5 × ULN. NOTE: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded,&#xD;
             the patient can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient will give a written informed consent obtained according to local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients eligible for this Treatment Plan must not meet any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

        product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has HER2- overexpression confirmed by local laboratory testing (IHC 3+&#xD;
             staining or in situ hybridization positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient requires chemotherapy for symptomatic visceral disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is currently receiving hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has had prior therapy with mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus,&#xD;
             deforolimus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has a known intolerance or hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycin&#xD;

          7. Patient with a known history of HIV seropositivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;1.5× ULN&#xD;
             despite adequate therapy. Patients with a known history of impaired fasting glucose or&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus (DM) may be included, however blood glucose and antidiabetic&#xD;
             treatment must be monitored closely throughout participation in the program and&#xD;
             adjusted as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions such as:&#xD;

                  infarction ≤6 months prior to randomization, serious uncontrolled cardiac&#xD;
                  arrhythmia,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active or uncontrolled severe infection,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Liver disease such as cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and chronic&#xD;
                  hepatitis (i.e. quantifiable HBV-DNA and/or positive HbsAg, quantifiable&#xD;
                  HCV-RNA),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known severely impaired lung function (spirometry and DLCO 50% or less of normal&#xD;
                  and O2 saturation 88% or less at rest on room air),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active, bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient is unwilling to or unable to comply with the treatment plan.&#xD;
