      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose&#xD;
      ascending study in healthy subjects with concurrent PK sampling from blood plasma, urine, and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid. The overall study design is outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Single-Dose Regimen and Fasted-Fed Crossover For the single-dose regimen,&#xD;
      approximately 40 healthy male or female subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 5 single-dose&#xD;
      cohorts (designated as S1 through S5, respectively) in an ascending fashion. Each cohort will&#xD;
      consist of 8 subjects randomized to CVN766 or placebo, whereby 6 subjects will receive a&#xD;
      single oral dose of CVN766 suspension, and 2 subjects will receive a matching placebo&#xD;
      suspension under overnight fasted conditions. Subjects will remain fasted for 4 hours&#xD;
      post-dose. Consumption of water is permitted as desired except for 1 hour before and after&#xD;
      administration of Study Drug. Sentinel dosing (1 subject to receive CVN766 and 1 subject to&#xD;
      receive placebo) will be used in each cohort to ensure adequate safety and tolerability&#xD;
      evaluation prior to administering CVN766 or placebo to the remainder of subjects within the&#xD;
      cohort. After blinded review by the Safety Review Group (SRG) of 24-hour, post-dose safety&#xD;
      and tolerability data from the sentinel group, the remaining 6 subjects of each cohort may be&#xD;
      dosed provided that the adverse event (AE) profile in the first 2 subjects is considered&#xD;
      acceptable. To accommodate the lumbar puncture in the S3 fasted cohort, after the sentinel&#xD;
      group, the remaining 6 subjects dosing may be staggered every two days. The planned dose&#xD;
      levels will be 5, 15, 45, 125, and 250 mg CVN766. The SRG will review all available blinded&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, clinical laboratory results (minimally including samples collected from&#xD;
      subjects through 72-hours post-dose), and pharmacokinetic (PK) data after each cohort and&#xD;
      before subsequent dose escalation. Each following dose level may be higher, lower, or remain&#xD;
      the same as the preceding cohort, dependent on the recommendation of the SRG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional cohort(s) may be added if deemed necessary by the SRG to fully characterize the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of CVN766. For example, if the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not&#xD;
      reached with cohort S5, additional cohorts with higher dose levels may be considered. Such&#xD;
      additional cohorts will follow the same schedule of events as for cohorts S1 through S5.&#xD;
      Additional/Alternative PK timepoints may be implemented if the SRG determines this is&#xD;
      necessary to fully characterize the PK profile of CVN766.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of food on CVN766 bioavailability in suspension formulation, single-dose&#xD;
      administration will be repeated in a single cohort (S3) after ingestion of a standardized&#xD;
      high-fat, high-calorie meal according to FDA Guidance for Industry (Food-effect&#xD;
      bioavailability and fed bioequivalence studies, Dec 2002). Once the safety of the S3 cohort&#xD;
      dose level has been assessed, the S3 cohort subjects will return to the clinic (no sooner&#xD;
      than 14 days after their prior dose, or at least 4 half-lives, has lapsed based on&#xD;
      preliminary PK data, whichever is longer). They will receive the same dose as before,&#xD;
      administered after ingesting a standardized breakfast. Subjects will finish the entire&#xD;
      content of their breakfast within 25 minutes and will receive an investigational product 30&#xD;
      minutes (± 5 minutes) after beginning the meal. Sentinel dosing will not be required for&#xD;
      subjects returning to the clinic for the fed regimen. If the CVN766 PK parameters in the&#xD;
      fasted S3 cohort reveal poor absorption with inconclusive results, the fed cohort will be&#xD;
      deferred until a higher dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects for all cohorts will be admitted to the study unit 1 day prior to dosing and remain&#xD;
      in the unit for safety and PK assessments. On Day 1, subjects will undergo safety monitoring&#xD;
      and PK sampling from blood plasma through 72 hours post-dose and, for cohort S3 (fasted)&#xD;
      only, from CSF via lumbar puncture at 3 hours post-dose. The total confinement period will be&#xD;
      4 nights, unless extended at the discretion of the Investigator, e.g., for monitoring and/or&#xD;
      management of AEs. Follow-up assessments will occur on approximately Days 8 and 14 and +21&#xD;
      and +28 for cohort S3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Multiple-Dose Regimen For the multiple-dose regimen, approximately 24 healthy male&#xD;
      and female subjects age 18 to 50 years old will be enrolled in 1 of the 3 multiple-dose&#xD;
      cohorts (designated as M1 through M3, respectively) in an ascending fashion. The dose levels&#xD;
      planned to be studied in the multiple-dose regimen are 45, 125, and 250 mg CVN766 for&#xD;
      multiple-dose cohorts M1 through M3, respectively. Each multiple-dose cohort will consist of&#xD;
      8 subjects randomized to CVN766 or placebo, whereby 6 subjects will receive a daily oral dose&#xD;
      of CVN766, and 2 subjects will receive a matching placebo for 7 days. Dosing will be&#xD;
      administered in the fasting state; this can be changed by the SRG if exposure is found to be&#xD;
      higher in the fed state. The planned dosing duration for the multiple-dose cohorts is 7 days.&#xD;
      However, the duration may be increased to ≤14 days at the discretion of the SRG if&#xD;
      preliminary PK data suggests steady-state will not be achieved within 6 days of daily dosing.&#xD;
      For each dose on intensive PK sampling days (first and last days of dosing, e.g., Days 1 and&#xD;
      7), subjects will remain fasted for 4 hours post-dose. On other dosing days (Days 2-6),&#xD;
      subjects will remain fasted for 1-hour post-dose. Consumption of water is permitted as&#xD;
      desired except for 1 hour before and after administration of Study Drug. Unlike the&#xD;
      single-dose regimen, sentinel dosing within cohorts is not required in the multiple-dose&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation of the multiple-dose regimen will only occur after a full blinded review of all&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and clinical laboratory results for the fasting drug administration to&#xD;
      single-dose Cohort S3 (minimally including samples collected through Day 4) and available PK&#xD;
      data. For each multiple-dose cohort after the first, the actual choice of dose level may be&#xD;
      modified by the SRG after the available blinded safety, tolerability, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      results, and PK data in the preceding multiple-dose and corresponding single-dose cohorts&#xD;
      (i.e., multiple-dose Cohort M2 will not initiate until the data review for multiple-dose&#xD;
      Cohort M1 and single-dose cohort S4 is complete). Each subsequent dose level may be higher,&#xD;
      lower, or remain the same as the preceding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional multiple-dose cohort(s) may be added if deemed necessary by the SRG to fully&#xD;
      characterize the safety and tolerability of CVN766. Such additional cohorts will follow the&#xD;
      same schedule of events as for prior multiple-dose cohorts. Additional/Alternative PK&#xD;
      timepoints may be implemented if the SRG determines this is necessary to fully characterize&#xD;
      the PK profile of CVN766.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects for all multiple-dose cohorts will be admitted to the study unit 1 day prior to&#xD;
      dosing and remain in the unit for the duration of the dosing period and for at least 48 hours&#xD;
      after the last dose for safety and PK assessments before discharge. On treatment Days 1 and&#xD;
      7, subjects will undergo safety monitoring and PK sampling from blood plasma through 48 hours&#xD;
      post-dose and, in cohort M1 only, from urine through 24 hours post-dose. In cohorts M1 and&#xD;
      M2, on treatment Day 7 (or last day of dosing, if extended beyond Day 7), subjects will&#xD;
      additionally undergo PK sampling from CSF via lumbar puncture at 3 hours post-dose. If needed&#xD;
      to resolve questions arising from prior cohorts' data, subjects in cohort M3 also may, at SRG&#xD;
      discretion, undergo PK sampling from CSF via lumbar puncture, the choice of day (e.g., Day 1&#xD;
      or Day 7) and sampling time to be decided by SRG. Subjects in MAD cohorts may be asked to&#xD;
      return to the clinic for an additional PK sample 3 days after the last dose (e.g., Day 10)&#xD;
      depending on emerging PK data, i.e., t½). The total confinement period will be 9 nights&#xD;
      unless extended for additional dosing days or management of AEs. Follow-up assessments will&#xD;
      occur approximately 7 and 14 days after the final dose.&#xD;
