  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 200 women for elective abdominal myomectomy were randomly allocated into two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 women in experimental group were administered 400ug Misoprostol (2 tablets of ProsotecÂ®)&#xD;
      through the rectal route prior to surgery and 100 were in control group, in which no drug was&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;

      After getting approval from hospital's ethical committee, patients eligible for the study&#xD;
      were recruited in the study according to the selection criteria. Before surgery, after taking&#xD;
      informed written consent, patient's detailed history including demographics, parity &amp; BMI was&#xD;
      recorded. Uterine size was assessed by bimanual pelvic examination. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      myomectomy were randomly divided into 2 groups using lottery method. In experimental group&#xD;
      Misoprostol 400ug was administered per rectally prior to surgery. In control group, no drug&#xD;
      was administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedural elements, the surgeon or surgeons performing the procedure and the&#xD;
      use of antibiotics as well as anesthetic agents was standardized to remove any bias.&#xD;
      Intraoperative blood loss was recorded by a single trained doctor and calculated using visual&#xD;
      scale for the abdominal sponges and chest swabs/gauzes used during surgery and blood&#xD;
      collected in suction bottle.&#xD;
