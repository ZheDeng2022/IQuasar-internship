  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-therapeutic study assessing peripheral T cell determinants of response and&#xD;
      resistance to immunotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma.The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      systemic T cells traffic into the tumor microenvironment (TME) can predict response and&#xD;
      resistance to immunotherapy. These systemic tumor directed T cells can be defined by&#xD;
      tumor/blood small conditional RNA (scRNA) using T cell receptor (TCR) as a barcode and can&#xD;
      help predict response to PD-1 therapy.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand how the systemic immune profile (T cell activation and expansion in TME)&#xD;
      changes in response to pembrolizumab therapy in patients with advanced melanoma on&#xD;
      pembrolizumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate the peripheral T cell profiles with the objective response rate (ORR) at 24&#xD;
      weeks in patients with advanced melanoma on pembrolizumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate the peripheral T cell profiles with progression free survival (PFS) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced melanoma on pembrolizumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate the peripheral T cell profiles with overall survival (OS) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced melanoma on pembrolizumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate the peripheral T cell profiles with toxicity profile. V. Transcriptional and&#xD;
      phenotypic features of tumor directed T cells in blood using a combination of phenotypic&#xD;
      markers derived from COMET and cite-seq.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 6 months from time of treatment initiation. After 6 months,&#xD;
      patients do not need to be followed but standard of care scans and survival status can be&#xD;
      assessed for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will identify the genes predictive of response to anti-PD-1 therapy by testing for significant associations across expression rates of each gene and response/resistance, within a hurdle-Gaussian mixed-effect framework that accounts for variance across patients and technical noise present in single-cell data.</description>

    <description>The investigators will identify T cell sub-populations in the tumor-directed component in blood whose relative frequency is indicative of response to anti-PD-1 therapy, using a negative binomial regression model. We will test for predictive differences in relative frequencies before and after treatment initiation separately, as well as when combining both time points with appropriate interaction terms</description>

    <description>The investigators will build a novel computational framework to identify T-cell clonal behavior associated with response to anti-PD-1 therapy using profiling of TCR sequences at single-cell resolution to compare clonal expansion in each of the sub-populations for their association with response to anti-PD-1 therapy.</description>
