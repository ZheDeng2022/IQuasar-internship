  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2014, an estimated 7,000 patients were diagnosed of melanoma in China. It is growing at an&#xD;
      annual rate of 3%-5% and approximately 20,000 new cases are reported each year recently.To&#xD;
      date, CFDA only approved dacarbazine as first line chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      monotherapy as second line. There is no standard of care after chemotherapy and anti-PD-1.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single center phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab for Chinese patients with&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma after disease progression from prior anti-PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      and chemotherapy. The first 20 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
      sitravatinib plus tislelizumab (Arm A) or sitravatinb monotherapy (Arm B). After the&#xD;
      completion of initial 20 patients, additional patients will be recruited until 24 efficacy&#xD;
      evaluable patients achieved in Arm A&#xD;
