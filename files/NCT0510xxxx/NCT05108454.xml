  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal nutrition profoundly affects foetal growth, development, and subsequent infant birth&#xD;
      weight. Babies with low birth weight (LBW) have an elevated risk of death in infancy and&#xD;
      later childhood. A recent systematic review revealed that multiple micronutrient&#xD;
      supplementations (MMS) could reduce the risk of LBW by 13% in comparison with iron and folic&#xD;
      acid (IFA). Based on this newer evidence, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended MMS&#xD;
      during a pregnancy instead of IFA, with consideration of the country context-specific&#xD;
      research. However, little progress is being achieved in ensuring adequate MMS coverage to&#xD;
      improve pregnancy outcomes. Based on the WHO recommendation, CIFF awarded the Social&#xD;
      Marketing Company (SMC) to set up a sustainable business model with affordable and quality&#xD;
      MMS to pregnant women in Bangladesh over a period of 5 years through SMC's pharmacy networks.&#xD;
      We propose to develop an evaluation design including both process and outcome evaluation to&#xD;
      evaluate the implementation and effect of the MMS by the SMC in Bangladesh. The evaluation&#xD;
      study will comprise both process and outcome evaluation, complementing each other. The design&#xD;
      will be a quasi-experimental cluster-based open cohort, two-arm, mixed-methods design. The&#xD;
      evaluation would take place in 5 divisions of Bangladesh.&#xD;

      Background: a. Burden: Maternal nutrition profoundly affects foetal growth, development, and&#xD;
      subsequent infant birth weight. Babies with low birth weight (LBW) have an elevated risk of&#xD;
      death in infancy. Furthermore, these babies have a higher risk of stunting or linear growth&#xD;
      failure and slower mental development in childhood. b. Knowledge gap: A recent systematic&#xD;
      review revealed that multiple micronutrient supplementations (MMS) could reduce the risk of&#xD;
      LBW by 13% in comparison with iron and folic acid (IFA). Based on this newer evidence, the&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) has updated the antenatal nutrition recommendations. Now, MMS&#xD;
      is recommended during a pregnancy instead of IFA, with consideration of the country&#xD;
      context-specific research. However, little progress is being achieved in ensuring adequate&#xD;
      MMS coverage to improve pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, the MMS tablets are expensive&#xD;
      compared to the IFA, which might hinder the uptake of the MMS by the people. c. Relevance:&#xD;
      Based on the WHO recommendation, CIFF awarded the Social Marketing Company (SMC) to set up a&#xD;
      sustainable business model with affordable and quality MMS to pregnant women in Bangladesh&#xD;
      over a period of 5 years through SMC's pharmacy networks. We propose to develop an evaluation&#xD;
      design including both process and outcome evaluation to evaluate the implementation and&#xD;
      effect of the MMS by the SMC in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The prevalence of LBW will be reduced by 5% point in the intervention group&#xD;
      compared to the control group by the end of the 5-year program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Outcome evaluation- To evaluate the effectiveness of market-based distribution of&#xD;
      MMS intervention on the prevalence of low birth weight (less than 2500 g) in the infants born&#xD;
      to women in the intervention area who received the intervention compared to control areas&#xD;
      Process evaluation- To measure the fidelity, reach and mechanism of impact of the&#xD;
      intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The evaluation study will comprise both process and outcome evaluation,&#xD;
      complementing each other. The design will be a quasi-experimental cluster-based open cohort,&#xD;
      two-arm, mixed-methods design. The evaluation would take place in 5 divisions of Bangladesh:&#xD;
      Barishal, Chattogram, Dhaka, Rajshahi, and Sylhet. For outcome evaluation: Eligible pregnant&#xD;
      women will be approached for recruitment with proper consent. Right after recruitment, a&#xD;
      baseline data collection will be conducted using a structured questionnaire along with&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements. The recruited participants will be followed up until the end of&#xD;
      their pregnancy. After successful delivery of a baby, an endpoint data collection will be&#xD;
      done along with birth weight measurement of the baby. Data from the control areas will be&#xD;
      collected following the same guideline to maintain consistency. The process evaluation will&#xD;
      be carried out concurrently to monitor the program activities. This will follow a&#xD;
      mixed-method design, including both quantitative and qualitative components. The participants&#xD;
      will be recruited from the same area where activity for outcome evaluation will be ongoing.&#xD;
      We will focus on the fundamental aspects of process evaluation that includes- (a)&#xD;
      understanding the health promotion program and how it is supposed to work, (b) defining the&#xD;
      purposes for the process evaluation, and (c) considering program characteristics and context&#xD;
      and how these may affect implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables: The key variable for outcome evaluation is the measurement of&#xD;
      birth weight. Key variables for process evaluation are fidelity, reach, and mechanism of&#xD;
      impact of the intervention (MMS).&#xD;
