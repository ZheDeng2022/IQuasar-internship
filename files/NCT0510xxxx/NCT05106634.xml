  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare breastfeeding success and breastfeeding self-efficacy&#xD;
      levels of mothers who gave birth via vaginal delivery (VD) or cesarean section (CS).Breast&#xD;
      milk is the only physiological infant food that contains the nutrients needed by the baby in&#xD;
      the appropriate amount and quality. It positively affects both maternal and infant health.&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to compare breastfeeding self-efficacy and breastfeeding success of&#xD;
      mothers who gave birth via cesarean section (under general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia )&#xD;
      with those of mothers who gave birth via vaginal delivery (under under epidural analgesia or&#xD;
      via spontaneous vaginal delivery ).&#xD;
