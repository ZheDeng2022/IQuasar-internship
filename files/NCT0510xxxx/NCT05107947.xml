  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the effect of a dynamic light in order to improve the&#xD;
      circadian rhythm, provide a better sleep and well-being, and in the long run an improved&#xD;
      recovery. The primary question is whether dynamic artificial light with circadian stimulus&#xD;
      can affect the circadian rhythm. The secondary question is whether this also provides better&#xD;
      sleep and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group that is particularly interesting to study is a geriatric population that is more&#xD;
      sensitive to circadian rhythm disorders, sleep disorders and confusion in connection with&#xD;
      hospitalization and that can be of particular benefit from this intervention.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, prospective study where the diurnal variation of melatonin as well as&#xD;
      sleep-related parameters (sleep duration and sleep quality) will be investigated with regards&#xD;
      to light exposure during the hospital stay. Furthermore, it is investigated how psychological&#xD;
      and cognitive functions are affected by light intervention and whether this is related to&#xD;
      improved sleep or not. The study includes a total of 300 patients over the age of 65 who are&#xD;
      cared for in an internal medicine or orthopedic surgery department at Skåne University&#xD;
      Hospital in Malmö. The measurement period in the project is intended to be carried out during&#xD;
      the period of October 2021-February 2022. Hospital rooms in the orthopedic department and in&#xD;
      the medical department constitute the study environment. In all rooms, a biocentric lighting&#xD;
      environment will be able to be created by activating a special lighting system. In these&#xD;
      rooms, light will change dynamically both in spectral distribution and intensity during the&#xD;
      day. During the day, color temperature and intensity are high (1000 lux and up to 6500 K) to&#xD;
      decrease both intensity and color temperature during the evening. By weighing together&#xD;
      spectral distribution and brightness, the circadian stimulus of the light environment can be&#xD;
      calculated. The biocentric light provides a light with a high circadian stimulus during the&#xD;
      morning and early afternoon. The biocentric light can be turned on (intervention) or off&#xD;
      (control). When control setting, the standard normal light constitutes the light environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all rooms included in the study, an accurate measurement of light conditions is carried&#xD;
      out both with regard to spectral distribution and light intensity. Furthermore, patients will&#xD;
      carry light meters to measure the actual amount of light to which patients are exposed. The&#xD;
      study includes two arms, an intervention group and a control group. Patients who are assigned&#xD;
      to one of the study rooms, and meet the inclusion criteria, will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      the study. Patients are randomized to activate the biocentric light environment or standard&#xD;
      light environment. The patients who are cared for in a biocentric light environment are&#xD;
      included in the intervention group and those who are cared for in rooms with a standard light&#xD;
      environment are included in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 patients are to be included in the study. Surveys concerning alertness, sleep will be&#xD;
      carried out. The frailty and a rapid test for delirium will be assessed. The patients will&#xD;
      wear an actiwatch that records their sleep. For a small group of patients, also saliva&#xD;
      melatonin will be collected every 4th hour from 7 pm to 11 am for two different nights 3 days&#xD;
      apart. The results will be compared between the patients in the intervention group and the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
