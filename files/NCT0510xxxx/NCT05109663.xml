  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      of single ascending oral doses of SKLB1028 in healthy subjects. This study has also explored&#xD;
      the effect of food on the PK of SKLB1028.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was divided into 2 parts. Part 1(Dose Escalation) included 2 cohorts (Cohort 1 and&#xD;
      Cohort 2) and subjects received a single oral dose of SKLB1028 50 or 100 mg on Day 1. In Part&#xD;
      2 (Food Effect) included 2 cohorts (Cohort A and Cohort B), subjects received a single oral&#xD;
      dose of SKLB1028 150 mg in a fasting and a fed state, with a 10-day washout period between&#xD;
      the 2 doses.&#xD;
