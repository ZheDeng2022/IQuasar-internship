  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are seeking healthy volunteers and people with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder for a clinical study of the immune system in psychotic disorders.&#xD;
      This is an observational study, to understand the ways in which the immune system may be&#xD;
      contributing to the disease process.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genetic studies have linked the number of copies coding for C4 protein to risk for&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Studies examining the amount of mRNA, the molecules that point to how much C4&#xD;
      protein is likely being made, found more C4 mRNA in the brains from individuals with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Studies in mice have suggested that expressing more C4 protein in the brain,&#xD;
      specifically the A-type of C4, can result in abnormalities in behavior. However, researchers&#xD;
      have also found that pathways that involve this protein in the blood to be abnormal in&#xD;
      individuals even before they develop schizophrenia and hypothesize these abnormalities change&#xD;
      the blood brain barrier. In this work, we are hoping to understand the ways in which C4&#xD;
      protein is abnormal in the peripheral blood and how this may be contributing to the disease&#xD;
      process in hopes of finding new ways of helping individuals with schizophrenia and possibly&#xD;
      other mental health disorders. A major goal of this study is to collect blood tissue for&#xD;
      ongoing translational study of pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested participants will be asked a series of questions about their medical and mental&#xD;
      health history, be able to provide informed consent, undergo a urine toxicology screen and be&#xD;
      willing to provide a blood sample.&#xD;

      The investigators want to save private information and/or specimens for future research. The&#xD;
      study collects 5 Tablespoons of blood. As part of the analysis on your specimens, the&#xD;
      investigators may do genetic testing. Genetic research is research that studies genes,&#xD;
      including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by parents to children.&#xD;
      Your specimens will be stored using an assigned study code number and unlinked to your&#xD;
