  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistant starch (RS) is considered to have many of the same health benefits as dietary&#xD;
      fiber. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of RS3 on postprandial glycemic and&#xD;
      insulinemic responses and appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy males (aged 18-35 years) participated in this study. Subjects were provided meals in&#xD;
      the laboratory after overnight fasting on two separate occasions, at least 1 week apart. On&#xD;
      each laboratory visit, subjects were given either a control meal (COM) or an RS3 meal (RSM).&#xD;
      Both meals during the two visits consisted of vegetarian pasta and were matched for energy&#xD;
      intake, composition, ingredients, and amount, but were prepared in different ways. The COM&#xD;
      was hot, freshly cooked pasta, while the RSM was re-heated pasta that had been cooked the&#xD;
      previous day and chilled overnight. Blood samples and subjective appetite ratings were&#xD;
      collected at fasting and for a period of 3 h after meal consumption (i.e., 15-min intervals&#xD;
      for glucose and 30-min intervals for insulin, ghrelin, and subjective appetite).&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in subjective appetite ratings (Visual Analogue Scale) (n=8)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective appetite ratings were assessed during laboratory visits (before and 3 hours following the meal consumption in the two visits) with the use of paper-based visual analog scales with words anchored at each end of a 100-mm horizontal line that expressed the most-positive rating and the most-negative rating for a question. The questions were in the form of &quot;How (rating) do you feel?&quot; (with ratings of hungry, satisfied, and full), &quot;How much of a desire to eat?&quot; and &quot;How much do you think you can eat?&quot;</description>
