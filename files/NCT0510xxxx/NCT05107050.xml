  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial designed to compare healing&#xD;
      rates between normal saline wash in combination with an amorphous gel (NSS-HG) versus the&#xD;
      grouping of a synergistic antimicrobial cleanser (AMC) and antimicrobial gel (AMG) in chronic&#xD;
      lower extremity ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consenting, the ulcers of eligible subjects are measured, photographed and undergo the&#xD;
      MolecuLight imaging procedure (MiX). The subject is then randomized to one of two arms:&#xD;
      target ulcer cleansed saline wash and an amorphous gel (NSS-HG) or synergistic antimicrobial&#xD;
      cleanser (AMC) and antimicrobial gel (AMG). After cleansing the wound a second MiX is&#xD;
      performed. The subject is given a four-week supply.&#xD;

      BIAKOS™ Antimicrobial Skin &amp; Wound Cleanser helps in the mechanical removal of debris and&#xD;
      foreign material from the skin, wound, or application site. BIAKOS™ Antimicrobial Skin and&#xD;
      Wound Cleanser is a pure, colorless, isotonic cleanser that is safe. The preservative, PHMB,&#xD;
      at a concentration of 0.1% w/w is added to the product to inhibit the growth of&#xD;
      microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, antibiotic resistant Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus&#xD;
      aureus [MRSA). and fungus Candida albicans within the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIAKŌS Antimicrobial Wound Gel provides a moist environment to wound surfaces. BIAKŌS&#xD;
      Antimicrobial Wound Gel is a safe and gentle colorless gel. The gel provides preservative&#xD;
      properties through the antimicrobial PHMB. BIAKŌS Antimicrobial Wound Gel: • Resists&#xD;
      microbial colonization within the gel during shelf storage. • Provides an amorphous gel&#xD;
      covering. • Facilitates autolytic debridement through a moist wound environment. Wounds&#xD;
      experience some level of autolytic debridement in which the body's own enzymes breakdown&#xD;
      necrotic tissue.&#xD;

    <masking_description>This protocol is double-blinded. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to have their wound cleansed with either NSS-HG and AMC-AMG. Unblinded staff will prepare the solutions for the two arms the morning of the day of enrollment. NSS-HG and AMC-AMG will be placed in labeled containers consistent with the randomization scheme. Finally, the unblinded research staff will provide the subject with their 4-week supply of NSS-HG and AMC-AMG to take home. The unblinded staff will not assess the study ulcer.</masking_description>
