  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, prospective, retrospective, non-comparative, multi-center&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order not to interfere with patient management, the study is observational. Thus, no&#xD;
      follow-up visit is imposed. The data collection will be limited to the data related to the&#xD;
      management of the patients included throughout their follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended for all patients with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of cardiac&#xD;
      amyloidosis. Three cohorts will be identified: the HEAR (Healthcare European Amyloidosis&#xD;
      Registry)-Retrospective Cohort, the HEAR(Healthcare European Amyloidosis&#xD;
      Registry)-Retrospective-Prospective Cohort and the HEAR (Healthcare European Amyloidosis&#xD;
      Registry)-Prospective Cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyloidosis is a rare disease characterized by infiltration and continuous accumulation of&#xD;
      insoluble fibrillar proteins in the extracellular matrix in various organs including kidney,&#xD;
      nerve, liver, heart and skeletal muscle. Its prevalence is estimated at 0.5-1.3/100,000. The&#xD;
      main forms are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary amyloidosis is caused by deposits of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains&#xD;
           produced by a plasma cell clone in the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hereditary (familial) amyloidosis, the major form of which is mutated transthyretin&#xD;
           amyloidosis of autosomal dominant transmission. More than 100 different mutations of&#xD;
           transthyretin are known and several mutations have been described as amyloidogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Systemic senile amyloidosis which is due to deposits of wild-type (unmutated)&#xD;
           transthyretin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. AA amyloidosis of chronic inflammatory causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Localized amyloidosis. They are in the vast majority of cases primary amyloidosis (or&#xD;
           immunoglobulinic) amyloidosis. The deposition of amyloidosis formed by light chains of&#xD;
           antibodies occurs here in contact with a proliferation of plasma cells located in a&#xD;
           particular organ. There is no passage of the immunoglobulin light chain into the&#xD;
           bloodstream and therefore deposits do not form remotely in other organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Rare amyloidoses. The prognosis of the disease is most often related to the cardiac&#xD;
           involvement. Unfortunately, its diagnosis is often delayed, which worsens the prognosis.&#xD;
           This delay is linked to the absence of simple diagnostic tools (biomarkers, imaging,&#xD;
           etc.) allowing early diagnosis of the disease. The absence of early diagnostic tools,&#xD;
           the heterogeneity of the expression (multi-systemic) of this disease and the difficulty&#xD;
           of its management lead to delays in diagnosis and non-management of certain organ&#xD;
           disorders, which have an impact on the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong need to help physicians better characterize the clinical and biological&#xD;
      presentations of the disease and to improve diagnostic tools and standardize therapeutic&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected for the study are key, routine data for the condition, readily available&#xD;
      in the patients' medical records. It is also possible to use additional and specific&#xD;
      computerized tools to collect these data, within the participating expert centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded in an electronic observation book.&#xD;
