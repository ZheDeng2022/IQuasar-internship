    <textblock>
      Patients with breast cancer meet criteria for enrollment are randomized into PTC group or&#xD;
      control group. The neoadjuvant therapy regimens are guided by PTC test in the PTC group. The&#xD;
      regimens in control group are included of (dd)EC-T for HER2 negative subtype, TCH(P) or&#xD;
      EC-TH(P) for HER2 positive subtype. We compared the pCR rate between two groups as the&#xD;
      primary endpoint.&#xD;

      1. Before neoadjuvant therapy, all samples will be obtained by core needle biopsy for PTC&#xD;
           drug sensitivity test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After obtaining drug sensitivity results and confirming ER/PR and HER2 expression state,&#xD;
           all recruited patients will be randomized into the PTC group or the routine treatment&#xD;
           group, according to the method of random number table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Beijing Cornerstone Life Science and Technology Co., Ltd. is responsible for gene&#xD;
           sequencing and PTC drug sensitivity test for biological samples. All samples for the&#xD;
           study are clinical residuals and will be used in the study, store or destruction is&#xD;
           unapplicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Neoadjuvant therapy regimen in the PTC group is guided by PTC drug sensitivity results,&#xD;
           and regimen in the routine treatment group is based on clinical guideline, such as&#xD;
           (dd)EC-T for HER2 negative breast cancer, and TCH(P) or EC-TH(P) for HER2 positive&#xD;
           breast cancer. All neoadjuvant therapy will be completed before operation if without PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. According to postoperative pathological remission, pCR patients in two groups continued&#xD;
           to complete adjuvant targeted therapy based on original treatment. For non-pCR patients&#xD;
           in the PTC group, PTC drug sensitivity test will be done again to guide adjuvant&#xD;
           therapy, for non-pCR patients in the routine treatment group, Capecitabine for HER2&#xD;
           negative breast cancer, and T-DM1 or H(P) will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. All patients will be received radiotherapy or endocrine therapy if necessary.&#xD;
