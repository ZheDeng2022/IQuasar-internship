      Sepsis is a critical factor causing major mortality and morbidity in liver recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (6). According to guidelines patients with active infection should be treated before listing,&#xD;
      and those who develop infection while on the waiting list should be removed until the&#xD;
      infection is cured or has improved with appropriate antimicrobial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (12). Live donor liver transplant (LDLT) in comparison to Deceased Donor Liver Transplant&#xD;
      (DDLT) is a more planned surgery. This gives us an opportunity for preoperative optimization&#xD;
      and surgery can be timed. In identifying the impact of timing of LDLT wrt. sepsis , major&#xD;
      morbidity can be reduced by optimizing/delaying timing of transplant. On the other hand,&#xD;
      preoperative optimization may not be as critical as currently thought, and many more patients&#xD;
      , currently delisted following sepsis can reap the benefits of a timely transplant. Results&#xD;
      will help in better selection of patients as well as better management of pre transplant&#xD;
      sepsis. A variety of studies have evaluated the impact of preoperative sepsis at different&#xD;
      periods prior to LT on postoperative outcomes but results are widely varied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subsets of macrophages in hepatic capsule are known as liver capsular macrophages(LCMs).&#xD;
      LCMs recruit neutrophils in response to bacteria reaching the liver capsule .LCM depletion&#xD;
      increases liver pathogen load. Further it is also important to study peritoneal macrophages&#xD;
      in chronic liver disease (13). Chronic sterile inflammation, as in nonalcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease, is associated with constant release of damage-associated molecular patterns.&#xD;
      Continuous activation and recruitment of peritoneal and Liver capsular macrophages may&#xD;
      contribute to fibrogenesis under condition of chronic liver diseases. Study of LCMs and PMs&#xD;
      could be a landmark study identifying peritoneal macrophages and Liver capsular macrophages&#xD;
      as highly mobile cells with a specialized function , with many possible therapeutic&#xD;
      applications (14).The study will be collecting data both prospectively and retrospectively&#xD;
      and will involve assessment of association of timeline and profile of preoperative sepsis on&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity of liver transplant recipients. Primary objective will be Correlation&#xD;
      of timeline of sepsis with recipient outcome following Live donor liver transplant. Outcome&#xD;
      parameters will be Post operative sepsis ,In hospital mortality, Hospital stay, ICU stay,&#xD;
      Retransfer to ICU, Days on ventilator, Need for tracheostomy/re-intubation, Duration of&#xD;
      inotropic support. Secondary objectives To study the impact of source of sepsis on&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes, To evaluate the causative organism of sepsis on post operative&#xD;
      outcome. To study the correlation between recipient liver capsular and peritoneal macrophage&#xD;
      activity and preoperative sepsis timeline, profile as well as post operative recipient&#xD;
      outcome. 25 samples will be collected for liver capsular and peritoneal macrophage study.&#xD;

      Explant liver with be sent for assessment of the subcapsular layer in addition to routine&#xD;
      Histo pathological examination (HPE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peritoneal biopsy with 5 ml of peritoneal fluid from the recipient will also be collected and&#xD;
      processed for analysis of macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will then be subjected to flow cytometry for assessment of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Macrophage identification markers: Quantitative assessment .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Macrophage Activation markers: Qualitative/ Activation assessment. Density and&#xD;
           functionality of both LCM and PM will then be co-related to both pre-LT sepsis timeline&#xD;
           and profile as well as post operative recipient outcome .&#xD;
