  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, positive parallel controlled clinical study to evaluate&#xD;
      the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety of PVL/PVE combined with DEB-TACE in the&#xD;
      treatment of unresectable patients with large or large tumors in the right lobe of the liver.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most guidelines recommend transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as the standard of treatment&#xD;
      for hepatocellular carcinoma（HCC）which is limited to the right half of the liver, single&#xD;
      large or multiple, with / without tumor thrombus of the right branch of the portal vein.While&#xD;
      a number of studies demonstrate poor effect of TACE for patients with large hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. Portal vein embolization(PVE)/portal vein ligation(PVL) is the main means to&#xD;
      increase the future liver remnant (FLR), which can reduce the complications after&#xD;
      hepatectomy. TACE on the basis of PVE/PVL can not only increase FLR, but also can effectively&#xD;
      control the progression of tumor by sequential TACE. This study intends to conduct a&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, positive parallel-controlled clinical study to objectively and&#xD;
      scientifically evaluate the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety of ligation of the&#xD;
      right portal vein combined with Drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization(DEB-TACE)&#xD;
      technique in the treatment of patients with large or large tumors of the right lobe who&#xD;
      cannot be resected in I-stage.&#xD;
