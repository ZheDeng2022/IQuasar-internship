  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Refractory pituitary adenoma is characterized by invasive tumor growth, continuous growth&#xD;
      and/or hormone hypersecretion in spite of standardized multi-modal treatment such as&#xD;
      surgeries, medications or radiations. Quality of life or even lives are threatened by these&#xD;
      tumors. According to the 2017 World Health Organization's new classification guideline of&#xD;
      pituitary adenoma, patients have to suffer from symptoms or complications caused by these&#xD;
      tumors, to bear a heavy financial burden, and to accept additional therapeutic side effects&#xD;
      when the diagnosis of &quot;refractory pituitary adenoma&quot; is made. If refractory pituitary adenoma&#xD;
      could be predicted at early stage, these patients would be able to have a more frequent&#xD;
      clinical follow-up, receive multiple effective treatment as early as possible, or even be&#xD;
      enrolled in clinical trials of investigational medications, so as to prevent or delay the&#xD;
      recurrence or persistent of the tumor growth. Therefore, the unmet clinical need falls into&#xD;
      an early prediction system for refractory pituitary adenomas, which could provide accurate&#xD;
      guidance for subsequent treatment in the early stage. The investigators have constructed a&#xD;
      pituitary adenoma database including clinical data, radiological images, pathological images&#xD;
      and genetic information. The investigators are proposing a study using machine learning to&#xD;
      extract features from these multi-dimensional, multi-omics data, which could be further used&#xD;
      to train a prediction model for the risk of refractory pituitary adenoma. The proposed model&#xD;
      would also be validated in another prospectively collected database. The established model&#xD;
      would be able to identify potential medication targets and provide guidance for personalized&#xD;
      therapy of refractory pituitary adenoma.&#xD;
