  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current commercially available MEKTOVI® (binimetinib) 15 mg tablets are provided as&#xD;
      immediate release film-coated tablets for oral administration. For the treatment of adult&#xD;
      patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation, the recommended&#xD;
      dosing regimen is 45 mg twice daily (bis in die, BID). No food effect with the commercial&#xD;
      formulation of 15 mg was demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce the patient's burden, a new strength tablet containing 45 mg of&#xD;
      binimetinib as active ingredient is being developed. As a result, the number of tablets to be&#xD;
      taken by the patients will be reduced from 6 tablets (6 x 15 mg) to 2 tablets (2 x 45 mg) per&#xD;
      day. The evaluation of the relative bioavailability of the 45 mg tablet in comparison to&#xD;
      three 15 mg tablets intake is therefore required.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The R formulation is the currently commercially available tablet containing 15 mg of&#xD;
      binimetinib as active substance, administered as three tablets for a total of 45 mg&#xD;
      binimetinib. The T formulation is the tablet containing 45 mg of binimetinib as active&#xD;
      substance in one tablet. Participants will be randomized to one of 2 treatment sequences (RT&#xD;
      or TR) containing 2 treatment periods, with at least a 7-day washout between each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period between 21 and 2 days before the first study&#xD;
      treatment administration on Period (P) 1 Day (D) 1, 2 treatment periods of 5 days each, and a&#xD;
      washout of at least 7 days between P1D1 and P2D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatments are given by the oral route in fasted condition. The end-of-study (EOS)&#xD;
      visit will be performed 30 (± 3) days after the last study treatment administration or&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;
