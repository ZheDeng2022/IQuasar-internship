      The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the effect of elevated plasma ceramides on&#xD;
      peripheral vascular function. Subjects will be administered a high fat meal consisting of&#xD;
      long chain fatty acids (to increase plasma ceramides) or medium chain fatty acids (control)&#xD;
      followed by assessment of their vascular function using brachial artery flow-mediated&#xD;
      dilation and reactive hyperemia to measure their large and small artery function,&#xD;
      respectively. In addition to these traditional methods, specifically peripheral microvascular&#xD;
      endothelial function will be assessed using incident darkfield microscopy (CytoCam).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Following decades of decline in mortality, death due to heart disease is increasing, and&#xD;
      remains the #1 cause of death in the United States. Although acute ischemic events are&#xD;
      typically due to obstructive plaque within the coronary conduit arteries, strong evidence&#xD;
      suggests that dysfunction within the coronary microvasculature is a more powerful predictor&#xD;
      of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) than severity of atherosclerosis. The coronary&#xD;
      microvasculature likely also contributes to other forms of cardiovascular disease including&#xD;
      heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). While assessment of the coronary&#xD;
      microvasculature is highly invasive and expensive, interrogation of the peripheral&#xD;
      microvasculature offers a more feasible approach. Recent studies have concluded that&#xD;
      peripheral microvascular dysfunction mirrors the functional status of the coronary&#xD;
      microvasculature. Further, impaired peripheral microvascular function is associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of MACE in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), suggesting that&#xD;
      the microvasculature plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevated plasma ceramides are also associated with risk of MACE in otherwise healthy&#xD;
      individuals as well as in heart failure both with and without reduced ejection fraction&#xD;
      (HFrEF and HFpEF, respectively). Recently it was shown that ceramide levels are increased in&#xD;
      patients with early CAD. Exposure to exogenous ceramide causes microvascular endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction in arterioles from healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However the effect of ceramide on human in vivo peripheral microvascular function represents&#xD;
      a critical knowledge gap that needs to be addressed. This study will observe how blood&#xD;
      vessels respond to acetylcholine and nitroglycerin before and after increased plasma&#xD;
      ceramide. Acetylcholine induce endothelial-dependent dilation whereas nitroglycerin is an&#xD;
      endothelial-independent dilator. Therefore although both are vasodilators they elicit&#xD;
      dilation very differently. The nitroglycerin is used to ensure the subject can dilate even&#xD;
      despite endothelial dysfunction. Lack of a response to acetylcholine suggests that the&#xD;
      subject may have endothelial dysfunction, which is a precursor to cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Increased plasma ceramide may evoke peripheral in vivo microvascular dysfunction that mirrors&#xD;
      that of the coronary microvasculature thus providing a less invasive means to assess future&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
