  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The XVIVO Registry is to collect standard of care clinical data from &quot;all-comers&quot; who are&#xD;
      transplanted with an EVLP lung treated with the XVIVO Perfusion System™ in order to assess&#xD;
      the long-term performance of the device, and monitor device-related serious adverse events.&#xD;
      In addition, 4 and 5-year UNOS registry data of the 126 subjects who received an EVLP&#xD;
      transplant under the NOVEL and NOVEL Extension studies are provided as part of the long-term&#xD;
      safety and quality of life data. The 4 and 5 year data of the 126 subjects is providing&#xD;
      equivalent to 8.5-12 years long term safety data if part of the All Comers Registry with&#xD;
      anticipated 10-15 transplanted subjects annually.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The XVIVO registry is an ongoing, observational, multicenter, retrospective review of&#xD;
      patients exposed to XPS™ EVLP-treated lungs. The Registry study is aligned and managed by the&#xD;
      UNOS and OPTN data collection process. This registry uses quarterly STAR file data requests&#xD;
      for the OPTN data managed by UNOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated the &quot;All Comers Registry&quot; will have 10-15 transplanted subjects, annually.&#xD;
      The EVLP procedure and transplantation will be performed per XPS™ Instructions for Use and&#xD;
      the treating physician's discretion. Post-transplant clinical care will follow the&#xD;
      institution's standard-of-care policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTN updated the data collected since the submission of the protocol therefore the data&#xD;
      collection has changed. The following data has updated collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collects if hospitalized since last follow-up (yes, no), not the number of&#xD;
           hospitalizations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collects acute rejection episodes (yes treated, yes not treated, no), not the number of&#xD;
           episodes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collects Karnofsky Score as replacement for Physical and functional capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Employment limitations has been updated to working for income (yes or no)&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary Function Test (FEV1) is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. FEV1 is the key lung function test in diagnosing BOS. FEV1 test at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years post-transplant.</description>

    <description>Rate of Grade 0 through 3 Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years post-transplant. Clinically, BOS is associated with a progressive decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) greater than or equal to 20% of baseline. Decline in FEV1 % increases the risk of development of BOS (Grade 0 to 3).</description>

    <description>Karnofsky Performance Status Scale is an assessment tool for functional impairment. It is used to improve understanding of patient needs, ability to carry out daily activities and to assess patient prognosis. Karnofsky score is calculated at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years post-transplant. Higher the Karnofsky score, better the ability to carry out daily activities.</description>

        This is an &quot;All Comers Registry&quot; hence, no specific investigator sites. All patients&#xD;
        receiving EVLP lungs treated with XPS™ will be included in the registry without eligibility&#xD;
        criteria or pre-selection. Since the registry collects only standard-of-care data and&#xD;
        requires no additional procedures or risks to the subject, a waiver of consent is&#xD;
        appropriate&#xD;
