      introduction to the session, recognizing the general topics, 5 minutes of briefly summarizing&#xD;
      the previous session, and the topic of the session for 30-40 minutes. In all sessions,&#xD;
      reflections prepared with the power point program will be used. In the sessions,&#xD;
      question-answer method, audio-visual (audio-visual) method, role-playing and performance&#xD;
      feedback phases will be used when necessary. In addition to knowledge, experiences in&#xD;
      education will also be emphasized and it will be possible to make comparisons with the&#xD;
      subject learned in education.&#xD;
