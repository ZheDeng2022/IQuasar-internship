      This study will be a randomized control trial and will be conducted in Riphah International&#xD;
      Hospital, National orthopedic and specialist hospital, Riphah international hospital and&#xD;
      Chambeli institute of physiotherapy. A sample of 34 participants will be taken. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized into Group A and Group B through lottery method. Group A will receive High&#xD;
      Dose Neural Mobilization Technique, Hot pack for 15 minutes, strengthening exercises with&#xD;
      10rep/8sets , strengthening exercises for quadriceps and static stretching exercise for&#xD;
      hamstring with 10 rep/8sets, While Group B will receive Low Dose Neural Mobilization&#xD;
      Technique with minimal intensity, hot pack: 15 minutes, strengthening exercises with&#xD;
      10rep/4sets. Both groups will be given session of 40 min/day, 2 days/week for 4 weeks,&#xD;
      assessment will be done at baseline, at the end of 1st week, 2nd week, 3rd week &amp; at the end&#xD;
      of 4th week. The outcome measure will be Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Oswestry&#xD;
      Disability Index (ODI), Active Knee Extension test (AKE) and Lumbar flexion by Schober&#xD;
      method. Data will be analyzed be SPSS 22.&#xD;

    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale that is a uni-dimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (no pain) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;). The intrarater reliability with ICC = 0.67.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index(ODI) is a questionnaire reported by the patient itself for low back pain. The questionnaire into ten sections is divided and used to assess daily living activities limitations. Scored on scales of 0- 5 for each section, greatest disability is represented by 5. To calculate index summed scores is divided by the total score, then by 100 multiplied and as percentage it is expressed. With degree of disability associated are the scores indicating minimal to bed bound disability. 0% to 20% scores shows minimal disability, moderate disability indicated by scores from 20% to 40%, severe disability indicated by from 40% to 60% scores, 60% to 80% indicates crippled; and bedbound or exaggerating indicated by scores from 80% to 100%. Test-retest has high reliability (r = 0.83 to 0.99).</description>

    <measure>Active Knee Extension test for hamstring flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AKE test as known as active knee extension test is used to assess the flexibility and available Range of motion of hamstring muscle.The range of active knee extension in the position of hip flexion is easily assessed. M. Shamsi, Meriam et.al discussed the reliability and validity of this test and proved it as a valid tool for measurement of shortness in hamstring muscle.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lumbar flexion by Schober method</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the measurement of OST, the participant stood erect while the lumbosacral junction was marked as indicated by the dimples of Venus. A second mark was placed 10 cm above the junction. The participant was then asked to bend forward as far as possible, and the stretched distance was indicated as the OST in cm.</description>
