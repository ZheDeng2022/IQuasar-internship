  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular edema (DME) is one of the leading causes of visual impairment in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes. Fluorescein angiography (FA) plays an important role in diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      (DR) staging and evaluation of retinal vasculature. However, FA is an invasive technique and&#xD;
      does not permit the precise visualization of the retinal vasculature. Optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive technique that has become popular in diagnosing and&#xD;
      monitoring DR and its laser, medical, and surgical treatment. It provides a quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of retinal thickness and location of edema in the macula. Automated OCT retinal&#xD;
      thickness maps are routinely used in monitoring DME and its response to treatment. However,&#xD;
      standard OCT provides only structural information and therefore does not delineate blood flow&#xD;
      within the retinal vasculature. By combining the physiological information in FA with the&#xD;
      structural information in the OCT, zones of leakage can be correlated to structural changes&#xD;
      in the retina for better evaluation and monitoring of the response of DME to different&#xD;
      treatment modalities. The occasional unavailability of either imaging modality may impair&#xD;
      decision-making during the follow-up of patients with DME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem of medical data generation particularly images has been of great interest, and as&#xD;
      such, it has been deeply studied in recent years especially with the advent of deep&#xD;
      convolutional neural networks(DCNN), which are progressively becoming the standard approach&#xD;
      in most machine learning tasks such as pattern recognition and image classification.&#xD;
      Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are neural network models in which a generation and a&#xD;
      discrimination networks are trained simultaneously. Integrated network performance&#xD;
      effectively generates new plausible image samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work is to assess the efficacy of a GAN implementing pix2pix image&#xD;
      translation for original FA to synthetic OCT color-coded macular thickness map image&#xD;
      translation and the reverse (from original OCT color-coded macular thickness map to synthetic&#xD;
      FA image translation).&#xD;
