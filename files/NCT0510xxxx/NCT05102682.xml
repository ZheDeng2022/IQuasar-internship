      enhance balance, mobility and uPPER limb function in people with Multiple Sclerosis &quot;RAPPER&#xD;
      III - MS&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rex Bionics are now enrolling for RAPPER III, a 10 patient trial at East Kent University&#xD;
      Hospital foundation Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at the following address:&#xD;
&#xD;
      School Of Engineering and Arts, Jennison Building, University of Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NT We&#xD;
      would like to invite you to take part in our research study. Before you decide we would like&#xD;
      you to understand why the research is being done and what it would involve for you. One of&#xD;
      our team will go through the information sheet with you and answer any questions you have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this feasibility study is to evaluate the overall device safety when used in&#xD;
      a Clinical Rehabilitation Centre under the supervision of a physician and/or qualified&#xD;
      rehabilitation specialist. The trial can be completed by patients over 6 sessions, each a&#xD;
      week apart. The study will consist of walking in REX Bionics powered exercise device and&#xD;
      completing a variety of therapy exercises the assistance of REX trained therapists. You will&#xD;
      be asked to complete some questionnaires and other tests before the first session, after the&#xD;
      3rd session and finally after your 6th session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This document is broken into 2 parts Part 1 - tells you the purpose of this study and what to&#xD;
      expect if you take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - gives you more detailed information about the conduct of the study. Part 1 What is&#xD;
      the purpose of this study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) To assess the feasibility and safety of undertaking a neuro-rehabilitation exercise&#xD;
      program using a Rex robotic device within a controlled clinical environment (ease of use for&#xD;
      both user and therapist ii) Investigate the potential to improve balance and walking using&#xD;
      Rex for people with MS iii) Investigate the potential health benefits of this Rex&#xD;
      Rehabilitation program iv) Ascertain whether there might be a measurable impact on upper limb&#xD;
      functional abilities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why have I been invited? You have been asked to participate in this study because you have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of multiple sclerosis that fits the inclusion criteria of this study. There will be&#xD;
      a number of assessments prior to trialling the device to ensure you fit the criteria to&#xD;
      safely use REX. This is for your own safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do I have to take part? It is up to you to decide to join the study. We will describe the&#xD;
      study and go through the information sheet. If you agree to take part, we will then ask you&#xD;
      sign a consent form. You are free to withdraw at any time, without giving a reason. This&#xD;
      would not affect the standard of care you receive. We are planning to enrol 10 people for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What will happen to me if I take part? Study Schedule You will be asked to come to the rehab&#xD;
      clinic for 6 sessions. The timing of these sessions vary and more detail is given below. Each&#xD;
      session will be a week apart. Please ensure you wear supportive fitting laced shoes, a pair&#xD;
      of comfortable sporting trousers/track suit bottoms and a light T-Shirt or Similar. If you&#xD;
      have issues with the support structures of your feet you should consider using orthotics to&#xD;
      offer added support. Please raise any concerns you have with your therapist conducting the&#xD;
      research so further information can be provided to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrolment - You will be asked some screening questions prior being enrolled in the&#xD;
           study. If you are enrolled, you will be asked to complete 13 outcome measures&#xD;
           (tests/questionnaires) in session 1, 4 questionnaires 2 days after session 3 and finally&#xD;
           all 13 outcome measures (tests/questionnaires) in session 6. (approximately 90 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 1 - you will be asked to come into the clinic to complete a number of tasks.&#xD;
           (approximately 150 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 1: baseline medical assessment and giving informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medical examination will take place along with a discussion around your current medical&#xD;
      conditions and previous medical conditions to determine if you are safe to use REX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a patient information sheet and ask to give consent if you would like to be&#xD;
      included in the study. You can withdraw at any time and do not have to give consent if you do&#xD;
      not choose to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2: Assessment against inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assessed against a number of different inclusion and exclusion criteria to&#xD;
      determine whether you are appropriate for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 3: completion of pre-treatment outcome measures and questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to complete a number of scales and questionnaires. These will be repeated&#xD;
      at the end of the study (during sessions 6). If you have any questions about any of these you&#xD;
      should ask the investigator and the investigator will provide you with enough time and space&#xD;
      to discuss everything. The outcome measures are listed below.&#xD;
