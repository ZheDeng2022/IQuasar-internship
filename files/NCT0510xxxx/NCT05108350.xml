    <textblock>
      The trial is to assess the bioequivalence between HR20033 FDC tablet and co-administration of&#xD;
      SHR3824 tablets and metformin XR tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate bioequivalence of SHR3824 and Metformin in healthy&#xD;
      Chinese subjects in the fed state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of HR20033 FDC tablet in healthy Chinese&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There will be two independent cohorts of subjects who will each receive two treatments (high dose strength and low dose strength), and each treatment will be followed by 72 hours of blood sampling for pharmacokinetic assessments, with safety and tolerability. In each cohort approximately 40 healthy subjects will be randomized to receive treatment with IP to complete at least 36 evaluable subjects.</intervention_model_description>
