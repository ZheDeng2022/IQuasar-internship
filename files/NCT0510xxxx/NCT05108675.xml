    <textblock>
      Nutritional status during pregnancy plays an important role in maternal health and birth&#xD;
      outcomes. While few factors impacting nutritional status during pregnancy have been&#xD;
      identified, studies of undernutrition in children have revealed a key role for the gut&#xD;
      microbiome. Remarkably, studies examining the dynamics of the maternal gut microbiome before&#xD;
      and during pregnancy and its impact on birth outcomes are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted to investigate how a mother's nutritional status and her gut&#xD;
      microbiome during pregnancy contribute to the birth outcomes and health of her baby. The gut&#xD;
      microbiome is the totality of microorganisms (e.g. bacteria, viruses, fungi) living in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. This study will focus on married pregnant women 24 years and younger&#xD;
      living in Matiari District in Pakistan. The focus is on younger women due to their&#xD;
      vulnerability to undernutrition. Pregnant participants, and upon delivery, their newborns&#xD;
      will be followed throughout pregnancy and for a year afterwards. Throughout this period, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect stool samples, rectal swabs, blood samples, health assessments,&#xD;
      nutritional and dietary assessments and birth/ labour details. The goal is to define the&#xD;
      relationship between a mother's nutritional status and her microbiome dynamics during&#xD;
      pregnancy and how they contribute to the birth outcomes and growth of her newborn.&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesizes that alterations of the microbiota in the maternal gut (dysbiosis)&#xD;
      is exacerbated by nutritional status or pathogen exposure during pregnancy. This impacts&#xD;
      weight gain because of impaired nutrient absorption, and can lead to corresponding negative&#xD;
      birth outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project represents the first systematic investigation of the impact of the microbiome on&#xD;
      nutritional status during pregnancy in young women and directly aligns with global health&#xD;
      initiatives focused on this vulnerable cohort. The goal of the study is to define the&#xD;
      relationships between host nutritional status and microbiome dynamics during pregnancy and&#xD;
      how they contribute to birth outcomes. The gut microbiome has a profound influence on host&#xD;
      nutritional status. Dysbiosis (loss of diversity/beneficial microbes and gain of pathobionts)&#xD;
      has emerged as a major factor in the development of undernutrition. Despite the importance of&#xD;
      nutrition during pregnancy, few studies have examined the role of the microbiome on maternal&#xD;
      health and birth outcomes. Further, little is known concerning the influence of enteric&#xD;
      eukaryotic microbes, such as parasites, on the bacterial microbiome and host nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the core of this study are two complementary cohorts of young women that provide an&#xD;
      exceptional opportunity to obtain longitudinal samples to monitor the dynamic relationships&#xD;
      between microbiome community structure and function with gut health and host nutritional&#xD;
      status. This registration is for the Matiari, Pakistan cohort of the study, where there is&#xD;
      known to be a high prevalence of undernutrition among young women. This cohort is expected to&#xD;
      yield insights into the influence of eukaryotic microbes that are often viewed as&#xD;
      asymptomatic. The target demographic of the study is young, married mothers, ≤24 years in&#xD;
      Matiari District within the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Matiari District is representative&#xD;
      of rural settings in Pakistan The investigators have identified this younger demographic due&#xD;
      to the lack of knowledge on the microbiome of young women, and their vulnerability to&#xD;
      undernutrition. A second complementary cohort will be based Toronto, Canada. This project&#xD;
      will yield insights into the relationships between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in the&#xD;
      gut and their associations with maternal health and birth outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis of the study is that alterations of the microbiota in the maternal gut&#xD;
      (dysbiosis) exacerbated by nutritional status or pathogen exposure during pregnancy, impacts&#xD;
      weight gain because of impaired nutrient absorption, leading to corresponding negative birth&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective, longitudinal, observational study to investigate the impact&#xD;
      and relationship between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in the gut and their association&#xD;
      with maternal health and birth outcomes among married young women ≤24 years residing in&#xD;
      Matiari District. . The study will aim to recruit 400 women into two groups based on BMI at&#xD;
      time of recruitment (normal BMI will be defined as between 20 and 24.9 kg/m2 and low BMI will&#xD;
      be defined as less than 20 kg/m2). With a goal of having 200 participants within the normal&#xD;
      BMI group and 200 participants within the low BMI group. Although this is the recruitment&#xD;
      aim, in the event that the investigators are unable to recruit 200 women with a low BMI, more&#xD;
      women will be recruited that fall within the normal BMI range. The study will follow women&#xD;
      and their infants over the course of their pregnancy and for a year postpartum, collecting&#xD;
      stool, rectal and blood samples, nutritional information, heath assessments, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements and empowerment metrics at different time points.&#xD;

Alpha diversity will be measured through indices such as Chao, Shannon and Simpson indices. Beta diversity will be measured through standard indices such as Bray-Curtis distances.</description>

        This study will examine young, married women ≤24 years living in Matiari District,&#xD;
        Pakistan. The investigators focus on younger women, due to the lack of knowledge about&#xD;
        their microbiome and their vulnerability to undernutrition&#xD;

    <ipd_description>In addition to publishing findings in open access journals, the investigators will ensure all sequences and metabolomics datasets are deposited in appropriate public repositories of those who consented for this deidentified data sharing. SOPs, pathogen samples and statistical methods developed through this project will be shared with the IMPACTT research core (https://www.impactt-microbiome.ca/). Microbiome sequence data will be uploaded on the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).&#xD;
The NCBI acts as a central data repository for sequence data. In line with publication standards, the investigators are required to provide access to users who may wish to follow up on analyzing the microbiome data for their own purposes.&#xD;
The sample analysis information, including the sequencing data and metabolomics data will be de-identified and the patient sequence data will be removed.</ipd_description>
