  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to compare pain differences between using MedJet needle-free drug-delivery system&#xD;
      with standard of care treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas&#xD;
      in participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will undergo treatments on two morphologically and anatomically matched target&#xD;
      lesions, preferably on opposing sides of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first plaque will be treated using standard of care topical bexarotene or nitrogen&#xD;
      mustard for participants with CTCL (cutaneous T-cell lymphomas) or intralesional TAC&#xD;
      (triamcinolone acetonide) using a syringe/needle with participants with CBCL (cutaneous&#xD;
      B-cell lymphomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second plaque will be treated using a needle-free injector system. After the treatment,&#xD;
      the participants will be followed for another three visits over the course of 4 months to see&#xD;
      how the treated areas responded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to account for 20% dropout, 11 patients per group (a needle free and a traditional&#xD;
      treatment group in CBCL patients and the same two groups in CTCL patients) will be recruited.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain measurement between the Med-Jet and standard of care treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 Hour after the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The pain of injections with Medjet vs conventional topical therapies of bexarotene or nitrogen mustard will be measured using a visual standard analog pain scale 0 (no distress) to 10 (unbearable distress) immediately after each injection.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants that prefer traditional treatment versus MedJet.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability of Pruritus</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability will be measured using Pruritus score assessment in the Medjet and topical therapy cohorts using a visual standard analog itching scale 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable) with the affected plaques at each indicated visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life due to skin conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life assessment will be done using the Dermatology Life Quality Index survey (DLQI) which will include a series of topics related to the skin condition including symptoms, feelings, effects on daily life, employment or schooling, personal relationships, and treatment.&#xD;
Each of the ten (10) questions are scored from 0 to 3, giving a score range from 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life). Resulting scores are as follows: 0-1 = No effect on patient's life, 2-5 = Small effect, 6-10 = Moderate effect, 11-20 = Very large effect, 21-30 = Extremely large effect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CAILS assessment of clinical efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) is an assessment of individual lesions by the investigator of disease severity at the time of evaluation which can be used to monitor and compare lesions over time. CAILS is a 5-criterion scale ranging from 0 (no evidence) to 8 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the size of the lesion and severity of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, and hypo- or hyperpigmentation. When making the assessment of severity, the Investigator will score the area with most clearance (ie, have scores of 0) within the treated plaque.</description>

    <description>The Med-Jet injector is a needle-free injection system that consists of a hand-held firing body/trigger, sterilized barrel, disposable luer lock syringe, disposable nozzle cap, and disposable splash guard. The Med-Jet injector is designed to deliver drugs or biologics into the intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular tissues, by means of a narrow, high-velocity jet of fluid, which penetrates the surface of the skin and delivers the fluid to the target tissue</description>
