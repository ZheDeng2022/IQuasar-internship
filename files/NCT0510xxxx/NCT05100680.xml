  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy study in one period will include 34&#xD;
      participants divided into two groups. One group will receive a test product (n = 22; test&#xD;
      group; multicomponent dietary supplement including MSM and several vitamins and minerals);&#xD;
      the other group received placebo capsules (n = 12; placebo group; only modified starch).&#xD;
      Volunteers will take two capsules / day orally continuously daily for 12 weeks to assess the&#xD;
      effect of these substances on nail growth and condition and skin.&#xD;
