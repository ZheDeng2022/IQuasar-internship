  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous set of severe developmental abnormalities&#xD;
      of the nervous system characterized by deficits affecting social interactions and verbal and&#xD;
      non-verbal communication, as well as the presence of restricted interests, repetitive&#xD;
      behaviors, and atypical sensory manifestations . ASD affects approximately 1% of the general&#xD;
      population (Elsabbagh et al., 2012). Studies of siblings of individuals with ASD show that&#xD;
      ASD is present in 7-20% of the offspring in families where a child has had a diagnosis of ASD&#xD;
      and this prevalence increases if there are two diagnosed children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies show the benefits of interventions targeting parents' interaction strategies&#xD;
      in the early phases of development of infants at high risk for ASDs, in reducing the risk&#xD;
      itself or its severity. Very early intervention, due to the presence of significant brain&#xD;
      plasticity at these stages, may be particularly effective in changing these emerging&#xD;
      trajectories, from a &quot;preventive intervention&quot; perspective that would aim to mitigate&#xD;
      developmental risk and alter prodromal symptom trajectories, rather than eliminate a&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the implementation of a specific therapeutic education program during&#xD;
      a new pregnancy in the mother of a child with a diagnosis of ASD (MER Program) could improve&#xD;
      the mother's well-being, increase parenting communication skills, and thereby improve&#xD;
      interaction with the newborn at high risk for ASD. If the infant is affected, it may also&#xD;
      reduce the symptoms of the disorder. Indirectly, it could also improve the well-being of the&#xD;
      other parent involved in the interaction.&#xD;

      Randomized controlled trial with deferred start, French multicenter stepped-wedge type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The start date of the intervention in each center will be done by randomization, defining 2&#xD;
      periods: a control period located before the start of the intervention, and an experimental&#xD;
      period located after the start of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design allows the principal investigating team to train the centers associated in turn&#xD;
      with the intervention, and to have a control group with structured follow-up but without&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be included before 26 ADT and assigned to the control or experimental&#xD;
      group, depending on the time of inclusion and the randomization of the center to which they&#xD;
      belong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up will be conducted in 2 phases: 1. during pregnancy and 2. After the birth of&#xD;
      the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects included were pregnant women who already had a child with an ASD diagnosis, the&#xD;
      second parent if present, and the newborn at risk for an ASD diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of an innovative therapeutic&#xD;
      education program (the MER program) versus control in pregnant women with a first child&#xD;
      followed for ASD on the quality of interaction strategies of the mother-infant dyad at 10&#xD;
      months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was the caregiver non-directiveness subscore of the Manchester&#xD;
      Assessment of Caregiver-infant Interaction (MACI) scale at 10 months postpartum. This&#xD;
      subscore is both the most sensitive to intervention and predictive of ASD diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first secondary objective is the evaluation of the effect of the MER versus control&#xD;
      program on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maternal pregnancy-related anxiety (PRAQ-R2 score) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxious and depressive symptomatology and quality of life (WhoQoL-Bref score) in the&#xD;
           mother and the second parent during pregnancy (EPDS score) and up to 20 months of age of&#xD;
           the newborn (HAM-Anxiety and HAM-Depression scores);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perceived stress related to pregnancy (ALES score)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mother-infant interaction at 10 and 20 months (MACI score and subscore);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  autistic signs in at-risk infants at 20 months (ADOS Toddler score);&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second secondary objective was to study variables that could impact the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention, including&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adherence: compliance with sessions, satisfaction of participants (PEI-Parent score) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other variables that could modulate the effect of the intervention: sociodemographic&#xD;
           variables (socioeconomic level, family configuration, number of children); clinical&#xD;
           profile of the mother (intellectual efficiency (Raven's PM score), psychiatric&#xD;
           comorbidities (DIGS, SRS score)); clinical profile of the child already diagnosed (ADI-R&#xD;
           and ADOS score; developmental level); clinical profile of the infant at risk&#xD;
           (gestational age, MSEL, IBQ-R and ECBQ scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third secondary objective was to describe the barriers and levers to the implementation&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics related to the implementation of the intervention (recruitment, uptake,&#xD;
      fidelity, and implementation) will be collected, as well as the profile of mothers who did&#xD;
      not participate in the project.&#xD;

    <description>The M.E.R program is a therapeutic education intervention for mothers of children with ASD during a new pregnancy. This program, which is a pilot in France and in Europe, involves several dimensions, both pedagogical and behavioral (strategies for stimulating the baby, use of specific communication and interaction tools) and psychological (reduction of stress, anxiety, etc. in the mother).&#xD;
It includes 8 individual interviews of 1h30 every 15 days. The first and the last one are for evaluation purposes, the 6 intermediate sessions constitute the accompaniment. The structure of the program and the sessions are based on what is recommended in therapeutic education. The sessions can take place on the hospital site or at home.</description>
