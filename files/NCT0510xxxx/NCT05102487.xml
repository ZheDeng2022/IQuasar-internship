  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently at University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC) consent for anesthesia is obtained&#xD;
      verbally by qualified anesthesia providers. Later this year, we will be moving to a written&#xD;
      informed consent form for anesthesia that must be signed by patients before proceeded with&#xD;
      elective surgery. We aim to study patient satisfaction and retention of information presented&#xD;
      before and after this change is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent for anesthesia is obtained, study personnel will approach patients &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
      of age scheduled for elective surgery and, after seeking verbal consent for this study, will&#xD;
      administer a questionnaire which will assess patient satisfaction and retention of the risks&#xD;
      that were presented.&#xD;

      Currently at UCMC consent for anesthesia is obtained verbally by qualified anesthesia&#xD;
      providers. Later this year, we will be moving to a written informed consent form for&#xD;
      anesthesia that must be signed by patients before proceeded with elective surgery. We aim to&#xD;
      study patient satisfaction and retention of information presented before and after this&#xD;
      change is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures After consent for anesthesia is obtained, study personnel will approach&#xD;
      patients &gt;= 18 years of age scheduled for elective surgery and, after seeking verbal consent&#xD;
      for this study, will administer a questionnaire which will assess patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      retention of the risks that were presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will be recorded, including age, sex, classification of surgery (by&#xD;
      service), urgency of case, as well as role of person obtaining anesthesia consent (resident&#xD;
      vs. CRNA/APN vs. attending anesthesiologist). Method of obtaining anesthesia consent will&#xD;
      also be recorded. Patient identifiers, including name, MRN and date of birth will NOT be&#xD;
      recorded as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached for participation in this study preoperatively, in the pre-op&#xD;
      holding area, immediately after anesthesia consent is obtained by the appropriate anesthesia&#xD;
      provider. The patient's electronic medical record will NOT be accessed in order to pre-screen&#xD;
      for participation no PHI will be collected in this study.&#xD;
