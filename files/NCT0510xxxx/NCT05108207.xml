      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium, is a clinical condition characterized by acute and fluctuating deterioration of the&#xD;
      cognitive state, generally secondary to an acute pathology. It is a common condition in&#xD;
      hospitalized older adults and it develops in 20-30% of patients hospitalized in a general&#xD;
      ward and up to 80% of those hospitalized in critical care units. Delirium is associated with&#xD;
      negative outcomes in older adults, such as longer hospitalizations, higher mortality, and&#xD;
      short and medium-term institutionalization. Randomized clinical trials have shown that&#xD;
      delirium is preventable through non-pharmacological prevention measures, decreasing its&#xD;
      incidence by 30 to 50%. These interventions include promoting physical activity, facilitating&#xD;
      the use of glasses and hearing aids, cognitive stimulation, and providing frequent&#xD;
      reorientation of time and space, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measures are currently seldom applied in hospitals in Chile and around the world for&#xD;
      various reasons some of which include the heavy workload of clinical staff, the lack of&#xD;
      trained personnel, and, in general, the absence of systematic implementation processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate whether cognitive stimulation guided by PREVEDEL software&#xD;
      prevents delirium status(full/subsyncromal delirium) in hospitalized older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method/Design: randomized controlled trial, parallel groups, multicenter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: patients 65 years or older who have been hospitalized for less than 48 hours in&#xD;
      the general ward or in the intermediate care unit of 4 hospitals in Santiago, Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: participants in the intervention group will use a tablet with cognitive&#xD;
      stimulation software for delirium prevention for 5 continuous days versus the control group&#xD;
      who will use the tablet without the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations: The incidence of delirium and subsyndromal delirium, duration, density of&#xD;
      delirium, cognitive and functional status at discharge, adherence to prevention measures, as&#xD;
      well as demographic variables of interest will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background. Delirium is a clinical condition characterized by acute cognitive impairment, of&#xD;
      fluctuating course, generally secondary to an acute pathology, which appears after the&#xD;
      interaction between predisposing factors and well described precipitants. It is a very common&#xD;
      condition in older adults, observed in 20% to 30% of patients hospitalized in a general ward,&#xD;
      and up to 80% of those hospitalized in critical care units. Delirium is associated with&#xD;
      negative clinical outcomes which include longer hospitalizations, increased direct and&#xD;
      indirect costs, functional impairment, greater risk of mortality, increased risk of&#xD;
      institutionalization, and deterioration in long-term cognitive status, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsyndromal delirium (SSD) is a milder state characterised by the presence of certain&#xD;
      delirium symptoms but without meeting full diagnostic criteria thresholds, is also associated&#xD;
      with poor posthospitalization outcomes similar to those associated with delirium. The&#xD;
      reported frequency of subsyndromal delirium varies (7-50%) according to the definition&#xD;
      applied and the clinical population studied. Its incidence in the general medicine ward is&#xD;
      17%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of delirium status (full/subsyndromal delirium) in the general room is&#xD;
      approximately 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that delirium in hospitalized older adults is preventable. In multiple randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials, non-pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium (nPPD), shown to&#xD;
      reduce its incidence by 30-50%7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the high evidence supporting them, non-pharmacological interventions to prevent&#xD;
      delirium are poorly implemented in hospitals in Chile and around the world for several&#xD;
      reasons, such as the heavy workload of clinical staff, lack of trained personnel, and, in&#xD;
      general, the absence of systematic implementation processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this clinical trial, local pilot studies have shown some progress in this area. On&#xD;
      the one hand, it has been reported that the incorporation of software technology through a&#xD;
      &quot;PREVEDEL&quot; tablet is feasible and can be implemented on a hospital level, with possible&#xD;
      effects on decreasing delirium. On the other hand, the implementation of nPPD following a&#xD;
      theoretical model improves the adherence of health personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a multicenter randomized clinical trial is proposed, which seeks to evaluate&#xD;
      whether cognitive stimulation guided by the PREVEDEL software prevents delirium in&#xD;
      hospitalized older adults and whether it is a technology that can be used in others hospital&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centers and place where data is collected. Chile. These are: Hospital Clínico de la&#xD;
      Universidad de Chile (HCUCH), Hospital San Juan de Dios (HSJD), Clínica Las Condes (CLC) and&#xD;
      Hospital Santiago Oriente Dr. Luis Tisné (HLT). Two are public institutions and two are&#xD;
      private institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions to implement a program of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium&#xD;
      (nPPD) in the centers that will participate in the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months before the start of the clinical trial, an intervention is carried out in the&#xD;
      Internal Medicine, Geriatrics and Intermediate Care Unit services of the 4 participating&#xD;
      centers in order to establish a homogeneous plan of nPPD and assess adherence. The&#xD;
      implementation methodology in the first stage will be according to the Consolidated Framework&#xD;
      for Advancing Implementation Science (CFIR) model, used in a local pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions to perform an RCT where the effect of the use of PREVEDEL versus a placebo&#xD;
      (Tablet without PREVEDEL) in the prevention of delirium in older adults is compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard non-pharmacological prevention measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the recommendations in the literature and those made by local studies, the&#xD;
      following standard non-pharmacological delirium prevention measures were defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups Control Group: will receive the standard delirium prevention measures outlined&#xD;
      above, plus the use of a mobile device without delirium prevention software for 5 days&#xD;
      (Control Group: nPPD package, without PREVEDEL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group: will receive the standard delirium prevention measures, plus the use of a&#xD;
      mobile device with PREVEDEL software for 5 days (Experimental Group: nPPD package, with&#xD;
      PREVEDEL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate patient adherence and how the tablet is used, both groups will have an&#xD;
      application installed in their devices that will allow them to keep track of the time of use&#xD;
      and applications used.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      General To assess whether cognitive stimulation guided by PREVEDEL software prevents delirium&#xD;
      status in hospitalized older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implement a program of nPPD at the centers that will participate in the randomized&#xD;
           clinical trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the effect of the use of PREVEDEL&#xD;
           versus placebo (Tablet without PREVEDEL) in the prevention of delirium in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Cognitive stimulation guided by PREVEDEL software decreases the incidence of&#xD;
      delirium status in hospitalized older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of the sample size, local and literature data were considered. A delirium&#xD;
      status prevalence of 20% is estimated in the Control group and a decrease of this to 8% in&#xD;
      the Intervention group. In this way, with a power of 80%, and an alpha of 0.05 bilaterally,&#xD;
      147 patients will be enrolled in each group. If add to this a 10% loss of follow-up, the&#xD;
      overall sample size is 320 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. Randomization was performed with computer-generated random permuted blocks&#xD;
      using a centralized, secure Web-based randomization service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking The enrollers, evaluators and healthcare personnel (nurses, physical therapists,&#xD;
      physicians, occupational therapists) do not know the assigned group. Both groups receive a&#xD;
      tablet of the same dimensions and with the same basic applications. However, blinding the&#xD;
      patient is not possible, since when exploring the tablet, he or she will recognize whether or&#xD;
      not it has the PREVEDEL program included. To reduce this bias, the staff that delivers the&#xD;
      tablet encourages both groups to use its different basic applications (access the Internet)&#xD;
      and that any doubts may have participants about its use should be made to the tablet&#xD;
      coordinator, so that the evaluators or healthcare personnel remain masked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time between assignment and delivery of the tablet is between 4 to 12 hours in all&#xD;
      participating centers. This variable will be measured for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods For the descriptive analysis of the variables will use the mean (standard&#xD;
      deviation), median (25-75 percentiles), or proportions as appropriate to the type and&#xD;
      distribution of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical Statistics: For the primary outcome, a comparison of proportions between patients&#xD;
      who develop delirium and subsyndromal delirium in both groups will be made, using Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test, and as a measure of efficacy, an OR (95% CI) will be estimated. If there is any&#xD;
      baseline variable that is not matched by the randomization, efficacy analyses will be carried&#xD;
      out by means of logistic regression with the main variable being the treatment, and the&#xD;
      adjustment variables those that the randomization would not have been able to match.&#xD;
      Additionally, to compare the effect of the intervention over time, a time-to-event analysis&#xD;
      will be performed using the Kaplan-Maier procedure and then the Cox regression model to&#xD;
      adjust for baseline variables and the presence of the intervention. For the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, the Fisher's exact test or t-Test will be used, as appropriate, for the type and&#xD;
      distribution of the data. Linear regression or multivariate logistics will also be performed,&#xD;
      as appropriate, to evaluate the impact of the intervention, adjusting for the input&#xD;
      covariates. A bilateral p 0.05 significance level will be used for all analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Committee The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of&#xD;
      the Clinical Hospital of the University of Chile and its approval was validated by the ethics&#xD;
      committees of the respective participating centers (Registry No. 049, July 31, 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Steering Committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      Committee was formed with 3 international experts in the &quot;Trial Steering Committee&quot; (TSC)&#xD;
      area. This committee will watch over the following aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supervise and guarantee scientific quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advise on study protocol, recruitment progress, adherence, follow-up and data quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review the recommendations of the data analysis and monitoring committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review the publications in the primary trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the fulfillment of the objectives, the TSC will meet before, in the middle and at the end&#xD;
      of the recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent The informed consent will be given by the patient himself and obtained by&#xD;
      one of the main investigators.&#xD;
