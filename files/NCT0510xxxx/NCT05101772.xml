  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The screened patients were randomly assigned 25G puncture needles and 22G puncture needles in&#xD;
      a 1;1 ratio, based on the computer-generated random order, before receiving an ultrasound&#xD;
      endoscope puncture. Each puncture needle puncture lesions 2 needles, the same type of&#xD;
      puncture needle tissue samples taken in the same tissue pathology bottle, all tissues after&#xD;
      the completion of the necessary cytological smears, are placed in the Formalin solution to&#xD;
      send tissue pathology, pathologists do not know the order of distribution of 2 puncture&#xD;
      needles to evaluate the tissue results, all pathology results are reported by the hospital&#xD;
      pathology center, audit.&#xD;
