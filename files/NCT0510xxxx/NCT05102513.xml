  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral cleft lips can be treated with different incision techniques. According to a&#xD;
      survey by the American Cleft Palate Association, the Millard II technique is currently used&#xD;
      by the majority of US cleft surgeons. In this technique, a cleft-sided advancement flap is&#xD;
      pivoted from the cleft side into the rotation flap of the non-cleft side, which serves, among&#xD;
      other things, to lengthen the lip. However, the rotational component is often insufficient to&#xD;
      sufficiently lengthen the lip on the cleft side. The result is a raised red lip, a shortened&#xD;
      edge of the philtrum or a so-called pipe-hole deformity. In order to compensate for these&#xD;
      &quot;deficiencies&quot;, a triangular flap is currently being formed in the area of the white roll,&#xD;
      which is intended to provide sufficient lengthening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the scar of the triangular flaps runs exactly opposite to the aesthetic unit. In&#xD;
      addition, it often provides a step formation within the white roll. Knowing the weaknesses of&#xD;
      the previous techniques, a further development of the incision was made. The rotational flap&#xD;
      of the Millard II technique was extended by extending the incision into the columella -&#xD;
      similar to the well-known Mohler technique. The caudal part of the advancement flap of the&#xD;
      Millard II technique was extended by a wave incision as known from the Pfeifer procedure.&#xD;

    <description>A curved incision is marked skirting the philtral ridge. If more length is required a back-cut incision can be performed. The C-flap is outlined by the incision just marked and the incision along red-white border up to the base of the columella. On the cleft side an advancement flap is designed. For the vermillion a Noordhoff plasty is applied.</description>
