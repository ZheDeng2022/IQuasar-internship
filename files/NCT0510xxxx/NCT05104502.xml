      This is a clinical trial assessing the effects of fasting on the immune system in healthy&#xD;
      adults. Immune profiling, gene expression profiling, and flow cytometry on peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be performed and we hypothesize that a period of fasting will&#xD;
      alter the immune system in healthy adults.&#xD;

      Dietary restriction (DR) is an intervention demonstrated to increase healthy lifespan in&#xD;
      various model organisms including yeast, worms, mice, and rhesus monkeys (Lee et al., 2016,&#xD;
      Fontana et al., 2015). It has been investigated extensively as a therapeutic modality in&#xD;
      metabolic disease such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, with evidence of&#xD;
      benefit independent of weight loss (Wilkinson et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020, Di Francesco et&#xD;
      al., 2018). The major DR regimens include caloric restriction (CR) (Fontana et al., 2010),&#xD;
      time-restricted feeding (TRF) (Brandhorst et al., 2015), fasting mimicking diets (FMD)&#xD;
      (Mirzaei et al., 2014), and intermittent fasting (IF) (Chaix et al., 2014). Within the&#xD;
      broader, poorly defined concept of IF, specific regimens exist that have yet to be&#xD;
      standardized, including alternate-day fasting (ADF), 5:2 intermittent fasting (fasting 2 days&#xD;
      per week), and daily TRF (typically restricting eating to an 8 hour window with 16 hours of&#xD;
      fasting) (Chaix et al., 2014, Stekovic et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of the effects of several different forms of DR on the immune system have shown both&#xD;
      pro- and anti-inflammatory effects on immune responses, particularly with chronic calorie&#xD;
      restriction (Choi et al., 2017). Certain periodic dietary restrictions prevent immune&#xD;
      dysfunction and restore normal immune functioning by decreasing the number of circulating&#xD;
      autoimmune cells from circulation and activating tissue regenerative capacity (Cheng et al.,&#xD;
      2014). Although both chronic CR and nutrient-restricted FMD require substantial lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications and can prove challenging in terms of adherence, forms of TRF and IF provide&#xD;
      reasonable alternatives while showing similar efficacy. This makes forms of DR involving&#xD;
      fasting rather than CR more appealing as a clinical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While multiple studies have shown positive effects on the immune system with various IF&#xD;
      regimens in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis (MÃ¼ller et al., 2001), multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
      and cancer, mechanistic data in healthy humans are lacking. Recent studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      changes in immune cell distribution with various regimens of CR and IF in murine models,&#xD;
      supporting the exploration of potentially similar changes in healthy humans (Nagai et al.&#xD;
      2019). In order to study mechanistic details of the immune changes seen with DR in healthy&#xD;
      humans, we designed this trial to examine the effects of fasting dose on multiple immune cell&#xD;
      populations and relevant cell surface markers. While we observe a cohort over what is&#xD;
      effectively only a single cycle of ADF, here we make an important step in characterizing the&#xD;
      immune modulation occurring with ADF. This is one of the most studied fasting regimens, with&#xD;
      substantial possibility for use as a clinical therapy in the future.&#xD;

    <description>The study will consist of two days of eating a &quot;controlled habitual diet&quot; and one 36-hour period of water-only fasting with glucose monitoring as a measure of compliance. Water intake will be limited to 2 liters/day to prevent electrolyte abnormalities. Subjects will undergo 4 separate blood-draws consisting of an overnight fasted sample (Baseline), a 2-hour postprandial sample (Fed), a 36-hour fasted sample (Fasted), and final 2-hour postprandial sample after the fasting period (Refed).</description>
