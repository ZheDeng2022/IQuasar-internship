      The goal of this study is to apply the regression discontinuity design (RD) methodology on&#xD;
      arthroplasty registry data. The investigators aim to use an age-based cut-off for fixation&#xD;
      type choice and estimate the causal effect of fixation type on short term mortality and&#xD;
      revision, using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The optimal method of fixation for primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), cemented or&#xD;
      uncemented remains unknown. Studying implant survival in both RCT and retrospective study&#xD;
      design, as measured by the revision rate both gives inconclusive evidence, largely due to&#xD;
      heterogeneity between patient groups. A network meta-analysis showed similar survival of&#xD;
      newer uncemented implants compared to the traditional cemented hip implants. In general,&#xD;
      older patients more frequently have cemented THAs. However, since these elderly patients have&#xD;
      more comorbidity and might pass away or might be unfit for revision surgery, the likelihood&#xD;
      of revision will be lower compared with younger patients with an uncemented THAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decade, there is a trend towards an increased use of uncemented implants in&#xD;
      Europe, Australia and the United States. This despite the fact that registry data show not&#xD;
      unequivocal superior outcomes of these uncemented stems. One of the most important&#xD;
      methodological challenges in observational data, is to determine whether the medical&#xD;
      intervention under study is causally related to an outcome, rather than simply being&#xD;
      correlated with another factor that is truly causally related to the outcome under study.&#xD;
      This is a particular threat as in observational studies comparison groups are typically&#xD;
      different in more aspects than just treatment type because of non-random treatment&#xD;
      allocation. Patients are treated in accordance with the preferences of treating physicians,&#xD;
      rather than because of a coin flip, like in randomized studies. These treatment choices are&#xD;
      frequently informed by a patient's severity of illness. The treatment may be associated with&#xD;
      outcome but could be interfered by other factors like disease severity that are causally&#xD;
      related to outcome. Thus, observational studies assessing the causal effect of treatments are&#xD;
      at risk of obtaining incorrect results. This type of bias is called confounding by&#xD;
      indication. Since overall registry data are prone to inclusion bias and the aforementioned&#xD;
      confounding by indication, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design to analyse the&#xD;
      difference in revision rate between these two THA fixation methods could clarify this&#xD;
      unanswered question. RCTs are the best scientific method for evaluating the efficacy of&#xD;
      treatment. However, randomised controlled trials may have poor external validity due to&#xD;
      exclusion of patients not meeting the inclusion criteria. Therefore, complementing any&#xD;
      evidence on treatment efficacy from randomised controlled trials with that from observational&#xD;
      studies is valuable. When looking at implant survival an RCT design is also impractical due&#xD;
      to the relatively long time until revisions (with the risk of revision is as low as 0.5&#xD;
      percent per year for the first 20 years) occur and thus a large number of patients needed, to&#xD;
      correct for the heterogeneity between these patients. Furthermore, studying data from the&#xD;
      Dutch Arthroplasty Registry (LROI), it shows a large variation in clinical practice of type&#xD;
      of fixation of hip and cup stems between hospitals. When using data from a national registry&#xD;
      with high completeness and hospital coverage, such as the LROI, regardless of age,&#xD;
      confounding by indication exists (e.g. large variation in the selection of fixation type) and&#xD;
      the patient group will be very heterogeneous. Thus, new research methods are warranted to&#xD;
      isolate the effect of fixation of THA on outcome within registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some orthopaedic surgeons and hospitals use an age-based cut-off in the choice for the type&#xD;
      of fixation of components of the THA. The existence of such simple age-based cut-off&#xD;
      guidelines for choosing for either a cemented or non-cemented stem and/or cup between&#xD;
      different hospitals, enables us to analyse the causal effect of fixation on revision in THA.&#xD;
      In one of the hospitals in the LROI it is known which age dependent cut-off points are used.&#xD;
      In male patients above the age of 70 years old cement fixation is used, and under the cut-off&#xD;
      age an uncemented THA is placed. In female patients this cut-off age is set at 65 years of&#xD;
      age. This age-based cut-off point for assignment of either cemented or uncemented THA offers&#xD;
      the opportunity for a new quasi-experimental research design while limiting the potential for&#xD;
      selection bias, and allowing causal inference, namely the regression discontinuity design&#xD;
      (RD). The RD is a quasi-experimental study design that was first introduced by psychologists&#xD;
      Thistlethwaite and Campbell, who used the RD to evaluate the impact of National Merit&#xD;
      Scholarship awards on awardees' careers and attitudes. Since then RD has also been applied in&#xD;
      politics, psychology, and other areas, but a recent study showed it is underutilized in&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RD identifies causal effects by exploiting a treatment assignment practice: the&#xD;
      assignment of treatment based on whether a patient scores above or below a cut-off point on a&#xD;
      continuously measured variable, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, CD4 count or in our case&#xD;
      age. Treatment assignment following such a rule can be either deterministic (every patient on&#xD;
      the one side of the cut-off value receives the treatment and every patient on the other side&#xD;
      does not) or probabilistic (the probability of receiving the treatment is higher on the one&#xD;
      side of the cut-off value than on the other side). The first case is called ''sharp'' RD&#xD;
      design (SRD) and the second ''fuzzy'' RD design (FRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to apply the regression discontinuity design (RD) methodology on&#xD;
      arthroplasty registry data. The investigators aim to use an age-based cut-off for fixation&#xD;
      type choice and estimate the causal effect of fixation type on short term mortality and&#xD;
      revision, using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design.&#xD;
