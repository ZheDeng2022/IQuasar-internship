      Purpose of this study was to evaluate different methods of controlling pain during debonding&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients data was obtained from the Department of Orthodontics, Armed Forces Institute of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Rawalpindi. One Hundred and ten patients were included in the study, which were&#xD;
      divided into two groups, 55 patients in each group, based on method of controlling pain&#xD;
      during debonding. To control pain during debonding in one group , teeth were stabilized with&#xD;
      finger pressure with cotton between finger and teeth and then debonding using open mouth&#xD;
      technique was done. In second group teeth were stabilized using a plastic wafer between&#xD;
      maxillary and mandibular teeth and then debonding was done using closed mouth technique. In&#xD;
      order to reduce biasness, all of the patients were debonded with same plier and with wires&#xD;
      still ligated to brackets. With the help of VAS, pain score was measured after debonding. A&#xD;
      single operator performed complete procedure of debonding and pain recording.&#xD;

    <description>In one arm/ group 1 (plastic wafers group), debonding was done by open mouth technique. All brackets were removed using same plier i.e. angled direct bracket remover. Figure pressure in the apical direction was applied concomitantly applied to stabilize each tooth. Loose cotton was used between thumb and tooth during debonding. Arch wires and ligatures were not removed during debonding.&#xD;
Patient pain score during procedure was measured using visual analogue scale ranging from zero to one hundred (0-100) In</description>

    <description>In another arm/ group 2( finger pressure group) brackets were removed in the same way with the same debonding plier as in group 1 but soft acrylic sheets folded 4 times were placed between upper and lower dentition with the patient biting on this wafer. Wires and ligatures were left tied to brackets during debonding. After the procedure, patient was asked about pain using visual analogue scale.</description>
