  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a persistent joint disorder, which normally affects the weight bearing&#xD;
      joints especially knee joint. Lateral wedge insole is one such approach suggested by&#xD;
      professionals to manage the knee osteoarthritis.Effectiveness of lateral wedge insoles (LWI)&#xD;
      group (n=20), and conventional physical therapy (CPT) group (n=20) with home exercises as&#xD;
      baseline treatment were assessed on Urdu version of Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome&#xD;
      Score scale (KOOS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of n=104 patients were recruited through the non-probability convenience sampling&#xD;
      technique and were thus evaluated for the inclusion criteria. Of which, n=40 participants&#xD;
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Participants were randomly divided through the sealed&#xD;
      envelope method in two groups; lateral wedge insoles with home exercises group (n=20), and&#xD;
      traditional physiotherapy with home exercises group (n=20). The data was collected through a&#xD;
      general demographic questionnaire and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) in&#xD;
      Urdu to determine the severity of pain, stiffness, functional activities, recreational&#xD;
      activities and Quality of life to promote functional independence in osteoarthritic&#xD;
      patients.[20] The level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS) ver. 23 was used for data analysis.As the assumption of the parametric test&#xD;
      was met, mixed ANOVA was used for the interaction effect of between-subject factor (group)&#xD;
      and within-subject factor (time). With-in group analysis and one way ANOVA was used for&#xD;
      between-group comparisons to determine the effect size (É³p2).&#xD;

    <description>In this group, participants were advised to use lateral wedge insole during walking and long-standing. Non customized full-length lateral wedge insoles of 7mm made of silicon material with 5 degrees angulation (because greater wedging is associated with foot discomfort) was used. Full-length wedge extends under the lesser metatarsal heads which increases the lever arm for rearfoot eversion and thus can prevent subtalar joint rotation. The evaluations were performed every week till fourth week.</description>

    <description>Each participant received 40-45 minutes long session, started in lying position. The therapeutic low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (US) was used for 7 minutes with the frequency of 1 MHz, Spatial Average Intensity was 0.2 W /cm2, pulsed duty cycle 20%, therapeutic dose was 112.5 J/cm2 with fixed application on the medial side of the knee joint. The model of US was Unit Intelect Mobile, (Chattanooga Inc). After US therapy passive stretching of calf, hamstring, quadriceps, hip flexors, adductors &amp; abductor s was done, which was followed by the manual strengthening exercises and strengthening with quadriceps bench. The session was repeated thrice a week and 12 sessions per month. The home program was guided in both groups including avoiding low sitting, cross leg sitting along with Isometrics of quadriceps atleast 3 times a day, with 5-10 seconds hold of each contraction.</description>
