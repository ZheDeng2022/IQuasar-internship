    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct a prospective, longitudinal assessment of the natural&#xD;
      clinical progression of Angelman syndrome (AS) in children and adults. This will be performed&#xD;
      by acquiring baseline measurements, and developing effective outcome measures and diagnostic&#xD;
      tools for the syndrome, to prepare the healthcare system for forthcoming clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in anticipation of several candidate therapies which are&#xD;
      approaching clinical readiness for Angelman syndrome. This study will comprehensively&#xD;
      evaluate the natural clinical progression of the disease using scales and questionnaires for&#xD;
      the assessment of motor function and global development, motor measuring devices (ActiMyo),&#xD;
      and by collecting sleep and seizure diaries. In addition, proteomic analysis and&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) recordings will be collected to identify biomarkers which will&#xD;
      indicate improvements in disease outcome following treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development - 4 (BSID-4) for Developmental delays. Scale is divided into five domains, which are further divided into subdomains. The first step is to calculate the starting point by beginning with the items that are age appropriate. The starting point is validated if three consecutive items are achieved. If the participant affected by Angelman Syndrome does not achieve three consecutive items in a row at the age-appropriated starting point, the evaluator must go backwards to the lower age-starting point until the participant affected by Angelman Syndrome achieves three items in a row. The assessment stops once five items in a row are not achieved.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the candidate participants affected by AS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Genetically confirmed diagnosis of AS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  0-99 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or Female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obtained consent forms and/or record of consultation by the carers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In this study, the two primary carers for each participant diagnosed with AS will be also&#xD;
        considered participants. Carers will have to meet the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or Female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Legal carer of the patient diagnosed with AS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to follow study procedures, as assessed by the research team&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to sign the consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand all the information regarding the study, as assessed by the&#xD;
             research team&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant affected by AS may not enter the study if there is any comorbidity (*)&#xD;
             that could potentially affect the results of the study. This will be subject to the&#xD;
             clinical judgement of the Chief Investigator (CI) and/or the Principal Investigator&#xD;
             (PI). Participants of ongoing (interventional) clinical trials that assess the&#xD;
             efficacy of potential treatments will be excluded as assessments need to be done on&#xD;
             the basis that represent the natural progression of AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (*) This includes any confirmed chronic or acute condition or disease affecting any&#xD;
        system(s), which could interfere with the results of the study and/or the compliance with&#xD;
        the study procedures.&#xD;
