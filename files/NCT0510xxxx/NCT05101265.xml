  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lurbinectedin is mainly eliminated by the liver. Thus, Hepatic Impairment (HI) may alter the&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of lurbinectedin. This study is designed to examine the PK and safety&#xD;
      of an adjusted dose of lurbinectedin when administered to patients with HI. The results of&#xD;
      this study may be used to support future clinical studies in patients and prescribing&#xD;
      information in future labeling.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, open-label, parallel, phase Ib, hepatic impairment study in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors who either have Hepatic Impairment (HI) at varying degrees (mild,&#xD;
      moderate or severe) or qualify for the control group (normal hepatic function) according to&#xD;
      the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI-ODWG) classification&#xD;
