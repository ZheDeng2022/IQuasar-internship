    <textblock>
      This project an observational study performed on patients with severe Traumatic Brain Injury&#xD;
      (TBI) treated at Neurosurgical ICU (NICU) at Karolinska University Hospital. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the effects of various oxygenation levels on production rate of&#xD;
      Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The&#xD;
      patients will be included in the study after the placement of intracranial monitoring device&#xD;
      consisting of intracranial pressure gage (Codman), microdialysis (MD), and Licox oxygen&#xD;
      electrode for measurement of partial pressure of oxygen in brain tissue (pBtO2). Intracranial&#xD;
      monitoring is inserted on clinical indications and is used for early detection of deleterious&#xD;
      processes in brain tissue such as hypoxia or hypoperfusion and for purpose of guiding of&#xD;
      given therapies such as cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), oxygenation, dosage of vasoactive&#xD;
      drugs etc. Despite the technical possibilities to monitor all these physiological parameters,&#xD;
      there are no clear guidelines how to interpret the MD and pBtO2 data and implement it in&#xD;
      clinical decision making. One of the controversies deals with optimization of oxygen levels:&#xD;
      some authors point out the importance of adequate brain tissue oxygenation, whereas other&#xD;
      researchers are worried about the possible negative effects of excessive oxygen levels such&#xD;
      as increased production of ROS or facilitating pulmonary atelectasis, contributing to adverse&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of various oxygenation levels on ROS&#xD;
      production in TBI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is designed to measure short-lived ROS in blood and microdialysis fluid&#xD;
      samples of TBI patients during alternating periods of normal vs temporarily increased&#xD;
      oxygenation levels under normobaric conditions (normal atmospheric pressure).&#xD;
