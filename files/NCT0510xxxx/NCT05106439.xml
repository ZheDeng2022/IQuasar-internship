  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to their high-stress workloads, medical interns tend to have lower sleep and decreased&#xD;
      physical activity. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of gamified competition&#xD;
      (delivered through a smartphone) for improving the physical activity and sleep of medical&#xD;
      interns. During the study, they are teamed up by programs and institutions and competes with&#xD;
      other teams, which aim to motivate them to have more physical activity and sleep duration&#xD;
      during their internship year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether introducing competition mechanisms&#xD;
      into mobile health (mHealth) interventions can improve a medical intern's activity-related&#xD;
      behavioral outcomes: daily step counts and sleep duration. The first secondary aim is to&#xD;
      assess the time-varying competition effect on their behavioral outcomes. The second secondary&#xD;
      aim is to evaluate how social cooperation (competing within the same institution or program)&#xD;
      moderates the effect of competition on behavioral outcomes. The first exploratory aim is to&#xD;
      assess the competition effect on study engagement and the second exploratory aim is to&#xD;
      evaluate the competition effect on mental outcome, mood score.&#xD;

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' daily step counts are recorded through a Fitbit or an apple watch. High step counts are considered a positive outcome as it indicates more physical activity.&#xD;
For teams randomized into competition arm and randomized to compete on step count, their average daily step count is compared with the average step count of the opponent team.</description>

    <measure>Average daily sleep minutes</measure>

    <description>Participant's nightly sleep duration (in minutes) is recorded through a Fitbit or an apple watch. High sleep duration is considered a positive outcome.&#xD;
For teams randomized into competition arm and randomized to compete on sleep duration, their average daily sleep minutes is compared with the average sleep minutes of the opponent team.</description>

    <description>Through the study mobile app, participants enter a mood score (scale 1-10) every day of the study. 1 corresponds to lowest mood and 10 corresponds to highest mood</description>

    <description>Programs with at least five interns were grouped into program-based teams. Interns within the same residency institution in programs that did not meet this criterion were grouped into institution-based teams, with a minimum of five participants per team.&#xD;
For each week, an eligible team is randomized to either competition or non-competition group with 50/50 chance. For those randomized to competition arm, teams were assigned an opponent team according to a weekly equally randomly selected rule from three options: 1. total randomization, by which the opponent team was assigned regardless of institution and specialty; 2. within-institution randomization, by which two competing teams were from the same institution; 3. within-specialty randomization, by which two paired teams were from the same specialty. For each pair of competing teams, there was a 50/50 chance that they would compete on average daily step counts or average daily sleep minutes.</description>
