  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the ageing process, individuals with intellectual disability (ID) experience decreased&#xD;
      balance and loss of functionality at an earlier age than their peers without ID.&#xD;
      Above-mentioned negative effects of the age affect particularly work ability, forcing to the&#xD;
      retirement. It also implies difficulties for social interaction and economic problems, among&#xD;
      others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baduajin is a traditional Chinese exercise and it has been demonstrated as an effective&#xD;
      therapy in different alterations of the movement (i.e. Parkinson Disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that a training program of Badaujing will improve the balance&#xD;
      and functionality of individuals with ID over 40 years old that from a company of in&#xD;
      sheltered work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with mild to moderate ID aged 40 years or older who are working in Lantegi Batuak&#xD;
      (Bizkaia, Spain) will be invited to take part in an Baduajin intervention. The training&#xD;
      program will consist in a 1 hour session each week during 10 month. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a control or intervention group. Before and after the intervention, all&#xD;
      the participants will be assessed with the following protocol: balance in stabilometric&#xD;
      platform, SPPB for functionality and strength of the upper limb.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intellectual disability (ID) is deﬁned as a signiﬁcantly reduced ability to understand new or&#xD;
      complex information and to learn and apply new skills (impaired intelligence). This results&#xD;
      in a reduced ability to cope independently (impaired social functioning), and begins before&#xD;
      adulthood, with a lasting eﬀect on development. For the ﬁrst time in history, adults with&#xD;
      intellectual and developmental disabilities are living to experience old age. Although the&#xD;
      impact of ID on life expectancy is variable, most people with mild-to-moderate mental&#xD;
      impairment can now expect to live as long as their non-disabled peers. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      ageing process and related functional problems seem to have an earlier onset in people with&#xD;
      ID, charasterized by impairtment of movement and balance skills, which could lead to an&#xD;
      increased risk of falls, and in turn, to a higher risk of disability and loss of quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The social and health-related beneﬁts of the integration of the people with ID in the&#xD;
      workplace are well known. People with ID often want to participate in work and organisation.&#xD;
      However, these persons are much less likely to be employed than their non-disabled peers. In&#xD;
      addition, people with ID who are in employment tend to need to retire earlier, producing&#xD;
      social, economic and health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On one hand, Lantegi Batuak is a provider of supported employment for more than 1000 people&#xD;
      with ID in Bizkaia (Spain). At the above-mentioend company it was found that workers with ID&#xD;
      over 40 years old showed problems related to ageing, which include loss of body balance and&#xD;
      in consequence less functionality. In consequence, methodologies for the prevention of the&#xD;
      problems related to the ageing process in people with ID are particularlly interesting for&#xD;
      the above-mentioned comapany, and can be potentially interesting for other public and private&#xD;
      providers of supported employment. On the other hand, as has been previously demonstrated,&#xD;
      Baduajing can enhance the body balance and functionality in different conditions. However, it&#xD;
      have found no evidence concerning the use of this method for improving the function of people&#xD;
      with ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to ascertain the efficacy of a Baduanjing program for improving&#xD;
      the body balance and functionality of people with ID, aged 40 or older, who are working in&#xD;
      Lantegi Batuak. A total of 40 participants will be randomly allocated to a control or&#xD;
      intervention group. The intervention will consist in a 1 hour supervised Baduajin group&#xD;
      sessions conducted once a week during 1 year. After and before the intervention, body balance&#xD;
      and functionality will be assessed.&#xD;
