  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it is aimed to examine the immediate effect of kinesiological taping on&#xD;
      functionality in hemiplegic patients. 40 hemiplegic patients with a mean age of 63Â±15 years&#xD;
      were included to the study. The patients were divided into two groups using the computerized&#xD;
      randomization method. Kinesiology tape was applied to the 1st group (study group), and a&#xD;
      patch tape was applied to the 2nd group (control group). The demographic and physical&#xD;
      characteristics of the people who agreed to participate in the study were recorded. In both&#xD;
      groups; before taping, right after taping, 45 min. after and 4 days after taping Timed Get Up&#xD;
      and Go Test (TUG) were administered. Both groups were asked not to remove the tapes at the&#xD;
      end of the 4th day.&#xD;

    <description>With a computerized randomization system, 40 people, 20 of whom we applied kinesiology taping in the first group (study group), and the second group of 20 people (control group), were determined. T max branded kinesiology tape was applied to both M. Quadriceps Femoris and M. Gastrocnemius muscles of the experimental group. Roll branded plaster tape was applied to both M. Quadriceps Femoris and M. Gastrocnemius muscles of the control group.&#xD;
Timed get up and go test was applied to evaluate functionality. All evaluations were applied to both groups before taping, immediately after taping and 45 minutes after taping. Patients in both groups were asked not to have their tapes removed until the 4th day. All patients were re-evaluated on the 4th day. Apart from routine physical therapy methods and taping, no other treatment was applied to the patients.</description>
