    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the clinical benefit of a transmitter for contralateral routing of&#xD;
      signals. The benefit will be evaluated in noisy environments regarding speech intelligibility&#xD;
      when the CROS system is adjusted to different microphone settings. Additionally, data&#xD;
      regarding overall system stability, crash reboot rate, sound quality and connectivity will be&#xD;
      obtained over a period of time to validate the CROS system in combination with smartphone and&#xD;
      accessories. This study is a confirmatory study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Unilateral Hearing Loss (UHL) can be defined as any degree of permanent hearing loss on one&#xD;
      ear with normal hearing in the opposite ear. Unilateral hearing loss can be debilitating&#xD;
      associated with audiological, psychosocial and educational challenges. Audiological&#xD;
      challenges include the reduced ability to localize sounds, reduced awareness on the unaidable&#xD;
      side and difficulties hearing in noise or at a distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One solution for unaidable UHL is Contralateral Routing of Signals (CROS) and Bilateral&#xD;
      Contralateral routing of signals (BiCROS) using a so- called CROS transmitter together with a&#xD;
      hearing aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this clinical investigation is to collect clinical data with a rechargeable&#xD;
      CROS transmitter to evaluate the benefits of a BiCROS fitting compared to the alternative&#xD;
      treatment option, the monaural hearing aid fitting, and to no treatment in noisy listening&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;

    <measure>Speech Intelligibility (SI) in noise (fix direction): BiCROS fitting vs. monaural hearing aid fitting</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate whether a BiCROS fitting (better ear fitted with a hearing device, unaidable ear supplied with a CROS device) improves speech intelligibility in noise compared to a monaural fitting (just the aidable ear is supplied by a hearing aid), for adults with an asymmetric hearing loss, measured with the Oldenburg Sentence Test (OLSA). Results of the speech test will be the SRT (speech recognition threshold) in dB SNR (signal to noise ratio).&#xD;
The target speaker will be presented from 0° azimuth and is adaptive (start level at 65dB (A).&#xD;
The noise will be presented on the better ear at an azimuth of 90° or 270° (depending on the site of the better ear), at a level of 70 dB (A).</description>
