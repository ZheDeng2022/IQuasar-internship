  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers found that impairments in the cardiopulmonary system caused by acute exposure to&#xD;
      ozone were outweighed by repeated exposures to ozone. The goal of this study is to confirm&#xD;
      there will be an adaptation similar to what was previously proved but in individuals with&#xD;
      asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). The purpose is to examine adaptive&#xD;
      responses in a randomized cross-over trial in which physically active individuals will&#xD;
      perform submaximal exercise on five days in ozone and filtered air exposures separated by a&#xD;
      washout period.&#xD;
