  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spine pain syndromes are one of the most common pain conditions in our society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of kinesiotaping is to normalize muscle function, improve blood and lymph flow,&#xD;
      reduce pain, improve proprioception, promote tissue healing and restore normal tissue&#xD;
      function. Today, this method is used in many fields of medicine. Its primary purpose is to&#xD;
      support the musculoskeletal system by using various types of applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of publications in the global literature on the effect of kinesiotaping of&#xD;
      the external oblique muscles on lumbar spine pain. The main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of kinesiology taping in the treatment of lumbar spine pain in&#xD;
      individuals under 30 years of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Back pain occurs in people of all ages, regardless of their job. Both blue-collar and&#xD;
      white-collar workers are exposed to strain and pain in the lumbar spine. The presence of pain&#xD;
      is also promoted by low physical activity, poor motor habits, as well as stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous factors affecting the quality of life in patients with lower back pain.&#xD;
      These include degree of pain, physical fitness, individual factors, degree of social support,&#xD;
      and a potential for adapting forces to match constantly changing conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contemporary functional model of lumbar spinal muscles divides them into local&#xD;
      stabilizers, single-joint global stabilizers, and multi-joint global stabilizers. The&#xD;
      abdominal external oblique muscles are classified as global stabilizers. They generate force&#xD;
      to control range of motion and allow limitation of that range (eccentric control), and&#xD;
      functionally control rotation in all movements, regardless of the load acting on the spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of kinesiology taping in&#xD;
      the treatment of lumbar spine pain in individuals under 30 years of age.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Before commencing the tests, each participant was familiarized with their course, expressed their informed written consent for participation and random assignment to a specified tested group. The author of this paper had no influence on the categorization of the participants into individual treatment groups. During the studies, the physiotherapists performing the categorization were not informed about the results of the used treatment.</masking_description>

    <description>The Laitinen questionnaire takes into account four indicators evaluated in a scale of 0 to 4: the intensity of pain, the frequency of its occurrence, the use of analgesic medications and limitation of the participant's motor activity. A research participant could be granted from 0 to 16 points, the maximum score meaning the highest level of pain.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will use a special dynamic patch made of cotton, coated with a hypoallergenic acrylic heat-activated adhesive arranged in sinusoidal-shaped layers. The tape will be applied using the muscle technique with a Y-shaped cut patch directly to the dried and non-greased skin. The application will be performed in a standing position, with the participant's lower extremities straight. The therapist will place the beginning of the tape (the base) on the participant's sacrum and then, asking them to bend 45 degrees forward, tape the tails of the tape along the spine on the extensor muscles of the lumbar region, without changing the tension of the tape, keeping the base in the initial position.</description>

    <description>In the control group, a plain paper patch will be used to conduct the study, which, like the dynamic patch, will be applied using the same form of tape cutting and the same application technique. The entire method of applying the patch will also take place in the participant's standing position with forward bending. The paper patch will be placed at the levels from the L3 segment to the sacrum, along the spine on the lumbar extensor muscles.</description>
