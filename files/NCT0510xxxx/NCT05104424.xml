      Intranasal Insulin, Zinc, Gabapentin, Ice Cube Stimulation may suspect having promising&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of intranasal insulin in healthy humans has been linked to improve memory&#xD;
      function and increased olfactory thresholds also enhance the olfactory performance and&#xD;
      regenerate the olfactory epithelium which the corner stone mechanism at affection of smell&#xD;
      and taste disorders. zinc orally has many functions and improve taste and influence the&#xD;
      activity of carbonic anhydrase in saliva which is important in breaking down foods in our&#xD;
      mouth . the application of small ice cube in the mouth for one minute may improve seat taste&#xD;
      and lower temperature by 5 degrees. gabapentin working by altering or blocking abnormal&#xD;
      electrical discharges arising from the peripheral damaged smell or taste organ&#xD;

    <description>The change in smell is based on the comparison of the results of the olfactory assessment after / before treatment obtained from a single method out of the three carried out:&#xD;
Sniffin 'Stick Test Results: Threshold Test Score and Actual Identification Test Score.&#xD;
TI score: sum of the individual scores of the threshold and identification measures (TI score varying from 0 to 32). It is used to classify patients in terms of normosmia, hyposmia and functional anosmia based on normative values of &quot;Sniffin 'Sticks&quot; (according to the age and sex of each subject) with the threshold at the tenth percentile of the database provided in the study published by Hummel and Kobal.&#xD;
