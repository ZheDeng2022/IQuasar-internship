  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bexmarilimab treatment has demonstrated tolerable safety profile and anticancer efficacy in&#xD;
      some subjects with advanced malignancies. This is the first study to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of single neoadjuvant dose of anti-CLEVER-1 antibody bexmarilimab prior to radical surgery of&#xD;
      renal cell and colon cancers. We expect that the single dose will demonstrate measurable&#xD;
      effects on the tumour immunological microenvironment as well as systemic effects on subject´s&#xD;
      immunological status and that this evidence may be used to guide future neoadjuvant studies.&#xD;
      There will be a dose escalation to investigate the effect of different doses of bexmarilimab.&#xD;
      In addition to subjects receiving single neoadjuvant dose of bexmarilimab, there will be an&#xD;
      observational cohort without Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) for either cancer. All&#xD;
      patients participating in the study (whether in investigational or observational cohort) will&#xD;
      attend each visit and are assessed for the same endpoints.&#xD;

             g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Histologically confirmed clear cell renal cell cancer planned to be treated with&#xD;
             surgery with curative intent (Renal cell cancer cohort). In renal cell observation&#xD;
             cohort, histological confirmation not mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
             or Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon planned to be treated with&#xD;
             surgery with curative intent (Colon cancer cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Additional inclusion criteria for subjects planned to have a single neoadjuvant dose&#xD;
             of CLEVER-1 antibody bexmarilimab:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For females of reproductive potential: use of highly effective contraception* for at&#xD;
             least 1 month prior to screening and agreement to use such a method during study&#xD;
             participation and for an additional 12 weeks after the end of single neoadjuvant dose&#xD;
             of bexmarilimab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms or other methods to ensure&#xD;
             effective contraception with partner during study participation and for an additional&#xD;
             12 weeks after the administration of single neoadjuvant dose of bexmarilimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential i.e. not post-menopausal or surgically sterilised&#xD;
                  must use highly effective methods of contraception. For example, combined&#xD;
                  estrogen and progestogen hormonal contraception to inhibit ovulation;&#xD;
                  progestogen-only hormonal contraception to inhibit ovulation; intra-uterine&#xD;
                  device (IUD); intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) or vasectomised partner&#xD;
                  to prevent pregnancy or abstain. Abstinence must be in line with the preferred&#xD;
                  and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence such as calendar,&#xD;
                  ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods and withdrawal are not&#xD;
                  acceptable methods of contraception during heterosexual activity for the duration&#xD;
                  of the trial and for at least 12 weeks following the study drug administration.&#xD;
                  In addition, barrier contraception (with or without spermicide) may be used but&#xD;
                  this should not be considered as an adequate form of contraception on its own.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Fertile men whose partners could be of childbearing potential should routinely use a condom&#xD;
        for 12 weeks after the study drug administration. The partner, if not pregnant, should also&#xD;
        use a reliable form of contraception such as the oral contraceptive pill or an IUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             except for local nodal metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of previous treatment for renal cell cancer (renal cell cancer cohorts) or&#xD;
             colon cancer (colon cancer cohorts).&#xD;

             York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2, Myocardial Infarction (MI) within 6 months or&#xD;
             laboratory finding that in the view of the investigator makes it undesirable for the&#xD;
             subject to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any medical condition that the Investigator considers significant to compromise the&#xD;
             safety of the subject or that impairs the interpretation of IMP toxicity assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Confirmed human immunodeficiency virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Confirmed hepatitis B or C virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Symptomatic cytomegalovirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with active autoimmune disorder (except type I diabetes, celiac disease,&#xD;
             hypothyroidism requiring only hormone replacement, vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The subject requires systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects with organ transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects in dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Use of Live (attenuated) vaccines for 30 days prior to the start of study treatment,&#xD;
             during treatment, and until last visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Medical history of chronic ulcers, abnormal liver function or previous liver&#xD;
