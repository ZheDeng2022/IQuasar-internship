        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Should be enrolled in multiple sclerosis partners advancing technology and health&#xD;
             solutions (MS PATHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant (or participant's legal representative) has the ability to understand the&#xD;
             purpose and risks of the study, to provide signed and dated informed consent, and to&#xD;
             authorize the use of confidential health information in accordance with national and&#xD;
             local privacy regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Should have literacy of written language in which the software and Instructions for&#xD;
             use are displayed (User Interface [UI], Instructions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to use a smartphone as per physician's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not owning a Konectom-compatible smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Biogen, make the&#xD;
             participant unsuitable for participation in the sub-study. A participant only needs to&#xD;
             complete the assessments deemed necessary by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.&#xD;
