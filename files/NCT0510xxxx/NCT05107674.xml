  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human Phase 1a/1b multicenter, open-label oncology study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activity of NX-1607 in patients with advanced&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1a is a dose escalation to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NX-1607 in adult&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors for which standard therapy with proven clinical benefit&#xD;
      does not exist, is no longer effective, or is not appropriate. Indications include platinum&#xD;
      resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer,&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), metastatic melanoma, non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), malignant&#xD;
      pleural mesothelioma (MPM), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic urothelial cancer, cervical cancer, and microsatellite stable colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (MSS CRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b will investigate the efficacy of NX-1607 at the dose selected in Phase 1a in up to 8&#xD;
      cohorts of patients with select advanced malignancies for which standard therapy, including&#xD;
      immunotherapy, with proven clinical benefit does not exist, is no longer effective, or is not&#xD;
      appropriate. Indications include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platinum-resistant EOC, including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advanced gastric/GEJ cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HNSCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unresectable melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advanced NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mCRPC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mixed solid tumor cohort indications consisting of patients with MPM, TNBC, locally&#xD;
           advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, cervical cancer, or MSS CRC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma with Richter transformation (DLBCL-RT)&#xD;
