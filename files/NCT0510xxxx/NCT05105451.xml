  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) refers to the difficulties of orientation,&#xD;
      cognition, communication, memory and abstract thinking of patients after anesthesia and&#xD;
      surgery. And/or accompanied by the decline of the ability in social activities, such as the&#xD;
      change of personality, social ability of language and behavior, cognitive function and life&#xD;
      skills. POCD is a common complication of central nervous system in elderly patients after&#xD;
      operation, with an early incidence of about 21% and a long-term incidence of about 35% .&#xD;
      According to the current research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and POCD in the elderly, it has&#xD;
      been found that they have similar pathological basis and some homologous related genes.&#xD;
      Altogether, POCD is closely related to molecular pathway neuropsychiatric diseases (such as&#xD;
      dementia, depression and Alzheimer's disease). Researchers have come up with various&#xD;
      hypotheses to reveal the underlying mechanisms of POCD, including neuritis, oxidative stress,&#xD;
      autophagy disorder, synaptic dysfunction, and lack of neurotrophic support. To date, apart&#xD;
      from evaluating with scales, CT Scan and EEG analysis, there is neither exact biomarkers for&#xD;
      monitoring and diagnosing POCD, nor clear relationships between specific EEG changes and&#xD;
      diagnosis of POCD, so that the diagnosis of early POCD only stays in the evaluation of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and scales. Therefore, our study aims to provide an effective basis for&#xD;
      early diagnosis and treatment of clinical POCD through multivariate analyses of clinical&#xD;
      scales combined with EEG analysis of patients.&#xD;
