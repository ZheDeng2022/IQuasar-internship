  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PREVENT is a multicentre, 2x2 factorial, randomized clinical trial that aims to determine the&#xD;
      effect of cytisine versus placebo, as well as the effect of text messaging to support smoking&#xD;
      cessation versus standard of care in perioperative patients. This trial aims to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of cytisine and text messaging on 6-month continuous abstinence rates. PREVENT&#xD;
      will also assess secondary outcomes at 30 days, 56 days and 6 months post-randomization:&#xD;
      7-day point prevalence abstinence, urge to smoke, time to first lapse, time to relapse,&#xD;
      number of cigarettes smoking if still smoking, pulmonary complications, vascular&#xD;
      complications, wound and infectious complications, stroke, time in hospital and acute&#xD;
      hospital care.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) is the sponsor of this trial. The PHRI believes the dissemination of clinical research results is vital and sharing of data is important. PHRI prioritizes access to data analyses to researchers who have worked on the trial for a significant duration, have played substantial roles, and have participated in raising the funds to conduct the trial. PHRI balances the length of the research study, and the intellectual and financial investments that made it possible with the need to allow wider access to the data collected. Data will be disclosed only upon request and approval of the proposed use of the data by a Review Committee.</ipd_description>
