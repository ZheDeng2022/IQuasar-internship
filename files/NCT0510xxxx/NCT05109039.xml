  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a 6 week creatine supplementation intervention with performance&#xD;
      familiarization and pre and post testing. Participants will report to the human performance&#xD;
      laboratory (HPL) for baseline to read and sign an informed consent explaining the procedures&#xD;
      and potential risks and benefits of participation. Participants will then complete a physical&#xD;
      activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q) prior to performing any physical tasks. Participants&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete testing below in the order described. Participants will become&#xD;
      familiar with the pre/post performance tests, which include isokinetic testing, medicine ball&#xD;
      throw, vertical jump, and Wingate testing. Twenty-four hours following visit 1, participants&#xD;
      will return to the HPL for visit 2 where they will undergo a second familiarization session&#xD;
      for the isokinetic testing and Wingate testing only - these two tests require individuals to&#xD;
      provide maximal physical efforts and research suggests that participants should perform&#xD;
      multiple familiarization trials before beginning experimental trials. At least 72 hours&#xD;
      following visit 2, participants will return to the HPL for visit 3 to perform the baseline&#xD;
      performance assessments. Following the baseline assessments, participants will be divided&#xD;
      into two supplementation groups: creatine and placebo (maltodextrin). These groups will be&#xD;
      randomized and matched based on body mass, hours of dance training per week, meat intake, and&#xD;
      menstrual cycle phase. Participants will be asked to consume one of the two supplements daily&#xD;
      for 42 consecutive days and maintain their regular dance training and eating behaviors.&#xD;
      Participants will report to the HPL daily to receive their supplement between the hours of&#xD;
      12pm and 2pm. Following the last day of supplement consumption, participants will report to&#xD;
      the HPL to perform post-testing assessments which will be identical to pre testing.&#xD;
