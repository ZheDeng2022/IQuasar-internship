      The study intends to investigate the alteration of regional myocardial work in patients with&#xD;
      acute anterior myocardial infarction underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI), and compare the distribution of regional myocardial work in patients with/without&#xD;
      early remodeling at acute phase and 3-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>A novel tool for non-invasive myocardial work(MW) assessment has been introduced to evaluate myocardial performance.MW was calculated as a function of time through a combination of LV global longitudinal strain(GLS) data and an estimated LV pressure curves. Work efficiency (WE) was calculated from the ratio of the constructive work to the sum of constructive and wasted work, expressed as a percentage.The values of culprit regional WE was expressed as WE-LAD.The values of non-culprit regional WE was expressed as WE-nonLAD.The absolute differences of the WE was calculated as the values of non-culprit regional WE minus the values of culprit regional WE, and noted as delta-WE.</description>

    <description>Global work index (GWI) is classified as total work within the area of the LV pressure-strain loop calculated from mitral valve closure to mitral valve opening.</description>

    <description>Global constructive work (GCW) was defined as work contributing to LV ejection performed during shortening in systole and work performed during lengthening in isovolumic relaxation.</description>
