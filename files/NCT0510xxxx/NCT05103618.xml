  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to use 18 F Fluorodopa positron emission tomography (FDOPA&#xD;
      PET) to measure dopamine function, and utilize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure&#xD;
      inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in persons with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study will be to further the understanding of the effects of a novel&#xD;
      meditation technique called orgasmic meditation (OM) on these neurophysiological parameters.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this study is to further the understanding of the physiological and&#xD;
      psychological effects and dopaminergic function of OM in couple pairs in a control group and&#xD;
      in couples in which one member has Parkinson's disease (PD). This study will utilize F-18&#xD;
      Fluorodopa (FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging which utilizes an experimental&#xD;
      radioactive tracer called FDOPA which helps to evaluate the activity in the dopamine neurons&#xD;
      in the brain. A secondary goal of this study is to determine whether undergoing OM meditation&#xD;
      alters body or brain physiology, and to measure whether there is an effect on intimacy and&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction in women with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to understand the changes that occurs when subjects undergo intense&#xD;
      meditation or meditation induced by sensory stimulation and structured touch. This study is&#xD;
      designed to allow researchers to understand the changes in couple-pairs that occur when&#xD;
      subjects undergo a shared meditation practice. Since meditation practices are widely used by&#xD;
      individuals, the Investigators hope that a better understanding of the effects of meditation&#xD;
      practices will provide information regarding potential clinical uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 subjects will be enrolled (6 healthy couple pairs) and 30 couple pairs in which one female&#xD;
      member has PD. The Investigators will also for a 10% attrition to enroll a total of 72&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For evaluation of the dopamine function, [F-18] Fluorodopa (FDOPA), dose (5-10 millicurie&#xD;
      (mCi), ± 20%) will be injected intravenously into an antecubital vein. Subjects will be&#xD;
      premedicated with 200 mg of carbidopa orally approximately one hour prior to injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDOPA has been available for over 30 years but has not been previously approved for&#xD;
      commercial use by the FDA. The Investigators will be obtaining the FDOPA from the University&#xD;
      of Pennsylvania cyclotron that has produced FDOPA for many Investigational New Drug&#xD;
      applications (INDs) It will also be beneficial to assess whether there are specific changes&#xD;
      in levels of different molecules that are related to energy consumption and oxidative stress.&#xD;
      Proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) has been previously performed in Parkinson's disease (PD) and&#xD;
      parkinsonian syndromes to evaluate in vivo concentrations of basal ganglia and cerebral&#xD;
      cortex metabolites such as N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and creatine (Cr).&#xD;

Two group of couple pairs will be enrolled into this study: one group will be healthy couple pairs in which neither member has PD. The other couple pairs will include a female member with PD. For subjects who are enrolled in the meditation training programs couple pairs in which the female member has PD may be assigned to an active group or a waitlist control group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Profile of Mood States is a standardized self-report inventory will be administered to evaluate changes in mood, current state or traits. is a psychological rating scale used to assess transient, distinct mood states. The questionnaire contains 65 words that are rated on a scale of zero for not at all to 4 for extremely. There are 5 mood subscales: tension-anxiety, depression, anger-hostility, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. A higher score for the total mood indicates a greater degree of mood disturbance.A Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) can be calculated by adding the raw scores from tension, depression, anger, fatigue and confusion and then subtracting the vigour score. This will give a value between -24 and 177, with lower scores indicative of people with more stable mood profiles.</description>
