  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, investigator-initiated, phase II, multicentre-study, investigating the&#xD;
      efficacy and toxicity of definitive SABR of osseous oligometastases, when pragmatically&#xD;
      introduced into a daily clinical setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a histology or cytology proven non-hematological cancer and at least one lesion&#xD;
      in the bones are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with de novo- and induced oligometastatic disease, as well as patients with&#xD;
      oligo-recurrence or oligo-progression disease can be included. A total of 67 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim is to document long time follow-up in respect to local control rate, OS, PFS,&#xD;
      rate of symptomatic skeletal event at the irradiated site(s), time to progression outside the&#xD;
      radiation field at 1-, 2- and 5-years and acute/ late toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the rate of local control 1-year post SABR. Patients will have a CT&#xD;
      scan and a clinical evaluation every 3 month after SABR according to the standard clinical&#xD;
      follow-up program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 1 year follow-up we also perform pain assessment (using the Numeric Pain Rating&#xD;
      Scale), report the analgesic consumption and Quality of life (QoL) measured with EQ-5D-5L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two dose levels are offered with either 37.5 gy in 3 fractions or 30 gy in 3 fractions,&#xD;
      prescribed to the GTV.&#xD;

It should be concluded from the treating physician that the symptom/intervention is a result of the fracture. Vertebral fractures include end plate-only fractures.
