  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is a devastating acquired language impairment mainly caused by stroke, in which&#xD;
      anomia is a quintessential clinical feature. If speech-language therapy (SLT) has been shown&#xD;
      to be effective for persons with aphasia, the relative efficiency of one SLT strategy over&#xD;
      another remains a matter of debate. The influential relationship between language, executive&#xD;
      functions and aphasia rehabilitation outcomes has been addressed in a number of studies, but&#xD;
      only few of them have studied the effect of adding an executive training to linguistic&#xD;
      therapies.The aim of this study is to measure the efficiency of a protocol combining anomia&#xD;
      therapy and executive training on naming skills and discourse in post-stroke aphasic persons&#xD;
      at the chronic stage&#xD;

    <measure>Evolution of individual naming scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Evolution of individual naming scores during baseline and treatment phases Participants are asked to name pictures from a personal naming task constituted of 100 black and white pictures and scores are expressed as percent of correct responses (min 0, max 100): higher percents meaning a better outcome. A visual analysis of the evolution of these scores along the course of the treatment will be conducted.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of discourse</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of discourse scores before and after the treatment For each participant, four different samples of discourse are elicited before and after the treatment (picture description, personal narrative, book supported narrative, procedural information). The mean number of correct words per minute is then computed for each participant, and compared between the two time points, higher scores meaning a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of executive scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of executive scores before and after the treatment Executive scores are computed before and after treatment for each participant, from the Modified Card Sorting Test (Nelson, 1976), in which higher number of categories achieved means a better outcome, and from a verbal fluency task in which higher number of words produced in 2 minutes means a better outcome</description>
