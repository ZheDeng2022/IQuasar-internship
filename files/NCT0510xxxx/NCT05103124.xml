  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently little robust evidence to inform the management of hyposalivation and&#xD;
      xerostomia in this population. Although the treatment of xerostomia is very individual, a&#xD;
      first-line medication is needed to ameliorate the dehydration in the mouth by substituting&#xD;
      for the secretion of saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to describe the effect of the administration of Hydral on reducing&#xD;
      patients' xerostomia symptoms due to radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) and foresees a&#xD;
      crossover design, so the population will be divided into two groups, receiving both the&#xD;
      medical device and the placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) accounts for more than 750,000 new cases per&#xD;
      year and its prognosis is still poor in terms of mortality and of morbidity and it causes&#xD;
      approximately 350,000 deaths annually worldwide. Radiotherapy (RT) is an established&#xD;
      treatment modality for HNSCC and other H&amp;N tumors, either for treatment alone or as adjuvant.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, high-dose RT has significant adverse effects on the oral and maxillofacial&#xD;
      tissues, both hard and soft. In particular, when salivary glands are within the irradiated&#xD;
      field, irreversible salivary glands damage occurs in 63-93% of the patients. Salivary gland&#xD;
      damage typically manifests as reduced saliva secretion, which in turn can translate into a&#xD;
      subjective sensation of dry mouth (xerostomia), oral discomfort, altered taste, difficulty&#xD;
      with speaking, swallowing, chewing, and increased risk of dental disease. Overall&#xD;
      hyposalivation and related xerostomia can cause a substantial reduction in quality-of-life&#xD;
      (QoL). However there is currently little robust evidence to inform the management of&#xD;
      hyposalivation and xerostomia in this population. Although the treatment of xerostomia is&#xD;
      very individual, a first-line medication is needed to ameliorate the dehydration in the mouth&#xD;
      by substituting for the secretion of saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GUM Hydral (GUM Hydral: Sunstar Italiana SRL. Corso Italia 13 21047 Saronno, VA, Italy) is a&#xD;
      product based on hyaluronic acid and sodium citrate. It helps in rehydrating and protecting&#xD;
      the oral tissues, by forming a film on those tissues. It may be helpful in reducing the&#xD;
      xerostomia symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is a high-density liquid and it is used as a mouthwash. In this trial, the aim is&#xD;
      to investigate if its efficacy in reducing the xerostomia symptoms is higher than placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo will be made of water with xylitol in addition. Xylitol is a is a sugar alcohol&#xD;
      used as a sugar substitute, which does not increase the risk of tooth decay. In this&#xD;
      formulation, its only role is to give a slight sweet flavor to water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to describe the effect of the administration of Hydral on reducing&#xD;
      patients' xerostomia symptoms due to radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) and foresees a&#xD;
      crossover design, so the population will be divided into two groups, receiving both the&#xD;
      medical device and the placebo.&#xD;

    <measure>Improvement of the Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>After a one-month therapy both with Hydral and Placebo</time_frame>
    <description>The modified XQ provides a measure of the severity of radiation -induced xerostomia that affects the patients' QoL. This questionnaire consists of 10 questions, associated with patient-reported dryness. Moreover, a general question &quot;how dry is your mouth?&quot; has been added to the questionnaire. The modified XQ is a self-administered tool and patients will be asked to rate each symptom on a 10-point NRS scale of 0-10, with higher scores indicating more severe dryness or discomfort due to dryness. Each item score is added, and the sum is linearly transformed to produce the final summary score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing higher levels of xerostomia.</description>

    <description>The QLQ-C30 provides 30 questions, globally assessing patients' quality of life. The answers will be converted into a linear scoring scale, with values between 0 and 100, as advocated by EORTC.</description>

    <measure>Improvement of the EORTC QLQ_H&amp;N-35 Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>The QLQ-H&amp;N35 includes 35 questions, and addresses symptoms associated with specific tumor location, side effects associated with the oncologic treatment and additional QoL aspects modified by the disease or its treatment. The answers will be converted into a linear scoring scale, with values between 0 and 100, as advocated by EORTC.</description>
