    <description>The first stage: single dose escalation according to classic &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation method. 6 increasing dose levels were set up, with 3 to 6 cases per dose. The first dose group is 0.5 mg QD. The second dose group is 1mg QD. The third dose group is 1.5 mg QD. The fourth dose group is 2.0 mg QD. The fifth dose group is 2.5 mg QD. The sixth dose group is 3.0 mg QD. In each dose group, patients take WBC100 once on cycle 0. After a washout period of 2 days, patents start subsequent 4 weeks cycles until progression disease or intolerable toxicity. In each cycle, patient was on WBC100 every for 3 weeks and off for 1 week.&#xD;
The second stage: Two dose levels will be chosen according to data from the first stage. Each dose stage enroll 12 pancreatic patients with positive c-myc expression.</description>
