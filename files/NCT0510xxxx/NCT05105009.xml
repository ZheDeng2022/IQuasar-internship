  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two phase study. The first part will take place at the National Institute of&#xD;
      Cardiology in Mexico, the second phase will be made in collaboration with the University of&#xD;
      California San Diego.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non blind experimental study, 60 patients with different stages of CKD from the&#xD;
      outpatient unit of the institute will be included. Each patient will receive a furosemide&#xD;
      stress test of 1 mg/kg in non diuretic users and 1.5 mg/kg in diuretic users, in addition to&#xD;
      an oral load of 5 grams of creatinine, as well as Iohexol to measure GFR. After the&#xD;
      intervention blood and urine samples will be drawn at 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and every hour&#xD;
      until the completion of the observation at 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine will be analized to measure creatinine (blood and urine), then samples will&#xD;
      be processed for measurement of furosemide (mass spectometry), indoxyl sulphate, p-cresol,&#xD;
      hippurate, and uromoduline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this stiudy is to asses the differences between GFR and proximal tubule function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Residual kidney function (RKF) its a critical tool in the CKD evolution and prognosis. It's&#xD;
      well known that preserving RKF increases survival in patients with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), and proteinuria have been the variables used&#xD;
      to asses RKF, wich are glomerular residual function (GRF) variables. This glomerulocentric&#xD;
      assestment of RKF has been challenged recently. It is knows that urea is not the principal&#xD;
      uremic toxine, the protein boud uremic toxins are particullary important because it's&#xD;
      elimination depends of the proximal tubular organic anionic transporters (OAT), and the&#xD;
      organic cationic transporters (OCT). The functional integrity of this transporters are lost&#xD;
      in advanced CKD stages, and it´s accumulation increases cardiovascular and renal damage&#xD;
      because they activate proinflammatory citokines, increasing mortality, this was shown&#xD;
      specially with the accumulation and clearance of hippurate and p-cresol independently of GFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to asses the functional capacity of two AOT (hOAT1, and hOAT3,&#xD;
      that can be blocked by furosemide), and one OCT (OCT2 blocked by creatinine) using an stress&#xD;
      test. The stress test will be performed in healthy subjects as well as in CKD from different&#xD;
      stages. Protein bound uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulphate, p-cresol, and hippurate will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the stress the typical furosemide stress test described previously by Mehta will be&#xD;
      implemented, in addition to an oral load of 5 grams of creatinine oral load. This levels&#xD;
      should be efficient enough to assess the functionality of the OCT2. A comparison between the&#xD;
      tubular creatinine secretine to filtrated creatinine measuring GFR using Iohexol will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion this is a pilot study aimed to establish a practical methodology for the&#xD;
      assesment of proximal tubular function.&#xD;
