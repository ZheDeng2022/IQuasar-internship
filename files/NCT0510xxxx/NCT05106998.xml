    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex, multi-organ autoimmune disease . The presence of&#xD;
      autoantibodies and circulating immune complexes can cause vasculitis and damage the&#xD;
      endothelial cells, leading to multiple organ dysfunctions .The clinical manifestations of SLE&#xD;
      include muco cutaneous, musculoskeletal system, cardiac, neurological, renal, hematologic,&#xD;
      and vascular system involvement . Nail fold capillaroscopy (NFC) is a non-invasive easily&#xD;
      repeatable technique and the best method for morphological analysis of nutritional&#xD;
      capillaries in the nail fold area . Nail fold capillary changes are very common in patients&#xD;
      with SLE. the major NFC pattern that has been reported in SLE patients was non-specific&#xD;
      sub-types, followed by normal pattern and scleroderma pattern. In (SLE) patients are reported&#xD;
      a large spectrum of antibodies, including the anti-ribonucleoproteins (RNP) antibodies These&#xD;
      antibodies were linked to several clinical manifestations and prognostic in patients with&#xD;
      SLE. Anti-U1-RNP antibodies are involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses during&#xD;
      pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases 12. U1-RNP complex is an intra nuclear protein&#xD;
      that converts pre-mRNA to mature RNA and constitutes three specific proteins A, C, and 70&#xD;
      kDa. High titer RNP antibodies are detected in MCTD patients and correlated with Clinical&#xD;
      disease activity index and the frequent complication of pulmonary artery hypertension in&#xD;
      those patients . It also has been found that NFC may detect subclinical microvascular changes&#xD;
      in SLE in the presence of anti-U1-RNP antibodies and may facilitate early preventive therapy&#xD;
      for major organ vasculopathy .&#xD;
