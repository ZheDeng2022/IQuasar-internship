      This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of virtual reality glasses and smartphone&#xD;
      game applications on preoperative anxiety in children who have day surgery. The study&#xD;
      comprised of 60 children (20 children in a virtual reality glass game application group, 20&#xD;
      children in a smartphone game application group, and 20 children in a control group). The&#xD;
      approval of the ethics committee, permissions from the institutions, and informed voluntary&#xD;
      approval of the children's were obtained to conduct the research. The data of the research&#xD;
      were collected through the Children's Perioperative Multidimensional Anxiety Scale (CPMAS),&#xD;
      physiological parameters of children were measured before, after and 90 minutes after the&#xD;
      operation, and salivary cortisol sample taken before surgery in all of groups. Children in&#xD;
      smartphone game application groups played a game for 15 minutes on a smartphone before the&#xD;
      surgical operation, and standard care was given to children. Children in virtual reality game&#xD;
      application groups played a game for 15 minutes on virtual reality glasses before the&#xD;
      surgical operation, and standard care was given to children. Before the surgical operation,&#xD;
      standard care was given to children in control groups. The value of p&lt;0.05 was accepted&#xD;
      statistically significant in the data analyses.&#xD;

      This randomized controlled experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      virtual reality glasses and smartphone game applications on preoperative anxiety in children&#xD;
      who have day surgery. The study was performed between the ages of 7-13 years children at a&#xD;
      tertiary hospital. Age, gender, surgery type, previous hospitalization experience and having&#xD;
      chronic disease criteria of the children in control group (n=20), smartphone game application&#xD;
      (n=20) and virtual reality glass game application (n=20) groups. Data were collected with&#xD;
      Descriptive Characteristics Form for Children and Families, Children's Perioperative&#xD;
      Multidimensional Anxiety Scale (CPMAS). Before the surgical operation, the game with a&#xD;
      smartphone and virtual reality glass was played to the intervention groups for 15 minutes.&#xD;
      Physiological parameters of children were measured before, after and 90 minutes after the&#xD;
      operation. In addition, CPMAS was applied to children in preoperative assessment (Time 1), on&#xD;
      the day of the operation (Time 2) and one month postoperatively (Time 3). Data were analyzed&#xD;
      with post-power analysis, descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman Tests. The&#xD;
      value of p&lt;0.05 was accepted statistically significant in the data analyses.&#xD;
