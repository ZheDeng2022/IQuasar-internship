    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of zanubrutinib plus rituximab versus&#xD;
      lenalidomide plus rituximab in participants with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma&#xD;
      (R/R MZL), as measured by progression-free survival as determined by an independent review&#xD;
      committee in accordance with the 2014 modification of the International Working Group on&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) Criteria.&#xD;
