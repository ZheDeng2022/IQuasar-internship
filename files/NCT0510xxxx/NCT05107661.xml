  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research efforts are necessary to identify strategies to increase colorectal screening in&#xD;
      underserved patient populations. Racial, ethnic minorities and medically underserved&#xD;
      individuals continue to experience disparities in colorectal cancer mortality despite the&#xD;
      availability of screening tests that can detect tumors early when treatments are most&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;

      To determine the effectiveness of completion of colorectal cancer screening through fecal&#xD;
      testing for blood and/or colonoscopies as a screening intervention utilizing digital&#xD;
      reminders versus telephone prompts and reminders in economically disadvantaged minority&#xD;
      communities as part of a colorectal screening outreach program.&#xD;
