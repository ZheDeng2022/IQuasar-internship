  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple arm, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, phase 2 study of intra-articular administration of an&#xD;
      allogeneic human placental tissue particulate (PTP-001) for the treatment of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. The study is planned to be conducted outside the United States. A total of&#xD;
      approximately 210 participants are planned to be randomized to receive 1 of 2 doses of&#xD;
      PTP-001 (100 mg or 200 mg) or saline vehicle control (placebo) injection. The purpose of the&#xD;
      trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a single low dose and high dose&#xD;
      of PTP-001 compared to placebo over a 26-week period.&#xD;

For each of these domains, ranges are defined for absolute and percent changes from baseline that correspond to &quot;high improvement&quot; and &quot;moderate improvement&quot;. OMERACT-OARSI response is defined as either i) improvement in pain or physical function ≥50% and an absolute change ≥20 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale; or (2) improvement of ≥20% and with an absolute change ≥10 mm in at least two of the following three categories: pain, physical function, and patient's global assessment (PGA).</description>
