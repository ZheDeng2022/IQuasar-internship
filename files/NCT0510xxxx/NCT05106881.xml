  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the userbility and satisfaction of one-off&#xD;
      functional gait training with the Gait Enhancing and Motivating System-Hip type (GEMS-H) on&#xD;
      locomotor function in normal adults including the elderly.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The GEMS-H is a hip-type assist device developed by the Samsung Advanced Institute of&#xD;
      Technology. The GEMS-H is worn around the waist and fastened at the waist and thighs by a set&#xD;
      of belts with velcro to assist motion at the hip joints. The device weighs 2.1kg, and has 2&#xD;
      brushless direct current motors running on a rechargeable lithium ion battery. The normal&#xD;
      operation time for the device is 2 hours. The GEMS-H is available in three sizes to fit&#xD;
      various waist/hip sizes: small, medium, and large. The width of each version can be adjusted&#xD;
      further to fit individual body size within the circumference range. Also, the thigh frames&#xD;
      are available in three sizes (large, medium, and small) for different leg lengths. It is&#xD;
      controlled through a custom built application on a hand held tablet.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 10 meter walk test from baseline in gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, After 45minutes of functional gait training (one-time experience)</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of self selected speeds by measuring the time it takes an individual to walk 10 meters. To perform the test, patient walks 10 meters (33 ft) and the time is measured when the leading foot crosses the start line and the finish line. The instructions are: &quot;Please walk this distance at your normal pace when I say go.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Timed Up and Go test (TUG) from baseline in balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, After 45minutes of functional gait training (one-time experience)</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of dynamic balance function. 11-20 seconds are within normal limits for frail elderly and disabled patients, and greater than 20 seconds means the person needs assistance outside and indicates further examination and intervention. A score of 30 seconds or more suggests that the person may be prone to falls.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, After 45minutes of functional gait training (one-time experience)</time_frame>
    <description>SPPB is a group of measures that combines the results of the gait speed, chair stand and balance tests. It has been used as a predictive tool for possible disability and can aid in the monitoring of function in older people. The scores range from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance). The SPPB has been shown to have predictive validity showing a gradient of risk for mortality, nursing home admission, and disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Four Square Step Test (FSST) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, After 45minutes of functional gait training (one-time experience)</time_frame>
    <description>FSST is used to assess dynamic stability and the ability of the subject to step over low objects forward, sideways, and backward.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 6 minute walk test (6MWT) from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, After 45minutes of functional gait training (one-time experience)</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test (6MWT) measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The individual is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway.</description>

    <measure>User Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>After 45minutes of functional gait training (one-time experience)</time_frame>
