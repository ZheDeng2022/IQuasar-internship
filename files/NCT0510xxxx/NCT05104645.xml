  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of acquired disability in adults in France, and more than 500,000&#xD;
      French people are currently living with the after-effects. Hemiparesis, which is a partial&#xD;
      deficit of motor or muscular control affecting the right or left half of the body, is the&#xD;
      most frequent motor disorder after a stroke. Currently, the management and treatment of&#xD;
      stroke patients consists of a combination of pharmacological treatments (drugs, botulinum&#xD;
      toxin, etc.), the fitting of devices (orthoses, etc.) and rehabilitation (physical therapy,&#xD;
      adapted physical activity, occupational therapy, etc.). According to the French National&#xD;
      Authority for Health, motor rehabilitation after a stroke must meet 3 criteria: early,&#xD;
      intensive and continuous. Functional evaluations (with validated measurement scales or&#xD;
      analysis of locomotor activities) make it possible to monitor rehabilitation and to verify&#xD;
      that the intensity is adapted to the patient's needs. To date, technological advances have&#xD;
      yielded numerous gait analysis devices, ranging from motion capture platforms to inertial&#xD;
      measurement units (IMU) and the use of motion platforms with integrated sensors. Different&#xD;
      systems embedding an IMU on the foot, for example, answer these problems of analysis of&#xD;
      walking in real situation. The IMUs record the movements and orientation of the foot in&#xD;
      space; the data are then processed by algorithms to recognize the walking steps and calculate&#xD;
      the spatiotemporal locomotion parameters. Additional IMUs positioned on the body can be added&#xD;
      to this system in order to access a more precise analysis of locomotion, in particular by&#xD;
      calculating the movements of the various joints of the lower limb. The validation of systems&#xD;
      integrating IMUs must be done according to a precise method widely documented by the COSMIN&#xD;
      recommendations (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement&#xD;
      INstruments). This project will be carried out in two stages, the first of which will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and psychometric properties of the spatiotemporal parameters of the IMU&#xD;
      devices in healthy subjects. If these properties (safety, reproducibility and validity) are&#xD;
      considered to be in conformity, the second phase will be initiated. These same parameters&#xD;
      will be evaluated during the rehabilitation of a cohort of patients who have suffered a&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
