  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two-arm, parallel group randomized clinical trial conducted via Mturk comparing a&#xD;
      single-session web-based intervention called Visitor Mindset versus a control intervention&#xD;
      (nature videos with relaxing music) for adults with depression and/or anxiety symptoms&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Procedures include completing: (1) pre-intervention assessments; (2) one of two&#xD;
      single-session web-based intervention (approximately 30 to 45 minutes each); (3)&#xD;
      post-intervention assessments, including survey questions following a negative affect&#xD;
      induction (brief film clip); and (4) a 2-week follow-up assessment.&#xD;
