  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that etomidate combined with propofol in gastroscopy has high safety and&#xD;
      lower incidence of hypoxia and hypotension, suggesting the advantages of etomidate combined&#xD;
      with propofol in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remimazolam Besylate is a 1.1 class new drug that acts on GABA receptors and is metabolized&#xD;
      by plasma esterase with fast metabolism time, only 1/7 of midazolam, which may be more&#xD;
      suitable for elderly patients. Therefore, this study intends to explore the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of two sedation schemes in gastroenteroscopy for elderly patients.&#xD;

      Before starting the endoscopy procedures, patients were randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      Remimazolam Besylate or propofol combined with etomidate. The effect time, recovery time,&#xD;
      vital signs, postoperative recovery, cognitive function and complication were observed.&#xD;
