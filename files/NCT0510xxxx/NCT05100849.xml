  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze which cognitive training experimental condition - Tablet versus&#xD;
      Kinect - results in greater cognitive, mood, quality of life, and functional gains in a&#xD;
      sample of chronic psychiatric patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive deficits are a nuclear feature of several psychiatric disorders, leading to a&#xD;
      decrease in functional abilities and quality of life. Besides facilitating the inclusion of&#xD;
      more ecologically valid stimuli and training tasks, technology-based cognitive training&#xD;
      methods allow more dynamic interactions with the cognitive training content, which can result&#xD;
      in an enhancement of patients' motivation and engagement in the therapeutic process. The&#xD;
      modality of interaction with the cognitive training content may influence patients' response&#xD;
      to cognitive training interventions. For instance, cognitive training through the tablet&#xD;
      requires essentially hand movements (e.g., interaction with the training tasks by touching&#xD;
      the correct stimuli), while cognitive training through the Kinect involves the performance of&#xD;
      wide range movements (e.g., interaction with the training tasks by making specific &quot;body&quot;&#xD;
      movements to select the correct stimuli). This study aims to analyze which cognitive training&#xD;
      experimental condition - Tablet versus Kinect - results in greater cognitive, mood, quality&#xD;
      of life, and functional gains in a sample of chronic psychiatric patients.&#xD;
