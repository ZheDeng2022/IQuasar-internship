  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare treatment with olorofim versus treatment with&#xD;
      AmBisome® followed by standard of care (SOC) in patients with IFD caused by proven IA or&#xD;
      probable lower respiratory tract disease Aspergillus species (invasive aspergillosis, IA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mortality rate in immunosuppressed patients with IA is high even with effective modern&#xD;
      antifungal drug treatment. Intrinsic and acquired resistance to azoles and amphotericin B,&#xD;
      the two most effective classes of treatment, have been identified in Aspergillus species and&#xD;
      are linked to this increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently marketed antifungal drugs have limitations including limited dosage forms, DDIs,&#xD;
      and significant adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with IA who do not respond to or cannot tolerate a triazole therapy, treatment&#xD;
      options are even more limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olorofim is an antifungal candidate with a novel mechanism of action offering activity&#xD;
      against resistant organisms, differences in safety profile, along with oral dosing,&#xD;
      predictable and reliable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and limited potential for DDIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olorofim&#xD;
      with that of AmBisome® followed by guideline-based hierarchy standard of care (SOC) in&#xD;
      patients with IA whose infection is either refractory to or unsuitable for azole therapy.&#xD;
