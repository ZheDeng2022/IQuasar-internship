    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of using Checkup Coach, a mobile&#xD;
      coaching intervention, to improve the way that primary care providers recommend HPV&#xD;
      vaccination to adolescent patients and their parents. To conduct this feasibility study, the&#xD;
      investigators will deliver the Checkup Coach intervention to 20 Kaiser Permanente Washington&#xD;
      primary care providers who routinely recommend HPV vaccine to adolescent patients. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a single-arm, pre-post design. Participating primary care providers&#xD;
      will attend a 1-hour virtual communication workshop and then use a mobile phone app to&#xD;
      receive additional coaching for 12 weeks. Providers will complete surveys at three time&#xD;
      points: before the communication workshop, immediately after the workshop, and at 12-week&#xD;
      follow-up. Surveys will assess changes in providers' self-reported HPV vaccine recommendation&#xD;
      practices and beliefs about HPV vaccine and also acceptability of the intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesizes that providers' HPV vaccine communication will improve between&#xD;
      baseline and 12-week follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of two main components: a webinar communication workshop and use of the Checkup Coach mobile app. The Checkup Coach intervention begins with a brief (&lt;1 hour), communication training workshop that reviews evidence on HPV vaccination, models guideline-consistent recommendations, trains providers to address parent concerns, and facilitates discussion of shared goals for improving. Next, providers are invited to download and use the Checkup coach mobile app at their discretion for the 12-week study period. Providers complete in-app self-assessments and receive tailored feedback about their HPV vaccine recommendation quality, progress toward improving recommendation practices, a dashboard of aggregate HPV vaccination coverage for patients in their clinic, and tips for addressing parents' concerns about HPV vaccination every time they use the app.</description>
