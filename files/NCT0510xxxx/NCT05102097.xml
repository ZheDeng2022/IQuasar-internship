  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain is a common health problem with a multifactorial impact on core muscle&#xD;
      function as well as causing pain, functional disability and decrease in quality of life, this&#xD;
      occur due to the reduction in the physical activity level of the individual causing atrophy&#xD;
      and inhibition of the core muscle affecting the stability of the spine&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several approaches and methods of treating chronic low back pain (CLBP) ranging&#xD;
      from education, exercise, electrotherapy and Manual therapy; to alternative treatment such as&#xD;
      acupuncture, yoga and Chiropractic. Among the above mention treatment exercise, manual&#xD;
      therapy and education are the most frequently utilize for the management of CLBP. The general&#xD;
      recommendation for individual with CLBP is to remain active as possible and this can be&#xD;
      achieve through exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence shows that active treatment in form of strengthening exercise of the abdominal and&#xD;
      back muscles, core stabilization exercise, coordination exercise and aerobic exercise leads&#xD;
      to significant reduction in pain and functional disability in patients with CLBP. A number of&#xD;
      researches have been focusing on core stability exercise, which is an effective way of&#xD;
      recruiting the core muscle (including the abdominal, back, pelvic and hip muscles) that leads&#xD;
      to the optimal force production, control of lumbopelvic-hip movement and load transfer from&#xD;
      the spine to the pelvis and the lower extremities. The core stabilization exercise has been&#xD;
      establish to activate and strength the deep core muscles, but researches are now focusing on&#xD;
      the exercise that can be able to activate the core muscles as well as increase the overall&#xD;
      health status of the individual&#xD;

    <masking_description>Upon completion of baseline assessments, participants will be randomly assigned into two groups A and B in 1:1 ( i.e 20 participants per group) ratio using table of random digit generated from excel.&#xD;
The study will be single-blind whereby only the outcome assessors will be blinded to participant's group allocation but the type of intervention will not be specified. Because of the nature of the intervention it will be difficult to blind the participants.</masking_description>

    <measure>Numeric pain rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A scale of 0 to 10 with 0 indicating no pain and 10 worst pain will be administered to the participants to choose a number indicating their level of pain this will be recorded at base line and 6 weeks after intervention</description>

    <description>Muscle activity of both lumbar multifidus muscle and rectus abdominous muscle will be assess using neurotrac myoplus pro machine and surface electrode. The assessment will be done both at baseline and at 6weeks after intervention</description>

    <description>Participant in prone position stabilize at both ankle and hip with the upper trunk out of the plinth will be instructed to extend the trunk and hold position, the more the time the participant is able to hold the position the more the core muscle endurance</description>

    <measure>Abdominal dynamic test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in supine lying position with the knees flexed to 90 degrees and upper limbs across the chest will be instructed to raised the trunk and neck and hold the position this will be timed using stopwatch. The more the time the participant is able to hold the position the more the core muscle endurance</description>

    <measure>Flexion rotation test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in supine position the knees flex the participants will be instructed to touch alternate knees for 90 seconds and number of repetition will be recorded. The higher the number of repetition the more the core muscle endurance</description>

    <measure>Pressure biofeedback stabilizer</measure>
    <time_frame>4 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure biofeedback stabilizer will be use to assess the strength of rectus abdominous and Lumbar multifidus muscle strength, the pressure biofeedback stabilizer is a simple device that sense changes in pressure with movement, the pressure cell measures from 0-200millimeter of mercury (mmHg), with a precision of 2 millimeter of mercury with 0 being the lowest score and 200 the highest score. To measure any of the core muscle strength the pressure biofeedback stabilizer will be inflated to 70 millimeter of mercury and will be placed underneath the muscle of the participant and instruction will be giving to the participant to contract the muscle by pressing the inflator down, the reading on the sphygmomanometer will then be recorded.</description>
