  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To quantify health effects of synergizing chemical and biological pollutants in a targeted&#xD;
      population setting, i.e., school-aged children. Indoor air pollutants will be monitored&#xD;
      within the classrooms with high end sensors. Exposure data from additional sources (outdoor,&#xD;
      home, transports) will be obtained. Health outcomes will be assessed prospectively using&#xD;
      validated medical procedures and real-time tracking with mobile health (mHealth) equipment&#xD;
      and a gamified computer app.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Communication with individual schools and families representing diverse cultural and&#xD;
      socioeconomic backgrounds, will be conducted and formal participation consents obtained. The&#xD;
      target population will include healthy children and be enriched for children with respiratory&#xD;
      allergies and asthma. Provision of instructions, training for participation and baseline&#xD;
      assessments of respiratory, immune, and mental health using questionnaires and relevant&#xD;
      physiological measurements (e.g spirometry, FeNO), will be performed. Sensors will be&#xD;
      positioned and cross-checked for functionality.Health data from the cohort will be monitored&#xD;
      by a specifically designed gamified application, as well as by state-of-the-art wearable&#xD;
      tracking technology. The app will capture input from the participants at large, while the&#xD;
      trackers will accurately, continuously, and remotely, identify personalized patterns of all&#xD;
      day activity status, heart rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, blood pressure, sleep,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, and mechano-acoustic breathing sounds signatures. Sentinel data will be&#xD;
      processed in Work Package 6 and integrated in the SynAir-G autonomous sensing platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be prospectively followed-up for a school year. Investigators will regularly&#xD;
      visit schools to keep sensors running and collect materials. Real-time tracking will be&#xD;
      coupled with regular communication and face-to-face visits for health outcome assessments.&#xD;
      Devices will be positioned in selected locations. The cohort will also provide the setting&#xD;
      for establishing indoor and outdoor interactions, dose-responses in real life, and health&#xD;
      outcome data for integration and synergy analyses.&#xD;

        Children at this age have the ability to understand the character of the study, to handle&#xD;
        the app and the wearables, to successfully perform lung function and airway inflammation&#xD;
        measurements (as it has been ascertained in the previous FP7_PreDicta and Horizon_CURE&#xD;
        projects), to cooperate with blood sampling, while not being yet subjective to hormonal&#xD;
        changes of puberty. Moreover, students at this age mainly attend lessons in the same class,&#xD;
        thus exposures in the school environment are considered stable,&#xD;
