      There is a lack of consensus on whether women with proteinuric kidney disease benefit from&#xD;
      prophylactic anticoagulation during pregnancy to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will investigate the feasibility of obtaining thrombosis profile data using&#xD;
      a viscoelastic haemostasis monitor - Sonoclot - from pregnant women with kidney disease, and&#xD;
      exploratory analyses to elucidate correlations between output values and clinical parameters&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is a risk factor for women developing blood clots in veins (VTE). The risk is&#xD;
      highest towards the end of pregnancy and in the few weeks following delivery. VTE can cause&#xD;
      swollen painful legs due to clots in the deep veins (DVT) and/or blood clots in the lung&#xD;
      vessels leading to chest pain, breathlessness and loss of blood pressure. VTE is the leading&#xD;
      direct cause of death in pregnant women in the UK (affecting 1.4 per 100,000 pregnancies).&#xD;
      Additional risk factors for VTE (including obesity, family history, previous history of blood&#xD;
      clots and Caesarean section) are routinely valuated through standard care and treatment to&#xD;
      thin blood with low molecular weight heparin (LWMH) injections is offered to those at highest&#xD;
      risk. Women with kidney disease comprise a very small proportion of all pregnancies and are&#xD;
      hence under-represented in large-scale studies to evaluate VTE risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outside of pregnancy, patients with kidney conditions associated with heavy leakage of&#xD;
      protein into urine through damaged microscopic filters (glomeruli) plus low blood protein&#xD;
      plus swelling (the &quot;nephrotic syndrome&quot;) have an increased risk of VTE. VTE risk is increased&#xD;
      as a result of (a) concentration of blood within blood vessels due to fluid leak into&#xD;
      tissues, (b) decreased flow of blood through veins due to circulating volume and decreased&#xD;
      mobility and (c) an imbalanced loss of proteins in urine that favour or inhibit blood&#xD;
      clotting. There is evidence to support blood thinning treatment to reduce the risk of VTE in&#xD;
      patients with one cause of nephrotic syndrome - membranous nephropathy - and many clinicians&#xD;
      choose to offer blood thinning treatment to patients with other causes of nephrotic syndrome&#xD;
      if they believe the patient is at increased risk of clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no clinical data to confirm a benefit of blood thinning treatments to prevent VTE&#xD;
      in pregnant women with nephrotic syndrome, but, faced with the lack of published studies,&#xD;
      consensus guidelines published in 2018 recommend that women with nephrotic syndrome should be&#xD;
      treated during pregnancy and for 6 weeks after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of consensus on whether women with less severe protein leak during pregnancy&#xD;
      should be offered blood thinning injections. An international survey of clinicians caring for&#xD;
      women with these conditions reports a wide range in practice from some offering treatment to&#xD;
      all with a protein leak (urine protein:creatinine ratio) &gt;100mg/mmol, to others only&#xD;
      considering treatment if leak was &gt;300mg/mmol AND evidence of low blood protein AND swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VTE prophylaxis with LMWH is standard of care for medical in-patients and for out-patient&#xD;
      treatment in pregnant women identified to be at increased VTE risk. Although LMWH treatment&#xD;
      is not associated with any adverse pregnancy outcomes, it is uncomfortable, inconvenient and&#xD;
      can interfere with delivery plans if spinal or epidural anesthetic is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are, therefore, women receiving LMWH prophylaxis because of increased urine protein&#xD;
      leak despite inadequate evidence to prove the benefit of this strategy and insufficient&#xD;
      clinical tools to triage risk profiles for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no routine laboratory tests that offer a direct measurement of thrombotic risk.&#xD;
      Sonoclot is established technology that has been utilised to quantify bleeding risk after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery and disseminated clotting abnormalities, and adequacy of anticoagulation in&#xD;
      haemodialysis patients and during treatment with direct acting oral anticoagulants. In&#xD;
      addition to predicting bleeding risk, results also identify clotting risk. This has&#xD;
      previously been studied in women taking oral contraception and in normal pregnancy with both&#xD;
      identifying patterns consistent with increased thrombotic risk during pregnancy or with&#xD;
      combined oral contraceptive use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial using Sonoclot&#xD;
      results to identify which pregnant women with kidney disease are at increased risk of VTE and&#xD;
      which are not, to define treatment protocols with LMWH prophlyaxis. This pilot study will&#xD;
      assess the correlations between Sonoclot results, urine protein leak, gestational age,&#xD;
      routine laboratory test results and routine VTE risk assessment tools.&#xD;
