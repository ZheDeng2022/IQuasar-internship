  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote monitoring is now universally available for all cardiac implantable electronic devices&#xD;
      (CIEDs), and it has become the standard of care for the management of patients with these&#xD;
      devices. In many countries, it is being proven that patients with implantable defibrillator&#xD;
      (ICD) or cardiac resynchronizing therapy (CRT) can benefit from remote monitoring (RM) both&#xD;
      economically and clinically. From previous RM related clinical studies, it is reasonably&#xD;
      accepted that hospitalization cost and mortality rate is comparably higher in defibrillator&#xD;
      patients compared to pacemaker indicated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is yet to be discovered which group of defibrillator patients are the most&#xD;
      beneficiaries using remote monitoring system. In this study, the investigators would further&#xD;
      categorize defibrillator patients into different indication subgroups and compare both&#xD;
      economic and clinical benefits among different indication. By comparing economic and clinical&#xD;
      benefits of remote monitoring by different subgroups, the investigators might be able to set&#xD;
      a guideline on which group of patients should be strongly suggested for remote monitoring&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators perform a prospective study in Korean population to compare&#xD;
      economic and clinical benefits of RM compared to conventional follow-up in overall study&#xD;
      cohort and by different subgroups. (ICD &amp; CRT-D).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to prospectively recruit 556 patients with ICD or CRT-D&#xD;
      implantation in 10 sites in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patients should be enrolled in remote monitoring system 0 to 45 days after&#xD;
           successful device implantation and then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the RM or&#xD;
           conventional follow-up group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the RM follow-up arm, the patients are not mandated to visit the clinic unless there&#xD;
           is unscheduled call due to adverse event notification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the conventional follow-up arm, the patients should be seen at the clinic according&#xD;
           to each center's custom but no longer than 1 year between each visit. Follow-up should&#xD;
           be continued accordingly until two-years of device implant.&#xD;
