  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether combining a shorter than standard course of&#xD;
      ADT with standard prostate brachytherapy and hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy&#xD;
      is a safe and effective way to prevent high-risk prostate cancer from coming back and/or&#xD;
      spreading to other parts of the body.&#xD;

    <description>Patients enrolled in this study will receive ADT for 6 months which will consist of bicalutamide 50 mg PO daily starting approximately 1-2 weeks before leuprolide 22.5mg injected every 3 months. The HDR prostate brachytherapy procedure will be performed approximately 3 months after starting ADT to allow for potential radiosensitization and cytoreduction. Approximately 4 weeks after the HDR boost, patients will receive image-guided, intensity-modulated, hypofractionated radiation therapy targeting the prostate, seminal vesicles and pelvic lymph nodes to a dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions delivered daily.</description>

    <intervention_name>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)</intervention_name>
    <description>ADT will include bicalutamide 50 mg PO daily started 1-2 weeks before leuprolide 22.5mg IM or SQ delivered every 3 months x 2. Bicalutamide will be continued through radiation and then discontinued on the day of the last fraction. Leuprolide can be given at different doses, but must be given for a total planned duration of 6 months.</description>
