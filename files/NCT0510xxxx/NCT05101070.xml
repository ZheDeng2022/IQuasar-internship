      The primary objective of Part A is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of S-531011 and to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      S-531011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Parts B and C is to evaluate the antitumor activity of S-531011 at&#xD;
