  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum albumin can indicate the onset of cancer cachexia, provide information about a&#xD;
      patient's nutritional status, and serve as a biomarker for the prognosis of patients with&#xD;
      cancer cachexia. However, the relationship between serum albumin levels and mortality in&#xD;
      patients with cancer cachexia remains unclear. We aimed to examine the association of albumin&#xD;
      and total protein with 1-year mortality in patients with cancer cachexia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer cachexia is defined as a multifactorial and multi-organ syndrome characterized by the&#xD;
      loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of adipose tissue), which cannot be fully&#xD;
      reversed by conventional nutritional support. In recent years, cancer cachexia has&#xD;
      increasingly been seen as a systemic phenomenon that affects various organs, such as the&#xD;
      liver and myocardial tissue. Cachexia is closely related to anorexia, inflammation, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, and decreased protein levels, which can lead to progressive functional&#xD;
      impairment, treatment-related complications, poor quality of life, and cancer-related death.&#xD;
      Its pathophysiology is characterized by a negative protein and energy balance. However, there&#xD;
      are no clear clinical guidelines to effectively combat the progressive tissue loss associated&#xD;
      with cachexia. Cancer cachexia occurs mostly in advanced cancers, with more than half of&#xD;
      patients with cancer having cachexia in the later stages, and &gt;10% of patients die with or&#xD;
      from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that cachexia can be diagnosed when weight loss in the past 12 months is&#xD;
      ≥5%, and the physiological variables of patients match at least threeof the following five&#xD;
      criteria: decreased muscle strength,fatigue, anorexia, low fat-free mass index (FFMI), and&#xD;
      abnormal blood profile. Albumin and total protein are two variables that reflect an&#xD;
      individual's nutritional status and disease severity. Additionally, albumin can serve as an&#xD;
      indicator of the inflammatory response and is considered a highly sensitive marker of a&#xD;
      patient's nutritional status. Serum albumin and total protein can be used to define cancer&#xD;
      cachexia and cancer-related malnutrition; patients with cachexia have lower total protein and&#xD;
      albumin levels than those without cachexia.5 Serum albumin may serve as a prognostic factor&#xD;
      for treatment outcomes and compliance in patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a reduction in albumin and total protein levels are associated with the diagnosis of&#xD;
      cancer related cachexia, no studies have shown that albumin and total protein can predict&#xD;
      mortality in patients with cancer cachexia. Here, we describe a prospective non randomized&#xD;
      study that will be conducted to explore the association between serum albumin and total&#xD;
      protein levels and 1-year mortality in patients with cancer cachexia .&#xD;
