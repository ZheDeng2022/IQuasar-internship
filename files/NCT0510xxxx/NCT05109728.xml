  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish the recommended dose of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in combination with&#xD;
      the standard of care or as single agent in three different groups of participants with&#xD;
      Glioblastoma. In addition, this study will investigate the safety of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE and&#xD;
      describe its uptake characteristics in participants with Glioblastoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study for each participant consists of a Screening period, a Treatment period and a&#xD;
      12-month Follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period of up to 6 weeks before starting GBM treatment, each participant&#xD;
      will be assessed for somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression by [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE imaging&#xD;
      PET/scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will be assigned to Group 1 or Group&#xD;
      2 depending on O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in Group 1 (concomitant radiotherapy + temozolomide and temozolomide&#xD;
           maintenance) will receive treatment with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE every 4 weeks +/- 2 days,&#xD;
           up to 6 administrations. Radiotherapy and temozolomide will be administered 7 to 10 days&#xD;
           after the first administration of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE. Temozolomide will be administered&#xD;
           orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day during the concomitant period, concurrently with&#xD;
           radiotherapy. Radiotherapy will be delivered at a dose of 2 Gray (Gy)/day, 5 days per&#xD;
           week followed by 2 days of rest, for 6 consecutive weeks with a total dose of 60 Gy&#xD;
           (without interruption). During the maintenance period, there is an intra-patient dose&#xD;
           escalation in temozolomide treatment. The dosage of temozolomide is 150 mg/m2 in Cycle 1&#xD;
           of maintenance period, and then to 200 mg/m2 in Cycle 2 and beyond in the maintenance&#xD;
           period, if 150 mg/m2 temozolomide treatment is well tolerated in Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in Group 2 will receive treatment with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE every 4 weeks&#xD;
           +/- 2 days for the first 3 doses (during the radiotherapy period) followed by every 3&#xD;
           weeks +/- 2 days as single agent, up to a total of 6 administrations. Radiotherapy will&#xD;
           be initiated 7 to 10 days after the first administration of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE and will&#xD;
           be delivered at a dose of 2 Gy/day, 5 days per week followed by 2 days of rest, for 6&#xD;
           consecutive weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants with recurrent glioblastoma will be assigned to Group 3 and will&#xD;
      receive [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE as single agent treatment every 3 weeks +/- 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An infusion of 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA) solution will be co-administered with&#xD;
      each [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE dose for renal protection.&#xD;

    <description>A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an AE or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that meets any of the criteria defining dose-limiting toxicities and with an onset during the DLT observation period specified for the group.&#xD;
• Group 1: DLT observation period of 49 to 52 days starting from the first administration of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE (Day 1) and ending with the completion of concomitant RT and TMZ. The 49 to 52 days observation period is depending on the start day of concomitant RT and TMZ (i.e. 7-10 days post first [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE dose). If the concomitant RT and TMZ is delayed for any reason, the DLT observation period will last until the completion of the concomitant treatment. If RT or TMZ is delayed, the DLT observation period will last until the last administered dose, whichever occurs later.</description>

    <description>All excreted urine from the start of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE infusion until the first whole body planar imaging will be collected, its volume measured and the radioactivity concentration kilobecquerel per milliliter (kBq/mL) determined in order to calculate the total radioactivity excreted from the body from the start of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE infusion to the time of the first scan. If no urine is excreted from the start of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE infusion until the first whole body planar imaging, no urine dosimetry is necessary.</description>
