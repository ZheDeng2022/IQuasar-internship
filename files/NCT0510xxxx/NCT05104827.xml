      Treating COVID-19 hospitalized patients incurred heavy burden of physical and emotional&#xD;
      stress. The present study is taking place at Carmel Medical Center in collaboration with the&#xD;
      integrative oncology and the internal medicine teams with aim to improve the wellbeing of&#xD;
      healthcare providers working in frontline COVID-19 departments. In this prospective&#xD;
      preference study, Healthcare providers (HCPs) working inside COVID-19 departments are&#xD;
      referred to integrative oncology-trained practitioners for assessment of their two leading&#xD;
      concerns followed by 30-minute individually tailored treatment. The study assess, based on&#xD;
      the Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCAW) questionnaire, the impact of personalized&#xD;
      integrative oncology modalities on the physical and emotional concerns as well as Heart Rate&#xD;
      Variability of participating HCPs in COVID-19 departments.&#xD;

      Background: Treating COVID-19 hospitalized patients incurred heavy burden of physical and&#xD;
      emotional stress. The present study is taking place at Carmel Medical Center in collaboration&#xD;
      with the integrative oncology and the internal medicine teams with aim to improve the&#xD;
      wellbeing of healthcare providers working in frontline COVID-19 departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To explore the impact of personalized integrative oncology modalities on the&#xD;
      physical and emotional concerns as well as physiological parameters (e.g., Heart Rate&#xD;
      Variability, HRV) of healthcare practitioners (HCPs) in COVID-19 department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this prospective preference study, HCPs working inside COVID-19 departments are&#xD;
      referred to integrative oncology-trained practitioners for assessment of their two leading&#xD;
      concerns followed by 30-minute individually tailored treatment, scheduled during the working&#xD;
      shift and performed adjacent to the COVID department. Integrative treatment include one or&#xD;
      more of the following modalities: acupuncture, manual (e.g., acupressure, anthroposophic&#xD;
      medicine, reflexology), movement (QiGong, Feldenkrais and Paula methods), and mind-body&#xD;
      therapies. The Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCAW) questionnaire is used for pre-&#xD;
      and post-treatment quantitative and qualitative assessment. HCP's narratives analysis is&#xD;
      purposed to identify concerns and impact of the integrative treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRV is assessed during the integrative treatment. Three minutes intervals at start and after&#xD;
      20 minutes are used for pre- and post-treatment assessment. The primary outcome is RMSSD&#xD;
      (root square of successive differences) indicating parasympathetic activity. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are further parameters from the time domain analysis (SDNN, pNN50) and frequency&#xD;
      domain analysis (LF/HF Ratio).&#xD;
